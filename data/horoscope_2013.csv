aries,2013-01-01,"Although this is likely a day away from work, there might be so much to do at home that you wish you were on the job. Nevertheless, you can see past the present moment as you anticipate the waves of relief heading your way. In the meantime, focusing on the present moment keeps your mind occupied. Don't let your responsibilities lag; taking care of the most pressing tasks right away eases the intensity so you can find time to relax."
taurus,2013-01-01,"A cautious approach to having fun today might sound restrictive at first, but you should be able to make this strategy work with ease. There is no need to go overboard with any type of indulgence; you can thoroughly enjoy yourself now by sharing simple pleasures with your friends or family. Instead of scheming for more gratification in the future, find contentment with what you have in the present."
gemini,2013-01-01,"You may feel conflicted today because you're currently motivated by needs that are different from your natural tendencies. Normally, you would choose communication over silence and activity over passivity. However, you can recharge your emotional batteries now by passing up a tempting party invitation or skipping a distracting trip to the bookstore. But even if you wisely choose to retreat, a part of you still longs for the action. Rest now; play later."
cancer,2013-01-01,"You are unsure about how involved you want to get with the emotional dramas that are unfolding around you. You might decide that acting cautiously is smarter than jumping into a conflict, only to discover that you are already playing a role in the scene anyhow. You may as well offer your assistance today, for your resistance will only delay a workable resolution. Showing your support by listening to your friends is the first step to establishing common ground."
leo,2013-01-01,"You may doubt yourself if you are putting too much effort into containing your energy. You're happiest when your love can be expressed naturally and everyone fully appreciates the magic you bring to their world. Now, however, it's tricky finding a healthy balance between your inner and outer worlds. Too much exuberance makes others uncomfortable. Too much self-restraint prompts them to worry about you. Don't be overly concerned; ultimately, all you can do is be yourself."
virgo,2013-01-01,"Even if there are unresolved issues floating around a current relationship, you can still latch onto a sense of well-being today. Once you decide to take everything in stride, communication becomes more straightforward and you're apt to just say what's on your mind. You're smart enough to know that some things are beyond fixing, and worrying about them won't make it easier to let go. Forget about the big picture for a while and revel in what you can do in the present moment."
libra,2013-01-01,"Retreating from the hectic world is a smart idea today and if you take care of your responsibilities early on, you can actually manifest a very relaxing day. However, you must scale back your social obligations or things probably won't unfold according to your ideal plan. Be ready for a few unexpected twists and turns; engage them willingly instead of resisting the inevitable. Your adaptability is the secret to your success."
scorpio,2013-01-01,"Although you might believe that being alone with your thoughts is the best way to spend the day, you will probably be better off hanging out with others today. But don't squander your time by celebrating with just anyone; you can be as selective as you want when it comes to the company you keep. Choose a few special friends and carve out enough space to share something meaningful. An unexpected gift of appreciation or a warm gesture of affection is a wonderful way to demonstrate your love."
sagittarius,2013-01-01,"You have recently experienced a phase of expansionism and it's time to re-establish balance in your life. Actually, your tendency to overstep limits may be a central theme for months to come, but it's still not healthy to lose yourself in unrealistic visions for next year. Instead, focus your attention on something you can change right now -- in the present moment. Today, thinking small is your smartest strategy."
capricorn,2013-01-01,"Having a concrete plan can help you feel better, but it still may be difficult to turn your thoughts into actions today. Don't be too self-judgmental if you can't yet get the traction you desire. You wisely realize that the best ideas take time to develop. Nevertheless, remember that you are currently caught between optimism and realism. Be patient; the pace will accelerate in the months ahead and a solid foundation prepares you for the changes of the future."
aquarius,2013-01-01,"It's awesome that you can still be comfortable even when life gets strange and weird. It's not that anything in particular is going wrong now; it's just that there are lots of loose ends that defy tying up. Instead of attempting to finish last year's business today, accepting circumstances as they are may be your most intelligent approach. Your irreverent sense of humor might just save the day, capturing the attention of admirers of a quick wit."
pisces,2013-01-01,"Your friends might try to bring you back down to earth today, but it's not easy to spend time with them if they're raining on your dreams and draining your enthusiasm. It's not that they have bad intentions where you're concerned; it's just that they don't understand the intense relationship you have with your imagination. You can be more tolerant of others once you understand that they sincerely have your happiness in mind."
aries,2013-01-02,"You are enthused about putting in a day of hard work today, but the details may require too much time and energy for your liking. However, if you become bogged down by a minor matter, consider that this isn't where your attention is most needed. Take a long, hard look before fruitlessly pouring your heart into a situation of questionable importance. You know you're doing the right thing when your energy flows without resistance."
taurus,2013-01-02,"While others seem uptight or nervous today, you may appear quite confident and calm. Your optimistic attitude and polished appearance make a great impression on your peers. You have a relaxed competence that puts people at ease, so take advantage of this creative phase by talking with those whose approval you seek. There's no need to hold back now so let your natural talents shine."
gemini,2013-01-02,"You feel extra clever today and are up for the challenge of getting your life back in order. But a problem may start at home with something relatively unimportant; unfortunately, even the smallest loose thread can unravel the largest fabric. Handling the situation successfully requires you to find the right balance between concern and detachment. Show how much you care without trying to control the outcome or expecting anything in return."
cancer,2013-01-02,"Using your sharp wit as a weapon today is less admirable than simply telling the truth. Don't just settle into a defensive posture if it feels like someone is attacking you. Emotions hiding beneath the surface might be the result of deeper motivations that are't being discussed openly. Rely on your analytical powers to discern whether anyone is trying to manipulate you, and then react accordingly. Taking the high road is almost always the best route to maintaining your integrity."
leo,2013-01-02,"You will accomplish a lot more today if you can focus on just one thing at a time. Of course, it's easy to be pleasantly lured off track when pets or children are in the picture. You have a wide range of talents and interests, but cashing in requires concentrating on what you value most. Mastering a single skill means that you really don't have time to waste. Remember, precision counts more now than anything else."
virgo,2013-01-02,"You typically like your world to be clean and polished, but you might get a little dirty today. Don't worry or become too self-critical about the mess because getting the job done is more important than looking good. Take a chance and dive into the challenges you face now. Put all your intensity into whatever you encounter and then move on, knowing that you gave it everything you could."
libra,2013-01-02,"Creating balance is what you Libras do best since you prefer staying cool and reasonable under all circumstances. However, if someone gets under your skin and agitates your feelings today, you might not keep your reaction to yourself. Pay attention to your emotions and notice where they take you. You have an excellent chance to talk through whatever comes up as long as you don't get stuck in one spot. Exploring uncharted emotional territory expands your heart, allowing more love to flow in and out."
scorpio,2013-01-02,"Your friends may attempt to convince you to do something that doesn't sound like the smartest move now. It's very important that you trust your instincts over someone else's argument -- even if you have to stand up for your beliefs. Nevertheless, be careful not to create more conflict than necessary, for others might be quick to take your disagreement as a direct challenge. Negotiation is certainly better than confrontation if you want to keep the peace."
sagittarius,2013-01-02,"Your laissez-faire approach might get you into big trouble at work today, especially if you try to avoid the most logical solution. Your best strategy now is the simplest one, so don't turn a molehill into a mountain or you'll eventually have to climb it. Listen to the cool voice of reason, even if it comes from your boss. Practicing self-discipline in the first place is a successful proactive strategy."
capricorn,2013-01-02,"Life feels a bit calmer today as the Moon moves through earthy Virgo. Try to make choices that stabilize a current situation while simultaneously planning for your future. Unfortunately, it may be challenging to balance your immediate needs with your long-term goals. Be careful not to let your ambitions dictate all your decisions or you'll end up wasting precious time and energy. Step back and ground yourself so you can operate from a practical perspective."
aquarius,2013-01-02,"It's difficult to slow down enough today to give your feelings time to fully express in the way you need. You tend to be uncomfortable when you are feeling vulnerable, yet emotional intimacy may be the key to your growth. Don't try to intellectualize everything you experience now. Instead, push through your awkwardness by freely opening your mind and heart to the world around you. Start slowly by sharing one of your deepest fears with someone you trust; you might be pleasantly surprised with where that conversation leads."
pisces,2013-01-02,"You may want to avoid tackling a difficult family issue today, but it's still probably a good idea to face an existing conflict head on. Instead of following your intuition, let the hard facts be your guide for a change. Analyze the situation from several points of view and then make an objective decision that benefits all involved. No one can find fault in your actions if you stick with clear logic."
aries,2013-01-03,"Although you may feel like changing the course of events today, others might not be willing to follow your lead. You could be too impulsive, since you're inclined to jump to conclusions without having the necessary facts to support your fantastic ideas. Go ahead and be as inventive as possible now, but don't expect anyone else to join in your parade. March to the sound of your own drum instead of waiting for something to happen."
taurus,2013-01-03,"You like knowing what's real, yet a whole new set of data may come to your attention today that gives rise to self-doubt. You might even question whether or not you're on the right track. Your resistance to change could harden into rigidity but this isn't a sensible strategy, especially if your previous assumptions were wrong. Remaining open to other options doesn't fix the underlying problem, but it can make your day easier to manage along the way."
gemini,2013-01-03,"You're on top of your mental game today and can amaze people with your wit and wisdom. However, extra care is required or you might become so enthralled with your own cleverness that you take an argument too far. Too much eagerness on your part could cause you to lose ground in a conflict. Go ahead and take a risk, but think twice before pushing your luck."
cancer,2013-01-03,"You may step on someone's toes unintentionally because you're uncharacteristically insensitive today. Normally, you're acutely aware of people's feelings, but you might get so excited now that compassion falls to the wayside. Your temporary lack of concern doesn't mean you are unkind; it's just that your enthusiasm makes you a bit inconsiderate. The simple solution is to stop and think about the impact of your words before you speak them."
leo,2013-01-03,"You are eager to enjoy yourself today, but previous commitments might present time management problems. Unfortunately, your nervous energy could grow distracting unless you consciously channel it into a creative activity. It's a good day to work in partnership with someone whose approach is much different from yours. A collaborative effort can be highly productive and may even bring the personal satisfaction you were originally seeking."
virgo,2013-01-03,"An unconventional plan helps to break you out of a familiar rut today. A job-related issue that's been eluding resolution may suddenly be put to rest, with the answer coming to you like a bolt of lightning. But don't take yourself too seriously, even if your solution is brilliant; acting in a self-righteous manner puts others on the defensive. Simply make your decision and then move on without the need to prove your superiority."
libra,2013-01-03,"Your day won't likely run as smoothly as you wish because unexpected circumstances can have a dramatic impact on your schedule. Unfortunately, you might become quite frustrated if you cling to your original agenda. The smartest way to handle irresolvable tension now is to simply let it go. Acknowledging that fate is temporarily in charge of your life makes embracing the surprises more pleasant than resisting them to no avail."
scorpio,2013-01-03,"Worrying about an unlikely outcome only creates additional stress as you become enthused about a radical approach to a sticky problem at work. There are many possible solutions now, but you have reservations about moving into uncharted territory by taking charge. Your ideas are probably better than you think, so go ahead and initiate action. You can always make necessary adjustments and try again later if you don't hit the nail directly on the head."
sagittarius,2013-01-03,The notion of doing something completely different from everyone's expectations is rather thrilling now. Unplanned activities may supersede your previous commitments. You could even stir up a bit of mischief just to see what kind of reaction you get. Have fun; there's no need to go out of your way to conform since your current unconventional ideas will likely lead to a sensible plan by tomorrow.
capricorn,2013-01-03,"You are usually cautious in your conversations about business, but your thoughts may be so loud today that it's hard to keep quiet. You might even say contradictory things now, which lowers your overall credibility. Instead of rambling on and on, continue to develop your ideas on your own and wait until tomorrow before sharing them. You'll have a much better chance of impressing others if your plan is well conceived."
aquarius,2013-01-03,"Your nervous system is wired tightly today while chatty Mercury is getting buzzed by electric Uranus, your key planet. Be careful, since you could easily commit your time and energy to a creative project that isn't really in your best interest. Consider the consequences before agreeing to an endeavor that can drain your resources. There's no reason to add more activity to your already busy schedule unless it's something you really want to pursue."
pisces,2013-01-03,"You want to show everyone how independent you are today, making you less accommodating than usual. Your patience may be tested, tempting you to say something that could be disruptive. Nevertheless, you don't have to put up with childish games as long as you're prepared to deal with the ramifications of your current rebelliousness. Thankfully, the results will be worth the temporary turmoil if you clearly express your honorable intentions to others."
aries,2013-01-04,"Your ruling planet Mars is supported by buoyant Jupiter today, motivating you to act on your feelings.

Although your current zest for life may be contagious, you might grow more circumspect toward the evening. Respecting established boundaries now prevents you from having to reconsider your radical approach later on."
taurus,2013-01-04,"Your key planet Venus forms a stressful aspect to somber Saturn tonight, reminding you that common sense will ultimately overcome your enthusiasm. However, don't let your self-restraint kick into action too early in the day or you may miss the other planetary excitement bubbling around you. Starting a new project is a good idea as long as you're willing to follow through with sincere effort after the initial buzz wears off."
gemini,2013-01-04,"At first everyone seems to be having a fine time, but you can see beneath the surface and the atmosphere isn't as copacetic as it appears. It isn't your style to rain on someone else's parade, yet the responsibility may fall on you to be the one to issue a reality check. Nevertheless, there's no reason to approach the situation with negativity. Express your thoughts as kindly as possible and then let go of your attachment to what happens next."
cancer,2013-01-04,"You feel the power of love today but you may not reveal your true passion, especially if the thought of expressing your desires makes you uncomfortable. Although you don't like being emotionally vulnerable on a regular basis, there's no need to let your irrational fears stand in the way of a potentially lovely experience. Instead of trying to control the process, just share what's in your heart without expecting anything in return."
leo,2013-01-04,"Although there are many excellent reasons to work in partnership now, be certain you have all the facts at your disposal before you make faulty assumptions. It's tempting to overlook something you don't want to know, but it's better to be rational and have a solid handle on reality today. Ironically, acknowledging the weight of responsibility opens the doors for more pleasurable times. Do the right thing when it comes to matters of the heart and the rewards will follow."

libra,2013-01-04,"Your exuberance is apparent in everything you do today as long as you're being creative. Luckily, you can maintain your sense of optimism if you focus your attention on the future. However, lingering doubts about your ability to follow through with what you start can raise old fears. Talk things over with a trusted friend instead of denying your concerns. Once your issues are out in the open, you'll be able to move forward without carrying the weight of the past on your shoulders."
scorpio,2013-01-04,"Sink into your own feelings today as energetic Mars activates your 4th House of Emotional Security. Your current optimism might inspire others; however a slight case of self-doubt could gnaw away at your confidence. This negativity may just be a passing thought if you are flexible in your thinking. Once you realize the source of your anxiety, you can easily move past it and refocus on the opportunities at hand."
sagittarius,2013-01-04,"Your ruling planet Jupiter is a key player in today's expressive cosmic configuration, pulling you head-first into the realm of relationships. Be careful about going overboard with your enthusiasm, especially if you are using it to cover a deeper concern. Finding a healthy balance between the adrenaline rush of reckless abandon and the dutiful routine of emotional responsibility isn't easy, but well worth the trouble."
capricorn,2013-01-04,"Demonstrating your competence at work is effortless today because everything seems to be going your way. Unfortunately, you may be so sure of yourself now that you take the path of least resistance rather than doing a job in your typically thorough manner. However, you could find yourself in trouble quickly unless you pay attention to all the little details. You can let your hair down and relax once you've fulfilled your current obligations, but not a moment sooner."
aquarius,2013-01-04,"Jovial Jupiter is harmonizing with irrepressible Mars in your 1st House of Personality today, pushing your exuberance to the surface. Everyone can see that you're putting your best foot forward, but you may not feel quite as optimistic as you appear. You have legitimate concerns about the actions of others; but instead of wasting your energy making judgments about someone else, change your own thinking. No one else's behavior needs to negatively impact your day, unless you let it."
pisces,2013-01-04,"Your imagination is often a path for escape, yet today you can dream your way to success as long as you're willing to cooperate with others on the job. Even if you're tempted to withdraw from social interaction, push past your resistance and reach out to your co-workers now. Instead of worrying about what anyone else thinks about your contribution, just show up and be yourself. You may be happily surprised with the positive reinforcement you receive in return."
aries,2013-01-05,"Your partner or friend may tell you something about yourself today that you prefer not to hear. But you're so busy communicating about your current projects or creating career plans that you might forget about your own feelings. Take advantage of this chance to put your world back together by refocusing your reactions to others. Instead of sidestepping the shadows that appear in front of you, shine the light of your awareness and transform your fear into love."

You'll be feeling more like your old self within a couple of days."
leo,2013-01-05,"You are in a rather noisy phase now that the people-pleasing Libra Moon is moving through your 3rd House of Information. There is a lot happening in your environment and it's hard to keep up with it all. Perhaps you have simply tried to pack too much into your schedule. Or maybe you have details to settle that you thought were already completed. Either way, don't get lazy and let your responsibilities slide, even if you wish you could take the day off. Take pride in your accomplishments."
virgo,2013-01-05,"Try to decipher the hidden meaning behind the information coming your way now, for there can be a chance for healing, especially around issues of love and romance.

Thankfully, you realize your ability to create peace in your life begins with accepting your own feelings.

It's difficult to join in because you might feel restrained by the very same people you want to engage. It's useful to discuss your concerns to clarify the differences, but there's no need to dwell on the matter. Ultimately, connecting with others feels much better than isolating yourself from the fun."
aries,2013-01-07,"It's hard to get much started today, especially if you're worried about the disapproval you might receive from your peers. You may think that you waited too long, but there isn't anything to be gained by self-criticism now. Be satisfied with whatever you accomplish, even if it's less than you expected.

gemini,2013-01-07,"You may need to re-evaluate your current objectives at work because your previous assumptions might prove to be wrong. Instead of being in a hurry to reach your goals, slow down and make sure that all loose ends are tied up before going on to the next step. It's more important to strengthen your foundation now than it is to expand your reach. A cautious and methodical approach today will prevent unnecessary trouble down the road."
cancer,2013-01-07,"You might feel a bit disheartened today by complications in a relationship, yet you're hesitant to share what's really on your mind. Even if someone is trying to exert control over your actions, they cannot change your emotions. Unfortunately, doing what's expected of you while hiding your feelings could create an undertow of resentment. Honor your own heart now by facing your resistance and telling the truth."
leo,2013-01-07,"Your efforts on the job may be thwarted now, no matter how hard you work. It's as if you're attempting to roll boulders up a steep hill and you wonder if it's worth all the effort. However, regardless of your lack of results, it's important that you keep trying since you are setting the stage for greater opportunities to come to fruition in the year ahead."
virgo,2013-01-07,"If your time is stretched too thin, you may have to cut back on your schedule. But don't waste energy complaining about how much you have to do or your co-workers might grow annoyed with you. Ironically, it seems like the more effort you put into making things happen now, the more work that's in front of you. Your best strategy is to shift your focus to another task for a while. You can return to your previous endeavors in a day or two with a fresh perspective."
libra,2013-01-07,"Your friends and family may not be as supportive now as you wish. Nevertheless, it's important to realize they are on your side -- even if it doesn't feel that way in the present moment. Instead of trying to convince anyone to help you today, release him or her from your expectations. Then, if someone lends a hand, it will be a generous act of free will instead of originating from of a sense of obligation."
scorpio,2013-01-07,"You might feel as if your best intentions are being stymied, and nothing you do fixes the situation today. The current circumstances are a test of your willpower; although you may be angry, losing your temper only makes matters worse. Even if you want to initiate more drastic action, kindly letting others know how you feel without blaming them is a more positive approach. Continue to take the high road instead of trying to even the score. You'll have a chance to get everything out in the open sooner than you think."
sagittarius,2013-01-07,"Pay extra careful attention to the clock today or your schedule could fall apart. It may be tempting to walk away from it all, but avoidance is not in your best interest. Plan ahead by first acknowledging that everything could take longer to finish than you expect. Adding extra time between activities allows you to work at a consistent pace without worrying that you'll lose control of your day. Your determination to stay on point earns the respect you seek."
capricorn,2013-01-07,"You might feel a bit lost today as reaching your goals slips out of your grasp. However, don't write off anything too quickly because the game isn't over yet. There's no time to wallow in discouragement now, even if your efforts until now haven't manifested the desired results. Prematurely admitting failure could stand between you and success. Be persistent and continue to work for what you want; monetary rewards and peer recognition may be just around the next corner."
aquarius,2013-01-07,"You may feel as if you must set your needs aside to fulfill responsibilities at work now that expressive Mars in your individualistic sign squares taskmaster Saturn. But instead of reacting by shutting down emotionally, set priorities that honor both your personal and professional goals. Succeeding at work is not an all-or-nothing proposition today, so make a plan that includes some quality time for yourself."
pisces,2013-01-07,"Your dreams may have grown so outrageous that achieving your goals seems unrealistic today. Something has to give because you might not be able to keep up with your own ambitious plans. Remember, if you are reaching too far, it's smarter to scale back your hopes now than waiting until it's too late. Establishing priorities based on reality, not fantasy, will help you create a healthy balance in your life."
aries,2013-01-08,Attempting to convince others to follow your plan today seems as impossible as herding cats. It may not matter how amazing your idea is or how articulate you are at selling it. Even your best friends seem too concerned with their own agendas to join in your efforts. Don't let anyone dampen your pioneering spirit; sometimes you're better off striking out on your own.
taurus,2013-01-08,"You could spend too much time seeking a hidden meaning that actually isn't to be found today. Meanwhile, a problem may arise because of your lack of concern over a financial matter. Trying to untangle a buried mystery might just be your way of avoiding an unpleasant issue. Instead of escaping into a world of conjecture, deal with the reality in front of you and save the metaphysical explorations for another day."
gemini,2013-01-08,"Think twice about the positive effect you could have on someone very close to you before responding to his or her emotional disclosure today. Your first reaction might be to step back from an intense conversation that's making you uncomfortable, instead of staying present with your feelings and discussing them openly. However, demonstrating your sense of autonomy is not as important now as being there for a friend in need."
cancer,2013-01-08,"You have some fantastic ideas about what you can accomplish today, but your expectations may be too unrealistic to meet. Thankfully, you could correct the situation before you get in over your head by recognizing your current tendency to bite off more than you can chew. Scaling back your plans before you begin might be enough to prevent disappointing others later on."
leo,2013-01-08,"You're experiencing alternating waves of optimism and pessimism today as you are caught between expansive Jupiter and restrictive Saturn. You probably think you're on the right track, but might still anticipate a rough road ahead, making it tricky to maintain an even pace. Even if you're eager to reach for the stars now, it's wise to proceed cautiously for the next few days until you see where your current path is leading."
virgo,2013-01-08,"You could be the biggest obstacle to your own happiness today if you expect too much from a close friend or family member. You're not necessarily inclined to make specific demands, yet you believe that everyone should do their part. Instead of projecting your high standards on to others, just continue to lead by setting a stellar example. Maintaining harmony is more important now than high productivity."
libra,2013-01-08,"Your best-laid plans may quickly unravel today, especially if you're holding the reins of control too tightly. Making many minor adjustments throughout the day is a more practical approach than trying to stick to a strategy that just isn't working. Keep in mind that modifying your methods or correcting your direction isn't the same as accepting defeat. Your willingness to adapt to changing circumstances is an essential key to your success."
scorpio,2013-01-08,"You might be feeling smug about your financial condition today, whether or not your confidence is actually based on reality. Be cautious about buying anything you don't really need because in your present state of denial, you could be tempted now to spend more money than you should. Take time to balance your books and reassess your needs before making any discretionary purchases."
sagittarius,2013-01-08,"You grow moodier with the reactive Moon back in your sign, yet you're not particularly interested in pursuing self-reflection now. You don't need to make any excuses; there really could be too much happening in your outer world to journey inward. Nevertheless, you might not be eager to socialize with your friends or family if a social activity was previously scheduled. Keep in mind that you'll have time tomorrow to ponder life's mysteries if you take a lighthearted approach today."
capricorn,2013-01-08,"It's difficult to keep your mind from going around in circles as you think about all the loose ends that you need to tie up. Fortunately, you can accomplish a lot if you get out of your head and into the real world now, even if philosophical theory is more interesting than practical application. Be as methodical as possible in your work, tackling the most important projects first. You'll feel a sense of true satisfaction after you cross a few things off your to-do list."
aquarius,2013-01-08,"You have great expectations for the workweek, especially if there are opportunities for social networking. However, it's crucial to take all the variables into account today because others might not share your idea of what constitutes a productive time. Don't make too big of a deal about any differences of opinions. Just keep the conversations between you and your peers on topics that pertain to business. For now, it's not wise to mix work and pleasure until you know the intentions of all the players involved."
pisces,2013-01-08,"Stand up tall and demonstrate your special style of leadership today. But rather than telling your friends, family or coworkers what to do, you can truly inspire and motivate others if you lead by example now. Even if someone doesn't respond to your liking, keep your eyes on the destination as you push ahead with unwavering belief in your dreams."
aries,2013-01-09,"Someone at work might ask for your help today, but there could be more trouble here than meets the eye. Be careful about what you do, for your behavior may create big expectations that you cannot fulfill. Don't respond to the situation with clever rationalizations or outrageous ideas. Instead, do whatever needs to be done, but not more. There are times when limited actions can accomplish the most."
taurus,2013-01-09,"It may be easier to make plans now than to actually execute them. Your key planet Venus lures you to envision the future as she joins three other planets in your 9th House of Big Ideas. Although thoughts come quickly to you today, your progress is impeded by circumstances beyond your control. Don't waste time worrying about something that goes awry; just reconsider your options and try again when the timing is right."
gemini,2013-01-09,"You may be inclined to set aside your responsibilities today and do things that bring you momentary pleasure. Unfortunately, it might not be that simple to find people to join your party because others may be more serious than you now. Don't complain about your social situation; if necessary, you can still have a delightful time all by yourself."
cancer,2013-01-09,"Your emotional sensitivity means that you don't miss much, so it's challenging for someone with mixed motives to get past your radar. However, your acute awareness can also make life more complicated as you analyze your feelings. Your early warning system may not detect the simple twists of fate that the universe now has in store for you. Don't try too hard to figure it all out in advance; simply let go and enjoy the ride."
leo,2013-01-09,"Just when you thought you were done processing all the emotions that were lurking in your subconscious, you realize that there are more hidden feelings buried out of sight. Although these pockets of intensity start to bubble to the surface today, they are not dangerous. In fact, delving into the depths of your heart will uncover rich treasure if you are brave enough to take the dive."
virgo,2013-01-09,"You might feel as if time is running out, but the faster you attempt to complete what's on your plate, the slower everything appears to move now. If you panic, time may even seem to stop for a while. This current lack of productivity places you in a difficult position because you can become very self-critical when you're not being efficient. Cut yourself some slack and just finish your work with as little drama as possible."
libra,2013-01-09,"Your life is at a critical junction now that new information is being thrown your way, bringing complex issues out into the open. Thankfully, your growing knowledge base enables you to make better decisions. In the meantime, integrate the events of the past couple of days, even if you don't have the full picture yet. Accept circumstances that you cannot change while working toward improving everything else. Redefining your ambitions can send you off in an entirely new direction."
scorpio,2013-01-09,"You transform into a private investigator today when unexpected things happen for no apparent reason. However, your current dilemma might even stump Sherlock Holmes, himself. Relax; there are some mysteries in the universe that must remain outside your logical analysis. It's time to smile in grateful acknowledgment and accept reality's gift with grace and without question."
sagittarius,2013-01-09,"You feel as if you're completely in charge today, but this sense of authority is probably more illusion than truth. It's not that your life is running amok; it's just that circumstances can unfold without your expressed permission. Unfortunately, you don't get to approve everything before it happens. Differentiating between what you can and cannot change allows you to focus your efforts where they have the greatest positive impact."
capricorn,2013-01-09,"You're not happy that your to-do list seems longer than ever now. Perhaps you need to rethink your workload and consider why you try to do so much. Are your goals in sync with your passions, or is it the recognition and rewards that you seek? Don't try to avoid your responsibilities; however postponing a few tasks could give you time to reconsider all your options."
aquarius,2013-01-09,"You may be acting as if life is fine today, but you're probably worried that something isn't going your way. Although feisty Mars occupies your 1st House of Personality, others can see your concerns lurking just behind your enthusiasm. Instead of denying that you want more stability in your life, acknowledge that your desire for security is as important as your need for freedom. You might not be able to resolve these opposite forces now, but talking about them reduces your stress."
pisces,2013-01-09,"As if your relationships with friends and associates haven't been complicated enough, a whole new dimension of depth and intrigue can emerge now. You are less apt to go off to have a good time today if it means letting your responsibilities suffer. Although others might think you're taking your work too seriously, you are quite clear about your current ambitions and the results you seek. Cutting back on your social activities helps you deliver on your professional promises."
aries,2013-01-10,"Focusing on your career may require all the energy you have now as the goal-oriented Capricorn Moon enters your 10th House of Status. You are more concerned with your own plans today than with the opinions of anyone else. However, you might not be able to reach your objectives without the help of others. Don't be so narrow-minded that you exclude your co-workers from sharing in your success."
taurus,2013-01-10,"Although you may have a concrete idea about how to complete your work, it might be smarter to finalize your plans today than actually execute them. Your intuition tells you to move beyond your normal routines and to try new things, but it's more important now to rely on your unwavering common sense. Blending your current vision with your practicality and patience creates an unbeatable combination."
gemini,2013-01-10,"It's irritating when something comes along in your life that's significant enough to anchor you to one spot for a while, especially if your attention is drawn elsewhere. But reality has an important lesson to teach you now, so don't let your attention wander. Stay focused on your feelings, even if it's challenging to integrate them into your life. The emotional dust will begin to settle by the weekend and you'll be able to move on."
cancer,2013-01-10,"Your current commitments to others may interfere with the fulfillment of your own emotional needs today. It might be wise to just set aside your desires for a few days while you do whatever is expected of you. Your efforts to stabilize personal and business relationships can bring you more happiness in the weeks ahead than anything you try to do for yourself now, anyway. Nurturing those you love does your own heart good."
leo,2013-01-10,"Put away your playthings and get out your tools and determination because you have chores to do and you might as well take your work seriously. Although you may be annoyed by the arduous tasks in front of you, tackle each job willingly with a can-do attitude. A couple of days of hard work should be enough to free you up to enjoy a weekend of relaxation and recreation."
virgo,2013-01-10,"The simplest pleasures are the most memorable ones now, yet you can still fulfill your need for fun while you are working. Unfortunately, you don't take too kindly to anyone telling you how to do your job. Of course, your idea of the best way to approach a task will work just fine. However, you could easily miss the chance to enjoy a special connection with someone today if you're not willing to receive constructive feedback. Listening to the advice of others offers you more options and demonstrates your willingness to be a team player."
libra,2013-01-10,"You might feel the stress today as you try balancing your work with the emotional needs of friends and family. Although you cannot walk away from your job, responsibilities may be calling you back home. Schedule your time in advance so you can divide your efforts between your personal and professional commitments. In the meantime, let others know that you're simply doing the best you can."
scorpio,2013-01-10,"Everyone seems to be paying extra close attention to what you say today with so many planets traveling through your 3rd House of Communication. However, it's crucial to focus on the integrity of your actions at all times, making certain they are consistent with your thoughts or you may end up in a rather difficult position. However, the current emphasis is on production now, so you must buckle down and do what must be done. Save the speech for another day."
sagittarius,2013-01-10,"Low self-esteem could get in your way today as you struggle against the limitations of your current job. This frustration might not be a new one, but it continues to surface again when outside pressures build. If you are financially stressed, consider how your feelings of self-worth might be impacting your bank account now. This is an opportune time to establish realistic goals and then develop an ambitious plan to achieve them."
capricorn,2013-01-10,"You may be approaching what appears to be the end of a road and you're trying to determine where to go next. Even if you're ready to charge ahead, unfinished business needs to be completed before you can see around the next bend. Try not to look too far ahead until after tomorrow's New Moon; instead, do everything you can to make this day as positive and productive as possible."
aquarius,2013-01-10,"Your dreams may be so vivid now that it's difficult to distinguish them from reality. One inner voice reminds you of the beauty inherent in the spiritual and metaphysical approach to life. Another voice confronts you with the hard facts of your present situation. You shouldn't ignore your responsibilities, even if you prefer to be alone with your thoughts now. Shift back and forth between these two worlds as needed until you find the right balance."
pisces,2013-01-10,"A team of co-workers or a group of friends places so many demands on you now that it could be hard to find any time away from the noise of social interactions. It's crucial to show up and let your feelings be known today, even if they differ from everyone else's. However, once you've stated your position, be prepared to go along with the pack. Ironically, demonstrating your cooperative spirit gives you the opportunity for personal expression later on."
aries,2013-01-11,"You may be growing tired of putting out so much energy, especially if you are busy at work. This is an ideal time to re-evaluate your career path as today's goal-oriented Capricorn New Moon activates your 10th House of Public Status. Pretend that there is nothing holding you back while envisioning what you want your future to look like. Then, return to the present moment and assess the obstacles that you need to overcome so you can change your life for the better."
taurus,2013-01-11,"Follow the path that is opened by new opportunities now as the ambitious Capricorn New Moon lands in your inspirational 9th House of Adventure. You know that exciting changes are just around the corner, but you might want to wait a bit longer before committing yourself to a new project. Trust your inner voice and move at a pace that feels comfortable. The current transformations will bring positive results if you are consistent and patient in your efforts."
gemini,2013-01-11,"You might as well go along with the plans of the day while the rational Capricorn New Moon energizes your 8th House of Deep Sharing. However, it's not wise to become too entangled with other people's long-term goals today. You stand to gain support in your future endeavors if you can respect the beliefs of those around you. Nevertheless, you need to channel your restlessness into your own pursuit of happiness."
cancer,2013-01-11,"You may need to grit your teeth and do what's expected of you since today's serious Capricorn New Moon emphasizes your 7th House of Relationships. Others might make unreasonable demands on you now, but you have your own agenda and don't want to waste time on everyone else's projects. Still, you prefer to put on a friendly outward appearance since you know that being a good team player can help create the emotional security that you seek. You don't have to give up what you want in the process; you just have to wait a little longer."
leo,2013-01-11,"Even if being practical isn't normally your strength, your friends and family may rely on you now to hold things together with the stabilizing Capricorn New Moon occurring in your 6th House of Self-Improvement. However, you are steadily moving your life into a new direction that is more consistent with your personal ambitions. Remember, the more open you are to life's possibilities, the more likely this journey will be a healthy transition for you. Fortunately, you can be there for those you love while also honoring your own needs."
virgo,2013-01-11,"You might have a tough time talking yourself into a lighthearted mood today, unless you have already completed your work. Ironically, you're comfortable with your somber demeanor now because the self-restrained Capricorn New Moon intensifies your 5th House of Creativity, enabling you to get a lot accomplished. Being efficient ensures that you will have something special to show for your day."
libra,2013-01-11,"Today's Capricorn New Moon falls in your 4th House of Emotional Security, raising stressful issues on the home front. You may feel that no matter what you do, someone in your family is going to be on your case for not having done something else. Ultimately, maintaining your integrity is more important than justifying your actions. If you're honest about your feelings, others will eventually come around to understanding your position."
scorpio,2013-01-11,"It may feel as if the resistance you are encountering originates from the current circumstances in your external world. However, the Capricorn New Moon occurs in your 3rd House of Communication, indicating that your immediate environment is a reflection of you. The good news is that your destiny is in your own hands; whatever conflict you have created, you can remedy with a real commitment on your part. Be brave and start talking about tough issues to get the ball rolling."
sagittarius,2013-01-11,"The calculating Capricorn New Moon stimulates your 2nd House of Possessions, encouraging you to be practical in your approach to managing personal resources. Instead of just buying things to make you happy, consider what you truly value beyond the material world. Setting new priorities based on your core beliefs can lead to lasting satisfaction rather than the fleeting thrill of acquiring something shiny and new."
capricorn,2013-01-11,"Today's New Moon in your sign starts a new emotional cycle that allows you to leave the past behind. Accept your current feelings, even if they aren't consistent with last year's plans. But this doesn't mean you should just drop whatever you've been doing in favor of a passing fancy. Find a workable balance between handling the logistics of life and cultivating your desires for personal fulfillment."
aquarius,2013-01-11,"Fantasy plays a significant role in your life now as the Capricorn New Moon falls in your 12th House of Dreams. You might feel as if reality is dissolving into the mists of illusion, but don't get so caught up in your ethereal visions that re-entry to your world is difficult. It's magical to travel into your imagination as long as you keep one foot on the ground to maintain your balance at all times."
pisces,2013-01-11,"You take your relationships very seriously now because the responsible Capricorn New Moon emphasizes your 11th House of Groups and Friends. Although you have your own needs, you may choose to temporarily set them aside to stabilize your position at work or in the community. But don't just give up your agenda in the name of team spirit. Being honest enables you to be active in your social network without sacrificing your personal goals."
aries,2013-01-12,"You are wired with the anticipation of doing something daring today, even if others think you're the epitome of stability. You may feel wild and crazy since your impulsive reactions are even stronger than usual. Nevertheless, you cannot act on every whim. Maintain a sense of responsibility to compensate for your current unconventional desires. Holding an outer posture of reliability enables you to continue chasing your dreams."
taurus,2013-01-12,"You might begin the day with simple goals, but complications mount as you head in one particular direction because of an irrepressible craving. You don't want your satisfaction to be delayed as your key planet, Venus, is excited by unpredictable Uranus. Just be careful not to destabilize anything that has enduring importance on your rush toward temporary gratification."
gemini,2013-01-12,"It seems as if everyone wants to have a good time today and you certainly don't want to be left out of the fun. You might think you can get away with a clever scheme in your quest for the next thrill, but you may be surprised how fast your mistakes can catch up with you now. Attend to your responsibilities early in the day so you can be free to explore your options for play later on."
cancer,2013-01-12,"Your obligations may feel overwhelming today, but you could still find a way to avoid too much drudgery. Your evasive behavior isn't necessarily an act of irresponsibility, especially if you are just setting your own personal boundaries. Remember, you don't always have to take on other people's worries just because they expect you to do so. Sometimes saying no to someone else is the healthiest expression of self-love."
leo,2013-01-12,"You may grow frustrated by thinking about how much fun you could have if you ditched your current obligations, jumped bail and declared yourself free. However, nearly anything you do today has immediate repercussions. Remember that it's easier to contemplate the consequences of your actions before having to deal with a crisis of your own creation."
virgo,2013-01-12,"If there are issues in your love life that need to be brought out into the open, today may be your lucky day. Just be considerate and express your desires in a rational way that demonstrates your compassionate spirit rather than a selfish attitude. Sparks might fly, but everything should work out as long as you speak from the heart, maintain integrity and act in a kindly matter. The outcome could be more pleasing than you expect."
libra,2013-01-12,"Unconventional desires can land you in trouble today, but a bit of self-awareness helps you get through the day without too much drama. However, sidestepping an emotional scene proves difficult because unexpected circumstances might sneak up on you. Your attractions may fluctuate wildly before you understand what's going on. Thankfully, it's healthy to experience extreme feelings now as long as you avoid acting on any one of them as if it was the ultimate truth."
scorpio,2013-01-12,"It's hard to maintain your concentration on chores today because enticing social circumstances are very distracting. You don't need to lose out on all the fun, but previous commitments prevent you from cutting loose as much as you wish. There's no need to stress about the good times you might be missing since there will be chances for more frivolity soon enough. Instead, be happy wherever you are and with whatever you are doing while secretly planning your escape."
sagittarius,2013-01-12,"You look like you have both feet planted on the ground, but your creative imagination may be soaring with the birds. Ironically, focusing on what's happening in the present moment empowers you to let go and follow a stream of consciousness while still maintaining a solid connection with reality. Even if your work is a bit sloppy now, strive to be as original as possible. Thankfully, you will be able to tidy up the details later on."
capricorn,2013-01-12,"You may not be able to resist your heart's desire today. Although logical analysis leads you to the right answers, it might not be sufficient to keep you on the straight and narrow path now. It's admirable to take the high road by transforming your physical needs into compassionate action. Perhaps self-restraint does lead to the most spiritual path, but keep in mind that you are human. Honoring your eccentricity is also an important part of your current path toward satisfaction."
aquarius,2013-01-12,"Amorous Venus squares edgy Uranus today, encouraging you to risk more in your quest for emotional fulfillment and physical satisfaction. You might believe that pursuing a sudden attraction will bring you lasting happiness. However, reckless behavior, at best, only leads to temporary pleasure. Sacrifice a little excitement now for the security of long-term stability."
pisces,2013-01-12,"Your mind is free to go anywhere today as your thoughts play out one possible scenario after another. But it may not be socially acceptable to express every whim. Nevertheless, it's up to you to find the courage to bring your dreams into full consciousness. Fortunately, you don't have to tell anyone about your fantasies, nor do you need to act them out now. Simply enjoy the movie in which you are the writer, the director and the star."
aries,2013-01-13,"You may feel the electricity of the high-frequency Aquarius Moon that insists you move into the future. But you're also listening to the beat of a not-so-distant drummer with a more traditional rhythm. Oddly enough, you might attempt to hold on to the past now, preventing you from freely running ahead. Thankfully, your stress dissipates if you share your dilemma with someone you trust; talking about your mixed feelings helps bring clarity to the situation."
taurus,2013-01-13,"Interactions with others may lure you into uncomfortable places today, yet you don't want anyone to know what's going on behind your stoic appearance. You have good reason to maintain the status quo, even if you're currently receiving information that tempts you to make immediate changes. Acting in a restrained manner is your most sensible strategy now. Acknowledging your emotional reactions is healthy, but you don't need to share everything you feel."
gemini,2013-01-13,"This isn't an easy time because the planets continue to hold your feet to the fire and your words to the law. Although you might prefer a more lighthearted approach to life, you are being constrained in ways that may make you doubt your methods. Thankfully, the freethinking Aquarius Moon offers relief today, but the deepest issues won't be blown away by a fresh breeze. If you stop and face the music, it won't be nearly as difficult to handle as you think."
cancer,2013-01-13,"Intimate communications with significant others are emphasized today. You may think that you have to be very precise in what you say because people are hanging on your every word. However, your message isn't as important now as how you deliver it. You can do your part by simply sharing what is most real for you. Just don't try to package all your emotions into a pretty box. Showing up with an open heart is your best gift."
leo,2013-01-13,"An encounter with a close friend or family member can leave you confused, especially if others are relying on feelings more than intellect. It's challenging because you might not have the words you need at your disposal today. Part of the problem comes from the inadequacy of language, making it tough to translate your ideas into coherent speech. Watch for non-verbal signals that tell you how you're being received. Being subtle in your approach now may be more effective than making grand gestures."
virgo,2013-01-13,"This is the start of a productive cycle of communication for you. Your thoughts are lighter and more speculative now. Fortunately, you're given time to think about integrating more creativity into your daily routine. Begin now by making time to write in your journal -- and then do it on a regular basis. You may be happily surprised by where this cathartic process leads you."
libra,2013-01-13,"Your memories could drift back to your childhood today as you seek the original source of your current feelings. You may be certain that your emotional habits were formed at an earlier time in your life and now you want to dig up the root cause. Go ahead and begin this important research, but don't expect fast and easy answers to your questions. Be thorough in your analysis yet allow the process to reveal the truth in good time."
scorpio,2013-01-13,"Although you are being required to be more actively engaged in various forms of communication, you're not inclined to simply fill the empty spaces with noise. You want serious interactions that have purpose and meaning. Without the reality factor fully involved, you might try to check out before the conversation is over. However, don't judge too quickly; give things time to develop depth on their own."
sagittarius,2013-01-13,"This is an odd day energetically because on one hand you're growing excited about the future. You might even feel that your dreams are on the verge of becoming real. On the other hand, the clouds of illusion fall away as fast as you can create the lovely dreamscapes. Ultimately, you want to see things as they are now, not as you would like them to be. Keeping one foot on the ground helps you make the best of both worlds."
capricorn,2013-01-13,Your biggest dilemma now is how to stay positive while you are exploring deep in the well of pragmatic thought. But endless analysis doesn't lead you anywhere productive; it just takes you around in circles. One strategy is to keep your calendar peppered with fun activities with friends because they will make sure you don't slip into a state of terminal seriousness. Cautious optimism creates the best chances for progress.
aquarius,2013-01-13,"You're probably quite moody now that the evocative Moon is back in your sign. However, this monthly lunar visit isn't just about your rapidly changing feelings; it's about making contact with your soul's purpose. Explore your imagination as four planets settle into your 12th House of Spirituality. Don't be afraid to let go and fall into your own dreams. You'll wake up stronger and happier if you take this metaphysical journey with an adventurous attitude."
pisces,2013-01-13,"Although your energy is just beginning to settle back down, your imagination is still stirring up exciting new recipes for life. What is usually just a touch of escapism or an idle fantasy can now take you on a very real ride. In fact, it may be difficult for you to separate the fruits of your labors from the fruit loops of your irrational fears and longings. Rely on your most sensible friends to give you the reality check that you need."
aries,2013-01-14,"You might not be willing to trust your feelings today, since you can't follow your thoughts to their logical conclusion. You are all for telling the truth, but there's so much on your mind now that every nuance cannot be communicated. Hidden realities widen your perspective and teach you a lot about the real world. The more open you are to the realms of fantasy, the more you can imagine new vistas ahead."
taurus,2013-01-14,"You may be quite relaxed today for a back-to-work Monday since you have already given yourself permission to chill out with your friends. Although responsibilities still require your attention today, make time to restore your energy. Don't be overly concerned if you leave a job unfinished for a while; treating yourself to a bit of pleasure now shifts your attitude in a positive direction."
gemini,2013-01-14,"Although you might not be eager to meet your obligations today, others may be relying on you more than you realize. Temporarily putting aside your long-term dreams enables you to interact fully in the present moment, but could also contribute to your angst now. No matter how uncertain you are about your future, your heartfelt efforts to communicate with your friends are greatly appreciated and will lift your spirits, too."
cancer,2013-01-14,"You may start the day feeling like an unhappy Crab that has been taken from its watery cave. However, as waves of familiar emotions wash through your life today, you're reminded of how important it is to stay in touch with those you love. Don't worry if you can't explain your newly found confidence to anyone else; just continue about your business without trying to rationalize your behavior. Nevertheless, connecting with others is what matters most."
leo,2013-01-14,"Your current dissatisfaction with a relationship may increase today, for you might realize what you are missing. But the real problem goes even deeper than what someone else has to offer; it's about your need for total engagement. Focus on what you can give to others instead of simply thinking about what you're not receiving in return. Everyone wins if no one is keeping score."
virgo,2013-01-14,"Someone who puts you in closer touch with your feelings may enter your life today, even if you don't know what to do about your reaction. Until now, you were in a very analytical frame of mind, leaving little room for the confusion of irrational emotions. However, you might need to accept that logic won't always bring you the satisfaction you seek. Your stress will dissipate if you can get out of your head and into your heart."
libra,2013-01-14,"You're unsure of how to go about accomplishing your goals today, but don't make excuses or procrastinate any longer. Instead of trying to create a plan, rely on your intuition to tell you what to do next. Although you may feel uncomfortable with this strategy, it just might produce the best results. However, don't overreact; taking an extreme position won't help you reach your destination any sooner."
scorpio,2013-01-14,"You may create more stress by trying to resolve the conflict between your current desires and a more logical approach to your needs. Thankfully, the tension should begin to settle down today without any specific action on your part. There are subtle shifts in the present circumstances now that can give you a glimpse of the smoother sailing ahead. But don't needlessly rock the boat; just stay on course until the discord dissipates."
sagittarius,2013-01-14,"Your lack of commitment might present a problem for a family member or your partner today. It's not that you're avoiding an uncomfortable issue; it's just that your priorities are different from everyone else's and not based on their expectations. If you don't want to be pinned down now, let others know how you're feeling as soon as possible. A difficult situation can simply be avoided if you speak up right away."
capricorn,2013-01-14,"You're trying to do the responsible thing today, but one distraction after another may prevent you from fulfilling your current obligations. Ultimately, it's less about what others think than it is about your own self-judgment. Be easy on yourself now, for there will be time later to return to unfinished business or to reconsider where to go from here."
aquarius,2013-01-14,"Instead of rushing into a new task, stop long enough to clarify your goals, assess your resources and make sure that traveling a different path is truly worth the effort. Even if you decide to build on what you have already started, don't move ahead too fast. Fortunately, it will be much easier to succeed if you take the time to develop your strategy first."
pisces,2013-01-14,"Although you might not feel fully prepared for what's around the next corner, the Moon's return to your sign indicates the beginning of a new emotional cycle. If you have left chores unfinished, unexpected events may force you to do what you should have already done. However, if your old business is completed, then opportunities may open up for you now. Just be sure that you honor your dreams when starting something new."
aries,2013-01-15,"A stroke of genius is right up your alley today and you love it when you're able to figure out totally new solutions to problems that have you and your associates stuck. But just because you suddenly see the light, don't assume you can make everyone else see things from your point of view. Patience is not your strongest suit, but it's still a sensible practice for now."
taurus,2013-01-15,"You may get so lost in your own dreams today that you can't find your way around in the real world. Nevertheless, you have very important tasks to complete and if you don't meet these obligations now, life will quickly grow more complicated. Get your chores out of the way as fast as possible, and don't forget to let others know that you need some time alone. After you are accountable for your actions, you can return to exploring your wild imagination with guilt-free abandon."
gemini,2013-01-15,"You're not nearly as scattered as others think because you have a plan in place, even if no one knows about it yet. Actually, you may have several options that you're juggling now, but this complexity is not beyond your natural capability. You can perform with the best of them, but remember that your goal isn't keeping lots of balls in the air; instead, it's about being happy. Fortunately, walking away from the distractions might be easier than you realize if you simply make a commitment to do it."
cancer,2013-01-15,"Favorable opportunities arise from the most unusual places now, but this doesn't make them any less reliable. Emotional interactions with friends or a romantic partner could lead to a conceptual breakthrough in how you reach your goals. Remain open to new possibilities, since your path is about to widen if you just let it happen without worrying so much about the outcome."
leo,2013-01-15,"Emotions that have you tied in knots may be suddenly released today, as if a magician planned your escape in advance. You could be breathing a sigh of relief from being set free, but you can't avoid the long-term issues you still face. Instead of running away, accept your current circumstances graciously as you work with determination to transform your life."
virgo,2013-01-15,"A shady character may let you down today by not following through on promises made, but don't waste your energy getting too upset about it. You might not have as much control over the actions of others as you prefer and you'll only make yourself unhappy if you allow your emotions to get the best of you. Manage your time effectively and concentrate on improving your own work instead of trying to change anyone else."
libra,2013-01-15,"You may be unsure why your day is overtaken by tasks that don't help you move any closer to your goals. You might be feeling less than ambitious now, so it's advantageous to just do whatever is expected of you. Even if you have lots of transformational ideas, applying them at work could take more effort than you're willing to invest. Entertaining fantasies about the future is enough to bring you satisfaction today."
scorpio,2013-01-15,An unexpected emotional encounter can shock your nervous system today and wake you up from a deep sleep. You may be in a bit of denial about where your life is heading and now you can begin to see things more clearly. Don't make the big changes yet; just playfully consider each possibility as it floats into your awareness.
sagittarius,2013-01-15,"If you are stressed out about making a financial decision, don't just take the easy way out today. There is more going on now than meets the eye; you'll be better off if you let the current situation take its course for a while longer, giving you additional time to discern what's best. Rest assured that your thoughts will grow clearer in the days ahead. Once your confidence returns, you will feel empowered to make the right choice."
capricorn,2013-01-15,You may have to let go of control over your schedule today. One thing after another comes up and you might have to accept that you cannot handle so much chaos at once. Don't judge yourself too harshly while responding to the demands of the day. Do the best you can and let some of the loose ends stay unraveled until tomorrow when you have sufficient time to handle them all.
aquarius,2013-01-15,"Responsibilities at work may conflict with your personal goals, but try not to let that concern you too much at this time. You might not have as much clarity as you want now, so avoid making a decision based upon inaccurate facts or incomplete data. Use this time to explore all of your options, without eliminating any of them. Most of all, be patient with yourself; you'll figure out what you want within a few days."
pisces,2013-01-15,"You are living in two distinct worlds today. On one hand, you're quite comfortable floating around in the dreamy fuzziness of your own imagination. On the other hand, you are uncovering more factual information than you know how to manage. Find ways to integrate your feelings with your rational thoughts. When they magically merge, it's time to swing into heroic action."
aries,2013-01-16,"Reconnecting with your ambitions can be rewarding today, especially if you are willing to make some hard choices. Personal desires might need to be set aside in order to accomplish your career objectives. Or, you may have to pay a professional price if you resurrect an old flame. Either way, something is lost and something is gained. Don't get too distracted by the temptation of immediate gratification; concentrate your attention on the long-term goals, instead."
taurus,2013-01-16,"You're not content to talk with friends about safe topics like sports or the weather today. You need to get right to the magic filling that is hidden at the center of the piece of hard candy. Thankfully, you're able to move mountains to get to the juice of your emotional and sensual life. However, you needn't worry about reaching satisfaction now; just commit to a path that inspires you to get the most you can out of life."
gemini,2013-01-16,"You might not be able to sidestep your partner's intensity today. Uncomfortable issues keep popping up in different places and in different forms, no matter what you do. Paradoxically, the messenger changes while the primary message stays the same. Keep in mind that you have much to learn from anyone who can put you in touch with your passion. Staying open to your feelings may be the first step to freeing yourself from limiting thoughts."
cancer,2013-01-16,"You could become a bit obsessive about someone close to you today. Often, there are things that are better left unsaid, yet now these same unacceptable feelings might have a grand moment in the light. There's no reason to share your deep secrets casually, but remember that focusing on the truth may initiate a dramatic change. Every negative situation can be transformed by love and acceptance."
leo,2013-01-16,"Perhaps you have lost your temper in the past, followed by regrets. Ironically, you can throw a tantrum today and actually end up stabilizing a relationship in the process. Nevertheless, it's wise to tread carefully because fear of rejection may not be enough to prevent you from sharing your heart's deepest desires. Consider the consequences or you might end up disclosing something better off kept to yourself."
virgo,2013-01-16,"Expressing a strong opinion in a relationship might bring you face to face with a challenging emotional issue today; however, it isn't as dangerous as it appears. Your concern about unimportant details could make the situation more problematic than necessary. Be flexible and you can overcome the blockages that prevent you from experiencing the intimacy you seek."
libra,2013-01-16,"You are in your element when playing the role of the diplomat, looking for the sweetest possible way to deliver a difficult message. Although you want to be liked, you might have to be the bearer of bad news now. It doesn't matter; take off your velvet gloves and tell it straight, even if you offend someone. Just don't push an issue too far once you get started. Knowing when to stop is your ultimate saving grace."
scorpio,2013-01-16,"You may be redefining who you are now and what's most significant to you as attractive Venus aligns with your key planet, Pluto. Even if you feel more like a caterpillar on a leaf, you're in the process of magically morphing into a magnificent butterfly. Once you start stretching your wings, you will be well on your way to flying. Remember, anything is possible once you believe in yourself."
sagittarius,2013-01-16,"The conjunction of beautiful Venus and dramatic Pluto emphasizes the cluster of four planets in your 2nd House of Self-Esteem. Although you're uncharacteristically self-critical now, others are willing to forgive your shortcomings quicker than you are. However, they may magnify your negative feelings as their perceptions reflect back to you, forcing you to acknowledge your shadow. Shining the light of your awareness wherever conversations lead you can help put things back into proper perspective."
capricorn,2013-01-16,"You experience emotional turmoil today as vulnerable Venus aligns with potent Pluto in your sign. However, others might not even realize that you're upset. There is always a danger in keeping things to yourself because if you don't vent some of your anger or passion, it can leak out in other ways. Your reactions may upset someone now, especially if you respond to something that hasn't even been said. Laying your cards on the table stops the drama before it gets out of hand."
aquarius,2013-01-16,"A colorful vision or a vivid dream may seem so real today that you look for ways to make it come true. There is an unusual intensity to your desires, drawing you into unfamiliar landscapes. Luckily, you can receive help from your higher self if your mind is open. Don't be afraid to entertain an unrealized fantasy because others might just join your party and support you along the way."
pisces,2013-01-16,"Your social life may be a source of a significant power struggle now, even if you don't understand why the dynamics are so tense. You still might find yourself in the middle of an intense melodrama. Thankfully, self-control isn't required for you to succeed. Find ways to express your most passionate and honest feelings, since releasing the emotional pressure allows everyone to move on."
aries,2013-01-17,"Your emotions are strong but inconsistent now that the Moon is back in your excitable sign. You may think you're receiving conflicting signals from a friend or partner today, but it's probably your interpretation that is mixed, rather than what is actually said. Be careful if you're making plans that impact someone else; checking out your assumptions by asking questions is more considerate than waiting until after the fact."
taurus,2013-01-17,"Although you are feeling quite grounded today, your imagination is taking off as if it has a life of its own. You are usually quite sensible, but now you could flip between being anchored in reality and having your head in the clouds. Nevertheless, be daring! Let your enthusiasm lead you forward, but don't lose sight of the practical matters that still concern you."
gemini,2013-01-17,"You might try to avoid a deep discussion about your feelings with someone at work today. You prefer to keep conversations lighthearted, but you're less interested in clever repartee now than getting to the truth. There will be time for casual banter another day. Instead of sharing idealistic dreams, just stick to the facts. Strengthening the foundation of a relationship can have lasting value."
cancer,2013-01-17,"A memorable vision may come to you in a daydream or in your sleep, and you have a chance to touch a deep spiritual truth now if you surrender to your intuition. However, trouble stems from your unsettled feelings that add confusion to your current perspective. Don't get sidetracked by the apparent inconsistencies. Just let the day unfold naturally as you continue to explore the hidden meaning behind the events."
leo,2013-01-17,"You try to stay on a straight and narrow path today, but you may end up misleading others or they could mislead you. The confusion might be intentional or simply the result of someone jumping to an inaccurate conclusion. No matter what happens now, try to clarify facts you don't understand. If you attempt to steer someone in a wrong direction on purpose, be prepared to deal with the fallout sooner than you think."
virgo,2013-01-17,"If something is bothering you physically today, the cause of your symptoms may be elusive. Even if you are feeling great, there is potential for fuzzy thinking when it comes to a relationship. You often excel at linking a cause to an effect, but now everything seems more nebulous than usual, no matter how hard you try to find clarity. Don't get yourself overly frustrated by forcing a solution. Let the uncertainty ride for a day or two before digging for the truth once again."
libra,2013-01-17,"A friend or associate may seem overly pushy today, yet you're able to hold your ground without exerting too much effort. Your key planet Venus receives solid support from stabilizing Saturn, empowering you to take a realistic approach to relationships. You know what you want and don't need anyone else's approval now. Let others do what they must without trying to change their behavior. The only actions you can control are your own."
scorpio,2013-01-17,"The magic of love feels nearby today, along with the frustration of realizing that your current attractions are based more on illusion than reality. You can use the excitement of infatuation to spark the romantic fires, but any attempt to create a lasting basis for your feelings may be futile. Enjoy the beauty of the moment instead of attempting to bottle it for some future date."
sagittarius,2013-01-17,"You might be dealing with a struggle between connection and separation today. On one hand, your vision of having a perfect home and family life may be idyllic -- and you're eager to do whatever is required to achieve this goal. On the other hand, you can't allow yourself to grow too attached to a relationship that has the possibility of failure. Don't sabotage your chance for happiness based upon your past experiences; focus your attention on manifesting your dreams in the present moment."
capricorn,2013-01-17,"It's wise to reread something that you write today since you may not be as clear and straightforward as you think. Your words can flow off your tongue or through your keyboard in a magical manner that makes you sound more poetic than usual. This is good news if you are writing a novel, composing a song or courting a new love. But don't back down once you have expressed your truth; let your conscience be your guide."
aquarius,2013-01-17,"Your dreams seem so real now that it's difficult to know exactly what's going on. Although you may want to take a quick escape into your fantasy world, too much activity in your daily life prevents you from retreating. Nevertheless, your desire for success will likely outweigh any lack of concentration you might be experiencing. Thankfully, setting specific goals for the day can help you stay on track. If your mind wanders, gently refocus your attention on what's most important."
pisces,2013-01-17,"You have stepped into the carnival fun house and are standing in the Hall of Mirrors, where everything is distorted. Nothing is exactly as it appears now -- especially you. Your self-image is about as far from reality as it can get. Don't wear a mask -- physically or emotionally -- to cover up your own inadequacies. You are in much better shape than you think today."
aries,2013-01-18,The spontaneous Aries Moon tempts you with the delicious possibility of immediate gratification if you have the courage to express your needs. But several planets traveling through calculating Capricorn tell you to wait for a better moment to move forward with your plans. Address your realistic concerns before taking a major risk. Combine the conflicting strategies to make your dreams come true.
taurus,2013-01-18,"You're inclined to take sides in a conflict at work today, but you can be more effective if you maintain neutrality. Look ahead by visualizing the various options and use your practical outlook to convey the good in both points of view. Be smart and let truth be your guide instead of your own desires. Speak your piece and then remain quiet, letting the chips fall as they may."
gemini,2013-01-18,"Even if you're not trying to lead the pack today, you still may feel as if you are a reluctant trendsetter. You could be worried about being the first one to run into opposition because you can see obstacles ahead that others cannot. Instead of wasting energy on situations that might not manifest, just do your best and deal with the resistance if and when it arises. Your positive attitude sets a fine example for everyone else."
cancer,2013-01-18,"You feel happy when you nurture those you love, but you might do it so passionately today that you run the risk of being overprotective. Fighting another person's battles now could be more about your own issues of self-worth than being of real assistance. Unfortunately, others may ultimately resent you for smothering them, so don't attempt to control any situation that isn't your direct concern. Channel your excess energy toward taking care of your own needs first."
leo,2013-01-18,"There's no need to be overly intent on attaining satisfaction today because forcing results can leave you feeling unfulfilled and frustrated. Fortunately, rewards may come as early as next week if you just control your impulsive tendencies now. Think about others before attending to your needs. Instead of seeking the adrenaline rush from a short-lived pleasure, work toward sustaining valuable relationships at work and play."
virgo,2013-01-18,"You're motivated to give one hundred and ten percent toward your job to ensure a smoothly functioning work environment. Unfortunately, you cannot do it entirely by yourself now, even with a superhuman effort. Thankfully, you have a healthy perspective on the current situation and are quite effective in collaborating with others as long as you don't gloss over any potential problems. An ounce of prevention today really is worth a pound of cure."
libra,2013-01-18,"Although your energy level is high today, feeling so good could get you into trouble. You may attempt to suppress a strong opinion that might be offensive, only to find that someone else says exactly what you are thinking. Ultimately, your inner conflicts can mysteriously work their way out into the open even if you keep them to yourself. You might as well express yourself honestly, kindly, and with a receptive heart."
scorpio,2013-01-18,"The ardent Aries Moon stimulates the heat of passion, but your sense of propriety prevents you from casually sharing your desires. Although you want to do the right thing, your feelings might not dissipate today until you acknowledge them by shining the light of awareness on to your emotions. Thankfully, you're able to defuse an uncomfortable situation by confiding in a trustworthy companion who can help you sort yourself out."
sagittarius,2013-01-18,"There is an obvious relationship between how much of your feelings you get out into the open today and the amount of resistance you encounter over the next few weeks. Even if it's difficult, slow down and deal with your emotions. Avoiding them by quickly moving to what's next won't help you in the long run. Explore your heart to discover what you truly want."
capricorn,2013-01-18,"You can accomplish more than you think by concentrating on what's directly in front of your nose today. Avoid distractions; even if something sounds like a great idea, let it pass for now. You don't have to go out to conquer the world or lead a parade; instead, staying close to home could bring you all the acknowledgment you currently need."
aquarius,2013-01-18,"It's tempting to wag your tongue without even considering the consequences today, for whatever you think now slips through your lips without much resistance. Handling the ramifications of your words can raise serious concerns, but ultimately, you'll be better off speaking up than if you keep your feelings private. Don't worry about a worst-case scenario; getting the issues out into the open works to your advantage."
pisces,2013-01-18,"You aren't completely sure what you want to do yet, but your plan is growing clearer day by day. At least you understand what's most important now, and can start making choices based upon your priorities, instead of just flying by the seat of your pants. Be certain to consider your finances in your current decision-making process. Covering all your bases improves your chances for success."
aries,2013-01-19,"The lights seem to glow brighter today, and something you couldn't see previously is growing more visible. You're moving into a more active social cycle and yet, at the same time, you are being cautious about what you actually put on your calendar. Don't lose track of your commitments, but do something for yourself that makes you feel free as a bird. Ultimately, you will be more productive now if your choices are your own."
taurus,2013-01-19,"Although you may be looking farther into your future now, this visionary tendency doesn't mean you are less sensible than before. In fact, your back-to-basics approach is a significant part of your current healing process. Thankfully, you can have it both ways. In other words, look forward to the possibilities while fixing whatever is within your reach in the present moment."
gemini,2013-01-19,"You are open to receiving the messages that the universe sends you today. However, you might not know how to use your heightened sense of anticipation. You may vacillate back and forth, feeling open and chatty at first. One minute everyone is your friend, but then you want to withdraw when you realize that you should be more cautious about what you say. Instead of wondering what to do next, stay quiet long enough to hear the wisdom of your inner voice."
cancer,2013-01-19,"This is a weird time of year because you're inclined to dig yourself into your cave, hibernating the winter away. However, a glint of awareness sparks your soul now and sets your thoughts on the upcoming spring -- even if it's still far away. Hold on to your images of warmer emotional weather ahead. But in the meantime, give yourself permission to hide safely behind your protective walls as you work out the details of your next adventure."
leo,2013-01-19,"You may be a little overwhelmed now as friends and associates confront you with facts that you need to integrate into your plans over the next several weeks. Communication in relationships is emphasized as talkative Mercury and the willful Sun join expressive Mars in your 7th House of Companions. Although you feel confident in your ability to say what you mean, it's still difficult to put your emotions into words today. Deliberate first and then speak later."
virgo,2013-01-19,"You are entering a new phase when your behavior may be quirkier than normal -- not that anyone else necessarily knows the details about your private life. Your fantasies are growing stronger and you're eager to show everyone what you are capable of doing. But instead of taking time to offer long explanations and rationalizations, just demonstrate your competence through direct action. Don't worry about what others think today; take a risk and do something that's wonderfully weird."
libra,2013-01-19,"This can be a very positive time of year for you with both the Sun and Mercury traveling through idealistic Aquarius, a fellow Air sign. Ironically, the rational emphasis supports your natural creativity now, helping you to express yourself more spontaneously. Your current ingenuity enables you to solve problems that seemed insurmountable in the past. Don't hold back; a more playful attitude toward work could bring success if you trust in the process."
scorpio,2013-01-19,"You may start the day feeling a bit on edge because it seems as if there aren't any easy solutions for your current scheduling dilemma. But things start to fall into place and by afternoon some of the earlier stress begins to settle down. However, this can still be a tense time when your feelings don't always match what you are showing others. Pay attention to the differences between your inner and outer worlds so you can navigate your way back to a place of emotional balance."
sagittarius,2013-01-19,"Your phone is ringing and your inbox is full as all forms of interaction and communication intensify. You may travel more -- even if only locally -- because of your work or your role in the community. No matter how complicated your life becomes in the weeks ahead, don't lose sight of your own personal goals. Think as big as you want, but take small steps instead of changing everything all at once."
capricorn,2013-01-19,"You might feel as if the spotlight isn't following your every move any longer -- and this newly found anonymity is just fine with you. You can get back to your real work now, instead of being required to perform for an audience. Rediscover your natural pace during the weeks ahead while taking care of business on a very mundane level. Set priorities, stick with what's most important and you can accomplish a lot."
aquarius,2013-01-19,"The radiant Sun and trickster Mercury enter your friendly sign today, encouraging you to connect with others and express what's on your mind. You've been waiting for the right time to take action and, finally, there's no need to practice self-restraint any longer. If you're prepared to work hard for your dreams you will be pleasantly surprised by what happens in the upcoming weeks."
pisces,2013-01-19,"Unfortunately, you may find yourself tangled up in the nets of your own imagination now. But even if you thrive on the excitement of temporary chaos, amazing opportunities to smooth out the waves are on the way. Tie up as many loose ends of your life as possible while you still have time. If you take care of all the little things today, you'll be ready for the big changes ahead."
aries,2013-01-20,"Your friends probably mean well by encouraging you to spend money on yourself today, but your current financial condition might not warrant an unplanned outlay of cash. This is especially true if everyone else is more excited than you are about the potential purchase. However, jeopardizing your stability isn't an acceptable price to pay for something you don't really want anyhow. Trusting your own intuition makes more sense now than listening to the advice of others."
taurus,2013-01-20,"Members of your family or community may expect you to participate in social events now, but you have your own ideas about what's important. However, you might upset someone's delicate feelings when you share your real intentions, even though you are simply just trying to be honest. Ultimately, you need to do what works best for you. Nevertheless, a little extra kindness on your part will smooth out feathers even before they start to ruffle."
gemini,2013-01-20,"Withholding any feelings of anger may backfire today, for your unspoken negativity might still leak out. Self-restraint sounds like an intelligent strategy, but could actually make things worse now. Instead of avoiding your emotions, express them in a straightforward manner, without blaming anyone in the process. Taking full responsibility for your opinions minimizes the need for others to get defensive and opens the door to an honest exchange."
cancer,2013-01-20,"You might not want to tell your friends what you are feeling today because you are afraid of rejection. But if they are true friends, they'll hear you out regardless of what you have to say. The only relationships you can jeopardize are the ones built on false loyalty. Nevertheless, trust your intuition and don't volunteer more than is comfortable at any given moment throughout the day."
leo,2013-01-20,"Eccentric friends and family members might place unreasonable demands on you today. However, some of the problem could stem from your misinterpretation of their requests. Others may actually be unclear in their communication with you as they allow unresolved emotions to cloud their words. No matter what, a cautious response on your part is wise. It's better to avoid an argument now than to further stir up unnecessary conflict."
virgo,2013-01-20,"Don't stress out if you can't decide what you should be doing or where you should be going today. Instead of having to change directions midday because you impulsively started too soon, relax until you really know what should be next. Ironically, inaction is better now than wrong action. You'll still have sufficient time to finish the projects on your plate. Work smarter, not harder to achieve the results you seek."
libra,2013-01-20,"You may have already overcome the biggest obstacles that were holding you back, but this doesn't mean that it's all clear sailing yet. Your sense of urgency could prompt premature action now, yet it's wise to figure out what to do with your emotions before acting on them. As is often the case, creative endeavors can unlock the gates for you, thereby letting your energy flow more smoothly."
scorpio,2013-01-20,"You might think that someone is being stubborn today just to annoy you. It feels as if everyone knows which buttons to push in order to agitate you. However, keep in mind that it's not about anyone else; the only thing that's important now is how you react. You can be more in control of your own fate as long as you practice a little self-control. Turn the tables by demonstrating your willingness to establish common ground."
sagittarius,2013-01-20,"A bit of hard work doesn't scare you off today because you're eager to tackle some chores that you have been avoiding for a while. Just keep in mind that there's a slight need for caution now, since you can easily underestimate the size of the job. Having a positive attitude is a real asset, but it's not a panacea. Don't bite off more than you can chew; promise less and deliver more."
capricorn,2013-01-20,"You may overreact to your temporary lack of ambition today by relentlessly pushing even harder toward your goals. Although this overcompensation can lead to heightened productivity, you might take things too far. Even if you're pursuing a relationship, find out what the other person is feeling before climbing way out on a limb. Applying common sense to your plans prevents unneeded embarrassment. Relaxing the reins of control is a healthy alternative for now."
aquarius,2013-01-20,"Your emotional attachment to the past may motivate you to express a deeply rooted fear to someone you can trust. Just make certain your subject matter is appropriate to share before you dredge up more than you intend. Be careful not to just ride an adrenaline rush, since a bit of excitement won't make you happier in the long run, nor will it help you reach your goals. Letting go of your fantasies of the future empowers you to succeed in the present moment."
pisces,2013-01-20,"You want to have time today to explore your vivid imagination, but previous commitments require you to act in a practical manner. Let common sense dictate your choices throughout the day, even if making decisions is challenging now. Balancing work and play enables you to concentrate on the real world and still get lost in your fantasies for a while."
aries,2013-01-21,"Your mind is free to explore new ideas today, and your words are in the spotlight. Although you can jump to brilliant conclusions very quickly now, think before you speak and carefully read your email through one more time before you hit the send button. However, there's no reason to hold back once you're sure of your message. Since you have a greater impact on others than you realize, it's wise to get it right the first time. Give your waiting audience a show they won't forget."
taurus,2013-01-21,"Your thoughts may run amok today, as if they're not under the jurisdiction of your logic. But temporarily setting aside common sense can actually lead to an unconventional solution to a tricky problem. Unfortunately, your co-workers might not be willing to give your ideas a fair hearing unless you have the facts to back up your position. Do your homework and be sure to have your information in order before sharing your plans with anyone else."
gemini,2013-01-21,"The Moon's return to restless Gemini inspires your thoughts to fly around in circles, as if they are eagles spiraling on the thermals. Your performance seems easy and graceful to others, but you might need to work hard to keep up the appearance. Meanwhile, you could feel stuck as the prevailing winds won't allow you to break free. Don't waste energy struggling against the breezes now; enjoy floating around until the wind changes and gives you an opportunity to escape."
cancer,2013-01-21,"Sharing your emotions can be a challenge now, even if you're clear about how you feel. However, you sense a change coming and you aren't yet sure as to which way your mood will swing next. Thankfully, this uncertainty isn't upsetting or worrisome today as long as you are content to just wait it out before making any important decisions. In the meantime, discuss your options objectively and be open to the feedback you receive."
leo,2013-01-21,"Someone might come to you with an unusual plan today, but you aren't so quick to endorse what you consider to be a risky solution to a simple problem. You can envision alternate strategies that seem more straightforward, and you would rather exhaust these direct approaches first. Even if you're certain that your answer is the most logical one, remain open to the surprises you encounter along the way."
virgo,2013-01-21,"Your friends need you today in ways that require you to express more emotions than you prefer. Even if you're resistant to revealing your inner thoughts now, try softening enough to give others what they want. You may feel like you're just going through the motions at first, but sharing your heart is a perfect prescription to brighten your day. You might receive something beautiful in exchange for stepping outside of your comfort zone."
libra,2013-01-21,"You could find yourself in a jam today, and you're uncertain if you should ask for help or just let it ride. Imagine what you would do if you had absolutely nothing standing in your way. Then, return your focus back to your current situation. If sharing your needs can bring you any closer to your goals, then don't hesitate to say what's on your mind and just deal with the consequences as they arise."
scorpio,2013-01-21,"You may intellectualize complex emotions that normally elude description. But your intuition is operating in overdrive now, so don't be afraid to rely on it. Nevertheless, you still have to prioritize your needs or you will be pulled in so many directions that you'll just end up annoyed. However, having a clear destination in mind gives you just enough stability that you can be creative without losing your way."
sagittarius,2013-01-21,"You can talk your way out of nearly anything today, relying on your social graces to avoid conflict. Your charm and wit are working for you now in ways that surprise even you. You know what you want and are willing to ask for it. Still, you could miss a significant opportunity when it appears in your life if you aren't receptive. Being more sensitive to others helps you recognize your own path to happiness."
capricorn,2013-01-21,"It may be challenging to stay motivated today because you can discover so many fun ways to keep your mind occupied that you end up avoiding your chores. Leaving a job undone is contrary to your basic nature, since you like to take care of business before you play. However, it's time to try something different now by making pleasurable distractions your top priority for a change. The work will patiently wait for your return."
aquarius,2013-01-21,"You could be very happy today, even if there's too much happening in your life. For example, you might agree to one too many tasks and now you must find a way out of your extra commitments. Nevertheless, mischievous Mercury tempts you into thinking there's a viable shortcut you can take. However, the flirty Gemini Moon's presence in your 5th House of Fun and Games indicates that you should be able to enjoy the company of others even if you still have a job to finish."
pisces,2013-01-21,"Your thoughts are moving so rapidly now that you may not be able to keep up with your own fantasies as they overflow into your reality. But even the most original ideas don't bring you any closer to a viable solution, so it might be wise to keep the unfinished schemes to yourself for now. Even if it takes another week or so, allow plenty of time for your plans to solidify before sharing them with anyone else. Start by writing everything down that crosses your mind, and then you can make sense of it all later."
aries,2013-01-22,"You can feel quite sure of yourself, even if your energy is spread too thin. Although your current confidence may be refreshing, it might seem out of place. You know that you should take your commitments more seriously, but you have an irrepressible sense that everything is going to work out for the best. Thankfully, your intuition is probably right; letting events take their own course today could magically lead to success."
taurus,2013-01-22,"Your tendency to exaggerate today can turn every little thing you hear into an unnecessary drama. If others push you too hard, you might just let them know what you think whether it makes sense or not. Thankfully, even if your temper flares, the outcome could be better than you expect. At least, everyone will know exactly where you stand -- even if you weren't planning on sharing your thoughts. For the best results, put your opinions out into the open as gently as you can."
gemini,2013-01-22,"You're talking a mile a minute now that gregarious Mercury is receiving encouraging signals from jolly Jupiter. Even if you try to avoid the intense amount of thoughts, you cannot shut off the flow of information. You're excited and may even be in a euphoric state of high alert today. Although you don't want to miss anything, it's OK to say when you've had enough. A peaceful meditation might be just what the doctor orders to regain your balance."
cancer,2013-01-22,"A secret admirer or a spiritual adviser may be the source of good news today. You could learn something that opens your mind to an entirely different way of looking at your current circumstances. Even if you are feeling the need to stick to your original agenda, allow yourself to move beyond your present point of view and think about what's best for all involved. Adopting a more spiritual perspective creates an unconventional path to success."
leo,2013-01-22,"It's nearly impossible to keep your thoughts wrapped up inside, even if you know that it's smarter to remain quiet today. You feel as if it's your personal responsibility to bring the information you have out into the open. Although you may wonder if you are being appropriate, a friend can encourage you to talk -- and once you start, you won't want to hold anything back. Just remember that discretion has its place; there are some things better left unsaid."
virgo,2013-01-22,"Normally, you're an analytical thinker, but today your thoughts carry you far beyond your usual limitations when your key planet Mercury harmonizes with lucky Jupiter. Much to your chagrin, you might be less practical now and more philosophical in your perspective. However, it's really not necessary to apply your ideas at this time. Write down your expanded visions while they last so you can make good use of them in a few days."
libra,2013-01-22,"You want to be understood by your friends, but it's difficult to explain yourself clearly enough so others will know why you are so passionate now. You're eager to share your views on relationships, politics and global issues because talking about conceptual ideas is safer than actually revealing your feelings. Although you may be a captivating conversationalist today, be careful not to speak in such vague generalities that you lose touch with your heart."
scorpio,2013-01-22,"Meaningful relationships with friends and family offer you the encouragement you need these days. Someone special may be the harbinger of good news, which can take some pressure off more tense circumstances at home. However, opportunities might come to you that increase the complexity of your life, prompting you to wonder if it's all worth the extra effort. Don't respond too quickly; decide what to say only after thinking it through and ultimately trusting your intuition."
sagittarius,2013-01-22,"Your current circumstances may be quite intense, yet you can still rise above the difficulties now. Even if you are unsure about what to do next, you are fortunate to receive helpful direction from someone you trust. Changing your attitude may be enough to bring you closer to the goals you've set for yourself. Instead of worrying about what could go wrong today, use the power of positive thinking to progress toward your desired destination."
capricorn,2013-01-22,"It's tempting to swing into action today, assuming that if you work efficiently everything will fall into place. Luckily, your attention to details adds to your productivity. However, your eagerness to demonstrate your competence may actually be your way to cover your emotional vulnerability. Choose a trustworthy friend and share a part of yourself you don't normally let others see. Confiding in someone else could be the catalyst you need to open your heart."
aquarius,2013-01-22,"Opportunity knocks today, bringing you a chance to show off your colorful creativity. If someone comes to you with an innovative idea, it just may look good enough to pursue. Remember, joyful Jupiter is increasing the shine on the cloud's silver linings today, so everything appears better than it actually is. Nevertheless, saying yes makes sense if you have a concrete plan to reach your goal. Blending reality with the fruits of your imagination is a combination that leads to success."
pisces,2013-01-22,"Nostalgic memories may be stimulated today as a friend shares a recent dream with you. But what starts as a sweet connection can actually reopen an old emotional wound that you thought was buried long ago. Fortunately, you are being given a chance to heal, but you might be the one who has to offer forgiveness. Remember, honest dialogue is the key to a healthier relationship."
aries,2013-01-23,"Your thoughts are running ahead of your emotions today and you're eager to share your conclusions. However, it gets more difficult to speak your piece as the day wears on. It might even feel as if you have missed your chance, and expressing your pent-up anger could make things even worse. Your best option is to chill out now and patiently wait for your heart to catch up with your head. It will be easier to say what you feel rather than what you think."
taurus,2013-01-23,"You may be annoyed if reality gives you negative feedback today, but you respect what you hear from a trustworthy friend. However, you might run into a snag that would deter someone with less determination than you. Dig in your heels and don't take no for an answer now. Turn this setback into an opportunity to make your good idea even better. Your dedication to your cause is your secret weapon."
gemini,2013-01-23,"It's very frustrating if you can imagine where you want to go, but are not allowed to go there yet. You might not even feel secure enough to share your plans with anyone else now. There are many details that must be addressed before you set out on your journey, whether you're starting a relationship, a project or a vacation. Don't be in such a hurry; you are not ready to depart yet. Finalize your plans before taking the next step."
cancer,2013-01-23,"You may be limited by your own lack of confidence today rather than by any specific situation. You can be quite self-critical, but negative judgments are not the current problem. Repressed fears could be keeping you from the journey of your lifetime. Nevertheless, use this time wisely to process your insecurities without blaming anyone else. The real solutions now come from within."
leo,2013-01-23,"You might not be ready to jump into the fray yet, even if everyone else appears to be having fun. You don't like feeling separate from all the action, but you can't join in until you've met your previous obligations. You accepted the extra responsibility and now you must honor your promises before you can take on anything new. Reward yourself with something special as soon as your work is done."
virgo,2013-01-23,"You are distracted by someone's unexpected shenanigans at work today, but you may not want to become too involved. You can see right through the surface noise and understand why an unimportant issue has become a big deal. However, keep your thoughts to yourself now, even if you want to straighten everyone out by telling them what you believe they need to know. Rethink your strategy and find a route to get to where you are going without stirring up more unnecessary drama."
libra,2013-01-23,"You may run into walls today as you put yourself out there, even if your plan is a good one. Perhaps you could avoid additional opposition if you take time to prepare yourself for any possible objections in advance. Instead of rejecting the feedback you receive, accept it as an opportunity to take your idea back to the drawing board. If you don't succeed at first, dust yourself off and try again."
scorpio,2013-01-23,"Sometimes it's your job as a Scorpio to delve beneath the surface, but it may not be easy today to get the information you seek. Your probing mind has gone as far as it can, yet you still don't believe you have all the answers. If you feel stuck, slow down. Pull your thoughts back into your own private world for a while and wait until the resistance passes. There's no need to waste energy fighting an uphill battle when practicing patience is the simplest solution."
sagittarius,2013-01-23,"You may try to explain your position as clearly as you can, only to have someone negate your best ideas today. Don't doubt yourself, for a minor setback is reality's way of inspiring you toward greater excellence. Put in extra time firming up your plans and doing the research that's necessary to make your goals more concrete. Oddly enough, being in less of a hurry now might just help you arrive at your destination sooner."
capricorn,2013-01-23,"You might be more concerned with the limitations of the real world than you are with your feelings today as the reflective Moon aligns with your key planet, Saturn. Instead of blindly pushing ahead, retreat and consider what makes the most sense in the long run. Achieving success may take more time than you think. Integrity, not progress, is your best friend now."
aquarius,2013-01-23,"Your boss may be the source of trouble today, or, perhaps, you experience a setback on a current project. Don't take whatever obstacles you encounter now as signs of defeat. Instead of giving up, hold your ground. Facing the roadblocks with determination should prove whether or not your plan is a good one. The struggle might last for a few days, but you will prevail if your efforts are worthy."
pisces,2013-01-23,"It may be better to wait for others to catch up to your way of thinking today before acting on your brilliant ideas. Even if you're on a roll, something could occur now that makes you feel vulnerable, giving you a reason to re-evaluate your current direction. Don't share your plans too soon. A few days can bring a lot of changes, so see what happens before revealing too much."
aries,2013-01-24,"Your motivation to explore new territory is countered by feelings of emotional self-restraint today. Your inner voice reminds you to be sensitive to other people's needs over your own. However, all the cautionary advice in the world may not prevent you from acting on a brilliant breakthrough now if you have the chance. Just remember to temper your actions with kindness so you don't inadvertently hurt someone you love."
taurus,2013-01-24,"You may save the day by creating the ultimate plan that everyone has been waiting for from someone else. Ironically, your contribution might come at the very last minute. Nevertheless, your thinking is sound even if it's unexpected and unconventional. Expressing your ideas with clarity encourages others to support your solution. Don't be afraid to take charge; assume the role of leader until you are sure that everything is running smoothly."
gemini,2013-01-24,"You are flying at top speed yet you still feel something pulling you down today. The experience of dragging an anchor might be connected with an unpleasant memory that raises issues of self-doubt. You won't be able to go far as long as you are in denial. Luckily, you could change everything by simply being more aware of your feelings. The dead weight can be dropped instantly once you accept your past and move on."
cancer,2013-01-24,"You want to express your needs in no uncertain terms today, and you expect others to sit up and take notice. There might even be a special someone you hope to impress, prompting you to do something impulsive that is completely out of character. This spontaneous behavior could attract the attention you seek now, but perhaps not in the way you prefer. Don't try too hard; just be yourself and don't worry so much about the outcome."
leo,2013-01-24,"You want to help others now, but you prefer to do it sight unseen with the Moon visiting your 12th House of Secrets. Thankfully, you can accomplish something today that will mean a great deal to someone else without a whole lot of effort on your part. It may not seem like much to you, but your actions might bring deep healing to a loved one. Fortunately, grand gestures are not necessary; it's your attention to the details that matters most."
virgo,2013-01-24,"There's no reason to take responsibility for anyone else's crazy behavior. If someone at work does something that catches you off guard today, just try to take it all in stride. Actually, a surprise could shock you just enough to reveal a new way of doing a routine task that you hadn't previously considered. It may seem like a reach, but, ultimately, you're the only one standing in the way of your success."
libra,2013-01-24,"Your focus is being redirected toward others now while the Sun sextiles unpredictable Uranus in your 7th House of Relationships. You probably don't mind a bit of anonymity, but it may be time to examine your insecurities if you're having trouble with a lack of attention. Luckily, you could be more successful by using your talents to help someone else. There's no need to be concerned if you don't get the credit you deserve today; the spotlight will return to you soon enough."
scorpio,2013-01-24,"You might feel stuck by your previous commitments and there isn't an easy way out now. You are willing to resign yourself to do what you said you would, even if you're uncomfortable with the situation that has developed. Thankfully, everything can flip in an instant as an ingenious idea lights up your brain like a bolt of lightning. Prepare for positive change with cheerful optimism since your attitude can really make a big difference."
sagittarius,2013-01-24,"It may be difficult to fit into the standard box of a traditional relationship now as you're pulled into your own world of unique feelings. Don't be too self-judgmental because you have something very special to offer, and anyone close to you probably already knows this. If others can appreciate you for who you are, it should all work out -- but first, you must learn to love yourself."
capricorn,2013-01-24,"The moody Cancer Moon in your 7th House of Partners places you in direct touch with your feelings by attracting highly emotional people into your orbit today. You often avoid revealing your vulnerability, but you might feel destabilized enough now to open up to someone you trust. Be willing to learn more about your own inner workings by tackling a tough issue. Thankfully, a difficult situation can rapidly change into a more pleasant one if you roll with the incoming waves."
aquarius,2013-01-24,"You might be afraid that you're headed for a major conflict now, when everything suddenly improves. Don't try to control anyone's behavior because your fear of a negative outcome could actually bring it into manifestation. Thankfully, you can sidestep an unnecessary dispute today if you remember that arguing won't help you get any closer to your goals. Solve your current problem within your brilliant imagination before trying to affect positive change on the outside. The solution is within your mind's grasp."
pisces,2013-01-24,"You may be entirely safe jumping into the unknown today as long as you believe that everything will work out fine. Fortunately, you will likely have all the support you need now if you don't lose sight of what's most critical. However, your creative visualizations can only get you so far. The power of positive thought still needs to be reinforced with a concrete plan and solid effort."
aries,2013-01-25,"You already made your choice to ride the incoming waves by maintaining a positive attitude, yet you might have underestimated the power of the tides now. Don't be afraid to retreat and re-evaluate your plans before pushing against the currents. A steadier pace improves your chances of reaching your destination. Regardless of the actions of others, you have the capability to transform your love into something greater than it already is."
taurus,2013-01-25,"Your common sense reminds you to think before you speak, because it's better to get your message right the first time rather than having to start all over. Although you're not greedy, you might have trouble acknowledging your limits today. More is not necessarily better; if you have set a goal, be prepared to stop when you reach it."
gemini,2013-01-25,"Although your key planet Mercury is impeded by austere Saturn today, communication will improve later in the day. Your good idea is close to paying off if you remain persistent in your efforts. However, too much stress at work can make you less effective, so be flexible and coast for a while if you run into trouble. Resist the temptation to dig in and make a stand. Adaptability is your not-so-secret weapon, so don't be afraid to use it."
cancer,2013-01-25,"Your emotional reactions are strong today, yet you won't gain any advantage by giving up at the first sign of conflict. Neither do you need to battle against an immoveable stone wall. Your most sensible strategy is based upon consistent behavior without aggression. It may even be helpful to consciously let go of control so you can float with the flow. Calm your nerves by surrounding yourself with nature, soothing music or just good old-fashioned silence."
leo,2013-01-25,"This is a significant day for relationships and you may end up quite pleased with the outcome. However, you might need to demonstrate a bit of self-restraint or someone else could rain on your parade. The dynamics of the current situation have long-lasting ramifications; even if you feel as if you're being bent out of shape, express the love that is already in your heart. A simple act of kindness can shift the energy and make everything brighter."
virgo,2013-01-25,"A flood of brilliant ideas opens many possibilities at work today, yet you may grow frustrated because you cannot turn this magic moment into something more. If you meet resistance now, pushing harder won't bring success. Instead, ride the intellectual currents and wait for the energy to settle down before finalizing your career plans. Exploring your options enables you to make the most of the amazing opportunities knocking at your door."
libra,2013-01-25,"You have a lot of work you hope to accomplish today and you really don't want to modify your schedule. Unfortunately, too much rigidity only stirs up more conflict. You stand to gain the most by meeting others halfway and being as spontaneous as possible. Paradoxically, compromising may be the easiest way for you to get what you want now. Just make sure you don't go to the opposite extreme and become so enthusiastic about every idea that nothing gets done at all."
scorpio,2013-01-25,"Some of your current conflict stems from how you reacted to recent events. If you pursued an opportunity without overplaying your hand, you won't likely run into any problems at all. But if you made a poor decision, today's consequences might be a bit tougher to accept. Nevertheless, letting go of your old expectations clears the energy and frees you to achieve your goal."
sagittarius,2013-01-25,"Although you may be worried that your best-kept secret isn't safe now, you still could enjoy yourself while managing the situation. Today's high level of action is what you wanted, so don't waste your energy wishing that everything was less hectic. The Sun's sweet trine to auspicious Jupiter indicates that there's really a pot of gold at the rainbow's end. However, you must meet your current responsibilities before you can magically transform a tricky moment into an awesome day."
capricorn,2013-01-25,"If you have been handling the details of a project and living up to your end of the bargain, then rewards may be just around the next corner. But the clouds might not clear until later in the day, just in time for a great weekend. Meanwhile, don't fall behind in your work. Part of your current lesson is learning to live with more uncertainty. Find meaning in the present moment while also honoring your dreams for the future."
aquarius,2013-01-25,"It's hard to keep your thoughts in line today, but you're up for the challenge. Although you might not have much fun at first, don't waste energy berating yourself if something isn't working out as desired. Your maps have brought you this far but you must set them aside now to explore the uncharted territories ahead. Transform any remaining fear into courage and trust your intuition. Be optimistic about the possibilities, even if everything continues to change."
pisces,2013-01-25,"If your fantasies have hijacked your attention, someone may shock you with their criticism today, refocusing your attention back on reality. Instead of rejecting the advice you receive from others, embrace it. Just make sure you establish healthy boundaries to maintain your emotional sanity. Nurturing your confidence, not your skepticism, will guide you toward fulfillment."
aries,2013-01-26,"Love is on your mind today as the bighearted Leo Full Moon highlights your 5th House of Romance. However, you may get lost in thinking about what others want, leaving you unable to balance their needs with yours. Do whatever you can to keep your energy from bottling up. A walk outside, for instance, can shift your thoughts to nature and bring you a healthier outlook on your current situation. Widening your perspective eases your anxiety and fuels your creativity."
taurus,2013-01-26,"Today's Leo Full Moon activates your 4th House of Security, inviting you to retreat into the emotional safety of your home and family. However, the community-minded Aquarius Sun encourages you to shine your light in the real world. You might try to avoid choosing one approach over the other, but acting like a stubborn Bull doesn't get you any closer to finding a creative solution. Instead of backing yourself into a corner, just make a decision and move on."
gemini,2013-01-26,"It might feel as if you are under attack for your beliefs today, but you could be reacting to the intensity of the situation with a lack of understanding. Establishing well-defined boundaries makes it easier for everyone to know what to do. The Leo Full Moon lights up your 3rd House of Communication, indicating the value of talking about the issues now. Maintaining your position without going on the offensive is your smartest strategy."
cancer,2013-01-26,"You may be clinging to unexpressed feelings today as if they are irreplaceable treasures. However, today's Leo Full Moon brightens your 2nd House of Values, suggesting you might need to share what's bothering you in order to raise your self-esteem. When emotional intensity pressurizes your subconscious, it will release one way or another. Instead of waiting for something scary to happen, taking a proactive approach alleviates the tension and disperses unnecessary doubt."
leo,2013-01-26,"Today's Full Moon in your expressive sign adds a sense of urgency to your life that could be tough to manage. You may think that you won't have to share what's in your heart as long as your intentions are good. Unfortunately, your certainty might not be enough to overcome other people's doubts. Acting with kindness is crucial because whatever you do now has long-term consequences you cannot yet imagine."
virgo,2013-01-26,"It's a waste of time to blame yourself or anyone else today for a minor setback because nothing positive will come of your criticism at this time. Today's Leo Full Moon falls in your 12th House of Destiny, indicating that whatever has already happened cannot be undone. Instead of trying to rewrite the past, face your fear of not being in control. Although there are some things you can't change, a positive shift in your attitude can turn your day around quickly."
libra,2013-01-26,"You are an expert at making everyone else comfortable, especially with the playful Leo Full Moon shining in your 11th House of Friends. You're naturally gracious, but if you're provoked today, you may find it difficult to gloss over your anger. If you try to suppress your feelings, they will find a way to slip out, anyhow. At least if you share your concerns consciously you can package them with kindness, making the results more constructive than disruptive."
scorpio,2013-01-26,"Your tendency is to constrain the waves of emotional intensity today because you fear what might happen if you tell the whole truth. You may be overly concerned about losing face as the dramatic Leo Full Moon lights up your 10th House of Status. Unfortunately, practicing too much self-control can lead to frustration. Keep the pressures of your life in perspective by replacing negative blame with positive solutions. Be as honest as possible and you'll be fine."
sagittarius,2013-01-26,"You may want the security of a personal relationship, yet you could be unwilling to give up your freedom today with the bodacious Leo Full Moon stimulating your 9th House of Adventure. You're quick to encourage others if it helps you get what you want, but forgiving them now is tougher. Your emotions are very close to the surface, but you can still give yourself time to settle down before you say anything. State your truth clearly, but save the intensity for another day."
capricorn,2013-01-26,"You can slip into denial when your emotions grow too strong unless you have the safety net of a stable relationship. Today's Leo Full Moon in your 8th House of Deep Sharing prevents a quick escape from an uncomfortable situation. However, avoiding the heat of confrontation won't solve the problem anyway. Face your greatest fears now, especially around issues of sexuality, power and control. Meeting this emotional challenge brings the rewards of self-confidence and admiration from others."
aquarius,2013-01-26,"It feels as if your life is reaching a crescendo, yet you're afraid that an important relationship is going to fall apart. A melodrama might be unfolding as today's colorful Leo Full Moon lands in your 7th House of Partnerships. However, an intense emotional outburst may be a symptom of the profound changes occurring within your psyche. Find an acceptable way to vent your feelings while still respecting those you love."
pisces,2013-01-26,"You might be tempted to make a big deal out of doing your chores, especially if you're feeling insecure now that the showy Leo Full Moon is rattling your 6th House of Daily Routine. However, you can also inspire others to greater heights by sharing your dreams of the future. By cleverly shifting the focus you can avoid the spotlight today yet still receive the recognition you deserve."
aries,2013-01-27,"Your social life is taking off and you're ready to go for a ride. However, a voice of caution may arise from your subconscious. The attraction toward new experiences is so strong now that it will likely win, but don't just ignore your inner guidance. Respect your common sense that is reminding you to save some time to accomplish your real world objectives before returning to pursuits of pleasure."
taurus,2013-01-27,"There has been a noticeable shift in the atmosphere, moving you out of your imagination and into reality. Although you may be rightly concerned with your role in the community and your career, you still aren't ready to give up your more personal vision of the future. Allow yourself the luxury of holding on to your dreams, but make sure that you also take care of your responsibilities along the way."
gemini,2013-01-27,"You may be dreaming of far-off lands and distant galaxies today, even if there isn't a realistic way to reach these fantastic destinations. Thankfully, you don't have to go anywhere special to be happy. You can even be satisfied with a voyage of the mind, so consider reading a novel that carries you beyond your current reality or enrolling in a class that expands your worldview. You are in a growth phase now, so choose your path wisely and embark on a journey worthy of your time."
cancer,2013-01-27,"If you're involved in a deeply meaningful relationship, you still must balance your need for intimacy with an unusual amount of emotional distance. In final analysis, this uncharacteristic behavior is a secret relief now, for you often become more entangled in a relationship than you intend. Make every attempt to simply enjoy your experiences today without worrying too much about what it all means."
leo,2013-01-27,"The relationship axis of your chart continues to be in the spotlight, making it difficult to avoid romantic cues from others now. However, it's also very easy to misread the signals, setting you up for an unwanted surprise. Don't make assumptions today or you could find yourself in an emotional mess. Ask for a reality check before things go too far. Keeping the communication channels clear will help everyone to be on the same page."
virgo,2013-01-27,"You may be having unusual desires now that amorous Venus in your 5th House of Romance is aligning with eccentric Uranus. Normally, your friends don't perceive you as weird, but you do have your idiosyncrasies. You're tempted to show these hidden facets more readily now, without worrying about what anyone else thinks. Ironically, others might actually be relieved when they discover that you're not as perfect as you appear."
libra,2013-01-27,"You're at the leading edge of a creative wave now, enabling you to express ideas that have been developing in your fertile imagination. Even if you recently faced restrictions that prevented you from having fun, the landscape is shifting today and the party is arriving at your doorstep. Make the most of this playful time by simply giving yourself permission to be spontaneous and free-spirited in everything you do."
scorpio,2013-01-27,"Your emotions and logic might be engaged in an internal struggle now, yet this dance between the heart and the head can be quite constructive. It is very simple; you need to practice holding two positions simultaneously. Take the leap by acknowledging that there's absolutely nothing wrong with you and that there's no immediate solution to your divergent needs. Once you reframe your world, the pressure to act one way or the other is alleviated. Your current confusion is a spiritual gift as long as you don't try to make sense of it yet."
sagittarius,2013-01-27,"Your rational mind creates a safety net that allows you to bury your attractions so other people don't know what you are feeling. However, this won't prevent you from telling them anyway. You can turn on the charm to get whatever you desire, assuming you have the common sense to ask for it nicely. Unfortunately, the problem is that you might not even know what you want. If you're not sure, there's no reason to say anything at all. Wait until you are clear about your needs before involving anyone else."
capricorn,2013-01-27,"Re-evaluate everything you think you know because you may be overly confident about all the wrong things today. If your friends have been trying to get you to see something from their point of view, it's time to stop and listen. Don't hold on to your past assumptions and desires, since your values are changing at a rapid pace. Embrace the future and let the new you emerge."
aquarius,2013-01-27,"You feel the excitement in the air as sexy Venus connects with wild Uranus, your key planet. Although you might not actually fall in love, your senses are more receptive than usual. Don't be afraid of receiving pleasure during the weeks ahead, for you can easily invite the Goddess of Beauty into your world with simple acts of acceptance. Be nice to yourself and others will follow."
pisces,2013-01-27,"It could be very challenging to separate your real life from fantasies, now that your imagination is inspiring you so intensely. You have a special opportunity these days to express the secrets you have been hiding. Proceed with caution, for the boundary between the inner and outer worlds is quite thin, making you even more alluring and vulnerable to others. Your intuitive powers often encourage you to be more susceptible to the magic of love."
aries,2013-01-28,"You receive a blast of energy from today's fiery Leo Moon, inspiring you to do something special with your creativity. However, you may get fired up over an unimportant issue and even lose your temper if someone rubs you the wrong way. The effects of the combative Moon-Mars opposition only last a few hours, but they prompt you to stand up for your emotions. Negotiating with others will get you farther than making a unilateral decision and trying to achieve your goals all by yourself."
taurus,2013-01-28,"You may be feeling a bit out of sorts today as you try to integrate your emotions with the complex realities of the day. Thankfully, you have an unusually clear sense of how you want your day to flow. However, you might have to temporarily change your direction because of on-the-job demands. Let go of your long-term goals while you respond to more immediate obligations. You can return to your original agenda once the pressure eases and things settle down."
gemini,2013-01-28,"It's a busier-than-normal Monday, even for you whimsical Twins who do so well with a variety of options. In fact, your dilemma now is whether to engage in several unrelated fun activities for a short amount of time each, or to pick just one special project that could fill most of your day. Fortunately, either way works equally fine if your heart is in it. It's not crucial to be productive today as long as you're doing what you love."
cancer,2013-01-28,"Your friends and co-workers enjoy your company when you choose to come out of your shell. Fortunately, you feel upbeat today and are ready to indulge yourself and your loved ones. However, you may become so involved with the day's events that you temporarily forget about more pressing issues. Counting your blessings is a sweet idea, as long as you don't neglect the promises you made along the way."
leo,2013-01-28,"The reflective Moon is back in your sign today, placing you directly in touch with your own cycle of renewal and rejuvenation. Listen to your co-workers who seem to have your best interests at heart because they are like spirit whisperers, quietly guiding you toward your next move. Fortunately, having the support of trusted allies further improves your chances for happiness."
virgo,2013-01-28,"You may have some old business to finish before you can start with this week's work. You might feel out of sync, but this uneasiness will dissipate if you stop analyzing the current situation and just tie up loose ends the best you can. Thankfully, the Moon's shift into your practical sign later in the day helps you get back in touch with your center and offers a comfortable sense of belonging."
libra,2013-01-28,"Your friends can revitalize you now and may even bring a bit of fun or romance into your life. But you might become so tempted by the idea of escaping your responsibilities that you actually try to ignore them. Unfortunately, previously made commitments won't go away, causing you to feel guilty about your attitude. The sooner you meet your obligations, the sooner you'll be able to kick up your heels."
scorpio,2013-01-28,"Something you want to say could be stuck in your throat today and your goal is to spit it out. Normally, after a period of reticence, you would put on your hard hat, dig in to do the work and express what you need to get off your chest. However, the problem might not be resolved by direct intervention now. It doesn't matter how others see you; it's about how you feel. Happily, speaking the truth is all you need to do; you may not have to fix anything at all."
sagittarius,2013-01-28,"This past weekend's experiences may have given you good reason to be spiritually uplifted. Perhaps you feel like you are doing better now, after an uncomfortable visit into the watery world of emotions. Today, you're finally ready to fly. There's no time to waste, so get ready for the action. The pace picks up, the audience arrives, and you are the star of the show."
capricorn,2013-01-28,"Digging into the mysteries of a relationship may dredge up a difficult issue now that the reflective Moon is in your 8th House of Deep Sharing. You might try to sidestep emotional conflict, especially at work, but sticking with the conversation can lead to a major breakthrough. Living with integrity in your feelings empowers your efforts and increases your productivity."
aquarius,2013-01-28,"Something odd is happening today and you might not be able to grasp its meaning. The feeling is too important to ignore, but as of yet, it's still somewhat unformed. The Moon, now visiting your 7th House of Partners, reflects light on the issue as you listen to your spouse, lover or close friend. Don't push for complete resolution since it may take another few days for everything to come together. The other shoe will fall in time if you just let it."
pisces,2013-01-28,"You stand to gain clarity by putting your daily chores in order today and making yourself a list of things to do. You might be tempted to perform a major production to show off your work, yet it's really nobody's business but yours. Instead, be as efficient as possible and get as much done as you can without making a fuss. By the end of the day you can feel proud of a job well done."
aries,2013-01-29,"Even the unimportant things can be annoying today, especially if they are the result of careless thinking. Unfortunately, you may be in a hurry and judge others harshly if they can't keep up with your pace. However, practicing patience helps your day flow smoothly and makes everything run more efficiently in the long run. Remember, not everyone is as fast as you."
taurus,2013-01-29,"There isn't a lot of room for frivolous activities today; however, a bit of fun isn't out of the question. You are eager to temporarily set aside your responsibilities, especially if you believe that you can learn something from an extracurricular experience. Find out in advance how much time you need to allow for play so you can finish up your chores later. It will be easier to escape for a while if you already know that you have your bases covered."
gemini,2013-01-29,"You might not be the most meticulous worker in the world, yet you can move very quickly once you start a job. However, you may put extra attention toward the details today if you are trying to impress someone, especially your boss. But your work could still fall short of other people's expectations, even if your intentions are honorable. Nevertheless, don't be too self-critical; just do the best you can and move on to what's next."
cancer,2013-01-29,"You may do better today if you schedule your activities in advance, rather than flying by the seat of your pants. Attend to your commitments early on so you can also make time to get in touch with your inner self through prayer, meditation, or meaningful conversations with friends. Meeting your obligations is important, but don't be so focused on the clock that you miss a truly wonderful opportunity to connect with your heart."
leo,2013-01-29,"Make time to catch up on financial matters today since your mental acuity is even sharper than usual. However, the best application of your skills isn't just to pay bills or balance your accounts. The issues are currently bigger, so sit back and reassess what's of most value to you. If you must make a choice about allocating funds now, use your resources in the most practical way possible."
virgo,2013-01-29,"You might feel somewhat uncomfortable with your irrational mood swings today as the emotional Moon visits your analytical sign. Avoid any tasks that require high levels of concentration, for you may not be able to prevent your mind from wandering now. Even if you want to take the day off, you're unwilling to disappoint those who depend on you. However, scheduling short breaks throughout the day improves your ability to focus on the work at hand."
libra,2013-01-29,"It's becoming harder every day to contain yourself, but you're probably not quite ready to let others know your feelings yet. Ironically, keeping your emotions to yourself now can heighten your spiritual awareness -- as long as you don't slip into denial about what's occurring. Try not to succumb to external pressures; you'll know exactly when to act if you trust your own intuition more than anyone else's advice."
scorpio,2013-01-29,"Spending time with your friends and associates today offers the change of pace you seek, but don't try to micromanage your social activities. Instead of wasting time by attempting to create a memorable event, stay flexible without assuming control of the situation. Ultimately, you have more fun and are more effective today when you are acting spontaneously, instead of working from a script."
sagittarius,2013-01-29,Attempts to accomplish too many things all at once today could lead to doing a poor job at all of them. Tread lightly in all of your interactions because understating your responses is the most efficient use of your energy now. Just take care of each problem as it pops up in a calm and collected manner. Your enthusiasm suddenly returns when others recognize how well you are handling a complicated situation.
capricorn,2013-01-29,"There are powerful forces at work today, yet they may be hiding behind the scenes so you can't see them directly. Your personal proverb du jour might be ""out of sight, out of mind,"" but, ultimately, this isn't the smartest strategy. Your tendency is to overlook minor details now, but a small thing could be the catalyst that turns your day around. Instead of jumping from one task to another, stick with each one until you are sure that the energy has run its course."
aquarius,2013-01-29,"Consider the potential benefits of working in close collaboration with a partner now, whether you're starting a new endeavor or simply doing a project around the house. Another person can bring important information or an interesting perspective to your work. However, you may be so quick to criticize the contributions of others today that you shut them up before you hear what they have to say. Don't be judgmental or you might miss out on a really great idea."
pisces,2013-01-29,"You may feel as if everything you do today falls short of other people's expectations. But if someone is highly critical of your actions, he or she might not understand you or your behavior. Rather than responding as an unappreciated victim, take time to carefully explain your intentions. Even if you're going over familiar territory, it's healthier to share your hurt feelings instead of hiding them. Starting an honest dialogue provides an opportunity to clear the air once and for all."
aries,2013-01-30,"You are confronted with the realization that your long-term goals may not be supported by the current circumstances. Nevertheless, you're tempted to set your throttle at warp speed and ram your way through the restraints. However, this type of impulsive strategy is foolhardy now. Don't push; instead, try to understand what reality is showing you. Once you learn that lesson, the stress will begin to dissipate and the path ahead will clear."
taurus,2013-01-30,"Your emotions can get in the way today if someone blocks your progress, but the reasons for your intense feelings might not be apparent to you yet. Resist making any judgments now because it may take a few days to fully comprehend what's going on. Life is somewhat unstable at the moment and it makes sense to wait until the turmoil settles. Take your time and get it right instead of blindly pushing forward."
gemini,2013-01-30,"You may feel uncharacteristically pessimistic today, but nothing is as impossible as it seems. Thankfully, the emotions that are holding you back can also contain the seeds for your future progress. Don't accept defeat under any circumstances, even if your confidence is waning. Remember, your current actions set the stage for the transformations ahead."
cancer,2013-01-30,"It feels like you don't have enough of what you need today. Although your problem could be a lack of resources, it might also be your self-esteem that's in short supply now. Whatever is troubling you, don't allow yourself to grow discouraged; the current difficulties are not about failure. This is an excellent chance to prove yourself by gathering your strength and making the best of what you have."
leo,2013-01-30,"Even if significant issues are already developing at home, your current actions still have major consequences over the weeks ahead. Consider the work that you must do; if you're trying accomplish too much, you may be forced to let some things go. Make the necessary adjustments now by taking cues from reality before it's too late. The sooner you act, the easier it will be to lighten your load."
virgo,2013-01-30,"Your reliable common sense helps you to remember what is most important now. Even if something at work isn't going as well as you wish, you can still make a smart decision today that enables you to stay on your chosen path. Be clear about your intentions and focus on your goals. Your confidence in your own abilities is currently your most valuable asset."
libra,2013-01-30,"Most areas of your life seem to be moving along quite well, but you could face conflicts now between what you want to do and the amount of money you make. Someone close to you may act impulsively and irresponsibly, adding to your emotional stress. Your innate ability to roll with the uncertain circumstances is your best defense. Stay flexible, hold on to your sense of humor and you'll move through this time with grace."
scorpio,2013-01-30,"Your temptation now is to follow the vision of your most idealistic future, even if it's totally unrealistic. However, you must make some changes in your plans as your needs evolve with the shifting tides. But it doesn't make sense to alter too much at once since you cannot afford to destabilize your life. Start making small yet meaningful adjustments so that you can reach your dreams."
sagittarius,2013-01-30,"You manage to keep a smile on your face, even when you encounter difficult situations. Although you have several supportive allies, it's easy to doubt yourself now. But this is not a smart time to quit; if life seems overwhelming, remember that Saturn the Tester is only giving you a wake-up call. Taking a spiritual retreat may be all that you need to regain your footing. Do whatever is necessary to ground yourself for the changes ahead."
capricorn,2013-01-30,"It's all too easy to acknowledge your own weaknesses today while the radiant Sun squares your key planet, sobering Saturn. Unfortunately, you might judge yourself harshly; it's frustrating if you don't match up to your ideal. However, this period of testing isn't happening because you're not good enough; it's because you are being so hard on yourself. For now, just take note of where reality doesn't meet your expectations. Wait a few days before reassessing your goals and then make whatever improvements you can to step up your game."
aquarius,2013-01-30,"Paradoxically, it's easier to feel free if you can accept the limitations being placed on you now. Instead of trying to eliminate all boundaries, learn to work within the safety net they provide. Don't attempt to push the edges of the envelope today. Restrain yourself just enough to maintain the status quo. Even if you're facing a difficult challenge, rise to the occasion and show what you can do."
pisces,2013-01-30,"A highly restrictive situation may prevent you from stepping over your limits, even if you aren't conscious of what's holding you back now. Stop worrying about what could fall apart or what might not work. Instead, focus singularly on your responsibilities. Today won't be the most relaxing day, but you can turn it into one that is quite productive with just a bit of serious intention and sincere follow-through."
aries,2013-01-31,"You are drawn into stressful relationship dynamics, both at home and at work, as the Moon visits your 7th House of Companions. However, your emotions may not be on the same page as those of your partner or coworker. Unfortunately, you might place roadblocks between yourself and intimacy because you're afraid of losing your independence. Instead of resisting your fears, get them out into the open where their power dissipates once and for all."
taurus,2013-01-31,"The Moon's presence in your 6th House of Work reflects your need to know you are doing a valuable service. Nevertheless, there is a part of you that would prefer to skip out on your responsibilities and indulge in pleasurable activities instead. However, as a stubborn Bull, it takes a lot to pull you off course; even if you want to relax, your unwavering determination can help keep you on track to reach your destination on time."
gemini,2013-01-31,"You may be motivated to express your creativity in original ways today, but it's still hard to set practicality aside in the name of spontaneity. Nevertheless, your sense of responsibility won't likely be strong enough to shut down your free-spirited behavior. It might be helpful to eliminate extraneous noise by minimizing your time online and postponing unnecessary meetings. You have a better chance of accomplishing your goals if you can hear yourself think."
cancer,2013-01-31,"You might not feel very adventurous today as the Moon moves through your 4th House of Home and Family. But seclusion can be problematic, especially if you need to play a leadership role at work or in the community. Don't waste time dreaming about your escape because you probably won't go through with it, anyhow. Instead, demonstrate your maturity by doing the right thing now and fulfilling your obligations."
leo,2013-01-31,"It's all about diplomatic communication today as five planets move through relationship-oriented Air signs, making what you say less important than how you say it. However, you have the capability to turn your dreams into reality now, so you must be careful when sharing your fantasies with anyone else. Take time to consider your audience and fine tune your delivery; concentrate on your goal and stay true to your heart."
virgo,2013-01-31,"You may seem very determined to get whatever you want today, but you must first overcome your timidity and ask properly. The emotional Moon in your 2nd House of Self-Worth can give you a sense of firm resolve, but your actions might not back up your intentions. If you find your mind wandering throughout the day, just gently bring your focus back on point and try again."
libra,2013-01-31,"Tender feelings rise up to the surface as the gracious Libra Moon travels through your 1st House of Personality today. You are highly sensitized to the subtle emotional energy spreading through your environment, and you're aware of the impact that your reactions have on others. As helpful as you are, don't forget to take care of yourself, too. You won't be any good to anyone if you don't pay attention to your needs first."
scorpio,2013-01-31,"You might feel somewhat discouraged today as the Moon visits your 12th House of Escapism. It's hard to get much done if you're not motivated to interact with anyone else. You don't want to be fully involved with the outer world and are tempted to withdraw into the hidden recesses of your imagination. Do what you must to get by, but don't shut off your dreams now just because they don't easily fit into reality. Remember, indulging your fantasies is a wonderful way to explore all the possibilities ahead."
sagittarius,2013-01-31,"Everything seems to run smoothly today, helping to soothe any lingering tensions. Don't worry about trying to resolve all the differences of opinion; just remember that being kind and considerate relieves the building pressure. Your current strength is reinforced by the fair-minded way in which you deal with others, even when you don't agree with them. It's more important to be a part of the community now than being on the winning side."
capricorn,2013-01-31,"It's challenging to shake off the stress these days, especially if someone is pushing your emotional buttons. Still, you appear to continue acting gracefully even in a difficult situation. Thankfully, you're able to hide your tension for a while longer, enabling others to feel more at ease. Fortunately, your own anxiety is ameliorated when everyone else finally settles down."
aquarius,2013-01-31,"Even if serious responsibilities continue to multiply, today's peaceful Libra Moon lightens things up. Although the source of your concerns won't likely disappear, taking a more spiritual approach to very real problems certainly helps. There's no reason to upset the applecart; for now, just try to go with the flow. Be smart and save your energy for when you really need to take a stand."
pisces,2013-01-31,"There are complex emotional waves washing through your mind now, challenging you to balance them with more practical issues. Unfortunately, it's difficult to find your rhythm and maintain the pace long enough to accomplish your goals. Listen to your inner voices as you carry on with your normal routine. The discomfort will settle soon, leaving you enriched by the experience."
aries,2013-02-01,"You're not interested in making life more difficult for anyone now as seeking peaceful solutions to ongoing problems is high on your list. Nevertheless, you are still likely to react if someone tests your limits by pushing you too far. If necessary, defend your territory, but you can show your real strength by trying to establish common ground instead."
taurus,2013-02-01,"You have a lot to do now, and part of a sensible strategy is to avoid being overwhelmed by all the details. Concentrate on being as productive as possible today while the Moon is still in your 6th House of Work. Advanced planning plays an important role in your current drive for efficiency. But give yourself enough time to rest between tasks in order to sustain your energy throughout the day."
gemini,2013-02-01,"There are big changes on the horizon, so it's doubly important to keep your eyes on your long-term goals. Conserving your energy helps to ensure success; if you scatter too many seeds you may exhaust yourself trying to keep up with your commitments. The fruits of your patience will pay off if you don't try to do everything all at once."
cancer,2013-02-01,"A little problem at home can turn into a bigger one today, especially if you believe that ignoring it will make it go away. Don't bury your head in the sand; instead, face the circumstances head-on by considering all available options. Choose the best course of action, but remember that it's not necessary to forge new roads where none are needed. Casting light on the issue can go a long way toward enabling you to discover a lasting solution."
leo,2013-02-01,"The pace of your life is already quickening, bringing you a taste of excitement and great potential for change. However, it's not useful to push your agenda on to others yet. Instead, you can make the best of the present moment by listening carefully and responding graciously. You have more time than you realize to prepare for future opportunities."
virgo,2013-02-01,"Exploring the source of your anxiety can pay off in the days ahead. You have been busy putting the pieces in place as you mapped out your long-term goals with cautious determination. Now, as your adrenaline begins to stir, you may grow overly concerned about the execution of your plan. Run through it one last time in your mind and then let go because your attention is needed in the present moment."
libra,2013-02-01,"Sometimes you are accused of indecision, but that's not what's happening for you now. It's just that you are acutely aware of the importance of the decisions you're facing today. Don't worry about anyone pressuring you to hurry up and make a choice; go ahead and do your Libra thing of weighing all the options before you make your move. You're the only one who can know when it's time to tip the balance one way or the other."
scorpio,2013-02-01,"Sometimes you feel very secure knowing more than you share, but the situation could be reversed today. You may actually be missing an important piece of information. However, don't get too concerned; it's likely that no one is purposefully withholding anything from you. Ask the right questions and you should receive the answers you need. Just remember that some things are meant to remain a mystery for a reason."
sagittarius,2013-02-01,"Imagine that you are hanging out with a bunch of good friends and sharing your wildest dreams with them. Gaining clarity on these visions can be useful now because they might just come true. Naturally, it's not quite that simple, but you do have the potential today to lay a foundation for your future by visualizing your goals. Don't waste this moment on meaningless fantasies. Be as conscious as possible and prepare to step into the next chapter of your life."
capricorn,2013-02-01,"You might be feeling uneasy today as you look to the future with uncertainty. Ironically, you're confident about your goals; your lack of clarity is more about how to proceed to reach them. You may have to take on extra work to make ends meet, which can distract you from your primary destination. Be flexible in your planning as you respond to the inevitable changes. If necessary, you'll have time enough in a few weeks to pick back up where you left off."
aquarius,2013-02-01,"Your world is about to be rocked as charming Venus slips into your futuristic sign today. Your social life improves, love comes your way and your creativity skyrockets. Although this pleasurable transit feels wonderful, you could end up digging yourself out of a pile of trouble unless you keep your desires under control. Don't exhaust yourself by attempting to take on too much at once; you can go farther and last longer by maintaining a cooler and slower burn."
pisces,2013-02-01,"Energetic Mars shifts into sensitive Pisces today, blasting your emotions into orbit. However, compassion is one of your greatest strengths and it's time to express this highest form of love. But you need to move carefully or you could get swallowed up by someone else's pain or misfortune. Taking the time to develop a spiritual practice is not selfish; it's essential for your health."
aries,2013-02-02,"You're better off keeping your most intense feelings to yourself now that your key planet Mars is traveling through your 12th House of Secrets. Instead of creating a lot of fanfare about a new project or interest, quietly finish up old business because it may take longer than you expect. But don't be hard on yourself if your progress is slower than you wish. Setting a steady pace and sticking to it is more important than reaching your goal today."
taurus,2013-02-02,"Success seems within your reach now that enriching Venus is visiting your 10th House of Public Life. Exciting opportunities encourage you to believe that fame and fortune are just around the next corner. But be careful if your current life circumstances are not aligned with your goals. Complications make you nervous, tempting you to take a risk to place yourself back on a path that leads toward your desired destination. Don't push too hard for change; let things unfold organically to incur the least amount of stress."
gemini,2013-02-02,"You may feel as if you need to re-evaluate your career objectives and readjust your priorities. The current transit of energetic Mars traveling through your 10th House of Profession motivates you to stretch beyond your comfort zone to make something positive happen at work. If you let this chance slip by without trying to better your position in the world, you could regret it. On the other hand, you might see encouraging results very soon if you get started right away."
cancer,2013-02-02,The next few weeks can give you the emotional boost you need. It's not that you are overflowing with energy; the effects of assertive Mars in your 9th House of Big Ideas are more subtle than that. You're comfortable enough with yourself now to hold on to any position that demonstrates your integrity. Don't let anyone sidetrack you while you're following your heart.
leo,2013-02-02,"Although you may not be in denial, a situation close to home could seem better than it actually is today. You might want to gloss over criticism that you receive from a good friend or family member. But don't be cavalier; you cannot afford to screw this up. Listen carefully and take any feedback now as constructive guidance rather than as a sign of defeat. A simple change in attitude can be enough to turn things around."
virgo,2013-02-02,"Concentrate on a project today that you recently let slip through the cracks. Remind yourself of your achievements as you re-establish new goals. But instead of trying to make big changes on your own, involve others in your process. There is not a moment to waste; it's time to get in gear with or without the support of your friends. The good news is that you can accomplish nearly anything now if only you put your mind to it."
libra,2013-02-02,"Your creative phase continues for a few more weeks, even if the energy is already beginning to shift. You may feel pressure to make money from your artistic pursuits, but you're not quite ready to cash in your chips yet. In the meantime, explore ways to take what you already started and make it last longer. Establishing new routines in your daily life can help, but avoid the dullest ones that take the joy out of life."
scorpio,2013-02-02,"You are brimming over with energy now that your planetary ruler Mars is marching through your 5th House of Self-Expression. You are highly creative in your thinking, though this isn't necessarily apparent to anyone else today. Concentrate on your internal world rather than external circumstances. Inspiration is returning to your imagination and you could begin to feel more emotionally in touch with your dreams. Make time to play; relaxing a bit may be the catalyst you need to feel even more revitalized."
sagittarius,2013-02-02,"Stress arises today from the judgments that others may make about your commitment to caring for those you love. Even if you act responsibly, your efforts might not be enough to satisfy everyone. Thankfully, somehow you can keep up with your busier-than-normal schedule and still have personal time for yourself. It's just that you have some deep thinking to do that makes you want to escape. Before you sneak off on a one-way, late-night flight to the tropics, deal with the source of your discomfort first."
capricorn,2013-02-02,"Spending extra time to fully prepare for the upcoming changes in your social life is a wise move now. Remember, no matter how ready you are, there still will be surprising obstacles to overcome. Unexpected twists and turns could surface in the coming weeks -- as if reality is teaching you how to handle curve balls being thrown your way. Others will appreciate your efforts if you simply do the best you can at hitting it out of the park."
aquarius,2013-02-02,"You're relieved with the recent cosmic changing of the guard; pushy Mars has left your sign and is now heading for the open seas of softhearted Pisces. Meanwhile, friendly Venus is visiting social Aquarius for a three-week visit that brings a smile to your heart. Your problems won't be solved overnight, but they may be much easier to handle now if you take a lighthearted approach. Open your heart to the love that is all around you."
pisces,2013-02-02,"Your imagination is buzzing today, but you're not content to just lose yourself in fantasies; you want to seize the day now that impulsive Mars is visiting your sign. Spend time exploring ways to turn your dreams into actions or you might end up feeling frustrated with your inability to communicate your amazing visions to others. Remember, developing your ideas is just the first step; you must execute your plan in order to be successful."
aries,2013-02-03,"You try to express your emotions today, but are tempted to filter out the difficult feelings by withholding them from everyone else. Secrets are being kept -- either by you or from you. Resist the temptation to remain quiet just to avoid discomfort. And if you sense that you don't have all the facts, dig harder until you unearth whatever it is that you need to know. The truth will set you free."
taurus,2013-02-03,"Others are making demands that pull you in too many directions and you just cannot do everything being asked of you now. You really want to say yes to everyone, but reality has a different idea. Don't waste too much energy trying to overcome that which can't be changed; limit your concentration to what matters the most. The tide will shift soon, allowing you to regain control of your destiny."
gemini,2013-02-03,"You can use all the logic you want to subdue the needs of your heart, but it's not going to work today. Although you are often able to sweet-talk anyone into anything, you may be taking yourself too seriously now to turn on the charm. Your irrational desires have a life of their own. Instead of trying to act on your current emotions, just sink into them for a while. Wait until the energy lightens up before sharing your feelings with someone you trust."
cancer,2013-02-03,"Your attempts to establish boundaries in your current relationships create stress today. You may be lured into the hazy territory between friendship and romantic love, even if the other person isn't fully aware of your feelings. Emotional currents can stir up confusion and loss of direction now, so focus on long-range goals and guide your life accordingly. Play it safe and state the rules up front so there are no misunderstandings later on."
leo,2013-02-03,"Tensions abound as you struggle to control your feelings during a family conflict. However, denying what's in your heart now only adds to your frustration. As difficult as it may be, try to engage your emotions fully today while remaining detached from the outcome. Do everything you can to express your opinions in the present moment, but stay open to whatever happens. Hopefully, this strategy enables you to improve any situation without setting yourself up for disappointment."
virgo,2013-02-03,"You may not be your normal rational self today and your emotions could get the best of you. Regardless of your current circumstances, be aware of how your intuition isn't necessarily supported by your intellect now. This dichotomy can be confusing, but no final decisions need to be made yet. Accepting the differences between your thoughts and your feelings lessens your anxiety and allows you to ultimately arrive at the best possible choice."
libra,2013-02-03,"You're motivated to defend someone's right to artistic freedom today -- and, it might even be your own. It doesn't really matter if you like the creation; you're just attracted to the idea of being able to express a unique style, whether it is acceptable to others or not. Although you aren't necessarily inclined to compromise now, remember you don't have to push so hard to make your point, either. Relying on your legendary charm improves your chances of being heard."
scorpio,2013-02-03,"It can be tricky to find a place where you feel secure enough to share your current concerns. Things at home or within your family may be tense and you're not able to sustain your current position much longer. However, once you overcome the inertia of fear and voice your truth, the stress begins to alleviate. Clearing the air allows everyone to feel better no matter what unfolds next."
sagittarius,2013-02-03,"It may feel as if something important is coming to an end today; the process has taken you as far as it can. Now it's time to dream about your future possibilities, even if fantasy won't satisfy you for long. If you communicate your vision in a manner that is understandable to others, then you have the potential to reach your goals. But let the old cycle run its course and come to its logical conclusion first."
capricorn,2013-02-03,"Your most valid ideas may be tested today as you come into contact with friends or associates who have a very different perspective than you. You might be resistant to what they are saying, or they could disagree with your point of view. Either way, it's up to you to prevent the energy from getting stuck. The situation just might resolve amicably if you can listen without feeling the need to prove yourself right. Choosing cooperation over competition now gives everyone the chance to be a winner."
aquarius,2013-02-03,"You're typically comfortable in your own skin and in touch with the purpose of your life. However, you might question your own motives today as you try to get yourself out of a tight spot. You may have to mediate a conflict, but your sympathies can affect which side you take. It's best to hold a neutral position if you are going to accomplish what you initially set out to do. Your objectivity comes in handy at the most interesting times."
pisces,2013-02-03,"Your current flourish of creativity originates from your own imagination. You're often comfortable with the spiritual dimensions of dreams, compassion and art. Although you want to get to the facts today, you're still drawn to the metaphysical realms. Just make sure you pay attention to what's real and recognize the boundary between this world and other ones. Instead of unwittingly slipping into unrealistic fantasies now, consciously pick the most practical one and make it real."
aries,2013-02-04,"Your behavior may be misinterpreted today as your key planet Mars aligns with fuzzy Neptune, making it difficult to plan ahead. You need to take other people's perspectives into consideration before you initiate action, yet this process may take longer than you prefer. Instead of pushing for resolution, ease up and let the events take their own course. Enjoy the magic of your current sense of timelessness before you have to return to reality."
taurus,2013-02-04,"You might still be recovering from a recent setback, but now it seems as if the pendulum is swinging in the other direction. Although you may be making progress, you aren't as sure of yourself today. Instead of stubbornly holding on to your goals, float along for a while and just see what happens. Don't judge yourself harshly if you are considering a change of plans. Trust your intuition over the facts."
gemini,2013-02-04,"It may be difficult to accomplish a lot today because you're more inclined to spend your time wandering around in your dreams now than paying attention to your current responsibilities. You can skillfully bend the truth with your actions, but there still could be a wide gulf between your fantasy life and what you show to others. If you don't stretch reality too far, you have a good chance of tap-dancing your way through the day."
cancer,2013-02-04,"Somehow you seem to know exactly what's going on as information about your future comes to you through your dreams. Don't ignore your intuition today because it enables you to touch a deep spiritual truth. However, you must willingly surrender your logic and accept any inconsistencies that arise in your imagination now -- even if they add confusion to the picture. Let the story unfold naturally and figure out the meaning later."
leo,2013-02-04,"You think you can get by without the details now, therefore you're more willing to fill in the missing information yourself. Although it appears that someone purposefully misleads you today, it could just be a case of a simple misunderstanding. Unfortunately, your vision may not be the same as someone else's, so make it your business to discuss anything that seems to be in conflict. Remember, you don't have to prove yourself right; cooperation is more useful than competition."
virgo,2013-02-04,"It's difficult to work with someone who is lost in dreams rather than sharing your sense of practicality. Your co-workers might actually believe that they can wish their way out of a difficult situation, but you know that escape isn't that simple now. However, it's crucial to keep an open mind while interacting with others because some solutions come from the imagination and are not the result of logic."
libra,2013-02-04,"Unusual physical sensations stir up fears today if you are worried about the underlying cause of any symptoms. Usually, you can maintain a balanced perspective when it comes to your health. But now -- even if you're feeling fine -- it's hard to wrap your mind around what's happening. Don't stress yourself out by attempting to force a premature solution. Get professional advice if you think there's reason for concern. Otherwise, let the ambiguity resolve in its own time without giving it more energy than it's worth."
scorpio,2013-02-04,"You could be enamored with someone today as you are attracted to an ideal picture of love. Unfortunately, reality isn't likely to live up to the perfection of your fantasy. Although infatuation can spark romantic fires, your attempts to turn feelings into a lasting relationship now might be futile. Nevertheless, allow for the possibility of being surprised. Either way, enjoy the pleasure of the present moment without trying to sustain it."
sagittarius,2013-02-04,"You may be stuck in the paradox between your desire for peace at home and the frustration of lingering negative emotions. You're willing to do your part to create a harmonious environment, but it's not wise to become too attached to an unrealistic goal. Be careful; you could inadvertently sabotage your plan by hesitating when you really need to jump right in. Thankfully, you should do fine just by improvising as you go along."
capricorn,2013-02-04,"You are quite charming today as you express your intentions through poetic words rather than concrete actions. Unfortunately, this dreamy state of mind may not be very useful if you need to communicate specific information. It's not that your thinking is flawed; it's just that you are better off now telling a story or singing a song. Carefully consider your audience before delivering your message."
aquarius,2013-02-04,"You gain confidence when you know all the rules of the game because then you can choose which ones might be worth breaking. However, you're not particularly comfortable with uncertainty, especially when it concerns money issues. You are challenged today because you don't have the facts you need to make a financial decision. Your natural tendency might be to fly by the seat of your pants. Nevertheless, it's wiser to wait a few days before making your move."
pisces,2013-02-04,"It's nearly impossible to know how others see you today because your self-image can be quite distorted by the shape-shifting Mars-Neptune conjunction in your imaginative sign. You might attempt to hide your inner turbulence, thinking that your day will be easier if others are unaware of your anxiety. However, the truth is that revealing your vulnerability could open the door to deeper friendships and increased intimacy."
aries,2013-02-05,"Patiently waiting for a better time to take action isn't your normal style, but you might consider a more passive stance now as the energy shifts. However, this doesn't mean doing nothing. Instead, retreat just enough to take care of your own needs before heading out to change the world. Even if you have big plans, you don't have to share more than is absolutely required until you are ready."
taurus,2013-02-05,"Although your antennae extend into the social sphere today you might not be ready to make any definite plans yet. You just know that you want to spend more time with friends and your community now that interactive Mercury is gallivanting through your 11th House of Networking. You may not have sufficient information to plan your day in detail. Playing it by ear isn't as scary as you might think, so don't make any commitments until you have more clarity."
gemini,2013-02-05,"You may be unwittingly building your castle on shifting sands now. Even if you are creating a strong foundation that can withstand change, it's still critical to know that you will be steadily supported in your work. Focus your attention on re-evaluating your motivations and beliefs to make certain they are in tune with your current actions. Having faith in yourself makes it easier for others to believe in you, too."
cancer,2013-02-05,"You might think that you have the ability now to absorb data directly from your environment as if you were lying on a beach and soaking in the sunshine. Overt action is not needed today; instead, use your intuition. Have confidence that your instincts are leading you in the right direction. If you're experiencing doubt, trust that feeling, too; it may be wise to wait until you are more certain about what you want to do next."
leo,2013-02-05,"Unfamiliar emotional territory can be intriguing today, yet you might be too busy to explore something that distracts you from a project. Ironically, surrendering to your imagination is an important learning experience, even if it doesn't help your productivity. Don't worry if you're lured off track for a while. Instead of trying to justify your behavior, enjoy your adventure into the land of fantasy while it lasts."
virgo,2013-02-05,"You are entering a phase now where relationships bring challenges because others may seem confused or unwilling to make a commitment. Your need for clarification is emphasized as your key planet Mercury moves into your 7th House of Partners. Keep in mind that your power isn't diminished just because you are missing information. Work with what you know, rather than what you don't."
libra,2013-02-05,"Your presence alone may be healing to others today, but, ironically, you might not know what you can do to help yourself. Your lack of certainty could raise issues of self-doubt, making it difficult to know where to start. However, you don't need to have a specific goal in mind to take the next step in a relationship now. Narrow your focus and just respond with your heart to the current circumstances. The larger picture will develop in time."
scorpio,2013-02-05,"Transforming your vision into a real journey can be the most important part of your life in the weeks ahead. If you are already thinking about your future, it's probably time to move your planning to the next phase. However, it's not time to take direct action yet. You are in the game for the long haul, so it's more productive to refine your strategy than to run off too quickly in the wrong direction."
sagittarius,2013-02-05,"You may be uncomfortable with energetic shifts that pull you into a more contemplative phase as mental Mercury slips into sensitive Pisces. Disjointed feelings can alienate you from your reality. Further complications could arise from mundane issues that you would rather avoid. Thankfully, taking care of logistics first frees you up to spend more time on your spiritual pursuits and creative fantasies."
capricorn,2013-02-05,"The next several weeks might bring unexpected complications as the pace of life speeds up. Normally, you're a champ at long-term planning, but now your focus shifts to what's happening day to day. The current cosmic conditions suggest that you are wise to lighten your schedule for a while. Even if you're overly ambitious, there will be time to climb the ladder to success later on. Adopting a more flexible attitude allows you to successfully manage the surprises heading your way."
aquarius,2013-02-05,"It's time to soothe your nervous system by slowing down and gaining a deeper understanding of your own self-worth. Sometimes you get so caught up in the present moment that you forget how much intelligence you can bring to a difficult situation. Your thinking may be fuzzy now and trying to concentrate might only make you more anxious. Don't worry; your clarity will return. In the meantime, let your dreams be your guide."
pisces,2013-02-05,"It's a very emotional time with logical Mercury moving into your sign for an extended stay through mid-April. Your dreams are growing even more vivid than usual, but it could be difficult to apply what you experience in your imagination to real life. Nevertheless, your thoughts are setting the tone for what will happen throughout the year, so don't hold back. Exploring your visions and fantasies now can reveal alternative paths to success."
aries,2013-02-06,"Your social life is improving, but you still might have to deal with stress that won't magically disappear. Even with so much happening now, find time to enjoy your friends. You naturally stay focused in the present moment when your passions are aroused, but don't use your pointed concentration to avoid an important issue. Prepare for the future by setting a realistic goal instead of scattering your attention all over the place."
taurus,2013-02-06,"This can be a fantastic day as your key planet Venus harmonizes with surprising Uranus and auspicious Jupiter. Instead of being so set in your ways, remain open to the extraordinary potential that exists in each moment. You won't benefit by being afraid of the future. Focus your intentions on finding simple ways to make your life more beautiful. Instead of denying yourself pleasure in order to meet other people's expectations, do what makes you happy today."
gemini,2013-02-06,"An unexpected event may cause your friend or partner to pull in the reins now. Unfortunately, you don't like it when someone else tries to control you. At another time in your life, you might have gone along with the change of plans, but you are more than ready to stand up for your needs today. Speak from your heart; luckily, your sincere interaction leaves you with a more enduring and honest connection."
cancer,2013-02-06,"Even if you continue to ride the roller coaster of your feelings today, they won't carry you away from a very sweet encounter that's on your radar. However, your fear could close the door to a magnificent experience before it even happens. If you commit to keeping your heart open now, the potential love that is all around you has a chance to take flight."
leo,2013-02-06,"Fantastic news could come your way today, but you have to be receptive to the message or it will pass you by unnoticed. The reward or acknowledgment you receive now might not be what you expect. You may be lucky enough to get an unexpected cash windfall or meet a very special person. Keep your eyes open but don't try to control the flow of events; just enjoy the good fortune while it lasts."
virgo,2013-02-06,"It's healthier to express your feelings than to keep them to yourself, even if you're anxious about the reaction you might receive. Although this assertive behavior may be contrary to your natural inclination, taking a risk is a really good idea now. Give yourself enough time because once you begin to share your emotions, it may be difficult to stop. Stir up whatever seems most stuck and expect your words to be catalytic in creating positive change."
libra,2013-02-06,"It feels as if everything will turn out for the best now because your key planet Venus is harmonizing with ingenious Uranus and lucky Jupiter. But don't be lazy today; waiting for something incredible to happen is not a smart strategy. Step outside of your normal comfort zone to manifest the beauty that you experience in your space of dreams. Your creations will be appreciated by your peers, so take a chance today and make some magic of your own."
scorpio,2013-02-06,"Your positive attitude remains the ultimate key to your happiness today, even in the most difficult situations. Although material success might be a lingering problem, don't let your goals get in your way now. Do whatever makes you feel good about yourself and the money will follow. If there are feelings that need to be expressed, share them with abundant love. But don't push too hard yet; you will know when the time is right."
sagittarius,2013-02-06,"Your key planet, extravagant Jupiter, receives a delicious kiss today from Venus the Lover. Even if you have been struggling recently, it's difficult for you to be negative now. Others, too, are more optimistic while in your presence. And, for this reason, they might seek you out, putting you on the most wanted list -- not for punishment, but rather for fun and games. If invited, just say yes."
capricorn,2013-02-06,The stress at work could be temporarily released because your bosses and associates suddenly see you as more graceful and charming than before. You're eager to encourage others today and your current optimism is reflected back at you. Don't dilly-dally; you could make money or increase your status by thinking big and taking decisive action now while your ambitions are supported by auspicious cosmic timing.
aquarius,2013-02-06,"You may be able to get away with some mischief today, but don't push your luck too far or your day could implode. However, even if you go overboard, you should be able to get everything back on track quickly. Your charm is working in your favor, so give yourself permission to joyfully accept the love that's around you without being greedy and wanting more than is available. Seek satisfaction from what you have now, rather than longing for something else."
pisces,2013-02-06,"Unexpected events can be shocking, even when they only occur in your fantasies or dreams. However, your destiny is within your control if you decide to consciously wake up and change the channel. Instead of focusing on your fear of the unknown, concentrate on the positive energy and the encouragement that is wending its way to your door. Receive the good news without resistance. Opportunity may be knocking, but you must let it in to make something amazing happen."
aries,2013-02-07,"At first, nearly every opportunity sounds good today and you're tempted to say yes before you even have all the facts. Although the power of positive thinking can impact your day, there may be a point at which enough is enough. The problem is there could be silver linings in all the clouds now, not just the dark ones. Nevertheless, exercising common sense saves you from being caught out in a storm."
taurus,2013-02-07,"Your good luck could be the envy of others at work today because it appears as if everything is going your way. The support you receive now encourages you to feel confident and act generously. You are inclined to spread cheer and good will. Nevertheless, don't take the easy life for granted. Be willing to work for what you want rather than just expecting the rewards to fall in your lap."
gemini,2013-02-07,"You may be feeling very lucky today, but it's still not a smart idea to bet the farm on an intuitive hunch at this time. It's not that you are destined to lose; you could even win big. However, there's an inherent instability in overextending your energy or resources. Although you can rationalize your risk-taking, you're better off playing it safe for now. A practical approach could bring you more happiness than you expect."
cancer,2013-02-07,"You are being drawn into a deep emotional mystery that involves complicated interrelationships and unresolved feelings. Although your initial approach may be intellectual now, your curiosity motivates you to investigate places you've never been. Follow your intuition, no matter what twists and turns life places in front of you. Let go of your fear of the unknown and open your heart."
leo,2013-02-07,"You could have a challenging time setting limits today. However, it's even more likely that others in your life are frustrated with your lack of boundaries. It's tough to maintain a clear perspective now because you're very confident in your own abilities and in the potential of what you are doing. Practice turning down your volume and see if you receive a more positive reaction. Softening your approach won't be any less fun, and it might be more effective in the long run."
virgo,2013-02-07,"You may have fallen into the giant Jupiter trap of dreaming about future success. It's not that you lose touch with reality; you don't. It's just that you can get swept up in the potential comforts that go along with material rewards. However, it's healthy to consider the creative possibilities, too. You might be ready to take a risk -- as long as it's not too big. It's better to successfully hit your mark than set it too high and end up disappointed."
libra,2013-02-07,"Once again you find yourself in that all too familiar place where both sides of a dilemma are equally attractive. No doubt, you love your freedom now. But you might have to give up some independence to gain the security of love that you also want. You could be leaning toward the side of intimacy and inclusion, but keep your travel options open, nonetheless. Fortunately, you can enjoy yourself today without making a final choice."
scorpio,2013-02-07,"Getting along with others isn't always easy for you because of your low tolerance for trivial matters. However, you may be feeling more confident about your role in relationships now. People in your immediate environment might attempt to use you in their quest for power today, but you're more interested in seeking meaning. Even if your goals aren't material ones, it's time to reap some of the rewards from the seeds that you've sown."
sagittarius,2013-02-07,"More of anything seems like a good idea now as delicious Venus harmonizes with your key planet Jupiter. You agree with William Blake, who wrote that the road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom. Unfortunately, it can also lead to the house of exhaustion. Even if you believe you know when to stop, you still might push it just one step too far. Thankfully, a more reserved approach enables you to indulge in the best of both worlds."
capricorn,2013-02-07,"Your vision inspires you to work harder now, especially if you love what you're doing. But don't get sucked up into expansive Jupiter's inflationary spiral, or you might not be able to work your way back to Earth. Use your core values as your compass and then stick to your plan of action. Even if everything is sailing along, remember that good business sense and rational thinking will set the most successful course."
aquarius,2013-02-07,"You might talk yourself into thinking that all is in good working order at this time. However, you can also see the weak spot in the big picture and you believe your direct intervention could save the day. But it's not a good idea to over-commit your resources to a project that's built on the blue sky of Jupiter's rosy optimism. Keep the ultimate goal in mind while focusing on your actions in the present moment."
pisces,2013-02-07,"You may be exuberantly shining in all your glory today when sexy Venus kisses your key planet Jupiter. Sit back and enjoy the perfection of your own imagination while also extending it outward into your local world. Others can see the twinkle in your eye now, but they won't necessarily know the source of your excitement. Don't stop to explain your behavior; just continue to spread your magic wherever you go."
aries,2013-02-08,"It's difficult to sit quietly in the back of the room because irrepressible Mars, your key planet, aligns with Mercury the Communicator. You know what you want to say and you think you can inspire others into action. Unfortunately, your message might be confusing unless you have all your facts in order. Avoid overreacting by counting to five before opening your mouth. But don't worry; you will get the chance to share what's needed when the time is right."
taurus,2013-02-08,"You might be the one in the group who stands up and speaks your mind today. Fortunately, you're able to draw on poetic images and creative visions that are normally beyond your reach. However, you may not feel comfortable with your forceful words, for they can offend your delicate sensibilities even as you say them. Nevertheless, don't talk yourself out of sharing what's on your mind. Your friends and associates will appreciate your honesty and your attempts to think outside of the box."
gemini,2013-02-08,"You may be feeling upset at the way things have gone down at work, but there isn't much you can do about it today, except talk about it. Expressing your concern with compassion wins you the support you seek as your key planet Mercury joins energetic Mars in your 10th House of Status. Use any means necessary to get your message out there, even if it means shouting it from the rooftop. You could be surprised with the positive response you receive if you are clear and direct in your delivery."
cancer,2013-02-08,"You are inspired to fight for what you want today, and chances are that you may actually get it. If you ever considered writing a letter about a familiar gripe or going to your boss about a lingering issue, this is the day you've been waiting for. However, you could inadvertently offend someone with your uncharacteristically forceful approach. It's easier to restrain your anger by softening your words than it is to deal with the mess you can make by being carried away with your emotions."
leo,2013-02-08,"You may feel lighter on your feet today because there's less responsibility weighing on your shoulders. Nevertheless, you're not in the mood to play games, and someone who gets in your way might be surprised with the speed and fury of your response. However, defending yourself by going on the offense isn't as effective now as revealing your true feelings. This time words speak louder than actions."
virgo,2013-02-08,"Sparks may fly if someone oversteps your boundaries today. It really doesn't matter who you are with now; you might feel as if others are trying to get your goat. You can respond to these situations with a display of anger if you feel the need to protect yourself against the apparent attack. However, the best strategy is to chill out and not take yourself so seriously. Allow a day or two for your perspective to evolve and then readdress the issue."
libra,2013-02-08,"Although it's always a good idea to stick with the facts, how you deliver the message is just as important today as what you say. When you put the data you've been working on into the report or email, make certain you don't overstate your position. Even if you are giving a verbal presentation, you can get hotter and more fired up than intended. Naturally, you're not looking to make any enemies, so keep reminding yourself to tone down your emotions. A subtle touch accomplishes more than a heavy hand."
scorpio,2013-02-08,"You have the sweet power of persuasion at the tip of your tongue now. Messenger Mercury aligns with your key planet Mars, adding the strength of conviction to your words. Just don't come on too strong or you could defeat your own purpose before you even have a chance. However, acknowledging your emotional intensity enables you to communicate your vision in a gentler and more compassionate manner."
sagittarius,2013-02-08,"It may feel as if something isn't quite right, but you can't put your finger on the source of the problem. You might be afraid that you won't get your needs met, even if satisfaction is within reach. Some event in the past comes back to haunt you today and you could become discouraged before you even ask for what you want. Remember that this is not history repeating itself. Push through your fears by staying in the here and now."
capricorn,2013-02-08,"Quicksilver Mercury catches up with warrior Mars in your 3rd House of Communication today, making it difficult for you to hold your punches. If you have experienced an injustice or are angry with someone, you might be more aggressive than you intend. Pay attention to the tone of your words now because you will be more persuasive with a firm but gentle approach to drive home your point."
aquarius,2013-02-08,"You may be more emotional than you prefer when the evocative Moon enters your sign today. Even if you try to avoid complicated feelings, you might be overwhelmed by your reactions now. Don't resist your changing moods just because they make you uncomfortable; relax and take a ride on the water-slide of life. Things will lighten up after this weekend's New Moon, enabling you to regain the clarity that comes from an objective perspective."
pisces,2013-02-08,"You aren't often this pushy, but you are ready to say what needs to be said now as chatty Mercury lines up with feisty Mars in your sign. However, you may not clearly know what you want to communicate because your thoughts are muddled by secret desires. Tone down your rhetoric until you decide your next move. In the meantime, do what you can to untangle your wild imagination from your rational intellect."
aries,2013-02-09,"Although you may be restless today as you wait for the opening to make your move, you intuitively know that the time isn't quite right yet. Sit back and let your anticipation build until you just can't bear it any longer, and then take action. However, consider everyone else's perspective before you set off on a course that can be more disruptive than you intend. Success is more likely now with the encouraging support of your friends and family rather than striking out on your own."
taurus,2013-02-09,"You may be receiving the green light from everyone else today, but you're not certain you can handle the extra workload. Even if you're determined to reach your goals, you might be afraid of taking on more than you can deliver. Instead of compensating by being overly cautious now, going along with someone else's expectations enables you to accomplish much more than you think possible."
gemini,2013-02-09,"Although you can see the potential of your current efforts today, you might also be setting yourself up for a fall. Your hard work may pay off, but the rewards won't necessarily meet your lofty expectations. You're looking at the future through rose-colored glasses now and everything seems better than it actually is. Be as realistic as possible to avoid facing disappointment in the days ahead."
cancer,2013-02-09,"Your imagination is running rampant today and you believe that you can dream your way out of a difficult situation. However, your desires may play tricks on you now, so be careful not to lose touch with reality. If you're romantically inclined, you could be so idealistic that you misinterpret someone's actions. Don't rely on your assumptions; ask for a second opinion and then pay close attention to what is actually said."
leo,2013-02-09,"It's difficult to take anyone at face value today. In fact, you might be deceiving yourself about your current social life. Even if you are attempting to be rational, someone could be purposefully misleading you. No matter how perfect everything seems, delay your most important decisions for a day or two until you have more clarity on the situation."
virgo,2013-02-09,"It's easy to miss an important fact when talking with a close friend or partner because you may be blinded by your own optimism now. Don't take what you hear as the absolute truth; do a little extra research before making an assumption that might get you into trouble. Giving someone you trust the benefit of the doubt is normally a sensible strategy, but today you can stretch the power of positive thinking too far."
libra,2013-02-09,"Your runaway imagination may bring on strange physical symptoms now. Thankfully, this doesn't mean that you're ill, but it's still smart to get any serious complaints checked by a health professional in order to put your mind at ease. Do whatever you can to foster a positive attitude. What you currently think today lays the foundation for what you build tomorrow."
scorpio,2013-02-09,"Even if you have a lot of work to do today, there's an inner child waiting for its chance to come out and play. It's challenging to suppress your desire for fun because you believe that you have waited long enough as it is. Go ahead and enjoy yourself, but don't overdo it. Setting sensible limits enables you to have a pleasurable time without worrying about going too far."
sagittarius,2013-02-09,"You might be riding a wave of optimism that is based upon your expectations and fueled by the encouragement of your friends. Ironically, the support you receive today further motivates you to go for the gold, even if it means disregarding the details, as mischievous Mercury activates exaggerating Jupiter in your 7th House of Relationships now. Fortunately, you can regain your hold on reality if you take the time to put all the facts in order."
capricorn,2013-02-09,"Philosophical Jupiter is receiving a valuable lesson from cerebral Mercury now, but it may not be what you think. Paradoxically, this is exactly what you need to learn -- that what you see isn't necessarily what you get. Soften your position and allow your uncertainty to influence your choices. Sometimes the most important things are not the most obvious."
aquarius,2013-02-09,"You may overestimate your bank balance today and spend more money than you should. However, your intentions are good and you could even believe that you are making a wise choice. But extra caution is advised because it's too easy now to misjudge the value of what you are acquiring. Don't be afraid to negotiate, but think twice before buying anything that might exhaust your resources."
pisces,2013-02-09,"Your current self-confidence may be an overreaction to what you don't know. Unfortunately, you could draw others into your plan without realizing that you might be jeopardizing a larger strategy. Your lesson now is to understand that you are part of a greater whole. Nurture your connections with those around you because it really does take a village to succeed."
aries,2013-02-10,"Your future may be looking bright now that the Aquarius New Moon lands in your 11th House of Hopes and Dreams, making it difficult for you to contain your excitement. However, you must be careful because you could be more gullible than usual. Your friends' schemes for world domination might not be as sound as you think. Solutions appear closer than they actually are now, so keep your enthusiasm up while proceeding with common sense."
taurus,2013-02-10,"You may be stressed out by your own career plans now as you realize the commitment of time and energy it will take to achieve your goals. The Aquarius New Moon falls in your 10th House of Public Responsibility, yet you might feel restrained by the expectations of your partner or parents. Unfortunately, you can't easily choose between work and family, so split your time equally during the next couple of weeks. Keep your eyes on the future while managing your relationships in the present moment."
gemini,2013-02-10,"You have so many things going on all at once that it may be difficult to finish everything you start. Your goals are set high and the Aquarius New Moon in your 9th House of Big Ideas has you believing you can accomplish more than usual. Although you have the skills required to do the job, you still might not be able to reach the stars. Avoid disappointment by finding satisfaction in each and every little task you do."
cancer,2013-02-10,"You could have unusual ideas about how to work with your colleagues today, but you might want more freedom of movement than you actually have in your current situation. The innovative Aquarius New Moon activates your 8th House of Transformation, yet you don't have much latitude for experimentation now. If you want to gain the cooperation of others, don't risk muddying the waters by revealing too much about your feelings. Instead, maintain clear boundaries between your personal and professional worlds for the best results."
leo,2013-02-10,"You are like a magnet for brilliant people now that the eccentric Aquarius New Moon stimulates your 7th House of Relationships. Unusual companions will likely play an important role in your immediate future. However, your assertive approach can complicate a situation, so it's wise to let others take the lead in social interactions today. Although you may be infused with self-confidence, stay cool and work toward being more cooperative rather than blazing your own trail."
virgo,2013-02-10,"Clean your closets, organize your information and sort through your files today. But do it in your own unique way because the individualistic Aquarius New Moon's presence in your 6th House of Self-Improvement is a cosmic permission slip to be weird as you go about your chores. Don't worry about involving others now as you establish your routine. An early spring cleaning will give you a new lease on life."
libra,2013-02-10,"Use whatever technology is available to share your creative and fun-loving side today. The futuristic Aquarius New Moon falls in your 5th House of Self-Expression, inspiring you to try something new. But your idealistic desire for spontaneity is at odds with your practical need to finish your chores. Take a computer break to draw a picture, write a poem or play a game before getting back to more serious endeavors. Be responsible, but give your inner child permission to come out and play."
scorpio,2013-02-10,"You might have unavoidable domestic responsibilities that require you to stay home and take care of personal business today rather than heading out into the world. The unpredictable Aquarius New Moon lands in your 4th House of Emotional Security, encouraging you to find shelter from the storms of life within the safety of your family. Don't worry about any other activities you are missing; there will be plenty of time to chase your dreams another day."
sagittarius,2013-02-10,"Today's Aquarius New Moon in your 3rd House of Communication may make your life rather hectic as the complexity of your schedule increases. You might want to let the less critical issues slide, but you probably enjoy the energy as you bounce around from one thing to another. Just be sure to follow through on the details or they will come back to haunt you later on. Thankfully, your friends and family can help you stay on track with their confidence in your success."
capricorn,2013-02-10,"The Aquarius New Moon activates your 2nd House of Possessions, emphasizing money issues over the next couple of weeks. Maybe there is growing uncertainty in your cash flow or, perhaps, you need to juggle resources to cover expenses. Be wise and plan how to use the days ahead to stabilize your financial condition. Although you might be overly optimistic one moment and cautious the next, tempering the extremes is your best bet."
aquarius,2013-02-10,"Insightful mental flashes bring you a new awareness about a current relationship as today's New Moon in your sign puts you in touch with your emotions. You may need to explore ways to increase your personal freedom if you feel constrained by someone close to you. However, if you are already feeling independent, you might actually seek security from a partnership. Either way, stand between your dreams and reality so you can draw the two closer together."
pisces,2013-02-10,"Oftentimes your dreams are elusive and slip away before you have an opportunity to write them down. Now, as the electric Aquarius New Moon stimulates your 12th House of Soul Consciousness, the images are more vibrant than ever and can even overflow into your waking life. Fantasies may be subtle but are also quite powerful. Making time to drift into the hidden recesses of your imagination inspires you to realize your fullest potential."
aries,2013-02-11,"It's difficult to accept that you can't get everything you want now. If you try to satisfy all your needs, fulfillment may grow even more elusive. Unfortunately, your anger can get the best of you if you aren't careful. Don't blame anyone else if you're feeling frustrated; striking out against others only pushes them farther away. It's healthier to expend your physical energy today by doing hard work or exercise. You'll be more fun to be around once the tension is released."
taurus,2013-02-11,"Your efforts to socialize on the job today may be met with a cool reception or even a cold shoulder. Although you might feel as if someone is raining on your parade, making significant connections isn't out of the question. Austere Saturn's square to loving Venus requires you to set aside exciting fantasies of lighthearted fun. Thankfully, putting in the hard work that builds a strong foundation creates meaningful and enduring relationships."
gemini,2013-02-11,"The zodiac's Twins are typically lighthearted and quick-footed, and seem capable of having a good time no matter what is happening. Now, however, you may be too anxious to fully enjoy yourself. You might be afraid that you're going to lose what goodies you already have and this makes you want to clench your jaw and hold your breath. Unfortunately, this suppression will have just the opposite effect of what you desire. Instead, relax into the present moment and remember this stress will soon pass."
cancer,2013-02-11,"The fear of the unknown lurks within your subconscious mind now. Of course, you can easily succumb to this self-induced uncertainty and withdraw from encounters in the outer world. Or you could face your demons by consciously overcoming your own instinctive resistance and bravely engaging them. The more light you shine on hidden places, the better you'll feel about life in general."
leo,2013-02-11,"It's time to pull back into the safety of your home and family as the tides of change wash upon your shore. You may be feeling a sense of urgency, but it's important to know that you won't lose your chance if you don't act today. This is your opportunity to tie up loose emotional ends now so that you can launch into a new cycle in the days ahead."
virgo,2013-02-11,"You have a better handle on your feelings today, but the real problem is that with your new focus comes the need to take decisive action. However, you are being pulled in the direction of separation now, rather than connection. Thankfully, you have the potential to fix something that's been bothering you but it will take revealing your vulnerability first. Listening to your heart won't lead you astray."
libra,2013-02-11,"Running into financial trouble may be a sign that you've been neglecting your responsibilities lately. On the other hand, the stress you feel might not involve money; it could raise issues of your own self-worth, especially pertaining to love and relationships. If your confidence is low, don't base your value on what someone else thinks or says about you. Finding your strength from within enables others to see the real you."
scorpio,2013-02-11,"You're experiencing emotional pressure from the expectations of loved ones, but their needs might be so unrealistic now that you're tempted to just withdraw without even trying. Your sense of isolation could be exasperated by an apparent lack of support from those who profess to love you. However, much of your current experience is based upon memories of difficult times. Fortunately, healing is just around the next corner if you are willing to forgive and then let go of the past."
sagittarius,2013-02-11,"You may feel that you're past any attempt to suppress a rush of emotions. However, it's healthy to remember that others might be overwhelmed by your energy as you release pent-up tensions. It's your uncharacteristically pragmatic vision of the future now that can pull you through times of disappointment. Do what you Archers do best: aim your thoughts at a distant goal and take the high road to follow them to your destination."
capricorn,2013-02-11,"You might try to avoid your friends as you go through a period of self-imposed isolation. At first, the idea of socializing sounds as if it could boost your morale by making you feel more connected with the people in your immediate environment. However, conversations may fall short of your current expectations. Don't be overly harsh on yourself or others; a bit of alone time gives you an opportunity to listen to your inner voice. You will be able to catch up on the fun with everyone else soon enough."
aquarius,2013-02-11,"Tying up loose ends is your first order of business today. You want to have fun with pleasurable Venus in your sign, but reality is your taskmaster now. You have to do what's being asked of you, even if it requires you to temporarily set aside your notion of personal satisfaction. The rewards will come in due time if you apply yourself in a practical and disciplined manner."
pisces,2013-02-11,"No matter what you do today, it feels as if your actions won't alleviate your current sense of disappointment. If you must postpone some long-term plans now, keep in mind that this isn't necessarily a permanent cancellation; more likely it's a temporary delay. In the meantime, if you patiently tend to the important issues, you may be able to fix whatever prevented you from reaching your goals in the first place."
aries,2013-02-12,"Your intuition may be operating on overdrive today; however, don't trust every notion that pops into your head. It's difficult to separate your valid thoughts from the ambient noise since you are particularly sensitive to your own fantasies now. Run each of your ideas through your own logical analysis before acting on any of them. Exercising a little discrimination ensures that your actions will be based on clear thinking rather than emotional bias."
taurus,2013-02-12,"Others seem to accept your authority now without much resistance. Ironically, you might not feel as if you're doing anything differently. Nevertheless, something has changed. It's as if you passed a test that you didn't even know you took. Don't push your luck by suggesting a crazy idea or you could quickly lose your hard-earned credibility. Steadfast determination and a sustainable pace are your friends in the long run."
gemini,2013-02-12,"The current emphasis is more on what's occurring in your outer life than what's going on within your imagination. Externalize your thoughts through direct action. Put your sound ideas to good use by organizing a project at work. Take control by managing the information at your disposal. Thankfully, your mind is functioning on a very practical level now, so a sincere effort goes a long way toward improving the working order of your life."
cancer,2013-02-12,"You may feel a bit disconnected today as you walk away from a difficult situation. It's not that you are apathetic or discouraged; instead, you believe that you can be more effective if you don't let your feelings interfere with your actions in the outer world now. But don't lose touch with what's in your heart, for your emotions continue to fuel your dreams no matter what else is going on."
leo,2013-02-12,"Go ahead and share your concerns with others today, even if you're uncharacteristically serious. You don't need to pretend that all is fun and games. However, there's no reason to wait until you're on center stage to be who you want to be. Talk about the issues you care about the most; the simple act of telling the truth now can create a special moment with a loved one. Your authenticity inspires others to open their hearts."
virgo,2013-02-12,"Your no-nonsense attitude comes in handy today as you keep your shoulder to the wheel. Even though you can become overwhelmed when there's so much on your plate, there is also a part of you that enjoys having plenty to do because it keeps your mind busy. Thankfully, working hard now frees you up to enjoy the fruits of your labor during the days to come."
libra,2013-02-12,"If you have been doing your part these past few days, your burst of productivity may reach a crescendo now. Don't be afraid to share your recent activities with a co-worker. However, gaining recognition isn't your primary motivation, even if acknowledgment from your peers comes later. Put the feedback you receive to good use. Currently it's all about solidifying your strategy in order to make your efforts worthwhile."
scorpio,2013-02-12,"Although you may withdraw into your own mysterious world today, you still might feel a lighthearted playfulness that inspires you to create something special. The problem is that you don't want to make time for non-productive engagements of any kind today. Social niceties and meaningless chitchat are not your current cups of tea. Just slip away when you get the chance and don't make a big deal about your escape. Others will secretly admire your determination to follow your bliss."
sagittarius,2013-02-12,"You may have your own private agenda today, yet others may believe you are selflessly helping them. Hopefully, you are working both sides of the equation by taking care of yourself, which in turn has positive effects on those around you. Above all, keep communication channels open and be willing to share your feelings. Your blunt honesty might not always be appreciated, but everyone benefits when you call the shots as you see them now."
capricorn,2013-02-12,"You're entranced by the beauty in your environment, yet it may feel as if you're walking across an emotional mine field today. Nevertheless, you should be able to navigate through the obstacles without much trouble. Although you can be temporarily distracted, you have work to do and don't have a lot of time to waste. Fortunately, your determination is unwavering now. Your singular focus is the secret weapon that enables you to reach your goals."
aquarius,2013-02-12,"Your intellectual clarity is exceptional today as long as it's not the only tool you rely on. You are particularly cautious in your thinking now because you understand the importance of working within defined social structures. However, you may not be able to suppress your rebellious streak forever. Acknowledge the established boundaries, but don't let other people's judgments prevent you from being true to yourself."
pisces,2013-02-12,"You may be feeling a little less spacey today, although your imagination continues to put on a show. Unfortunately, your gut is saying one thing while the information you're receiving is telling you something else. Thankfully, you can finally separate the facts from the illusions by using your current powers of discernment. Although your intuition is typically your strong suit, you're better off now basing your decisions solely on logic."
aries,2013-02-13,"The Moon's return to your sign infuses your day with emotional intensity. It may be wise to slow down because you tend to overreact to nearly everything that happens now. It's as if the volume is turned up on a song that you can't get out of your head. Nevertheless, strive to be gentle as you continue to stir up changes in your world."
taurus,2013-02-13,"Although you might lack clarity about your current role in the community, there are important interactions happening now that are just beyond your perceptions. It's important to learn whatever you can about the hidden dynamics, for what you don't know could have a negative impact on you. Fortunately, as you gather more information, you'll have more positive options from which to choose."
gemini,2013-02-13,"Your social life might be racing ahead in your thoughts, but the current circumstances of your life can't catch up to your big ideas. Ultimately, you can get what you want, but you must proceed with caution today. However, don't overreact and stop your forward movement entirely. Instead, imagine that there are yellow lights at each emotional intersection. Slowing down now could prevent you from having to clean up a messy accident down the road."
cancer,2013-02-13,"You are receiving strong cosmic signals that are pushing you forward, possibly creating anxiety in the process. A current relationship may be exerting pressure that requires you to balance your need for security with the expectations that other people place on you. Unfortunately, retreating to an emotionally safe place isn't your best strategy today. Instead, face your resistance and take the next step forward. Breaking through your fears can be an exhilarating experience and just the catalyst for change you need."
leo,2013-02-13,"Although you're not afraid to stick to your perspective even if everyone else disagrees, you still have a lot to learn now by listening to their opinions. It really doesn't matter that your mind is already made up. Your argument isn't with anyone else; it's with your own inner voice telling you that you know better. Soften your position and let go of your need to control everything. Demonstrating that you're a team player makes it easier to maintain your integrity in the long run."
virgo,2013-02-13,"It's becoming easier to collaborate with others, even if their work habits clash with yours. You may even be excited about the idea of adopting a different style. Stay open to new ways of doing the same old things, for this flexibility might just provide you with the nudge you need. Whatever has become stale is fair game for revitalization today."
libra,2013-02-13,You might not have the final say in what you do today because unexpected circumstances demand quick reactions. Whatever unfolds around you has an immediate impact on your plans and could change your agenda. You can choose to be frustrated or consciously open your mind and let go of control. Take the external events in stride and enjoy yourself in spite of your previous expectations.
scorpio,2013-02-13,"You have so many chores to do today that you may feel scattered if you try to do them all. Be smart; make a list and then start at the top. Consciously block out anything that isn't specifically aligned with the immediate task at hand. Stay focused on what's directly in front of you, and don't start the next item on your list until you have completed the current one. A methodical approach helps you to overcome your lack of concentration and enables you to get everything done."
sagittarius,2013-02-13,"Your current restlessness won't likely cause you too much worry today. You're quite familiar with experiencing bouts of wanderlust, allowing you to take your current fantasies of magical adventures in stride. Unfortunately, this may not be a sensible time to head out on a journey. Let your current impulse pass as a good idea that doesn't need to materialize yet. You'll get your chance to live out your dreams soon enough."
capricorn,2013-02-13,"Life may present you with a problem that seems more like a puzzle to you today. Practicing what Zen philosophy calls ""Beginner's Mind"" can be of great service in your search for a viable solution. If you become prematurely certain about the path to success, no amount of work will bring you satisfaction. However, treating the dilemma like a game frees your imagination to grasp the facts and allows you to come up with a brilliant answer."
aquarius,2013-02-13,"The idea of shaking up your daily routine is exciting, but you may be content to just contemplate the concept without taking any action today. Fortunately, you're committed to finding the most effective strategy to work within the current restraints. Seek ways to become more independent through the use of your rational skills. For now, your incisive thinking is the best tool you have at your disposal."
pisces,2013-02-13,An unexpected situation may require you to focus on your finances today. This could take you beyond simply balancing your checkbook or paying a few bills. You must decide how you are going to build on what you have and move into the future. It's time to be practical about money; just remember that you can be responsible without overreacting. Don't turn a molehill into a mountain while simply putting things in order.
aries,2013-02-14,"It's easy to be in touch with your inner world now that the Moon is visiting your sign, but it's not so simple to say what's on your mind while in the presence of others. You may grow restless if you feel constrained by current circumstances. Don't give up hope because you can successfully share your needs a little bit at a time. Things have a better chance of turning out OK today as long as your frustration doesn't incite reckless behavior."
taurus,2013-02-14,"You might be overly pushy today when sharing something you would normally keep to yourself. Whether you are eager to discuss your recent dreams, deep spiritual beliefs or hidden secrets, this could be the day to do it. Nevertheless, a gentle yet persistent approach lets others know you are serious about your feelings and they should be, too. Choosing the right time and place increases the likelihood of your disclosure being well received by the ones you love."
gemini,2013-02-14,"Although you may be excited about an upcoming event, remember that others might not share your enthusiasm. Your current tendency is to try even harder to get a positive response if they don't offer the support you expect. But don't let anyone else's preferences alter your good mood. Fight the temptation to convince anyone of anything. It's better to enjoy your anticipation in solitude than to add unnecessary stress to your relationships."
cancer,2013-02-14,"Your drive for success may have you up at the crack of dawn today as if there might not be sufficient time to accomplish all the tasks on your list. But your eagerness could fade when you realize that everything will require extra effort. It isn't that you're lazy; you just prefer a less hectic pace. Thankfully, a slow and deliberate work style now will likely be more efficient in the long run."
leo,2013-02-14,"You're ready to fly away as a yearning for an exotic adventure beckons you to go somewhere special. Unfortunately, it may not be that simple, unless you can make it a lunchtime getaway. As motivated as you are today, your fantasy must ultimately answer to your responsibilities at work. Get busy and start honoring your obligations immediately, but don't stop dreaming along the way."
virgo,2013-02-14,"Something might be bothering you today, but it's difficult to put your finger on exactly what it is. You're excited because you think you have found a brilliant solution to an ongoing problem, but the answer slips away before you can grab hold of it. You're easily enthused but once you understand how unrealistic your plan is, you are quick to let it go. Try not to make any final decisions now as you jump back and forth with your changing moods. Simply write down your thoughts and wait for your clarity to return."
libra,2013-02-14,"The independent Aries Moon in your 7th House of Companions encourages you to reassert your needs within a professional or personal relationship. Go ahead and express what you want without blaming anyone else or you might run the risk of losing ground rather than gaining it. Fortunately, taking your time and clearly stating your intentions enables a discussion to go fairly smoothly. There's no limit to what you can resolve if you're willing to keep your mind open to new ideas."
scorpio,2013-02-14,"This is an excellent day to concentrate on the details of unfinished business and to efficiently handle mundane matters. You have sufficient energy now to initiate action where necessary, yet without pushing so hard as to stir up resistance. Instead of tackling a large project, you are better off taking care of many smaller tasks to give you a greater sense of accomplishment by the end of the day."
sagittarius,2013-02-14,"You might wish that today was a play day, even if there are many things on your to-do list. Nevertheless, your optimism could turn even the most tedious chore into a pleasurable activity. However, don't slip into the Tom Sawyer trap by putting on a show just to make everything look so good that everyone wants to jump in and do your work for you. Instead, let your inner child demonstrate your creativity since you can have lots of  fun now while still being productive."
capricorn,2013-02-14,"Be careful how you express your displeasure at home today, for the tiniest annoyance could quickly escalate into something bigger. A dramatic display of your anger is ill advised, for others might overreact to whatever you say now. However, withholding your emotions doesn't work very well either. Seek common ground through open dialogue, rather than just making non-negotiable demands. Listen just as much as you talk and you may be pleasantly surprised at what you learn."
aquarius,2013-02-14,"If you aren't careful about how much you try to accomplish today, you might end up exhausting yourself. You are easily encouraged to begin a new project before considering the impact it could have on your current workload. You are liable to spin your wheels now and not necessarily get anywhere, unless you set clear priorities and make up your mind to stay on track, no matter what. No one expects you to be a super-hero except you."
pisces,2013-02-14,"Awareness of what you have to offer others today may come in a sudden burst of inspiration, but your realization is more than just some passing fantasy. Your new way of seeing your role as a participant in a group process is likely based on very practical ideas. Although your thoughts seem to originate in the clouds of imagination, don't be shy about expressing them now. If you rely on your common sense as a filter, others will appreciate what you bring to the table."
aries,2013-02-15,"You might be overdue for some peace and quiet -- and you could get just what you want today. You feel a need to settle down with the Moon in easygoing Taurus, and now you seek ways to harness the exciting energy of the past few days. However, there's no reason to stop any activity that's already in motion. Instead, set a pace that enables you to sustain what's important so it has a chance to last longer than just a day or two."
taurus,2013-02-15,"You are quite comfortable if your forward movement is slow today -- as long as you're still making progress. Happily, you don't feel as hurried or harried as you did recently. Ironically, circumstances might not have changed; it's something within you that has shifted. It appears that you will reach your destination as long as you continue to inch along. Enjoy your new sense of confidence and the easier pace of life while it lasts."
gemini,2013-02-15,"You may grow so accustomed to always being in motion that it becomes confusing when things start to settle down. Your world is quieter now, but your mind hasn't mellowed to match the circumstances. In fact, you could pull a few ideas out of your hat today and amaze everyone. Just don't get too distracted by your own cleverness. Instead, do something practical with your ingenious thoughts while you have time on your side."
cancer,2013-02-15,"A dream may be a wish your heart makes, especially when the reflective Moon is traveling through your 11th House of Long-Term Goals. Often, you backward-walking Crabs prefer to dwell in the past, but today the past, present and future are all jumbled together. Use your common sense to turn your fantasies into reality by inching toward your destination one step at a time."
leo,2013-02-15,"It seems as if everyone at work wants you to take charge today. There may be tasks you absolutely must handle, but you might be feeling lazy. Even if you can think of reasons to put off doing some chores, reality won't likely let you off the hook that easily. You need to come through for others whether you want to or not. Rein in your fantasies and do what is expected of you now, even if your mind is somewhere else."
virgo,2013-02-15,"You're operating within your intellectual comfort zone today and you are confident because you know how to apply your expertise. Your belief that you're being useful is your idea of heaven, because you know exactly what you're doing and you feel empowered by your contribution. Make the most of this positive time by working hard and being productive."
libra,2013-02-15,"You could learn a valuable lesson by looking back in your life at past events as you try to untangle a present dilemma at work. Luckily, you can use your contemplative mood to your advantage. Discuss your inner process with your coworkers so you remain objective about your choices. Although it may be difficult to make up your mind, simplify the facts and just make the best decision in the moment."
scorpio,2013-02-15,"Differences don't have to turn into major dramas -- although they may be more problematic than not today. You might find yourself at odds with the needs of those around you now, but it really isn't as bad as it seems at first. At least some part of the disagreement is based on a misunderstanding, so you must listen with great intent in order to hear what's really being said. Remember, there's no need to drag others into your emotional process while resolving your own internal conflicts."
sagittarius,2013-02-15,"Even if your head is up in the clouds, a shift in attitude can bring you safely and gently back to earth today. It's time to take care of unfinished business with the sensible Taurus Moon in your 6th House of Work. Whatever obstacles come your way, focus on the most practical solutions. You might not be in the most creative space now, but you will feel good about what you accomplish if you keep your eyes on your goal and your feet on the ground."
capricorn,2013-02-15,"You can feel the positive influence of the steadfast Taurus Moon in your 5th House of Self-Expression because she gives you the assurance you need. You're able to rely on getting the expected responses to your actions today. If you concentrate on executing your creative plan, the fruits of your labor will ripen soon enough. Avoid the temptation of slipping into your fantasies. For now, everything runs smoother if you stick to the facts."
aquarius,2013-02-15,"There may be an interesting paradox for you to solve today because the back-to-basics Taurus Moon requires you to simplify your life as much as possible. However, you also see opportunities for growth if you change the rules of the game and create alternate paths that aren't even on the map. Nevertheless, it's more advantageous to let the unexplored possibilities pass you by for now. Be patient; you'll have a chance to replay them next week."
pisces,2013-02-15,"Although you usually enjoy swimming in the seas of your own imagination, this is a great day for you Fish to find your way back to dry land. Getting your head above water enables you to see clearly; there is security to be gained when you stand firmly on solid ground. Grab this opportunity to perceive reality for what it truly is so you can make practical decisions based on facts and not on your fantasies."
aries,2013-02-16,"You don't have the right to boss everyone around just because you think you know the best route to the top of the mountain. Remind yourself that there are many ways to get to the same place. Your ideas may work great for you, but they aren't necessarily sensible for someone else. Give up control around the outer edges of your life; you'll get more done and feel relieved in the process. Allowing the chance for others to think for themselves puts everyone on equal footing."
taurus,2013-02-16,"It's challenging to settle your energies enough to make the most of the day because you could become obsessed with overcoming someone's resistance to your efforts. Although the stubborn Taurus Moon opposes unmovable Saturn early in the day to create conflict, don't let this inflexibility determine your whole day. Focus on what you can accomplish rather than on what's in your way."
gemini,2013-02-16,"If you are worried about something at work today, it's probably not a trivial issue. However, it's helpful to understand that your irritability may be stirred up because you feel trapped by your responsibilities. Don't waste energy planning your escape; take the mature course of action and face any uncomfortable issues head-on. The stress might not resolve right away, but your consistent effort leads to a lasting solution rather than a temporary reprieve."
cancer,2013-02-16,"When you hide your annoyance, it can transform into resentment. Others probably know there is something you're not saying today, so they might become angry with you for holding back. It seems as if your friends are expressing your suppressed anger. However, there's no need to be on the defensive. Facing your insecurities and communicating what must be said clears the path to a productive day."
leo,2013-02-16,"Leading by example is more effective than by intimidation. Luckily, you have a deep reserve of physical and mental energy now, and if you apply it carefully you can make these days really count. Remember, it's better to have people around you who can stand up to your authority than to get silent compliance from those who have no respect. The power to change other people's minds may be yours today if you use it wisely."
virgo,2013-02-16,"Although your business and personal relationships may introduce instability into your life now, you still have someone you can lean on. However, your main source of support today is you. If you want to get something done, you might have to rely on your own practical skills and efficient manner. Ironically, others are likely to come around quickly and hold up their end of the deal once you take your power back."
libra,2013-02-16,"Your simple goal today is to turn an unpleasant chore into an enjoyable activity. Your best chance of achieving satisfaction is by doing what you do best -- diplomatically smoothing over the rough spots so others can get along. Just remember, you don't have to downplay your importance while shifting the focus on to someone else. Take responsibility for your crucial role in the process by acting with conviction as you stand on common ground."
scorpio,2013-02-16,"Control issues may come to the forefront of your life today. You might feel as if your willpower is functioning at a high level, but your singular concentration on a specific task can actually contribute to a ruthless attitude. Others could feel as if they're obstructing progress unless they commit to following your instructions exactly as you give them. But nothing is gained when you're too set in your ways to learn something new. Luckily, there's always room for compromise."
sagittarius,2013-02-16,"You are willing to set aside your sense of urgency and work toward a long-term goal now. Although you have more patience than usual, you're still uncertain about how long you can wait before setting out on a new course. But don't turn your life upside down yet because getting everything ready will require more hard work. Use the stabilizing energy at hand to tighten your plans; follow your moral compass and you'll know when it's time to jump."
capricorn,2013-02-16,"You are exceptionally conscious of your goals now and know how you can achieve them. The danger is that you could talk yourself into the over-inflated importance of your objectives, tempting you to bend the rules of the game in your favor. However, the ends do not justify the means. You'll be proud of your accomplishments if you stick to the spirit and the letter of the law."
aquarius,2013-02-16,"You have your work in front of you and you won't let anything prevent you from finishing what you set out to do today. Although you might think you need to confront an authority figure on your way to success, you may actually receive more support than you expect. Don't make your path harder than it needs to be by turning a potential ally into an enemy. Live by the Golden Rule; if you give others the respect that you want, that's how they will treat you in return."
pisces,2013-02-16,"You feel as if you're working selflessly for some higher cause today, but it might be more obvious to you than to anyone else. Others may question your motives or try to convince you to shift directions, pulling the rug of certainty out from under your feet. Instead of doubting yourself, make a conscious decision to rise above the irrational confusion and to simply focus on accomplishing your goals."
aries,2013-02-17,"There are too many things to do today and not enough time to finish all of them. Although it might not be a very relaxing day, chances are you will still thoroughly enjoy it. You can feel the excitement swell as you swing into action. Just make sure you have a plan before you wander too far in the wrong direction. Doing a little research in advance saves you time and money and increases your chances for success."
taurus,2013-02-17,"Money problems may be highlighted today, yet focusing on your fiscal obligations gives you a better sense of where you actually stand. The greatest danger to your economic well-being comes from your uncharacteristic lack of concentration now. Fortunately, by consciously slowing down your thoughts you can regain control and follow through on what is most important. It's currently smarter to do one thing right than to do lots of things halfheartedly."
gemini,2013-02-17,"The subjective Moon's return to your sign is a bit confusing today, for her square to nebulous Neptune makes it tough to share your needs without becoming overly emotional. If you find yourself in a stressful discussion, clearly let the other person know that you're having difficulty expressing your innermost feelings. Ultimately, speaking the truth can be a catalyst that helps the conversation flow more easily."
cancer,2013-02-17,"You are a walking paradox today because as hard as you try to be logical, your thoughts are colored by idealistic emotional considerations. On the surface it appears that you're willing to let go of an old resentment; unfortunately, it remains more of a struggle than anyone else realizes. Whether or not you share your internal process now, don't slip into denial. Life will continue to improve over the days ahead as long as you acknowledge your heart."
leo,2013-02-17,"It's challenging to get much finished today because everyone seems to have a different notion of what you should be doing. Additionally, matters are made worse if each person tries to convince you that his or her plan is better than yours. Meanwhile, you would rather continue unencumbered on your current path. Be firm but kind while asking others to let you figure out the day for yourself. Follow your instincts when deciding what to do next."
virgo,2013-02-17,"You may have to play different roles for different people today, which could leave you feeling uncertain about your true identity. It's not like you to be unsure of your place in family relationships, but now a lack of clarity might increase your anxiety throughout the weekend. Your best strategy involves putting extra effort into unfinished chores instead of trying to please everyone else. Nevertheless, your real friends love you for who you are and not for what you do."
libra,2013-02-17,"You may be very productive today, but your current accomplishments are more creative than practical. Everything you touch now has the potential of turning into an artistic masterpiece. Although this could be lots of fun, you must be careful not to spread your energy too thin or you will end up more frustrated than fulfilled. Each potential project has an advantage and a disadvantage. Make sure you explore both before jumping in with both feet."
scorpio,2013-02-17,"You're extremely rational today when it comes to your feelings, leading you to remain rather restrained. Ironically, you have the ability to objectively analyze your emotions now without necessarily being overwhelmed by them. A healthy dose of conscious detachment empowers you to tackle a serious issue in a positive manner. Don't waste the day with one distraction after another. Just figure out where you can make the most progress and dig in."
sagittarius,2013-02-17,"Without being overly judgmental, consider how a long-termn ally might actually be preventing you from doing what you wish today. However, this annoying situation is less about running into an obstacle than it is about others encouraging you to head off in a new direction now. Thankfully, there's no need to shut out your supporters, but don't let anyone pull you too far off track. Never forget you are the master of your own destiny."
capricorn,2013-02-17,"There are plenty of things you want to accomplish today, but you may not know where to begin. You might even bite off more than you can chew, only to realize how little you actually get done. The best remedy for this potential problem is to make a list early in the day and then stick to your agenda, no matter what happens. Ironically, temporarily narrowing your options now can lead you to other opportunities in the near future."
aquarius,2013-02-17,"Your stress level might escalate if you choose work over fun. The lighthearted Gemini Moon is visiting your 5th House of Spontaneity, making this a great day to let your inner child out to play. You deserve some time off now, and there is nothing wrong with letting loose as long as you're willing to make up tomorrow for what you skip out on today."
pisces,2013-02-17,"Complex circumstances unfolding at home could draw your attention away from your previous plans. You may be seduced into a complicated web of relationship dynamics that are entangling other members of your family. Although your natural tendency is to help anyone you in need, it will be healthier for all involved if you're extremely clear about your boundaries. Sometimes knowing when to walk away is the kindest thing you can do."
aries,2013-02-18,"The Sun's entry into your 12th House of Endings requires you to get ready for the upcoming action, and there's no time to waste. If you have recently overextended yourself by taking on too many projects, make an effort to clean up after your energy binge, but don't be too self-judgmental in the process. Just start now by paring back your commitments and doing whatever it takes over the next few weeks to prepare for what's around the corner."
taurus,2013-02-18,"It may feel as if your world is about to open up, so take this chance to think about your future. Unfortunately, the uncertainty makes you anxious, especially if your goals are out of sync with your current life circumstances. You might convince yourself that drastic action is needed to get back onto the proper path, but don't push so hard for change today. Adopting a methodical approach to your long-term goals is better than trying to do everything all at once. Life is a marathon, not a sprint."
gemini,2013-02-18,"You may consider re-evaluating your career path and making big changes as the Sun journeys through your 10th House of Status during the next four weeks. You have an opportunity to become more aware of your place in the world now. However, you might quickly regret letting this chance slip by, so make up your mind to take action while there's still time. Thankfully, you could see positive results sooner than you think if you can visualize your way to success."
cancer,2013-02-18,"These next few weeks are likely to bring a much-needed emotional boost. It's not that you're jumping up and down with excitement; it's just that you feel comfortable in your own skin and are willing to stand up for your beliefs in order to maintain your integrity. Don't worry about the details now; concentrate on your highest ideals. Your current vision is comprehensive, so be serious about making positive change while you can still see the big picture."
leo,2013-02-18,"You may attempt to gloss over criticism that you receive today from someone you consider to be family. However, acting in a cavalier manner could lead to more problems than you realize. Listen carefully to what others are saying and don't try to dodge the truth. Take feedback as constructive guidance, even if it doesn't feel as good as denial in the present moment. Your willingness to work on self-improvement now can fundamentally change the dynamics of a relationship for the better."
virgo,2013-02-18,"You have a lot to gain in the next month by taking time to look back before moving ahead as the Sun travels through your 7th House of Others. Review all that you have accomplished since your last birthday and acknowledge everyone who has helped you along the way. Creating new goals for the balance of your year is critical to your happiness. Luckily, you can make nearly anything happen if you focus your intentions and then work hard to reach your dreams."
libra,2013-02-18,"If your thoughts have been aimed at creative endeavors, you may feel as if something is beginning to shift today. Instead of fostering an artistic approach to your work, seek ways to apply what you already started in a more practical manner. But be careful not to overdo it; it's not healthy to take all the fun out of your life. To counteract the possibility of boredom now, initiate a new activity that has regularity to it, like taking a class or joining a club. Balancing work and play will put a smile back on your face."
scorpio,2013-02-18,"You may feel revitalized as the Sun occupies your 5th House of Fun and Games for the next several weeks. However, your surge of energy might not be apparent to others. Inspiration is returning to your imagination; you are beginning to feel more emotionally in touch with others around you. But don't worry if you still feel the weight of responsibility on your shoulders. Making time to express what's in your heart will help to lighten your load."
sagittarius,2013-02-18,"Not only are you maintaining your busy pace today, you're also having fun doing it. Although the party doesn't need to come crashing to an end, you realize that you have some serious thinking to do, and this pressure tempts you to withdraw from social activity. But don't just hit the escape button yet; you'll be happier in the long run if you deal with what's making you feel uncomfortable rather than avoiding it. Taking care of business promptly gives you a sense of satisfaction and a valid reason to reward yourself."
capricorn,2013-02-18,"Confusing times may be upon you as logical analysis fails to explain why your day seems to be running out of control. Even if you have spent considerable time making certain that you're ready for what happens next, there are still variables that you just cannot manage. Don't be too surprised by the twists and turns on the path of life now. Sometimes the journey is more important than the destination."
aquarius,2013-02-18,"You might actually breathe a sigh of relief as the willful Sun leaves your sign today and heads for the open seas of irrational Pisces. However, it still could take time to see where your new route will take you. Happily, the uncertainty will begin to settle down as you travel along. Problems won't likely be solved overnight, yet it's reassuring to know that there is plenty of time to plot your new course once you're already on your way."
pisces,2013-02-18,"The warm rays of the Sun shine on you now, illuminating your imagination as it visits your sign for the next month. Your fantasies are especially active now, but you might be unable to effectively communicate your visions to anyone else. Powerful emotions can muddy the waters or even block your self-expression. But don't waste energy trying to overcome your inertia, for it won't last long. In the meantime, write down your dreams, but wait a few days before revealing them to others."
aries,2013-02-19,"Your day may be full of distracting noise with the chatty Gemini Moon occupying your 3rd House of Immediate Environment. Fortunately, you're capable of pulling brilliant solutions out of thin air now. Your acquaintances are amazed at what you can do because you don't seem to be limited by the same rules as everyone else. Even if you are bold enough to bend reality to your liking, don't push your luck too far or you could unexpectedly lose your advantage."
taurus,2013-02-19,"A combination of fact and fiction keeps you on edge today, even if you try to keep these two worlds distinct. Your judgment isn't impaired; it's just that the current circumstances can be quite complicated now, making it nearly impossible to wrap your mind around the truth. Trusting your intuition is a smart idea as long as you are ready to change your position as you learn more relevant information throughout the day."
gemini,2013-02-19,"Your feelings change rapidly now that the emotional Moon is in your sign. However, wide mood swings may be more frustrating for everyone else than for you. It seems as if others want you to make up your mind, even if you can't commit to any single path. You still have plenty to think about, so don't let anyone force you to choose yet. The longer you can postpone your final answer, the happier you will be with your decision."
cancer,2013-02-19,"Your careful choice of words can hide deep feelings that you want to keep private today. However, you may be convinced to reveal your inner secrets if you are fortunate enough to connect with someone you respect. An emotionally safe relationship could be exactly what you need to encourage you to divulge your dreams. Whatever path you choose, don't try to rationalize your behavior to anyone else. Trust your instincts now rather than logic."
leo,2013-02-19,"You could have trouble assuming authority if you haven't earned your respect the old-fashioned way, yet you might try to play the role of a superhero, anyhow. Pulling off this amazing feat today may actually be possible if you don't become arrogant, but it will require a bit of finesse. It's up to you to find the simple solution that eludes everyone else. Your best bet is to be as direct as possible without steamrolling over anyone in the process."
virgo,2013-02-19,"You're not likely to be satisfied by resting on past accomplishments now, because the Gemini Moon's presence in your 10th House of Status prompts you to demonstrate your cleverness at work. You may need to step outside your comfort zone and, fortunately, you can do it now without a lot of hard work. Don't worry if nothing is falling into place yet; it will all make sense at the last minute. Meanwhile, jump in without hesitating and enjoy figuring out your way as you go."
libra,2013-02-19,"You may become obsessed with a brilliant new idea that comes to you today. Although you might believe that you stumbled on to something quite ingenious, you won't really know until you attempt to put your plan into action. Nevertheless, it's wise to assume that your strategy is a good one until reality tells you otherwise. Retreat if you must to tweak the details and then try again in a few days."
scorpio,2013-02-19,"You appear to have the support of others today, but it's difficult to tell how loyal your new followers might be in a crisis. You would like to get a handle on a situation that is eluding your control because of everyone else's tenuous involvement. Nevertheless, you don't need to hold back; show the world what you can do. Thankfully, others will appreciate your initiative and integrity; they might even show their approval and come through with a commitment at the last minute."
sagittarius,2013-02-19,"Interactions with friends may be very beneficial today, especially if you are precise about expressing exactly what you need. Unfortunately, you can really mess things up if you are too selfish in your behavior. Don't abuse your power; just focus on your role in each active relationship. Stepping into your future feels safer when others are by your side."
capricorn,2013-02-19,"You continue to develop your work skills now as you strive for self-determination. The good news is that even the simplest of thoughts can be utilized as the basis of your new foundation. Although it's crucial to conserve energy and be methodical about your forward movement, don't take your eyes off the distant horizon. Remaining practical while visualizing the future is a difficult balance to achieve, yet it's exactly what's required to build a bridge to your dreams."
aquarius,2013-02-19,"It's challenging to hold your current position between past memories and future goals. Nevertheless, it's a crucial part of your strategy now. Don't try to reinvent the wheel as you start from the beginning. Instead, rework an existing plan that just lacks one critical element. Figure out what you need to add by enlisting assistance from someone who supports your effort. Knowing when to ask for help is your secret ingredient to creating success."
pisces,2013-02-19,"You may feel anxious as you try to keep your emotions in check. It's tough to make progress today because you're so curious that you are distracted by one thing after another. Thankfully, your concentrated intentions overcome nearly any obstacle, but the final outcome will be determined by your attitude. Instead of worrying that you could miss the fun, be serious now so you can play later."
aries,2013-02-20,"It may be time to honor your need for privacy, even if you are accustomed to spending a lot of your energy engaged in activities with your friends and associates. You independent Rams often like to work alone, for your patience grows thin when others cannot keep up with you. But now your penchant for solitude might be more about recharging your emotional batteries so you can head back out revitalized, ready to conquer the world."
taurus,2013-02-20,"You're more tentative about sharing your feelings now because you don't want to risk your security. Unfortunately, keeping secrets can exhaust you because you have to focus attention on monitoring what you say. But your unexpressed emotions give you away today, so face your fears and resist the temptation to go quiet. Act proactively; engage in deep and meaningful conversations by choice. There's no need to wait for anyone else to drag you into a conversation if you go there first."
gemini,2013-02-20,"The pace of life slows down today, bringing you more time to integrate a recent change of heart. You may need to reconsider your goals or even change your position on a professional matter. If something totally unexpected is tossed at you, do your best to catch it in stride. But mind your own business now; any extra concern that you put toward someone else's problems might only make matters worse. Realigning your priorities makes sense because you have plenty to do on your own."
cancer,2013-02-20,"It's difficult to know exactly what you feel today since your moods can radically shift from moment to moment now that the Moon's back in your sign. You may go from wanting to pour your heart out to a friend or lover to withdrawing to the safety of your hidden cave. Try not to make any long-lasting decisions until your feelings settle back down. In the meantime, let your emotions flow naturally without trying to change them."
leo,2013-02-20,"Although others seem to be looking right at you, you still may feel as if you aren't being seen. You don't understand how they can miss the point as you hold your head high and carry out your assigned tasks, even if your heart is hurting. Remember, if you are having an overly emotional day, a humble disclosure to a trusted friend might bring the recognition you so desperately seek. Take the time you need to process your feelings before you step back into the spotlight."
virgo,2013-02-20,"You vacillate between accepting the support your colleagues offer today and fearfully pushing them away. Although you appreciate the camaraderie, you also need to know you can be self-sufficient. Try to soften your attitude, even if think you're being overly dependent on others now. It's a sign of intelligence and strength to openly embrace help when it is offered. There's no need to let pride stand in the way when someone wants to see you shine."
libra,2013-02-20,"You might be swimming in tumultuous emotional waters now, unless you can let go of the control you believe you need. However, you're not in charge of anyone's feelings but your own. Instead of trying to fix the situation by making someone more comfortable, concentrate on yourself. Once you've adjusted your attitude, then others may have the freedom to do the same. Turn down the noise and listen to your heart."
scorpio,2013-02-20,"You're content exploring your feelings in the privacy of your own space today. Your emotional security is extremely important now and you may not be satisfied until you feel completely safe and sound in your environment. Thankfully, you can journey nearly anywhere you desire within the wilds of your imagination. Just don't forget to demonstrate your colorful creativity while you have the chance."
sagittarius,2013-02-20,There may be an expansion-contraction dilemma developing now as your normally cavalier attitude assumes a more cautious stance today. But don't succumb to the pressures of social expectations. You can't please others if you don't acknowledge your own desires first. Chill out and give yourself permission to withdraw from the party if you really want some time alone. A little peace and quiet might be just what you need to reinvigorate your spirit.
capricorn,2013-02-20,"You may not believe you have sufficient patience to hold someone's hand while they go through an emotional meltdown; however, it could be exactly what's required today. Alternatively, it might be you that's the needy one at this time -- making you even less patient with yourself than with another person. Either way, acknowledge that the expression of feelings doesn't always fit neatly into a schedule. Being extra flexible enables you to stick with the process without being in such a hurry."
aquarius,2013-02-20,"You may be challenged by relationships at work now because your lack of clarity makes it hard to confront your needs and recognize how they differ from those of your peers. Your extra efforts might even seem to be a waste of time today. Although retreating into your own world isn't the answer, gently creating extra space between you and others gives you room to honor your own feelings. Once you re-establish your center of gravity, you will be ready to reengage with a more positive attitude."
pisces,2013-02-20,"Although your current tendency might be toward isolation today, you still may indulge in romantic play. Ironically, your ability to enjoy yourself makes you more productive now that the evocative Moon is moving through your 5th House of Spontaneity. Try channeling this energy into creative expressions, whether for work or for your own amusement. Your dreams are the source of your greatest inspiration."
aries,2013-02-21,"Although the shortest distance between two points is your preferred route, your path might not be so direct today. Your boundaries are fuzzy and it's difficult to discern what's real from what's imagined. Be careful about openly expressing your feelings now because you may be more attracted to your dreams than to a particular person or idea. Even if you find yourself professing love, postpone any commitment until your logic returns."
taurus,2013-02-21,"Idealism motivates you more than practicality today, but you could benefit by joining forces with a work group, social club, or political organization rather than going it alone. However, putting your thoughts in order might require you to spend some quality time by yourself. Although setting your goals high inspires you to reach for the stars, exercising caution improves your chances of success."
gemini,2013-02-21,"You are dreaming about your potential success in the outer world, and your fantasies can inspire you to do great things now regardless of your current work situation. However, problems could arise quickly if your aspirations are out of touch with reality. Let your mind roam today as you visualize all the possibilities ahead. But then zero in on a reachable goal and create a concrete plan to attain it."
cancer,2013-02-21,"It's nearly impossible to keep your feet on the ground today because your head is floating up in the clouds of illusion. You might wish you could escape into a sci-fi movie or a romance novel. Fortunately, your optimism about the future motivates you to make big plans. Indulge your fantasies, but remember that you may actually get the opportunity to live the adventure you are now imagining if you're willing to work hard to make your dreams come true."
leo,2013-02-21,"You might have weird feelings that are difficult to understand because your heightened sensitivity has you treading on unfamiliar ground today. On one hand, it's quite exciting that you're so empathic now; it's fascinating to know what others are feeling. But on the other hand, it's tricky to separate your emotions from what you pick up from everyone else. You could be easily swayed, so try not to make important decisions until you know which voice is your own."
virgo,2013-02-21,"You want to be seen by your peers and appreciated by those you love, but the image that you are projecting now might not be the true you. You can do an amazing job of bending reality to meet your needs today, but this is a dangerous game to play. Others may not see through your illusions immediately, but the drama will play out and eventually the truth will be revealed. To avoid complications, use each interaction as if it is a mirror that reflects your soul."
libra,2013-02-21,"You are motivated to discuss subjects that are normally difficult to pin down, but you may not be as clear as you think today. Sharing your visions by putting them into words doesn't make them real. Unfortunately, you can deceive yourself now because of how well you describe the indescribable. Remember, this is a fantastic day to tell a story or write a poem. It's more of a challenge to state the truth exactly like it is, so use your skills to work on a creative project rather than attempting to be overly practical."
scorpio,2013-02-21,"Exquisitely beautiful visions can be the source of inspiration today, prompting you to spread joy or create a work of art. You are particularly enchanted by a romantic or artistic attraction, and might fall deeper into a fantasy than you ever intended. You have a tendency to look for an escape route now, especially if you are falling in love or if you are avoiding it. Either way, keep the facts in perspective so you won't have to deal with disillusionment later on."
sagittarius,2013-02-21,"You can slip into the role of a shape-shifter today because your feelings impact your physical presence. Others may see you as larger-than-life if you are feeling good. But if you have self-doubt, then you actually might seem smaller and less powerful to those around you. You are currently aware of more than what you logically know, so remember to consciously use your intuition in positive ways."
capricorn,2013-02-21,You may be drawn into a philosophical discussion today or enticed into taking a journey of spiritual exploration. Metaphysical subjects carry you away from the outer world of work and put you in touch with the inner dimensions of dreams and imagination. Be careful about idealizing the future because you can gloss over a critical piece of information on your search to create a more perfect life for yourself. Blend the magical with the practical to actualize your ambitions.
aquarius,2013-02-21,"Your ability to quickly discern what's most important pays off since you're currently more likely to receive intuitive flashes when you least expect them. These messages from your subconscious can be confusing if they don't fit in with what's happening in your life. But don't ignore your inner voice today, for it's telling you something that you really need to hear. Save your judgment for later. For now, just pay attention to the subtleties of your imagination and enjoy the ride."
pisces,2013-02-21,"Your key planet Neptune hooks up with the Sun today, revealing unseen mysteries in broad daylight. You could have a momentary glimpse of a wider universe as the crack in in the cosmic egg breaks the shell that normally contains your rational world, giving you a whole new way of looking at things. Don't be hard on yourself if you don't know what to do next. Allow yourself a few more days to float around before returning to earth."
aries,2013-02-22,"You are facing a conflict between needing to work and wanting to play, yet you might not receive enough support to ease your current concerns. Even if you have been burning the midnight oil to get everything finished, it's not yet time to slow down. Pace yourself and tie up as many loose ends as possible. Your enjoyment will be sweeter if you have something tangible to celebrate."
taurus,2013-02-22,"The more resistant you are to change today, the greater your dilemma. If you put too much energy into holding on to an indefensible position, your problems may grow worse -- no matter how convincing your arguments are now. However, everything can fall into place if you remain flexible without sacrificing your integrity. Meeting others halfway allows everyone to happily move on."
gemini,2013-02-22,"You might keep your feelings quiet most of the day, but find yourself wanting to talk to everyone about everything later in the afternoon. Unfortunately, you may not know when to stop your endless chatter once you get started. Your co-workers and friends probably don't need to know all the gory details of your story at this time. Just convey the main idea as accurately as you can and hope for the best."
cancer,2013-02-22,"You know exactly what you're feeling today and it's unlikely that anyone will be able to talk you out of your experience. Your intense emotions are running extra deep now, and things get complicated when others don't understand the subtleties of your heart. For you, anything short of the full story misses the very essence of what you're trying to communicate. However, be open to taking a path between the extremes of disclosing too much personal information and saying nothing at all."
leo,2013-02-22,"Even if you are trying to settle down your emotional drama, it's still a hectic time now that the evocative Moon is back in your sign. It may seem appropriate to share your feelings if you have a strong attraction to someone today. Nevertheless, your behavior might raise complications at work. Take a few moments and think about the possible consequences of your actions. And remember, there's no undo button to push once you express yourself."
virgo,2013-02-22,"You are uncomfortable with your feelings today if they don't support the circumstances of a current relationship. Although your concerns may not be evident to anyone else, an overbearing person might pressure you to say what's on your mind. Nevertheless, you are wise to hold out and keep your mouth shut. Time is on your side; the less you say until after Monday's Full Moon, the more you'll be in control."
libra,2013-02-22,"You may take bold action today to make your point about an important friendship. You might even be struggling with a romantic issue, but others won't likely comprehend the depth of your feelings now. Although you want to make them understand, the harder you try, the less they get it. Behaving in ways that are true to your heart is more productive than struggling to convince anyone to believe you. Actions speak louder than words."
scorpio,2013-02-22,"Seek ways to be more flexible because today won't likely conform to the schedule you already have in place. Allow extra time for all activities since you may not have as much control now as you might like. Fortunately, your passionate approach to life is your secret weapon, as long as you remember to let go of your attachment to any specific outcome. The journey is more important than the destination."
sagittarius,2013-02-22,"You can feel the exhilaration from riding waves of extreme optimism today. However, you might attempt to settle down the energy because you have too much to do and very little time to waste. An important project requires your full attention while the limitations of your calendar are impacting your exciting plans. You have a very small margin for error now, so concentrate on your goals and get to work. If you stay focused, you may be pleasantly surprised by how much you accomplish by the end of the day."
capricorn,2013-02-22,"Even if you prefer to stay on your chosen course, there's a good reason to deviate from your plans now. Although others may think that you are inflexible, nothing could be further from the truth. Since you need stability in your life that you can count on, you're quite proficient at changing your tune when pressured by reality. Responding to the current changes without delay enables you to hold your life steady in spite of the challenges ahead."
aquarius,2013-02-22,"You may be frustrated if you have been trying to make improvements at work. Luckily, someone might ride into your life on a white horse and rescue you from your dilemma. Although today's events won't likely be a total solution, they still can reduce the pressure for a while. Remember, the answers to your current prayers are not logical; real solutions are intuitive now and come from within."
pisces,2013-02-22,"You can be quite productive at work today, even if you're anxious about your inability to perform up to everyone's expectations. But don't waste your energy worrying about anyone else's judgment. Instead, just take your job seriously and give it your very best effort. Ultimately, no one will blame you if your intentions are pure and your work ethic is strong. Perfection is one illusion you don't have to chase."
aries,2013-02-23,"Even if you aren't the jealous type, you may be ready to swing into action today so you can demonstrate just how much you care about someone special. Be careful because your behavior might inadvertently set the stage for someone else to be possessive of you. Honor your need for independence by processing your emotions in a healthy manner rather than delivering ultimatums."
taurus,2013-02-23,"You may be treated as royalty by your family, only to find that your good intentions don't go as far once you're out in the real world. You are more likely to gain the respect of others if your actions are aligned with your life purpose. Set priorities but pay particular attention to your role in the community. It's time to give back to society, even if it's more comfortable to stay at home."
gemini,2013-02-23,"Today seems busy with the lively Leo Moon moving through your 3rd House of Distractions. Although you may prefer to kick back and relax, the universe has different plans for you now. You are being drawn into someone else's drama and you might not be able to escape it. Nevertheless, you could minimize your involvement by doing what you can to help, but keeping your opinions to yourself on matters that are not your business."
cancer,2013-02-23,"If you have been putting off money-related chores, it's a perfect day to catch up on paperwork with the Moon visiting your 2nd House of Personal Resources today. Luckily, you have a healthy attitude about handling your finances now, so you might as well get to work. However, avoid buying something extravagant on a whim, since it's currently wiser to save for a rainy day."
leo,2013-02-23,"You might be facing your own fears of being vulnerable, but hiding them doesn't help matters in the realm of love and romance. Your desires are quite strong today while the Moon is in your sign, and, thankfully, you're able to project yourself in a favorable light. However, you might discover that your interpersonal relationships are reflecting a new level of intensity. What you want could be changing now, so rethink your personal goals instead of losing yourself in the details."
virgo,2013-02-23,"Be gentle with yourself today, even if you realize that you made a mistake. No matter how much you currently have to do, make time for your own needs. Being alone for a while can accelerate your healing process. And, even if you don't believe that you deserve forgiveness, act as if you do until you get the hang of it. Others will learn to treat you with love and respect if that's how you treat yourself."
libra,2013-02-23,"Fulfilling responsibilities by delivering on your promises may be the highlight of your day, even if you have more exciting plans in mind. Creative play is an important part of your life and it may be extra frustrating if you don't have the time for it now. However, don't set aside all your personal needs just so you can live up to someone else's expectations. Balance your service to others with nurturing yourself to get the best from both worlds."
scorpio,2013-02-23,"You may receive recognition today for a job well done, but you can be so tightly wrapped up in your emotional world that you don't realize how much others value you. It's difficult for the positive vibes to get through to you if you doubt yourself. Don't climb so deep into your own well that you can't see the bright lights that are shining from above."
sagittarius,2013-02-23,"Your natural enthusiasm keeps your head above water now, even if the seas are very stormy. However, it's difficult to know whether your optimism is based on real potential or on unrealistic fantasy. Either way, use your current willpower to overcome any fears that might creep into your thinking, especially if an emotional issue is brewing on the home front. It's healthier to sink into the truth and face the facts now than having to deal with the situation after it grows out of control."
capricorn,2013-02-23,"The Moon's current visit to your 8th House of Joint Finances indicates that someone could come to your rescue today, even if you aren't looking for help. If a current project is incomplete, there are people who can play a significant role by bringing encouragement, connections and resources. Don't try to do everything just to prove your self-sufficiency. Graciously accept the gifts the universe offers now even if you would rather do it on your own."
aquarius,2013-02-23,"You are at a major crossroads today and your current choices will have important repercussions down the road. Although you may be satisfied with clinging to an old dream and continuing along on your present path, reviewing your goals could lead to a positive change of direction. Don't be afraid to imagine the most idealistic outcome. However, anchoring your vivid imagination with a concrete plan greatly improves your chances of reaching your destination."
pisces,2013-02-23,"Your imagination continues to run away from reality as the Sun aligns with otherworldly Neptune in your sign. You are seeing your world through rose-colored glasses, placing practical decisions out of sight now. Share your dreams with those you trust while your visions are unrestrained by reality. But don't fall into the trap of thinking you must make a critical choice today about the direction of your life. There will be time for that once your clarity returns."
aries,2013-02-24,"Your hard work and strategic planning seem to be on the edge of paying off now, but you still might worry that you missed your chance. Your progress may slow down or even stop today but don't be concerned; everything is actually on track. It's just going to take longer than you originally expected. Instead of thinking that something's gone wrong, use your extra time to review your plans and improve them however you can. Ultimately, the more prepared you are the more productive you will be when the pace picks up."
taurus,2013-02-24,"If you have big plans for your future, you might become overwhelmed thinking about how much time it will take to reach your goals. You're committed to succeeding, but you may need to apply yourself harder than you imagined. But even if the upcoming week looks like a busy one, kick back and chill today while you still have the chance. A little rest and relaxation improves your attitude and your energy, revitalizing you for your next adventure."
gemini,2013-02-24,"Your key planet Mercury is currently retrograde in your 10th House of Career, possibly stirring up anxiety about not being able to complete your work in a timely manner. However, an obstacle might actually turn into a blessing that gives you more time to prepare for the new responsibilities that are coming your way. Take the changes in stride; amazing opportunities are closer than you think."
cancer,2013-02-24,"You may doubt the wisdom of recently made plans, even if they were still sounding good to your ears as late as yesterday. Rational Mercury's retrograde turn in your 9th House of Big Ideas prompts you to question your assumptions as you review your schedule for the next week or so. Oddly enough, it's hard to commit to anything now, so use this time to analyze the alternative paths without making any major decisions yet. Stretch your horizons and explore all your options."
leo,2013-02-24,"Life may seem like an uphill battle today, even with the Leo Moon reflecting the heartfelt energy of your sign. You might feel as if you're meeting resistance, but you can't directly confront your opponent. The shadows hold mysterious secrets and it's not clear what's holding you back. If you are running into problems dealing with an authority figure, there is a reason for the delay. Don't try to outmaneuver reality; instead, lay low and learn what you can do to be more effective."
virgo,2013-02-24,"Your key planet Mercury normally enables you to discern which facts are most significant. However, clever Mercury is back-stepping in nebulous Pisces now, making it impossible to know what's real. The more you strive for concrete answers, the more difficult it is to find them. Don't worry about solving problems today; cut yourself some slack and take some time off, no matter what anyone else says. Your clarity will return after the intensity of tomorrow's Full Moon is over."
libra,2013-02-24,"You may be unnecessarily hard on yourself now because you really want to do what is right. You are willing to put in extra effort and you hope your actions demonstrate what you can do. But don't let authority be taken from you before you make your case. Losing your temper won't help either, so treat the current situation like a chess game and plan your next move strategically."
scorpio,2013-02-24,"Although everything looks good on paper now, executing your plan may be more difficult than you anticipated. Fortunately, you're not as concerned with current events as you are with your long-term objectives. Apply your wisdom to whatever is going on today, but be aware that you might have to make some adjustments in your approach. Even the best theories need to be tested and refined along the way."
sagittarius,2013-02-24,"You may be in a difficult situation at home today because interpersonal dynamics are complicated and you might read a situation wrong. You could even believe that someone else holds the key to your current happiness. You don't like it when you lose control over your life, especially when you're standing on shaky ground. Regaining your center of gravity is easier than you think; just concentrate on being truthful and the resistances you face will begin to melt away."
capricorn,2013-02-24,"You are not comfortable today because your thoughts drift into fantasies without warning. Even if you attempt to concentrate on the work at hand, it's difficult to maintain a steady focus. Paradoxically, you might need to let go of your tight grip on reality and float into dreamland for a bit. Scheduling some time for relaxation, meditation, or contemplation is a useful strategy. You'll be able to return to your responsibilities with a fresh perspective, empowering you to get things back under control."
aquarius,2013-02-24,"You can rely on powerful allies to lead you in the right direction today. However, don't expect others to sugarcoat what they tell you. If you have to swallow a bitter pill of reality, then do it as gracefully as possible. There's no need to make anything look better than it actually is now, since whatever isn't working should just be set aside. Instead of wasting energy on an outdated plan, consider creating a brilliant new one, altogether."
pisces,2013-02-24,"You can only see those things that you want to see now, but unexpected events bring hidden problems clearly into view. You won't be able to bury your head in the sand for too much longer. Although you may be prepared to do the hard mental work required to overcome the obstacles in your path, you still have to eliminate your negative thinking. Share your concerns with someone you respect; meaningful conversations could help you to figure out what to do next."
aries,2013-02-25,"Your emotional IQ isn't as high as you think today, so don't rely solely on your instincts. Chances are that you're blowing a fantasy out of proportion and confusing the results with reality. But getting to the truth enables you to make important changes in your daily regimen now that the Virgo Full Moon brightens your 6th House of Health and Diet. However, it's not necessary to take on too much; it's better to make one small improvement that lasts rather than many that don't."
taurus,2013-02-25,"Your resources may be spread too thin now as your exuberance makes it tough for you to say no to another commitment. Although you're not usually one to take on more than you can deliver, your judgment is off kilter now. Even if you want to do it all, the meticulous Virgo Full Moon illuminates your 5th House of Self-Expression, reminding you to pay attention to the details when it comes to matters of the heart. Paring back your social calendar for a while helps you stay on track with the ones you love."
gemini,2013-02-25,"Today's Virgo Full Moon occupies your 4th House of Domestic Issues, stirring up tension at home that you can't seem to avoid. However, you can put this stress to good use if you're clever. If you are being overwhelmed with too many facts, you might try to escape into your vivid imagination. Fortunately, a little conscious visualization may have a positive impact. Sift through the noise in your environment so you have the mind space to make an intelligent decision about where you go from here."
cancer,2013-02-25,"You have a deep affinity with the Moon, so you can't help but feel the earthy Virgo Full Moon's presence in your 3rd House of Communication today. However, your emotions may be floating off into the boundless blue sky because it seems like there are no walls to constrain you. Forget about justifying your feelings now; instead, just let them flow. You can always pull back into your comfort zone later on when you're ready to retreat."
leo,2013-02-25,"You can make your contribution to a project look good on the surface with the productive Virgo Full Moon shining in your resourceful 2nd house today. But behind the scenes, something isn't quite as perfect it seems. It feels as if the simple truth keeps slipping out of your hands, just as you get close to finding it. Unfortunately, you could make things worse now by believing that you already know what's going on. But don't think that your way is the only way; time will tell which path is the best."
virgo,2013-02-25,"Today's Full Moon shines her light in your sign, flooding you with a variety of emotions. Your feelings have been building in intensity for the past few days, but now it's time to acknowledge what's in your heart, even if it runs counter to rational thought. Although you can't just ignore the facts, everything will start to make sense when you surrender your need for logic."
libra,2013-02-25,"Your emotions are stretched as far as they can go now with the Virgo Full Moon falling in your 12th House of Destiny. Although your thoughts may be running helter-skelter, it's important to remain enthusiastic, especially if you haven't reached your destination yet. There's no payoff in being overly self-critical today. Instead of dwelling on past performances, set your sites on a new round of goals and give it your very best."
scorpio,2013-02-25,"The Virgo Full Moon lights up your 11th House of Friends and Associates today, making this a great time to reassess your social position and reconsider what you want out of your relationships. You have a high level of awareness about your current situation now and realize that you're not on the trajectory you prefer. Somehow you've been sidetracked, but your new perspective about a creative project can also help you understand how to make things work more efficiently in every aspect of your life."
sagittarius,2013-02-25,"Today's Virgo Full Moon highlights your 10th House of Career, adding stress to your life as you review your goals for the next couple of weeks. Thankfully, your key planet Jupiter is in the mix, lifting your spirits so high that you can also see the potential of nearly anything. Don't attempt to make big changes yet; your best strategy now is to make many tiny adjustments until the current turbulence settles down."
capricorn,2013-02-25,"You could reap the rewards of your work sooner than you expect because today's Virgo Full Moon in your 9th House of Future Vision demands that you quit holding on to your fears and actually go for it. But even if you fail to reach your goal now, the real news is about the doors of opportunity that continue to open. Don't get too lost in the details of a bargain; just focus on the big picture and keep inching forward on the path of least resistance."
aquarius,2013-02-25,"You may be struggling with the intense energy from the Virgo Full Moon that rattles your 8th House of Intimacy today. You might even feel as if you're emotionally in over your head. Thankfully, your cleverness and resourcefulness help you maintain enough balance to keep your ship afloat, even in an imbalanced situation. Relationships will become more manageable as the reflective Moon wanes over the next few days. Soon you'll be looking back at an amazing experience from the calmer waters ahead."
pisces,2013-02-25,"This Virgo Full Moon lights up your 7th House of Partners, and with exuberant Jupiter involved, you have no shortage of great ideas. You're in communication mode, even if you have trouble finding an audience. Try not to overcompensate by talking up a storm once you get someone's attention. Tread carefully because others may need more emotional support than you can offer. Establishing clear boundaries now enables you to have healthy relationships in the future."
aries,2013-02-26,Be wise and tone down the delivery of your message because you probably seem more belligerent today than you intend. You might not realize how much energy you're putting into everything you say now that your ruling planet Mars is agitating communicator Mercury. You will be much more successful at telling your story if you communicate it without such a hard edge. Softening your words accomplishes more than coming on too strong.
taurus,2013-02-26,"It's challenging to keep your cool in a social situation today because you may have reached the end of your rope. You believe that you have been waiting long enough. Fortunately, you realize what has to happen next in order to restore balance to your life, but knowing what to do isn't the same thing as doing it. Turning your ideas into action can be challenging. Nevertheless, acting with firm and consistent pressure is more effective than just pushing harder and harder until something gives."
gemini,2013-02-26,Communication at work may be strained now that your ruling planet Mercury is moving retrograde in your 10th House of Career. Your frustration could prompt you to lose your tempter if you believe your choices are thwarted. But don't bite the bait if someone tries to lure you into an open disagreement. It's smarter to avoid an unnecessary argument because it won't likely bring you closer to reaching your goals. Taking the high road demonstrates your flexibility and helps to make everyone feel better.
cancer,2013-02-26,"Postpone signing an important document or making a final agreement today, because you won't likely be satisfied with any deal that comes to a conclusion now. It may appear as if you are procrastinating, but there's a purpose to your delaying tactics. Moving quickly isn't in your best interest, so if someone is pushing you, gently push back. Don't be in a hurry; the energy will shift over the next few weeks, improving your chances of getting what you want."
leo,2013-02-26,"You may think that you're being direct in what you say, but you have so much going on now that you probably appear more scattered than you realize. You might even begin sentences without completing them, which can drive others crazy. Eliminating a few extraneous activities from your daily schedule eases the tension for you and everyone else. You'll be able to follow through with greater efficiency with less on your mind."
virgo,2013-02-26,"You may be engaged in a battle of wits today as your key planet Mercury backs into warrior Mars. Unfortunately, there might not be a clear winner or loser no matter how intent you are on coming out on top. No one benefits if anyone feels depleted or demoralized from unnecessary fighting. Rather than aiming for victory, set your sights on cooperation so everyone involved can win."
libra,2013-02-26,"Your co-workers may look to you for guidance today, even if you don't know what to tell them. But don't try to be profound; simply speak your truth as a compassionate observer. Your unique perspective gives you a much wider range of options than you realize. Listen to your gut instincts now; when your choice is the right one, you'll know without even thinking about it."
scorpio,2013-02-26,"Be careful about what you say today because your current words inspire others to action -- even if that isn't your original intention. Ironically, you don't know how to convince anyone to join in your cause, mostly because you are so emotionally involved with the outcome that it's tough to be objective. Step back and give everyone a bit of breathing room. Then reassess your tactics before climbing back onto your soapbox and starting in on the same message again."
sagittarius,2013-02-26,"Your career objectives are more important than ever, but you could become so enthusiastic about your vision that you lose touch with being practical today. However, it's not wise to just improve your current plan so you can accomplish everything on your list. Instead, be creative and envision what motivates you to reach beyond the ordinary. There's a world of potential waiting right in front of you if you're ready to take the first steps on your next journey."
capricorn,2013-02-26,"You may be better at formulating a winning strategy today than you are at executing it. Even if your plan is a good one, it's probably not concrete enough to make real. Fortunately, you could receive more support than you expect, but you might have to ask for help first. Remember, requesting assistance is not a sign of weakness; only the most intelligent people know when to share the burden of work and the joy of the rewards."
aquarius,2013-02-26,"Although you may see the world through a very practical lens now, you might run into trouble getting your feet to stay on the ground. You analyze each situation by comparing the financial and energetic cost with the possible return. However, you don't necessarily have all the facts at your disposal today. Continue to gather information while leaving your biggest decisions for later. A rush to judgment won't help you reach your goals any sooner."
pisces,2013-02-26,"You might behave in an uncharacteristic manner today by initiating a discussion about a subject that you normally avoid like the plague. Whether you start up a politically motivated discussion or one about your needs in a relationship, you're ready to go to the mat to justify your position. But there's no need to act in a belligerent manner; you can disagree without being mean. Nevertheless, don't back down if things heat up; continue to hold your ground with a smile."
aries,2013-02-27,"Pay close attention to the little things today, for they might unravel your day if left untended. However, once you are faced with a crisis -- no matter how small -- you would be wise to let other matters slide until the brush fire is contained. Accomplishing as much as you can early in the day ensures that you are able to focus on more important issues as they arise. Your natural inclination to take charge works to your advantage now."
taurus,2013-02-27,"Acting with common sense might not guarantee the desired outcome today, for there are social forces at work that you don't completely understand. For example, a recent conflict may be revisited for no apparent reason. Or maybe a playful or romantic interaction turns temporarily sour. Whatever happens now, don't attempt to micromanage the situation. The sooner you relinquish control, the easier it will be for you to reclaim it."
gemini,2013-02-27,"A domestic problem could overflow into your workday, yet it's crucial not to spend too much energy trying to suppress it. The more you resist revealing your feelings today, the more relentlessly they will persist. The unpleasant circumstances are a sign that something isn't working right. But don't try to fix it; instead, initiate a dialogue to get to the core of the matter. Remember there are at least two perspectives, so make sure you are an active listener now as well as an amazing storyteller."
cancer,2013-02-27,"You may feel as if you walked into the middle of an awkward situation today. It's not a good idea to take sides in a pre-existing conflict now, but you might not be able to avoid it. It seems as if anything you do could have some negative consequences, so just pick the lesser of the evils and then get on with your day. Even if uncomfortable vibes linger, their intensity will settle down quicker than you think."
leo,2013-02-27,"You may be uncharacteristically less than confident as you worry about how your actions might negatively influence others today. However, the current circumstances have already been set into motion and you are simply acting as a catalyst. Even though others might be annoyed with you now, keep in mind that they could be thanking you by tomorrow. There's no need to prove anything to anyone, everything will fall into place on its own."
virgo,2013-02-27,"Your mental acuity may stir up ill will today as your feelings break through the awkward silence. If you have something to say, you might not be able to keep it quiet any longer. Unfortunately, you could have more impact on the situation than you realize, arousing ire in others. There is only so long the truth can stay hidden; thankfully, everyone will feel somewhat relieved later, once the storm has cleared the air."
libra,2013-02-27,"A low-level panic could motivate you into action early in the day once you realize how much there is to do. Perhaps you haven't managed your time well, yet you still must complete the tasks on your plate. Be careful and don't drag any innocent bystanders into your scheduling drama, since that will only make everyone's life more difficult. Even if the outcome isn't looking pretty, just stay as focused as possible now. You may be pleasantly surprised with what you accomplish by the end of the day."
scorpio,2013-02-27,"Your current vision of the future may be quite different from someone else's dream, and this incompatibility can agitate deeper issues of uncertainty. Although a misunderstanding could make matters worse, the real concern isn't about lack of clarity; it's about who is in control. Hold steady to your convictions at first so you are taken seriously; you can always choose to negotiate later on after you've made your point."
sagittarius,2013-02-27,"Even your most substantial plans can be turned inside out without warning today. You might try to flex your managerial muscles by holding fast to the current strategy, but this isn't necessarily the most effective idea. It may be in your best interest to let everything shift on its own, without exercising too much control. Luckily, life will be more stable once the dust settles and you can see more clearly."
capricorn,2013-02-27,"An intense situation could become quite distracting today, so practice maintaining your concentration before anything goes awry. Make use of your organizational skills in the morning while your schedule is still clear enough and you have time to follow through on anything you start. If your objectives are well-defined, you should be able to hold on to them all day. Good time management gives you the extra edge you need."
aquarius,2013-02-27,"Although it's not likely that you'll be visited by aliens today, you still might feel as if you're on the set of a sci-fi movie as strange things seep into your world. Luckily, you are more open to these kinds of phenomena now than at other times, so you can take nearly anything strange in stride. Keep your antennae tuned to the metaphysical dimensions of the universe as they contain significant information that will help you make a big decision with confidence."
pisces,2013-02-27,"Someone may disappoint you today by ignoring responsibilities or falling short of delivering on a promise. If you are counting on others, it's a smart strategy to temporarily lower your expectations now so you don't end up discouraged. Even if you're upset, don't fall into the trap of playing the blame game. It's much easier to motivate others through encouragement than guilt."
aries,2013-02-28,"Although you may have a lot going on with other people today, make time to retreat from all the noise so you can contemplate the beautiful mysteries of the universe. Sit back and imagine the most idyllic setting for your life, and then put yourself right in the middle of this fantasy. But don't stop dreaming about your future; take the next step and share your vision with a friend. Talking about your goals helps you reach your desired destination faster."
taurus,2013-02-28,"You may be feeling unsure of your role at work today, even if you recently believed everything was rock solid. It is as if someone took away your map and guiding compass when you weren't looking. But don't be overly concerned if you are lost because this is not a long-lasting situation. In fact, your current uncertainty can lead you to exciting possibilities as you search for your new direction."
gemini,2013-02-28,"If you have sudden urges now to help others at work, remember that you're not the only one who has something special to offer. Although you can see things from your point of view, it's useful to expand your vision and move beyond your narrow perspective. Ironically, you might be receiving assistance from your friends in a way that can lighten up your feelings, too. If so, be open and graciously accept what is coming your way, even if you're not sure where the current circumstances will take you."
cancer,2013-02-28,"You need to rise above your feelings today, even if you're being pulled into the depths of your subconscious. Although you may want to uncover the source of your current confusion, you can be distracted along the way. Fortunately, you have the ability to make it up as you go along now, and too much advanced planning could even hold you back. But be careful what you conjure up in your imagination --your fantasy might just come true whether you want it to or not."
leo,2013-02-28,"You may grow anxious if you believe that someone is trying to control you in some way. But your fear might be based on the realization that you don't have all the answers today. Instead of acting with false bravado or using smooth words to impress others, be honest and show your vulnerability. Oddly enough, admitting what you don't know opens the door to real intimacy and stronger relationships."
virgo,2013-02-28,"You might experience disillusionment if you set an acquaintance or friend up on a pedestal. Although you may have been lost in admiration, negative personality traits cannot be swept under the rug forever. Denial only prolongs the inevitable now. It is better to be prepared by accepting the truth about someone you like than to be surprised and hurt later on. Being realistic about your expectations prevents experiencing disappointment down the road."
libra,2013-02-28,"Perhaps you should be concerned about your own job and the pressing issues at work, but your mind is on helping everyone else now. You are tempted to go out of your way today to rescue those less fortunate than you. Remember, your compassion is a sign of your emotional strength, but don't let it overtake everything else in your life. Establishing healthy boundaries so you can attend to your own needs enables you to continue your service to others."
scorpio,2013-02-28,"You are imagining various ways to enjoy yourself today with the sweet Venus-Neptune conjunction playing out in your 5th House of Fun and Games. You are either in love or dreaming about it. Both ways, your daydreams feel so close you may not be able to tell if they're fantasies or real events. The problem with conjuring perfect love is that the reality never quite matches up to the vision. Don't set a romance up for failure before giving it a proper chance to unfold organically without any expectations."
sagittarius,2013-02-28,"A complex emotional issue at home probably isn't as complicated as it currently seems. It's just that you are even more of a visionary now than usual, but your perspective is missing the depth and detail that's needed to make an intelligent decision. Continue to mull everything all over for a while, without trying to come up with a final answer. You'll have better luck being objective tomorrow when your perceptions are clear and the channels of communication are open."
capricorn,2013-02-28,"Lighthearted conversations with close friends might give rise to misunderstandings today, unless you pay careful attention to everything that is said -- both by you and them. If you keep your thoughts straight, this can be a very significant day. If you can't, even a simple business transaction may get all messed up. Say exactly what you mean and nothing more for the least confusion and the best results."
aquarius,2013-02-28,"You feel extra confident today as you set new goals at work, giving you a chance to demonstrate your real worth to yourself and others. Although social interactions can be a real ego-booster, they could also reflect your current lack of clarity. Maintaining your integrity in all that you do will help you achieve the success you are seeking."
pisces,2013-02-28,"You can use your sweet demeanor to help you get what you want today with the dreamy Venus-Neptune conjunction falling in your 1st House of Personality. You are being given an opportunity to lift your own spirits with your imagination, but you also have a chance to be a shining example to others now. Demonstrate what is possible by successfully balancing your creative and spiritual practices with the work you must complete in the mundane world."
aries,2013-03-01,"You're not so impulsive today and you may withhold your feelings to strengthen the emotional foundations upon which you are building your life. The current relationship conflicts are real, yet you know what you must do to make things right. You can try to wait for the perfect time to act, but if you are walking your talk, there is no better time than right now. Don't put off telling the truth, even if it hurts."
taurus,2013-03-01,"You're concerned with making a relationship last; there's no flash-in-the-pan show for you today. No colorful fireworks or temporary fixes will do the trick. Instead, you are concerned with getting back to the basics, so say what you mean and mean what you say. Don't beat around the bush. Just write the email and send it. However, be sure to deliver your message kindly, clearly and succinctly for the best results."
gemini,2013-03-01,"You may be particularly hard on yourself as you strive for perfection today, while others only see your well-rehearsed rituals. You appear to be a true magician, fascinating everyone with your hands waving wildly in the air. However, you have a very practical agenda now, and your stories and sleight-of-mind tricks are distractions that prevent people from seeing through your veneer. Don't waste energy criticizing yourself; take action and fix the problem, instead."
cancer,2013-03-01,"Your intuition continues to lead you in the right direction as you make big plans for the future. Somehow, you are downloading data directly from the cosmos today, so don't spend too much time questioning how you are learning what you know. Even if others don't trust what you are doing now, rest assured that your efforts will prove effective in the long run. Time is on your side and so are your instincts."
leo,2013-03-01,"Take action while you have the chance, for what you start today will likely stand the test of time. You have an air of confidence about you that allows you to explore emotional realms that don't often feel as safe as they do now. Stabilize your life by acting on your feelings without delay. Avoid dramatic gestures; doing whatever you can to add substance to your life has a positive influence on those around you."
virgo,2013-03-01,"Relationships continue to be a challenge, but now you have authoritative Saturn acting as your guardian angel, ensuring that you don't lose touch with reality. This is an excellent time to reel yourself in and to tow the party line. Even if you don't feel particularly creative, your ideas can have significant impact today. But don't relinquish your power; instead, find a way to cooperate with others without sacrificing your heart."
libra,2013-03-01,"You have the authority to alter the course of events at your workplace now. If you can focus on the tasks right in front of you, then you are able to have positive impact on the larger issues, too. Now more than ever, your newfound discipline and solid work ethic could lead to a significant payoff. But don't think about cashing in your chips just yet. Rewards will follow if you keep plodding along until you reach your goal."
scorpio,2013-03-01,"You now have the necessary tools to create enough stability in your life that you can balance your need for fun with your desire to go the distance and reach your destination. It's as if you're preparing for a marathon because you're in it for the long haul and not just a sprint. But don't give anyone the power to talk you out of your view of reality. Ultimately, you're running your own race; it's your choice and no one else's. Trust your feelings and act on them with confidence."
sagittarius,2013-03-01,"It may be bothersome to have to deal with mundane issues like running errands and cleaning the house. Even if you're bored with your domestic duties now, this is a great day to do your chores because it frees your mind to reflect on your past and think about your future. Let your mind travel through time while you finish your work. Sticking to familiar routines today brings you the best chances for success in the long run."
capricorn,2013-03-01,"You are determined to climb the ladder of success now and are committed to working extremely hard to prove that nothing can stand in your way. Your ambitious attitude is commendable, but your I-can-do-it mindset might lead you into trouble. If you're involved in a challenging project, stand back to reassess the situation, put the pieces together into a new strategy, and then push ahead to reach your goal."
aquarius,2013-03-01,"You are in touch with your own values today and understand the impact they have on your career objectives. If you have recently been uncertain about your goals, your perspective grows sharper now. But your success won't come from doing more; your income potential goes up when you do one thing better than anyone else, instead of many things poorly. Eliminate items from your current to-do list unless they directly support your lofty ambitions."
pisces,2013-03-01,"Your life may not feel very exciting now, but you have worked long and hard to create the stability you're experiencing. Instead of trying to turn things upside down, chill out long enough to enjoy the tranquility you've earned. Letting your true feelings out of the bag today can stir up more static than intended, so it's wise to be patient for a while longer. Although self-restraint is important, don't hit that brake pedal too hard or things won't move forward at all."
aries,2013-03-02,"Your normal weekend schedule is disrupted by the need to take care of pressing emotional issues today. You might feel that someone is imposing his or her will on you, since you prefer to stick with your usual routine. But the more you attempt to return to your regular programming, the more reality pressures you to deal with things that could grow out of control if not handled propitiously. Fortunately, behaving responsibly leads to healthier relationships and less stress all the way around."
taurus,2013-03-02,"It doesn't really matter how practical you think you are being today; your actions still may be harshly judged by a friend or partner. You might feel like someone with authority is on your case now and won't let you have your fun, even if you believe your plans are completely within reason. Negotiate with passion, but choose your battles wisely. Knowing when to let go of control makes all the difference in the world."
gemini,2013-03-02,"There may be a clash of wills today as someone attempts to pull you away from your previously scheduled activity and into a drama that is too intense for your taste. Although you might try to resist, you could cheat yourself out of an amazing experience now if you don't go along with the emotional flow. Even if the current situation unleashes deep feelings, being honest and putting everything out on the table will bring relief for everyone involved."
cancer,2013-03-02,"It doesn't matter if you were planning on rest and relaxation for the day, it may not happen. There are unavoidable emotional forces seeping into your life now. You can get as angry as you want today, but losing your temper won't resolve the complex dilemmas preventing you from taking it easy. Scrapping your original agenda in the name of cooperation makes more sense than fighting for something unimportant."
leo,2013-03-02,"It's difficult to feel positive about your day when someone appears to be undermining your best efforts. You may have trouble with an authority figure in your life today as he or she covertly manipulates you into changing your mind about what you want. Don't take it personally; this isn't the best time to put your foot down. For now, flexibility works better than resistance."
virgo,2013-03-02,"You may think that you are being pretty open with your agenda now. Although you're not intentionally hiding anything, something strange is happening that can still be frustrating. It's awkward to deal with others today because the source of the current stress isn't obvious and you might feel like you are shadowboxing. Keep your sense of humor intact; try dancing with the unknown instead of avoiding it out of fear."
libra,2013-03-02,"You really don't want to talk about anything uncomfortable today. You prefer to walk an emotional tightrope and hope that everyone will be sensible enough to keep quiet, too. However, this diplomatic approach won't work now if others are taking advantage of your sense of fair play. Instead, you might have to take a stand that is based on your emotions rather than on logical analysis. But don't wait until it's too late; make your feelings known and deal with the consequences as needed."
scorpio,2013-03-02,"It's an intense day, filled with unspoken emotional responsibilities. Fortunately, you know what you need to do and are prepared to do it. The difficult part is that shifting conditions can temporarily put you at odds with someone close to you. Even if you are concerned about a possible conflict now, remember that you're both on the same side. Be patient; the anxiety and turmoil will settle down as the day progresses."
sagittarius,2013-03-02,"You may be unpleasantly surprised today when you realize that you can't escape from an uncomfortable feeling that you've been trying to avoid. Fortunately, you can finally stop running now, even if facing the truth might not be fun at first. Nevertheless, this is a real opportunity to turn a liability into an asset. Anything is possible when you stop and listen to your heart."
capricorn,2013-03-02,"You sure-footed Goats usually build relationships on the solid ground of practicality and logic. However, emotional issues are shaking the mountain that you have been climbing so cautiously. Don't panic; there's no reason to run away from your feelings. Step beyond your doubt and trust the integrity of your foundations. People may let you down, but your strength and tenacity will not."
aquarius,2013-03-02,"Your fear of losing what you have already gained may be cause for concern now. However, the more you try to keep your worries buried, the louder they become. Instead of pretending that everything is fine, give yourself permission to feel the stress that comes along with uncertainty. Riding the emotional waves is preferable to fighting the currents. Stay positive by working toward your goals rather than resisting what you don't want."
pisces,2013-03-02,A conflict with a friend or family member may motivate you to attempt to fix a situation that is actually beyond your control. The real issue now is about how you hold on to patterns of behavior because of your fear of change. Old habits are being tested by new circumstances. You can struggle with an ally for the wrong reasons or you can let go of your stubborn attitude and make room for new dreams to flourish.
aries,2013-03-03,"It might be hard to motivate yourself today, even if you have a lot on your plate. You want some downtime at first and may delay getting started on what you have to do. But later, boredom sets in and if someone invites you to play, you could be tempted to leave your chores unfinished. Do your best to remain focused until you fulfill your responsibilities and then you can reward yourself with pleasurable activities later this evening or tomorrow."
taurus,2013-03-03,"Pleasure awaits you and it may not require a lot of extra effort on your part. Going out into the world might be necessary in order to meet previous commitments, but once your obligations are met, it's time to kick back and relax. Perhaps you could plan a small social gathering at your place later in the day or you might choose to spend the day alone. Enjoy your own company ... no matter what you end up doing."
gemini,2013-03-03,"You are right on target today with your charm and wit, expressing the most likeable part of your personality. Fortunately, you can still accomplish a lot of little projects if you concentrate, but it might take a lot of effort to get going. Even if the first steps feel awkward, just start walking confidently toward your goals. Fun times are right in front of you, but don't lose track of the more mundane responsibilities on your way."
cancer,2013-03-03,"Your romantic inclinations may be all you can think about now, but you might not have an easy path to reach satisfaction. Your relationships are still a bit unstable and expressing your immediate needs could tip the balance. Of course it's important to dream, but this doesn't mean you should share every desire, especially if it's inappropriate or embarrassing. Some secrets are best kept to yourself."
leo,2013-03-03,"You have great potential to heal an old wound today, especially if you're willing to face an issue that has been troubling you for a while. You are better equipped now to project your needs so that others can clearly understand your motives. Don't be intimidated or retreat from your purpose. Although you may feel magnanimous and try to be extra generous now, it's more critical to remain true to yourself and deal with any fallout later."
virgo,2013-03-03,"You may be hesitant today to talk about something that's important to you because you're afraid of the response you might receive. But your motivation becomes stronger throughout the day, urging you to take a risk and share what's on your mind. There's no need to push too hard; the slow and determined approach works in your favor. Fortunately, once the conversation is started, things will proceed with much greater ease than you ever imagined."
libra,2013-03-03,"Your health is improving along with the rest of your life. Nevertheless, remember that too much of something good can still turn problematic. Unfortunately, at this time you are tempted to avoid negativity, whatever the cost. Graciously accept the opportunities that now come your way, but don't fool yourself with inflationary thinking. Balancing the possibilities with realism is your safest path to success."
scorpio,2013-03-03,"Although love has recently been on your mind, the fierce Scorpio Moon encourages you to hold strong to your convictions, even if they differ from someone else's. Your integrity pays off as the Moon dances into happy-go-lucky Sagittarius this afternoon, freeing you up to enjoy the fruits of your beliefs. Although you're fully capable of running the whole show, it's time to let others share the responsibility so you can join the party."
sagittarius,2013-03-03,It feels as if you have been in planning mode long enough; it's now time to step into your future and put your intentions to work. Do whatever you can to increase your self-worth or to stash a little extra cash in the bank. Don't be lazy; fill your upcoming week with productive activities while the planets are smiling favorably upon you.
capricorn,2013-03-03,"Trying to make sense out of recent changes has required a lot of thought in the past few days. However, today you're feeling ready to jump into the next phase of your life. Thankfully, your harsh self-judgments are softening and others will shower you with the love and respect you deserve. Opportunities for growth are on the way, but you must take the initiative and open the door to let them in."
aquarius,2013-03-03,"You may be overwhelmed with the depth of your emotions today, yet it's challenging to put your feelings into words. You feel more connected with your friends or family now, but you might not understand why everyone is being so nice to you. Don't fight the positive vibrations; there is nothing to fear. Be courageous and open your heart to accept the love that's all around you, even if you aren't sure that you fully deserve it."
pisces,2013-03-03,"You intuitively sense the positive energy building throughout the day. You're more than willing to do whatever it takes to demonstrate the depth of your feelings. Nevertheless, there's no reason to over-dramatize your heartfelt intentions. Don't transform a minor problem into a federal case. Instead, just respond to each situation in a straightforward manner with encouragement and compassion. You don't need a big show of affection; just let your heart shine for everyone to see."
aries,2013-03-04,"Delicious dreams of possible pleasures make it easy to let go of the past. Previous obligations are less of a restriction today, and you're eager to start your new journey. Thankfully, you have the capability to juggle your future goals with your responsibilities in the here and now. Your satisfaction increases when you focus on both the present moment and what's ahead."
taurus,2013-03-04,"Cheerful thoughts lift your spirits today as jolly Jupiter influences your key planet Venus. A dear friend or lover can help you gain confidence about your long-term plans, making it difficult to hide your smile. There might not be a good reason to bury your positive feelings, but don't assume that success has arrived even if everything seems idyllic. You still have a lot of ground to cover before you reach your destination, so enjoy every step of the journey along the way."
gemini,2013-03-04,"Others can't help but notice you now that clever Mercury hooks up with the Sun shining in your 10th House of Career. Although it feels great to be acknowledged and appreciated, you may face a dilemma as you're torn between your desire to be effective at work and your need to be understood. Giving your emotional issues a rest for a few days enables you to catch a much-needed wave of productivity, earning you the professional respect you deserve."
cancer,2013-03-04,"Your current ideas for self-improvement might include taking a class or enrolling in an entirely new course of study. Unfortunately, these plans may need modification when you run into a logistical barrier. But this isn't time to quit, since apparent obstacles are not as overwhelming as they seem today. Strive relentlessly for your dreams; your persistence will be rewarded one way or another."
leo,2013-03-04,"It's tricky to follow through on your best ideas now because you are easily distracted by other people. Unfortunately, their projects sound even better than yours, tempting you to set your plans aside today. Don't forget that you have your own valuable skills to bring to the table. However, it may be more beneficial in the long run to scale back a grandiose scheme so you can relax and enjoy your current situation instead of pinning all your dreams on the future."
virgo,2013-03-04,"Your hopes are high for career success now, but you must also realize how much pleasure you can derive from the safety and security of your familiar surroundings with the reflective Moon visiting your 4th House of Roots. Nevertheless, your desire for adventure clashes with your more conservative work ethic. The potential for happiness is great if you don't set your expectations so high that you court disappointment. Ultimately, a healthy dose of realism is beneficial to your pursuit of happiness."
libra,2013-03-04,"Your common sense won't lead you astray today as long as you keep your emotional needs in check. If you overextend by agreeing to give more than you can, reality will quickly grab your attention. There won't be any free lunches now, so don't try to get something for nothing. Your best strategy is to work for what you want without expecting anyone else to carry your load or you to carry theirs. Simply changing your attitude makes room for pleasant surprises to happen."
scorpio,2013-03-04,"Pleasure arrives in small increments today, even if it seems as if you should be receiving more recognition for your work. You're tempted to pack your schedule with lots of activity, but this isn't the most reliable path to happiness. Working hard won't get you there any faster, so you might as well slow down now and enjoy the ride while you can."
sagittarius,2013-03-04,"You may be overly optimistic now about what you have to offer others. Although self-confidence is better than self-doubt, it can still trick you into saying yes today when you should be conserving your energy. However, it's not about doing anything special to gain approval from anyone else; it's about focusing on the most positive aspects of your everyday life while deriving satisfaction from life's simple pleasures."
capricorn,2013-03-04,"It's challenging to know exactly what you're feeling now because everything appears better than it actually is. Unfortunately, you might not be able to get a healthy perspective on reality as the buoyant Sagittarius Moon floats through your 12th House of Fantasy. Delay your most crucial decisions for a day or two until the magnifying lens of Jupiter passes and everything returns to its normal size."
aquarius,2013-03-04,"You might not feel very compassionate now if you're too obsessed with your own sense of purpose. Your current emotional sensitivity may be lacking, yet a short window of opportunity could open that offers you great spiritual rewards if you can respond kindly. Step out from behind your fears; shower the shadows with the light of awareness. Consider what you can do to help others today because community work is also good for the soul."
pisces,2013-03-04,"You may find it difficult to accept the love that is being offered today as your personal world is peppered with complex dilemmas. On the surface, pleasure seems so straightforward, yet now there's a price to pay if you set aside your professional goals in favor of immediate satisfaction. Experiencing the spiritual dimensions of your feelings and letting go of your preconceived agenda make things easier to manage. Ironically, when you stop grasping for the correct answer, your path will finally become clear."

taurus,2013-03-05,"You nostalgically long for the old routine, as it makes you feel emotionally secure. Today marks a change for the better as your workload increases, motivating you to stay on track until you're certain everything is in order. Luckily, there is less time to wander off into your own insecurities with so much to do. Don't waste a moment; get busy and create a schedule that allows you to step up to the challenge and shine."
gemini,2013-03-05,"You are being offered temporary relief from the excess noise that has recently infiltrated your world. Although it's still wise to pay attention to people's motives, you don't need to get involved in every conversation you hear. Hidden agendas may be motivating others, but the intensity begins to wane and you get to quietly reclaim your life."
cancer,2013-03-05,"Use your ability to react swiftly to an advantage as someone presents you with a personal dilemma today. Normally, you can cover your feelings and hide your secret thoughts. However, now it's time to channel your emotions into external communications -- either verbal or written -- so that others are able to acknowledge and appreciate your ideas."
leo,2013-03-05,"This is an action-packed week, yet you may feel weary from everything you have done -- and all there is still left to do. You might be quite overwhelmed because at your current pace you won't ever reach your destination. Don't base your assessment of your progress on your present exhaustion. Avoid the temptation to walk away from your responsibilities to do something more enjoyable and less stressful. Instead, find quiet satisfaction along the way to a job well done."
virgo,2013-03-05,"You sense a return to normalcy in your daily routine as the Moon moves into earthy Capricorn today, even if life will never be quite as orderly as you might prefer. You may be tempted to apply your efforts toward finding a new direction. But it's not about running away from your obligations and starting over right now. Change your attitude before proceeding further. Try doing the same old task with a renewed sense of excitement and see what happens."
libra,2013-03-05,"You are feeling more secure in your inner world than you have in recent days, but your emotions still don't fully match the circumstances around you. It's like your friends or co-workers are talking to you, but you cannot understand what they are saying. Even so, you are still pretty certain about how you feel. Don't let anyone pressure you into a decision before you are ready to share what's on your mind."
scorpio,2013-03-05,"You are better equipped to present your ideas to your peers today, even if your dreams are more serious than others prefer. In fact, intensity is a language that everyone understands now -- even if it stirs up difficult issues. Keep in mind that someone's compassion might help you feel better, but won't necessarily solve your dilemma. You have some deep thinking to do. Even if you're on this ride alone for a while, rest assured that you are on the right track."
sagittarius,2013-03-05,"This may be a fateful day as something happens out of the blue -- yet there is also an odd sense of familiarity about everything. This can test your understanding of life, for it seems like whatever is unfolding now has actually been planned out in some other space-time continuum. Whether or not you believe in parallel universes, today is sure to have some surprises in store for you. Remain flexible no matter how your path twists or turns along the way."
capricorn,2013-03-05,"Your mood swings back and forth today, like a gigantic pendulum -- and that's exactly what the Moon is as she returns to your sign. It's challenging to trust your feelings because they are in flux, but it's vitally important to tune in to your emotions. Your heart has something crucial to tell your head, so as long as you are attempting to rationalize the incoming information, you won't pick up on the signals being sent your way. Take time for mediation now so you can receive the messages meant just for you."
aquarius,2013-03-05,"Although you might concentrate on your professional responsibilities today, there is more going on than meets the eye. Your dreams are being stirred and you want to change the way you interact with others so you can be more productive. However, exerting too much control doesn't work. If you truly want to take a quantum leap now, temporarily let go of your own agenda and surrender to the unknown."
pisces,2013-03-05,"The activities that you schedule with your friends and co-workers today may end up having more than a casual impact on your life. You need the support of your social network now, so be willing to do whatever is required to earn it. Make time to kick back with your peers and share what's on your mind. The warm camaraderie can have a very healing effect on your heart."
aries,2013-03-06,"Too much emotional attachment in a personal relationship can make you feel antsy, since you value your independence. However, you may be eager to make a commitment today without any fear of being tied down. Perhaps your current relationship is different; or, maybe it's you that has changed. Then again, you could be misleading yourself. Act with integrity and time will reveal what you need to know."
taurus,2013-03-06,"Your instincts may tell you to slow down today and you would be wise to listen to them. Although you are in tune with the emotional buzz as Venus hums happily, you might also be tempted to overplay your hand. Don't withhold affection out of fear; there's no need to keep your guard up because you are afraid that the good feelings will pass. Rest assured that what you are experiencing now can have lasting positive impact, but only if you focus on the present moment rather than your expectations for the future."
gemini,2013-03-06,"You attempt to focus on your work, but an emotional attraction may be too strong to ignore now. You cannot help yourself because there are many intriguing social opportunities tempting you to abandon your obligations. You could miss the most wonderful experience if you spread yourself too thin. You cannot do everything, so pick and choose among your options carefully today so you won't have any regrets tomorrow."
cancer,2013-03-06,"You may feel on edge today with an unsettled sensation in your belly that won't go away.

If you cultivate love instead of trying to control it, happiness can be yours."
leo,2013-03-06,"Today you just know things that others cannot perceive. Perhaps you believe that someone is trying to control you and it doesn't sit well with you. Whatever has you concerned now, the most important thing is to stay calm. Observe what is happening and act in accordance to the external circumstances, rather than what is brought up by your own fears. You can choose to bring more stability into your life by basing your current decisions on love, and then trusting the process."
virgo,2013-03-06,"Although it seems as if you know what your partner or friend is thinking today, your intuition might raise unnecessary concerns over unimportant details. It can be tricky trying to separate the real worries from the imagined, but the solution may ultimately be in the hands of sweet Venus. Trust what's in your heart and move sensibly toward your passion. In the end, love wins out over fear."
libra,2013-03-06,"The cosmic love-buzz is aimed at you today since your key planet, Venus, is in the spotlight; luckily, your feet are planted firmly on the ground.

Revealing what's in your heart can be exactly what's needed to move a relationship to the next level."
scorpio,2013-03-06,"It's all about revealing your presence in the outer world today, rather than emphasizing your normal focus on the inner dimensions of life. It's not that your subconscious is any less important; it's just that reality is offering you a chance to engage in something real that should not be ignored.

Nevertheless, you can help yourself move along the path by sharing your feelings with someone you trust."
capricorn,2013-03-06,"The possibility of love and affection is so real today that you can feel it in your bones. Your key planet, karmic Saturn, receives a lovely trine from sweet Venus. Since Venus symbolizes anything of value, including money, this alignment also brings the possibility of finalizing a deal that can bring you great rewards. Whether it's finances or matters of the heart, don't let your limited expectations get in the way of unlimited potential. Dream big; anything can happen."
aquarius,2013-03-06,"Your ambitions are within reach today and you might not need to make too much of a sacrifice to get what you want. Nevertheless, reconsider your priorities and concentrate on your ambitions because valuable Venus harmonizes with responsible Saturn in your 10th House of Career. Don't over-intellectualize what's happening now. Just be thankful for what you have while continuing to work hard to make your dreams come true."
pisces,2013-03-06,"Your compassion is overflowing and you may be eager to attend to the needs of the masses today, but it's not healthy to ignore your own desires. Setting yourself up in the role of a martyr or victim doesn't help anyone in the long run. Seek ways to express your love without giving away your power. Nurturing others doesn't relieve you of the responsibility to also take care of yourself; one doesn't preclude the other."
aries,2013-03-07,"You want to race ahead, but something is telling you to retreat. Although you might display a veneer of pessimism today, you secretly believe that it will all work out fine. Trust your instincts and rise above your tendency to doubt yourself. You don't have time for negative thinking when there's so much work to be done. Instead of worrying about what anyone else thinks, find your inner superhero and take charge of your day."
taurus,2013-03-07,"You have important issues on your mind, but circumstances may not give you the time you need to develop your ideas into useful ones. You are hesitant to cut corners because you fear that something will be lost in the translation. Push past your own resistance, since saying anything today is better than saying nothing at all."
gemini,2013-03-07,"Everywhere you look you see signs that advise you to stop and think things through before opening your mouth. Most of the time, you prefer jumping in and figuring out where you are going as you are talking, but this isn't such a great strategy today. Write down what's on your mind first; this little step can help you organize your thoughts so you're more effective in your interactions with others."
cancer,2013-03-07,"Although your conversations at work may become emotional today, you still feel comfortable with the topic of discussion. You're revitalized with the prospects of getting to the core of the matter. Your perspective is intense now, so take it easy on others. They may not have the same ability or desire to dredge up the water from the bottom of the well. Adopting a gentle approach helps you make your point without upsetting anyone in the process."
leo,2013-03-07,"Your thoughts appear to be out in the open now, even if you are still withholding something personal. There may be another layer of your emotions lurking just beneath the surface, and unless you feel completely safe, no one will ever know. Don't try to force any issues. Trust your own judgment if you believe that keeping something to yourself for the present moment is a good strategy."
virgo,2013-03-07,"Logical analysis comes naturally to you Virgos, and today you can use your mental sharpness to be at the top of your game. Even if you aren't usually willing to delve into emotional realms, you may become engulfed by a complex interpersonal issue involving others. However, this might be a way to avoid a serious subject that needs your attention. Make the most of the day by not allowing yourself to become too distracted by someone else's drama."
libra,2013-03-07,"It's hard to accept that things are getting better, yet they truly are improving now. You just need to get through the next couple of days of intense planning and realistic thinking.

scorpio,2013-03-07,"You are looking at your long-term personal goals through a very practical filter now. It isn't that you have lost your ability to imagine an idyllic future; it's just that your dreams are more likely than ever to manifest as reality. Don't waste this opportunity on fantasies, for the visions will still need an anchor in the real world. Take control of your life by managing your thoughts and visualizing your future just the way you want it."
sagittarius,2013-03-07,"Your current path in life is moving you into deeper places and you're along for the ride. There are many lessons to learn now as you turn your attention toward deciphering what's motivating you in your search for meaning. Even if you are engaged in joyful activities today, don't be afraid to dig way down beneath the surface. Your natural buoyancy will bring you back up before you know it."
capricorn,2013-03-07,"You want to spend more time with others now, but not just for lighthearted play. There are critical subjects on your mind and you need feedback from the people that you trust the most. Go ahead and share what you are thinking, since your ability to manage many complex thoughts is greater than usual today. Don't let self-doubt get in your way; just believe your friends when they say that you are on the right track."
aquarius,2013-03-07,Discomfort arises if others don't take you as seriously as you want. You're in a productive phase and you want to be recognized for your hard work.

The only thing that really matters now is getting positive results.
pisces,2013-03-07,"It's not easy to relax and enjoy yourself today because there are too many practical issues weighing on your mind. You might prefer to postpone the fun and games until you have taken care of business. This may be the best tactic for you now, but don't completely forget about enjoying yourself. Finding a healthy balance between work and play ensures the highest levels of productivity."
aries,2013-03-08,"You may feel as if people are against you today because they might tell you something you don't want to hear. Naturally, your real allies are the ones willing to give you the honest feedback that others tend to withhold. Remember, your friends are on your side and could have important information that you need to know, so remain open to what they have to say now. Accept the support in the spirit that it was given and express your appreciation for the concern."
taurus,2013-03-08,"You might grow discouraged today as your best intentions run into a lack of support from others on the job. Understandably, you may be hesitant to share your frustration for fear of making things worse. Your best bet now is to keep your feelings to yourself, even if you believe that your associates are being negative. The proof is in the pudding; instead of complaining, put your angst to work and let your productivity speak in place of your words."
gemini,2013-03-08,It's time to consider postponing or even canceling an upcoming trip due to responsibilities you cannot avoid. The hardest part about this change in circumstances is not altering your plans. The real problem now is that your disappointment brings up memories of a similar event from the past. Letting go of your feelings attached to the previous experience can help you focus your attention and manage the current situation more gracefully.
cancer,2013-03-08,"Deeply rooted feelings of failure may bubble up to the surface now, prompted by a difficult interaction with a loved one. A specific memory of not being able to help someone in your family can influence your actions today.

Your brave attempts to make connections will be rewarded, even if not right away."
leo,2013-03-08,"It may be challenging to express your feelings today because it seems as if people aren't listening to you. However, chances are they actually hear every word you say; it's your fear of not being heard that makes you think you're being neglected. Go ahead and share what's in your heart now without letting your expectations get in the way. You might be pleasantly surprised with the response you receive once you give others the time to process their emotions."
virgo,2013-03-08,"If you're not feeling in tiptop shape today your body is trying to tell you something. Instead of concentrating on the possible negative side of what's going on now, make plans to revamp your exercise program and improve your diet. But don't grasp at any quick fixes; instead make small healthy changes that will have positive long-lasting effects. Rather than trying to do it alone, lean on someone you trust to support your efforts."
libra,2013-03-08,"You might feel blocked today if you are working on a creative project. Or, if you recently made a romantic gesture toward someone special, you may be unsure that your advances were taken in the right way. In either case, discouragement will not serve you well. Try to overcome any feelings of inferiority or insecurity by doing the best you can until the path clears and you are able to express yourself with confidence. Switching up the scenery could be enough to improve your mood."
scorpio,2013-03-08,"You have nowhere to share your most intense emotions today since others may not be interested in engaging the intensity of your passions. Nevertheless, you still have to interact with people at work or at home, so it might be a smart idea to temporarily keep your emotions to yourself. Instead, practicing discretion makes your day a whole lot easier to manage. However, denial is not an acceptable strategy. Channel your energy into some type of exercise for a healthy release and find a true friend who is willing to listen."
sagittarius,2013-03-08,"It's too late to go back and cancel your commitments if you over-scheduled yourself today. The biggest problem is that you feel you're letting someone down if you aren't on time or if you don't finish everything as promised. Instead of wasting your energy trying to reshuffle your calendar, stay focused and be as efficient as possible without worrying about what others think. Ultimately, your good intentions and unflappable determination will win out in the end."
capricorn,2013-03-08,"It's time for you to build on what you recently started, even if you are questioning the practicality of your recent decisions. However, this uncertainty is natural since you may be required to put a significant amount of effort into your plan now, and you really want to be sure it's the right one. Go ahead and reconsider your strategy; but rest assured that your current work will pay off, even if it takes a while to see the results."
aquarius,2013-03-08,"You may be so impatient that you are unwilling to wait for others to catch up to you. Your annoyance might even reach a critical mass today, prompting you to lose your temper. If you let your emotions get the best of you, remember that the real issue could be your own unexpressed feelings about a totally different topic. Look for the true origin of your irritation and deal with it, instead of taking it out on the wrong person for the wrong reason."
pisces,2013-03-08,"You may be thinking about something that you have kept to yourself and are now trying to decide the best time to share it with someone else. You would like to be alone so you can work out your dilemma without any interruptions, but responsibilities prevent you from retreating. Instead of getting annoyed about your current situation, try to remain flexible today because you'll have time for your inner work soon enough. You've waited this long to spill your secret, another day or two won't hurt."
aries,2013-03-09,"You are ready to go and it seems as if nothing can stop you when you are in your impulsive phase -- not even logic. In fact, you can be self-destructive if you go ahead with your plans in spite of what you now know. Fortunately, you're able to accomplish a great deal today, but only if you are aimed in the right direction. Before you set out on your path, cool your heels while you do another round of information gathering; being fully prepared helps to ensure your success."
taurus,2013-03-09,"There may be a conflict between your needs and what others want from you now. This stress can surface anywhere that you are supposed to be in charge, whether at home, in school or at the office. Instead of concentrating on your inner dilemma, listen carefully to what others have to say to you at this time. If you are open to what you hear, resolving your uncertainty could be easier than you expect."
gemini,2013-03-09,"Your unrestrained optimism might get you into trouble if you move too quickly today. Luckily, you can see your current situation from several different angles -- as if you were an eagle flying far above the field. Simultaneously, you are entrenched with the minute details. This combination makes you extremely effective for there is power in the knowledge of what a fresh perspective brings, especially if you choose to work hard for what you want."
cancer,2013-03-09,"You might get by without experiencing any turmoil if you act directly from your gut feelings, but unfortunately, this tactic isn't a possibility now. There is too much data coming at you to ignore. The problem is in knowing which information is valid since there are so many conflicting stories swirling around. Don't get caught up in someone else's artificial timetable. You are all but assured of success if you allow yourself enough time to discern the facts from the fiction."
leo,2013-03-09,"It's as if someone added a few extra ingredients to the mix today, and there isn't much you can do to change that. However, you're not in a weakened position, unless you try too hard to convince others of your point of view. Make sure that you're not hiding your feelings because they can get in the way of your progress if they're not out on the table for all to see. A collaborative approach leads to a win-win situation for everyone involved."
virgo,2013-03-09,"You typically react to new information with a cool, analytical head and a rational outlook. However,  you may get tangled up in the details today, so you might choose to ignore them instead. Unfortunately, this strategy is dangerous since it could be the lack of good data that motivates you to jump off the wrong cliff. Remember, facts are your friends -- even if they don't support your current scheme. Do your research and adjust your plans accordingly."
libra,2013-03-09,"You may be unsure of yourself today, even if everything is looking positive. There might be a potential love interest that is tickling your fancy, and it feels good to play the possibilities through in your mind. Just be aware that you don't have all the facts at your disposal yet. Don't inflate your thoughts into more than the fantasies that they are now. If they continue to linger on your mind, act on them next week."
scorpio,2013-03-09,"Your faith may be tested as a situation on the home front prevents you from expressing how you feel. You want to get to the bottom of the resistance today as you try to remain optimistic about something that isn't quite as positive as it appears. But don't steer away from any unpleasant details because you can create an unstable house of cards if you do. Instead, let your intellect overrule your emotions now, so you can maintain a healthy perspective while continuing to figure out your next move."
sagittarius,2013-03-09,"Your ruling planet, Jupiter, is in charge of bigger things, better ideas and more of everything. This cosmic magnifying lens cranks up your mental powers today, so everything seems more important than it is in reality. Be wary of blind optimism in all your dealings now, because inflated goals will settle back down to their normal proportion in just a couple of days. In the meantime, kick up your heels and have fun."
capricorn,2013-03-09,"You are often the one who others seek out when they require a reality check. But now you are being tempted by circumstances to take radical action because everything looks great. Be careful and dig for the facts; it's very easy to miss an important piece of information today. Don't do anything until you have a complete picture, and then act in a responsible manner. Avoid shortcuts and gift horses; there is no free lunch at the cosmic cafe."
aquarius,2013-03-09,"Your feelings are close to the surface and your emotional sensitivity is heightened now that the evocative Moon is back in your sign. Unfortunately, this moodiness might not add to your comfort level since you often prefer to remain in the logical world of thought. The problem is that your analytical abilities are not as rational today as you think. You can overcome some of your subjectivity by slowing down and listening to what others have to say first."
pisces,2013-03-09,"You are on an energetic upswing and you feel inexplicably cheerful about things in general, even if you're facing some difficult issues. Ultimately, this is a lucky time for you because you can turn your optimism into reality. However, you must perform a hard-to-do reality check so you don't drift too far off course. Put your facts in place and go for it. You are riding a powerful wave, so hold on tightly to your surfboard and enjoy the ride."
aries,2013-03-10,"Although you may be distracted by noisy circumstances, complicated social dilemmas won't be enough to take your mind off your inner life. Your dreams won't end this morning when you get out of bed; instead, they are woven into your thoughts and are part of your day. It might be challenging to stay in the present moment, since a free-floating nostalgia seems to follow you around. Rather than trying to shake it off today, embrace the subtle energy and turn your fantasies into your friends."
taurus,2013-03-10,"You are excited about the possibilities for the upcoming week, but you may be asked to partake in more social activities than you can manage. You have a lot to do and you wish you could just get on with it -- but life is not that simple today. You're not sure why your friends and family members are making unnecessary demands of your time, but don't resist; just joyfully do what is expected of you now and sort things out later."
gemini,2013-03-10,"You feel as if you have lost the optimistic edge you had last week, yet you're still ready to move forward with your plans. Ultimately, you think your ideas will work; it's just that you're unsure about your role in the world now. This uncertainty weighs heavily on your mind, so don't waste energy."
cancer,2013-03-10,"You are receiving intuitive hunches about your future, but they might not be perfectly aligned with your present actions. Although this dilemma can be a source of worry, there are forces at work that are beyond your comprehension now, and logical analysis won't bring you the final answer you seek. Practice living with the uncertainty; you'll feel a welcome sense of relief when you stop trying to figure everything out."
leo,2013-03-10,"Establishing clear boundaries may be problematic today. You're in a position to better understand how others see you and it isn't quite what you expect. You can settle into an emotional place now, affording you the ability to absorb the feelings of those close to you. On one hand, this empathy widens your perspective on relationships. On the other hand, you need to practice distinguishing other people's feelings from yours. Decisions will become easier to make once you gain more clarity about your own emotions."
virgo,2013-03-10,"You may be your own worst enemy today if you waver between spacing out and concentrating on your chores. You have a sense of instability as the day progresses, and you wish you could just stay on track until you fulfill your responsibilities. But your thinking is fuzzier than usual now so just let your thoughts drift for a while. Be gentle and don't judge yourself too harshly; finish tomorrow what you don't accomplish today."
libra,2013-03-10,"You are still riding a creative wave, but you may develop a sense of urgency today. You might believe that you'll lose your chance if you don't complete an unfinished task. However, your deadline is only an illusion; just because your excitement is waning, your inspiration doesn't need to die. Keep your eyes on the destination; your determination and patience will bring you the rewards you seek."
scorpio,2013-03-10,"It's been pretty quiet on the emotional front lately, but you can feel your passions flowing again now that the Moon is back in a water sign. Although it probably is refreshing at first, the intensity might distract you from the simple chores you want to finish. Don't try to suppress your powerful mood changes; your extreme reactions are a clear indication of the zest you have for life."
sagittarius,2013-03-10,"You might be in the midst of a dilemma that pits your head against your heart now. You are moving one way while your emotions flow in a different direction. Unfortunately, you can't serve two masters, especially if they are in strong disagreement. You may grow frustrated because there's no quick and easy way to resolve this situation. Inaction could be your best move today since the conflict will likely settle down after tomorrow's New Moon."
capricorn,2013-03-10,"You may be feeling an awkward sense of anticipation as you imagine easier times ahead. However, there are still a few obstacles that need to be conquered first. Although you're a natural planner, it's smarter to fly by the seat of your pants now. Circumstances are shifting so rapidly that you're better off being flexible in your approach rather than committing to a predetermined path."
aquarius,2013-03-10,"Financial matters may be troubling you now, and it's about time you get to the bottom of it. Perhaps an accounting error has just come to your attention today and it is unsettling. Thankfully, this fiscal crisis might not be a big deal at all, but the elusiveness of an immediate solution bugs you. Keep your money on your mind but don't panic; you'll find resolution, but maybe not for a couple more days."

aries,2013-03-11,"You aren't as concerned with what anyone thinks now that the Pisces New Moon falls in your 12th House of Privacy. However, keeping secrets can get you into trouble today, especially if you don't tell others what you want while still expecting them to know. Your desires will probably slip out into the open anyhow, so don't waste energy trying to hide them from those you trust. Give yourself a few days to get your whole story out; you have more time than you think to make your point."
taurus,2013-03-11,"Today's Pisces New Moon occurs in your 11th House of Long-Term Goals, encouraging you to transform your fantasies into reality. Nevertheless, you're still re-evaluating where you want to go now, so invite a friend or an associate into your dream-world and share your imaginative wanderings. Talking about your future helps you to gain the clarity you need to take your plans to the next level."
gemini,2013-03-11,"It's challenging to just be yourself today because the Pisces New Moon is in your 10th House of Responsibility. This indicates there is a particular role you need to play in the outer world. Naturally, you're a willing participant, but it means that you'll have to keep your personal life out of the picture. Protecting your emotional privacy shouldn't be too much of a problem now; it's a small price to pay for the success you see coming just around the next corner."

It's been a tough few days and you realize that the tides are now ready to change again. Your thoughts are focused on the future instead of the past, so it's time let go of your baggage. Your security is dependent on what you feel in the present moment and not tied to what you once had. Dreaming about your next big adventure is the first step to making it happen."
leo,2013-03-11,"It's tricky to shift into full gear today because the watery Pisces New Moon in your 8th House of Deep Sharing makes it difficult to take care of your own needs. Everything seems to be slightly out of focus and you might not be able to get a handle on the relationship dynamics you are experiencing. Thankfully, a bit of discomfort doesn't indicate a bad day. Nonetheless, if you loosen up and let others take control, interpersonal communication should flow along quite nicely."
virgo,2013-03-11,"You might feel as if your vitality is low since the diffusive Pisces New Moon is opposite your sign. Interactions may take on an adversarial tone today, even if there's no real issue pulling the sides apart. In fact, it's important that you realize whatever conflict comes your way now is likely to be more about your own internal dilemma -- even if it seems to be originating from someone else. You can learn a valuable lesson about your own resistance to change from your current experience."
libra,2013-03-11,"You may feel a subtle annoyance as something beyond your control keeps recycling back into your life. Even if you attempt to fix the problem, it resurfaces in new forms -- however, continue working on a solution. If you just throw your hands up in frustration, things could get worse. Thankfully, the Pisces New Moon in your 6th House of Details means a tiny adjustment to your attitude could be all that's needed to set your world in order."
scorpio,2013-03-11,"Happily, you're able to lighten up and enjoy hanging out with friends today. However, you're also aware that the bigger issues haven't gone away. Today's Pisces New Moon activates your 5th House of Love and Play, which could put the spotlight on romance. An innocence that slipped away has a chance to return now, but you must make an effort to invite it into your life. Open the door and let the good times in."
sagittarius,2013-03-11,"The imaginative Pisces Moon rattles your 4th House of Foundations today, creating a personal dilemma. Even if you have amazing fantasies about mountain climbing, downhill skiing or sky diving, you must take care of things closer to home before you can embark on your next big adventure. Your head is telling you one thing -- and if you are rational, you would listen. However, your heart is telling you something else -- and you must fearlessly follow your dreams."
capricorn,2013-03-11,"You are entering a new phase of your journey now as you try to relax the restrictions that have held you back from fully expressing your thoughts. Even if the potential ramifications of your message are scary, you must trust your intuition today. The surreal Pisces New Moon falls in your 3rd House of Information, and you're moving through deeper waters now. Your old compass and maps won't be much help in navigating your way out; relax and let your imagination be your guide."
aquarius,2013-03-11,"You may be thinking about how you can increase your income now that the Pisces New Moon falls in your 2nd House of Self-Worth. But your ideas could be based on unrealistic fantasies because seven planets are lurking in imaginative Pisces. Fortunately, your dreams can come true if you take the time to separate out the practical ones and focus on them. Setting reachable goals can make all the difference between failure and success."
pisces,2013-03-11,"Let yourself dream about the possibilities of the year ahead, because today's New Moon in your sign marks a new beginning for you, Fish. Allow your fantasies to carry your thoughts far and wide. Make your wish based upon what's in your heart rather than what other people expect of you. There will be plenty of time later on to create a more realistic plan; for now, your imagination can be your greatest source of inspiration."
aries,2013-03-12,"No one is certain about what you're going to do next because you are ready to take back control of your life. Although your fantasy world has been overactive for the past few weeks, it's time to move your dreams out into the real world. Fortunately, now that your key planet, Mars, is back in your sign, you can call on that famous Aries courage to overcome any fear. Just don't expect too much too fast, since it could be a few weeks before your plans begin to take shape."
taurus,2013-03-12,"You're shifting gears to move into a phase where your imagination becomes just as important as reality. Daydreaming can be a creative process today, but there are problems with losing yourself in fantasy. Your beliefs could limit your success if you are holding on to unconscious patterns. Look within and clear your mind of the fears that prevent you from accomplishing the things you want to do."
gemini,2013-03-12,"Hang on tightly ... because you're about to get a jolt of energy in the form of eager Mars entering your 11th House of Friends. You'll find yourself more involved in social activities, but you could have so much fun that you exhaust yourself. Balance your own individual needs with the needs of your companions and associates. You can have a blast this month if you don't take your revelry too far."
cancer,2013-03-12,"If you are thinking about a career move, it's time to put your plans into action. Luckily, you'll have more energy to apply to your job over the next few weeks, but you still must be cautious with your time. You can inadvertently threaten others -- even your boss -- if you push too hard. This may lead to wasting energy on arguments that could have been easily avoided. Clarify your goals as soon as possible, then start working steadily to meet your objectives."
leo,2013-03-12,"Red-hot Mars enters a fellow fire sign today, prompting you to take a risk to make the most of this time in your life. You have a renewed sense of enthusiasm for the next several weeks and are eager to plan your future, to travel or to begin a new course of study -- anything that helps you expand your horizons. However, you may find that you are defending indefensible positions if you overly identify with your beliefs. It's better to quietly lead by example than to try to convince anyone that your views are the right ones."
virgo,2013-03-12,"The need to redefine a current relationship may begin to subside, but new experiences deepen these issues ... even if they become more subtle. You want to push ahead with your own agenda now, but you're reluctant to offend anyone close to you. Inevitably, your mixed feelings can muddy the waters and make solutions more difficult to find. One thing is for certain: you need to rely on others to get to where you want to go. The temptation to go off alone only complicates matters more. The choice is still yours to make."
libra,2013-03-12,"Now that warrior Mars has entered feisty Aries and your 7th House of Partners, you could become more assertive in all types of relationships. You are motivated to initiate decisive action now -- something that's often a struggle for you. Don't wait until the other person brings up an issue; think about what you want to do and then do it. As long as you act within a context of cooperation -- which is usually easy for you -- things will work out for the best."
scorpio,2013-03-12,"Your current spunky attitude may bring some tricky issues to the surface now. External circumstances require you to work hard and to perform at a high level of expertise while doing your job. But you want to do certain things your own way, only to find your path is being blocked. Try not to internalize your frustration because you might court illness if you do. The solution is to act with integrity and take pride in your work, regardless of everything else."
sagittarius,2013-03-12,"You are now entering a particularly playful and creative period as irrepressible Mars skips into your 5th House of Spontaneity. You can experience excitement through activities with children, or you may set aside your responsibilities and seek new ways to enjoy yourself by connecting with your inner child. Either way you choose today, jump in and walk your talk. There's no room to do anything halfway now, so don't hold back."
capricorn,2013-03-12,"You may not be able to avoid the big changes in your personal life, yet you're secretly excited about the prospects. There is a lot to do around the home and, thankfully, you have the ambition to start projects now and actually complete them. If possible, maintain a low profile today, especially in the workplace. It may be difficult to withhold your emotions, but your discretion is worth it. You can avoid some of the drama that otherwise may arise due to differences of feelings."
aquarius,2013-03-12,"Interactions with close friends and co-workers begin to raise the noise level of your daily routine. You are more direct and expressive than usual, and your eagerness to converse might unintentionally initiate more conflict. You tend to take things more personally now, so avoid pointless arguments if at all possible. Dramatic showdowns are just a waste of everyone's energies and won't make anyone happier ... no matter who wins the fight."
pisces,2013-03-12,"Be wary of making impulsive decisions today, especially relating to how you spend your money. You're inclined to purchase something you don't really need, or you might buy it for the wrong reasons. Problems arise when you over-identify with material things; happiness must come from within and not from what you own. Take stock of all the blessings in your life, and you may discover you have everything you need."
aries,2013-03-13,"Your natural ability to pump more adrenaline into a situation might hit a speed bump now as you struggle to maintain the hectic pace. Thankfully, you won't need to worry so much if you just tone down your energy level a little bit. Do it voluntarily, or reality might just have to slow you down without your permission. It's a smarter strategy to build momentum throughout next week, rather than trying to hit maximum speed today."
taurus,2013-03-13,"The Moon and Mars are visiting your 12th House of Dreams today, stimulating your imagination. Unfortunately, you may try to resist the feelings that are emerging. It's not that you don't appreciate the beauty of a lovely fantasy, but you have a lot to do and might be fearful of falling behind on your responsibilities. Establishing healthy boundaries helps to keep you tethered to the real world until you have time to make your escape."
gemini,2013-03-13,"Although you may be in the middle of your workweek, you're not eager to surrender your social life. Needless to say, your desire to hang out with your friends could cause problems. But it's not just about being around your peers; you are also concerned with your role in the community. Unfortunately, others might not be willing to give you the latitude you want. Don't stir up any unnecessary conflicts today. Go ahead and stand up for your convictions, but don't flaunt your strong opinions unless it's absolutely necessary."
cancer,2013-03-13,"The spontaneous Aries Moon is moving through your 10th House of Public Behavior, drawing you out of your comfort zone. Still, it's crucial to find time to retreat back into physical or metaphysical places where you feel emotionally safe. Although your world may be infiltrated by unfriendly people today, don't get caught up in their superficial games. For the next few days, your real growth continues to occur on a deeper and more internal level. Nevertheless, you must find a way to balance your personal needs with your professional ambitions to maximize your potential."
leo,2013-03-13,"You are doing your best to live in the present moment today, and you may do it with so much gusto that you upset others. They might think your blind optimism is glossing over negative factors that also need to be taken into consideration. Pay attention to your motives just to make sure you don't take initiative for the wrong reason. A little sensitivity and forethought can assure that your actions are well-received."
virgo,2013-03-13,"You must make decisions that involve the complex needs of others, distracting you from your regular routine and disrupting your day. However, burying your head in the sand isn't a viable strategy -- you have plenty to learn by facing a messy situation now. You can gain experience navigating through the seas of change today, even before you have all the facts. Thankfully, using your intuition frees you from the restraints of too much analysis."
libra,2013-03-13,"It's challenging to find enough time to take care of the personal chores that continue to pile up. Instead of trying to do everything, decide which tasks are the most important and let the others slide for a few more days. If you work too hard, you could start to feel resentful of those folks who don't seem to be struggling as much. Taking a few short breaks throughout the day enables you to return to your unfinished business with a lighter heart."
scorpio,2013-03-13,"Your world would be a better place today if you can just resolve a pesky problem that is bugging you. You are craving something new in your life, a memorable addition to feed your soul and revitalize your daily regimen. But, simultaneously, you need the regularity of habit and the structure of routine. Find a way to mix the two and you'll be on your way to achieving greater satisfaction. Dare to think outside of the box and you will find your solution."
sagittarius,2013-03-13,"Your unrestrained optimism may have you making promises you cannot keep, but you will be able to overcome nearly any odds if you have a practical plan. Your positive attitude can increase the anger of someone who challenges your efforts today. Instead of wasting time waging battle now, channel your enthusiasm and energy directly into your work to keep your day on the right track."
capricorn,2013-03-13,"The most significant changes might not be happening in your outer world where everyone can see. Although some people may respond to you with unbridled enthusiasm and encouragement, there could be some quiet resentment developing beneath the surface. Your uncharacteristic eagerness now could be a bit unnerving for your friends, but you don't have to let their anxiety rub off on you. Shine your light brightly for all to see."
aquarius,2013-03-13,"You're all over the map today because there's so much happening in your world -- making it challenging to keep up with everything and everyone. Tread lightly because your interactions with others might be negatively affected by your unspoken fear of being overwhelmed. Paying close attention to how your friends and associates react can help you to avert conflict, helping you reach your destination on time."
pisces,2013-03-13,"You're overly concerned with maintaining your material security today, especially if you believe that the power base at work is subtly shifting. Don't try to hold on to the status quo because your world isn't static now ... and your rigidity only increases the tension. Take a fresh look at your finances, but don't make any long-lasting decisions yet. A little change will do you good."
aries,2013-03-14,"You may get so excited that it's difficult to contain yourself. However, it may be obvious to you later in the day that you overreacted, which, in turn, makes the situation even more awkward. Thankfully, smoothing the ruffled feathers is easier than you expect if you put your mind to it. Enjoy the calm after the storm. Take a few deep breaths; after all, you've earned the right to relax."
taurus,2013-03-14,"You have arrived at the Last Chance Cafe once again, although you are sure that this time it's really your final opportunity to get it right. However, you are wrong once more. It may be true that you need to tie up as many loose ends as possible before the Moon enters your sign this afternoon, but whatever isn't completed will still be there later. In the meantime, give yourself permission to settle into the evening and reflect on the blessings in your life."
gemini,2013-03-14,"Concentrating on your work may seem nearly impossible now because there are so many interesting diversions that catch your attention. Often, your insatiable curiosity leads you down fantastic avenues of exploration. However, today it just makes you feel annoyingly scattered. Ultimately, you can reach your destination by reminding yourself to return to your original goal each time you lose focus."
cancer,2013-03-14,"You might grow tired of being responsible for the happiness of everyone else because it may seem as if that's all you have been doing lately. Although you aren't likely to walk out on your obligations, it could be time to restore some healthy balance to your life. Begin by acknowledging what would make you feel happy. Then, slowly start to move in that direction ... even if it means taking some emotional risks. Occasionally, there's nothing wrong with others taking care of themselves."
leo,2013-03-14,"If you feel like you're riding positive waves of change, it's wise to wear a life jacket as you head into rougher waters. A local storm isn't necessarily an indication of a serious issue, it might simply be a sign that you need to slow down enough to review your plans. Don't worry about solving every problem that surfaces; just navigate your way around the obstacles until you find a safe place to land."
virgo,2013-03-14,"You have delved deep enough into psychological intrigue and drama, and now you're ready for a simpler approach to life. Even if sweet pleasures are elusive earlier in the day, you can rest easy knowing that some fun is on the way later on. Making the right choices today sets the stage for peace and harmony to follow."
libra,2013-03-14,"An intense emotional engagement with someone special may have taken a lot of energy recently, but now it's time to turn this positive interaction into something more meaningful. It's as if a gentle waltz is bridging into a powerful tango right in front of your eyes. And, as the passion increases, so does your pleasure. Don't resist it; accept the current positive changes as a reward for your recent efforts. Lead with your heart and happiness will follow."
scorpio,2013-03-14,"You feel as if you have a secret weapon today, but you can't tell anyone about it because your power comes from what you don't say. Some may think that your charisma is a by-product of your sexual energy, but it actually goes beyond that and into spiritual realms. Your magnetism remains strong as long as the mystery continues. Keep your motives camouflaged for now and, in general, don't say more than you must."
sagittarius,2013-03-14,"You may have recently spent a lot of time and energy pursuing pleasure instead of getting your work done. Now it's time to pay the piper by catching up on your chores, even if it means saying no to a leisurely lunch or an evening out with your friends. However, attempting to do everything at once only creates more complications. The simplest route to success is reached by prioritizing your tasks and then doing them in order, one after another, until you are finished."
capricorn,2013-03-14,"The first part of the day may be frustrating because it feels like you're running around in circles. Even your most reliable practices don't seem to contribute to your progress today. A smart strategy is to relax without giving up. Luckily, you should be able to find your rhythm later in the afternoon and can quickly make up for lost time."
aquarius,2013-03-14,"A wave of exhaustion may wash over your body today, requiring you to stop and reconsider how much you have already done this week. Unfortunately, you still have a lot to do, yet your heart might not be in your work right now. Accepting your fatigue can be a crucial first step in overcoming it. Take some time out in order to recuperate; you'll be much more efficient once you return to your work fully rested."
pisces,2013-03-14,"This is a tortoise and hare kind of day -- and you are now playing the role of both of these characters. You're off to a fast start as the hare and you are ready to run your paces. But you grow smarter as you consider how you can sustain your efforts. Slowing down like the tortoise makes a lot of sense to you, and the sooner you do it, the longer you'll be able to last."
aries,2013-03-15,It's nearly impossible now to separate your fundamental beliefs from what you need to do on a practical level. Breaking down a complicated job into the simplest steps helps to align your life with your core values. There's no room today for fuzzy thinking or actions that are inconsistent with your inner purpose. Starting small enables you to act with integrity throughout the day.
taurus,2013-03-15,"Thankfully, no one will be able to distract you from your agenda today, or talk you into doing any kind of trivial task. Others are quick to realize that you know what you're doing and your determination won't be swayed. However, don't be afraid to join forces if you meet someone who shares your practical perspective. Forging a partnership now could create an unbeatable team that is greater than the sum of its parts."
gemini,2013-03-15,"You are inclined to let others know about your vision for success now, but just be aware that they may not want to hear about your next grand scheme. You might feel as if your parade is under a dark cloud ... and you certainly don't want to march in the rain. Rather than pretending that everything is fine, a temporary retreat could be in order while you wait for the weather to clear. Luckily, you can use the extra time to improve your plan and increase your chances for a sunny outcome."
cancer,2013-03-15,"You're often able to talk your way out of a funk, especially if you have a trusted friend who will listen to you as you wander around in your imagination. Unfortunately, something just won't stop bothering you today, even if you share all of your secrets. An unresolved feeling may be lurking in the deep waters off the foggy coast of your consciousness. But don't worry, it's not as scary as it seems at first. Trust your intuition as you develop a creative plan; it might not be logical, but it could just work."
leo,2013-03-15,"You may feel rather inflexible today, resisting even casual social commitments. You don't like the idea of being tied down to someone else's schedule at all. You want to follow your own agenda and you won't likely surrender without a struggle. Unfortunately, this kind of stubbornness can create more problems than it solves. Consider taking a less severe stance in your dealings with others now. Friendly cooperation is your secret weapon for success."
virgo,2013-03-15,"Responsibility is calling, but you don't feel like answering the phone today. You might wish that your voicemail could just take a message, but you realize that you must get involved. As you are pulled into the conversation, it may bother you that the dialogue is so visionary, without practical application. Don't push your beliefs onto others now; a creative approach can still be useful if you let the discussions take a natural course. Wait a few more days before making any final decisions."
libra,2013-03-15,"Even your best ideas can get hung up today, especially if too much information comes at you from all directions. Paying attention to the details helps, but you might be sidetracked by other people's issues. Unlike some days, there's no need to judge the validity of the data now. Your determination will keep you moving forward as you bounce back and forth between the general and the specific."
scorpio,2013-03-15,"You are no stranger to power plays and control issues, so you're quickly annoyed if an inflexible person is limiting your ability. You may feel the tentacles creeping toward you and attempting to tie up your free will. Thankfully, this type of resistance won't stop you because you can retain parts of your life that others cannot reach. Hold on to your destiny by keeping your desires to yourself today. Just remember to open up when the time is right or you will be playing alone."
sagittarius,2013-03-15,"You might take a risk today by sharing something meaningful at work. Unfortunately, in the context of your disclosure, the other person may not understand what you are really saying. It seems to you as if it's their problem, for you are being as clear as possible. Maybe it's not about what you are expressing; it's more about your audience. If you aren't getting your message across, consider retreating until you find someone more receptive."
capricorn,2013-03-15,"Gentle waves of positive energy flow through your life today, but you still must be careful about your attitude. The devil may be lurking in the details that you miss. Usually, being realistic is your most successful approach, but an extra touch of optimism goes a long way now. Nevertheless, keep your feet on the ground if you want to succeed."
aquarius,2013-03-15,"You might not be in a social mood today, even if others expect you to lighten up. Having fun on command isn't your idea of a good time. You would rather talk about your latest plans for financial independence or the brightest business idea that's running through your brain. It's healthier to be true to your own needs than to pretend happiness just for the sake of someone else."
pisces,2013-03-15,"You have something on your mind and you want to share your thoughts now that the Moon is occupying your 3rd House of Communication. Unfortunately, you might feel as if you should have said it a couple of days ago. It may be more difficult to open the door to a tough subject now, but it will only get harder as the days progress. Thankfully, you can make steady progress in discussions if your heart is genuinely invested. Don't let anyone dissuade you from expressing your truth."
aries,2013-03-16,"Reconsidering your own motives now may bring a critical realization to the surface, yet greater awareness also presents additional choices. Circumstances might require you to decide between taking care of yourself and assisting another person through a rough spot. It could be useful to know why you are so eager to fix someone else's problems before you attend to your own. Establishing sensible priorities is easier once you're certain that your intentions are in the right place."
taurus,2013-03-16,"You may feel a sense of resignation sweep through your thoughts today as you see things from a new point of view. Although you believe you know the truth, you don't have to rush in and solve the problem. But your acceptance of a difficult situation shouldn't be an excuse for laziness. There's still plenty of work to do and even if it takes time to build the necessary momentum, it's wiser to start sooner than later."
gemini,2013-03-16,"Even your most casual actions can give others exactly the inspiration they need today. Imagine what you could do if you consciously commit to go the extra mile. Don't be afraid to push past your justifications for doing less. Your hard work is rewarded, but not in the way you might expect. Instead of increasing your income, you will be acknowledged for your contribution which, oddly enough, could make you happier in the moment than earning more money."
cancer,2013-03-16,"Thinking about the future now reminds you of the past. In particular, you might remember an old emotional or physical wound, but you really don't have the time to reminisce. You have too much to do in your life today, so indulge your flashback and then return to the current situation. Although you can't change your history, you can use the memory to positively impact the present."
leo,2013-03-16,"You're tempted to rescue every lost animal and hug every needy child today. Your compassion is real, but it may be fueled by your own feelings of insecurity. You won't fix your emotional wounds by helping others, but you might feel better for a while. More importantly, you can bring sunshine into the life of someone else who really needs it."
virgo,2013-03-16,"Your hard work may be enough to get you through a difficult time today, although you probably realize that solving the underlying issue is more complicated. Tensions have been brewing for a while and could take additional time to fully address. In the meantime, don't procrastinate. There are specific things that need to be done now and you are the one to do them. Take it slowly; you won't be able to plow your way through the entire list in one day."
libra,2013-03-16,"A feeling of competence helps to put you at ease today, but the situation probably isn't quite as manageable as it seems at first. One way to be of service now is by acting as a cheerleader because you can encourage people to perform beyond their normal levels. Dig deeply into your own psychological arsenal and use whatever tools you have to inspire others to fulfill their potential."
scorpio,2013-03-16,"Dealing with a stubborn person today might make you realize how rigid you can be, too. Although single-mindedness is an admirable trait, it may also be a recipe for disaster if two bull-headed people remain inflexible for too long. Consciously look at the issue from a different point of view. It's not about being right or wrong; it's just about finding a middle ground and proceeding from there in good faith."
sagittarius,2013-03-16,"Giving voice to self-doubt can make everything seem more difficult today. Thankfully, your recent tendency toward scattering your energy may temporarily become less of a problem now, but you could retreat so hard and fast that you don't make any progress at all. Acknowledge your apprehension, while consciously using logic to find a way to overcome it. Maintaining a rational approach is the fastest route to regaining your confidence."
capricorn,2013-03-16,"You are more relaxed now that your common sense is back in the driver's seat. Although there's still a lot of background noise in your life, the energy seems to be settling down a bit. You can help your cause by cutting back on unnecessary activities. The more you focus your attention today, the easier it will be to regain control over your daily routines."
aquarius,2013-03-16,"A conflict between what you currently want to do and what you have already promised can distract you from being productive. You could waste precious time today arguing with a friend or family member. However, you still might not be able to convince others that you're right, no matter what you say. Don't try to force resolution now; let unresolved matters remain that way until the energy shifts in a day or two."
pisces,2013-03-16,"A powerful wave of compassion might motivate you to sacrifice something important today so you can help another person -- maybe even a member of your own family. Naturally, it's commendable to come to the aid of someone you love, but it isn't as praiseworthy if you then choose to play the role of a martyr. Consider the consequences of what you're doing before you do it. Although it's not beneficial to anyone if you're setting yourself up to be a saint, true love can be a powerful healing force."
aries,2013-03-17,"You may be tired of relying on your intuition and look forward to basing decisions on more reliable information once again. The waters that have passed under your bridge are already heading out to open sea, so let go of whatever has happened in the recent past. You're ready to reclaim your strength as the enterprising Aries that you truly are. It's time to apply your sense of purpose and fearlessly embrace the future."
taurus,2013-03-17,"You're able to speak directly from your heart now, even if you are still unsure how you plan to fulfill your personal needs. Luckily, your sensitive words touch the hearts of others and they won't be able to resist your charm. But don't push anyone to provoke an immediate reaction; it could take several days to see any results. Initiate communication today and then let the conversation unfold organically."
gemini,2013-03-17,"You're particularly sensitive to change now as your key planet Mercury turns direct on the same day the Moon returns to your sign. The mental winds are shifting quickly, but the game you have been playing is not over. You are simply being placed on notice that the integration cycle of the last three weeks has reached completion. Stop the endless analysis and just reach for new experiences before the opportunity passes."
cancer,2013-03-17,"You may feel a special connection to your past as dreams and fantasies capture your imagination. Ultimately, you're not very interested in looking back; you have your mind set on an upcoming adventure. But something that was said weeks ago might resurface and continue to grow more important over the next few weeks. Even if you don't get a mercurial reminder notice, prioritize the unfinished business that is piling up on your plate. Start now, before it is too late."
leo,2013-03-17,"Your need to communicate is accentuated today, but it may not yet be apparent to anyone else. You might not say everything you are thinking, even if you know what's going on. Give yourself permission to be cautious because it's crucial to establish trust during this transitional time. Don't let anyone cajole you into premature action. Make your move only when you are truly ready."
virgo,2013-03-17,"You feel very excited as your key planet, Mercury, turns direct today. However, it may be challenging to express what's on your mind, since sharing what you're thinking could alter things in ways you would rather not change. Keep controversial thoughts to yourself for a few more days, even if you're bursting at the seams with anticipation. On the other hand, be prepared to get your best ideas out into the open as circumstances permit."
libra,2013-03-17,"Your thoughts are quite original today, but it could be difficult to bring them to their logical conclusions. Even if you feel as if you're on top of your intellectual game, there is an emotional uncertainty that prevents you from pushing to your final mental destination. Take a deep breath and rest assured that you'll arrive just in time. You won't fall behind schedule if you simply follow your heart."
scorpio,2013-03-17,"A methodical approach enables you to get to the source of your own intense emotions today. Fortunately, you can find calm in the center of any storm. Intellectually, you may already realize there's nothing to fear, and that you derive strength from the stillness. However, as clever Mercury starts to move forward again, be ready to move into new intellectual territory without giving up the sense of peace you have found."
sagittarius,2013-03-17,"Imagine how much you could accomplish if you were able to hold time, itself, motionless, even for just a little while. Ironically, you might get flashes of this feeling now that Mercury hangs still in the sky, giving you the illusion of speeding up as everything else seems to slow down. But don't fritter away your ability to focus your thoughts today. Use your newly found mental powers to express your real self."
capricorn,2013-03-17,"Something feels amiss as you receive signals that tell you not to trust your emotions today. Although your reliance on facts over feelings may work to your advantage, this isn't a good time to shut down your heart. There are powerful transformations unfolding in your life, and staying in touch with your inner world gives you a better chance to make intelligent decisions now."
aquarius,2013-03-17,Don't waste your precious time and energy spinning wheels that take you round and round in endless circles today. It's pointless to obsess over goals that are out of reach. A better strategy is to simply let go of a plan that hasn't come to fruition. Carefully review the past few weeks and make a conscious decision to eliminate something that continues to hold you back. It's amazing how great you can feel when your load is lighter.
pisces,2013-03-17,"You have been given plenty of time to solve a problem that has bothered you for the last few weeks. Now, with Mercury turning direct in your sign, be ready to make a decision even if you thought you already chose your final answer. But don't sacrifice your own integrity. Consider what is most important to you and then make your move accordingly."
aries,2013-03-18,"Although unexpected events may bring confusion into your life, you're able to shift gears and accept what's happening by looking beyond your personal needs. An overactive imagination can impact your relationships for better or worse. But it's not easy to distinguish fact from fiction now, so don't bother trying to figure everything out today. Instead, allow your dreams to lead you for a while longer, but don't wander so far that you can't find your way home."
taurus,2013-03-18,"Although your feelings are aroused today, it may seem like the storm will soon be over and there's nothing you need to do to speed it along. However, it helps if you can get past your fear of change because what you learn now could be quite exciting, especially as it impacts your social goals. Don't let other people's judgments influence your thoughts or behavior. Just maintain your own integrity and you will continue to grow."
gemini,2013-03-18,"Listen carefully to your inner voice now that the reflective Moon is in your sign, encouraging you to forget logic and step into more intuitive spaces. There's no need for flowery explanations; you already know the truth. Sometimes precognition can make you feel uncomfortable as you struggle with the reliability of your thoughts. Thankfully, a small dose of emotional detachment is enough to help you be a more objective observer of your own life."
cancer,2013-03-18,"You may be more confident of your feelings today if you let them drift into more spiritual realms. Take a chance and step beyond your personal limitations or you might be tempted to withdraw behind your castle walls. Remember that security comes from withstanding change, not avoiding it. Fortunately, you are stronger than you think."
leo,2013-03-18,"A romantic attraction is confusing if you are grappling with whether or not your feelings are real. But knowing that you're temporarily lost in a fantasy isn't enough to deter your escape from reality. Your dreams can make it difficult to reconcile your current trajectory with your plans. Thankfully, you have a better chance to succeed if you throw away your driving instructions and trust the signs from your intuition."
virgo,2013-03-18,"You might find it challenging to believe something that you previously thought was real. You aren't sure what changed, but your need for clarity is still being thwarted. Let go of your illusions about being in control now. Relaxing the death grip you have on the rational world today enables you to more easily tap into the depth of your imagination."
libra,2013-03-18,"Don't give up now, even if you're unsure of what you should do next. Your emotions are a bit out of control and it's difficult to know who to trust. But this temporary confusion isn't necessarily problematic, for it also presents plenty of opportunities for growth. You don't have to pretend that you have it all together today if you're not feeling it. Ultimately, following your intuition  reveals the best path to your destination and your faith will light the way."
scorpio,2013-03-18,"You may feel as if something has returned from the past, and your irrepressible desires are sparking an emotional renewal. Your concentration may drift today, but you are still certain about what feels good. During this time of heightened awareness, focus on your heart's desire and do everything you can to make your dreams come true."
sagittarius,2013-03-18,"An unfulfilled desire from your childhood may take you for a trip down Memory Lane today. You could remember something that you haven't thought about for a long time as pictures from the past rush into consciousness. Feelings of love are accentuated, even if your common sense is not. Don't worry about the wrong things; allowing your heart to open can also help it to heal."
capricorn,2013-03-18,"You want everything to move along faster now that Mercury is turning direct in your 3rd House of Communications. You may be struggling to balance your busy schedule with your emotional needs. Make the best of what you have because your time for major decisions has temporarily passed. Fortunately, there isn't any reason for major concern because a lost opportunity will come knocking on your door again."
aquarius,2013-03-18,"There's no need to withdraw into isolation to recharge your emotional batteries today. You are eager to enjoy the casual companionship of your peers and associates at work now, and this kind of social activity can rejuvenate your soul. Thankfully, your creative juices flow easily in a friendly environment, so don't hold back from playing with others and letting your light shine."
pisces,2013-03-18,"Your current blend of charm and flexibility enables you to convince others that your point of view is a valuable one. However, you may be annoyed, or even offended, by someone who is shallow or insensitive. You might be tempted to hide your feelings if expressing them destabilizes your day. However, don't take the easy way out by acting cool; overcoming your fears and saying what's on your mind ultimately brings you closer to your goals."
aries,2013-03-19,"You may try to escape an inevitable clash with your own emotions today, but this evasive tactic won't likely work. A conflict with someone close to you throws your feelings right back in your face, even if you attempt to turn away. Denial is just not an option now. Deal directly with your fears in the moment or getting a handle on the situation will be more difficult once the Moon slips into sensitive Cancer this afternoon. Staying present and talking things out could bring the peaceful resolution you need."
taurus,2013-03-19,"Incisive thoughts prompt sound decisions that may be very beneficial to you financially today, but it's doubly important that you pay close attention to the details. Consider all possible solutions by keeping your mind open to what others say. Adopting a flexible attitude and being more adaptable in your approach improves your chances for success ... there are more ways to achieve your goals than you think."
gemini,2013-03-19,"You have direct access to valuable information today that is usually out of your reach. Fortunately, you can learn whatever you need to know if you are willing to put in the extra effort. Although you may be inclined to do more research, honoring your intuition could reveal important insights that offer you both inspiration and guidance. Spending some time in meditation or prayer might be the way to uncover the answers you seek."
cancer,2013-03-19,"Typically, you prefer to observe and contemplate before taking action, but you might feel the urgency to dive right into a critical situation today. Slow down and think twice before acting on an impulse, because you might inadvertently pour fuel on to a fire that you're attempting to extinguish. Self-reflection offers a fresh perspective once the Moon returns to your sign, providing you with a workable solution. But remember, you don't have to wait for an emergency to be innovative in your approach."
leo,2013-03-19,"Group-related issues are liable to eat up your time and attention today as you confront matters you thought were long behind you. Unfinished business with friends or coworkers may seem like a disturbance at first, but it's really an indication of something more significant that needs your attention. Cleaning up the past is a logical way to make room for a brighter future."
virgo,2013-03-19,"Constant changes at work may be your biggest challenge now as you attempt to stabilize your professional life. Your unconventional ideas could be quite useful, but you might not be willing to alter your approach to fulfilling your responsibilities. Remain confident and show everyone that you are a capable leader by cultivating a flexible attitude. Adapting quickly to new circumstances will be seen as a strength rather than as a weakness."
libra,2013-03-19,"An intense conversation with an independent person may take you in an entirely unexpected direction today. However, if you're receptive to having meaningful discussions, the rich dialogue can stimulate you to reexamine your life and lead you to useful insights. Don't worry about other people's judgments; ignore anyone on a power trip who is just putting you down. Instead, interact with those who are sincerely willing to join you in mutual exploration with open minds and hearts."
scorpio,2013-03-19,"Taking a risk is probably a smart thing to do now because you could benefit by pushing beyond your normal limits. You won't ever reach your greatest potential unless you're willing to push the envelope and go past your safe boundaries. Naturally, there's no need to change if you are content with your current life. But if you're itching for something more, ask some hard questions and explore new options while you have the chance."
sagittarius,2013-03-19,"There is movement in the air today, but it's up to you to initiate action. Seize the day by setting goals and then going after them. A little competition may be invigorating for you now, so pick your challenges wisely instead of waiting for them to find you. Passive behavior could lead to endless discussions that go around in circles and lead nowhere productive. However, being assertive can set a positive tone leading to a sweet feeling of accomplishment."
capricorn,2013-03-19,"You might not have the option to plan cautiously now as circumstances pressure you into action. There are many factors prodding you into motion, even if it feels somewhat premature. Although spontaneity may not be your preferred way of doing things, be ready to react at a moment's notice today. A quick response will buy you additional time to consider your next move."
aquarius,2013-03-19,"Attempting to focus could give you a real headache today because there are so many delightful diversions all around you. Unfortunately, seeing a job through to the end may not be as easy as you wish. Although you can still be quite clever and amusing, spontaneous behavior won't bring you any closer to your goals. Channel your need for pleasure into creative activities and then get back to the routine tasks at hand."
pisces,2013-03-19,"It's tricky managing all the facts now and even paying special attention to your words won't necessarily be clear. You might not hear exactly what's being said and the psychic interference could turn even the most straightforward conversation into a nonsensical passage. Nevertheless, aim for accuracy by taking as much time as necessary to confirm the messages that you send and receive."
aries,2013-03-20,"Although your awareness is breaking through new ground like a germinated seed sprouting towards the sunlight, you might experience momentary pangs of self-doubt. Your life is pregnant with positive possibilities and you want to pursue all of them. However, the important work today is to delve beneath the surface because it's the hidden things that hold the real power. Push your fears aside and dig in."
taurus,2013-03-20,"You are quite fascinated with the symbolism that's bubbling up from your own imagination today. Your current fantasies seem so real, so meaningful, so dangerous and so not you. You may wonder why you're attracted to the beauty of what lies beneath the surface, when normally you are more concerned with things of material substance. Don't waste time questioning what's happening; just sink into the experience and learn what you can from your colorful inner world."
gemini,2013-03-20,"Serious feelings come and go in waves today. Although you want to lighten up and be socially involved, worries about money are tough to shake. Even if you choose to enjoy the company of friends or coworkers, you must set limits on your discretionary spending. Thankfully, you can get away from your mundane concerns for a while if you adopt a sensible approach to balancing work and play. Creating priceless memories doesn't have to cost a thing."
cancer,2013-03-20,"On one side of the equation, actions speak louder than words and you're eager to make things happen at work today. However, on the other side, the Moon is visiting your sign and feelings are all that really matter. Even if you successfully lead by example for a while, you can still bounce back and forth between these two worlds. Nevertheless, don't resist diving into the watery realm of your emotions. Just keep your subjectivity under wraps for now when dealing with others."
leo,2013-03-20,"You Lions are like a field of eager dandelions today, ready to spring into full glory at the slightest hint of warm sunshine. You feel so creative now that you want others to stop and admire your work. However, there are many flowers laden with pollen, so you can't expect all the bees to favor you. Remember, you're not the only show in town, so don't try to take all the sunlight for yourself. You'll shine even brighter when others shine, too."
virgo,2013-03-20,"You might be slightly annoyed today because you want less noise in your surroundings so you can concentrate on your work. But the distractions come knocking at your door like too many bad jokes at a cocktail party. Of course, witty performances provide a clever sort of amusement, but you still wish you could turn the volume down now. Unfortunately, you may not have as much control over your environment as you prefer. Be smart and accept what you cannot change, and keep a sense of humor about the rest."
libra,2013-03-20,"Your key planet, Venus, forms a magical connection with boundless Jupiter today, leading you off course and promoting a fun day. But you can't keep everything light and fluffy. Your impulses may be wild and uncontrollable now, but you are also obsessed with deeper feelings that need to be expressed. Don't sit around talking about your great ideas; you already know what to do. So seize the opportunity while it's still knocking at your door."
scorpio,2013-03-20,"You wish that you had more time to weigh your current options before being pressed into action. Although you may have to sacrifice your personal timetable, you're not eager to just let someone else rearrange your agenda. You have a solid idea of something big and amazing in your future; don't let fear sneak into the picture. Concentrate on the best possible outcome and be willing to compromise a bit to get your way in the long run."
sagittarius,2013-03-20,"Sweet Venus highlights your key planet, Jupiter, today in your 7th House of Partners, bringing optimistic people into your life. As enthusiastic as you are about working with someone special, you might also be worried that your secret insecurities could unravel a new relationship. But you don't learn anything by pretending you know everything. Instead of showing off your ability to make decisions, share the responsibility by letting others take charge for a while."
capricorn,2013-03-20,"Although the Moon may reflect your fear of rejection today, her opposition to potent Pluto gives you strength to stand up for your beliefs. You have a very realistic view of your possible future, but it might feel as if a friend or coworker is standing in your way. Thankfully, you have a specific mission now and you are not inclined to let others run your private affairs. Remember you can still care about someone, even if you won't back down. State what you feel is non-negotiable, but be kind in your delivery."
aquarius,2013-03-20,"Springtime places an emphasis on communication for you non-conformist Aquarians, but you prefer to keep everything light and lively. You may be invited on a magical mystery tour of subterranean emotional mysteries. Although you might say you're busy and can't make it, reality has already accepted the invitation on your behalf. Show up with a smile on your face and the willingness to be surprised by a journey to the unknown."
pisces,2013-03-20,"You are being bombarded by deep feelings of attraction or repulsion that won't go away. The waters of life are humming with complex patterns of emotional charges today. While much of the world is being distracted by the arrival of spring, you are still swimming in the dark depths of meaning. Trust your intuition and follow the timing of your own heart."
aries,2013-03-21,"You're feeling a bit battle-weary today as you grow tired of your old familiar games. Your current discomfort might prevent you from laying low as you step onto the front lines. Although you may have obligations now, you are being presented with an opportunity to start a process of emotional rejuvenation. Don't distract yourself from the real work at hand; paying attention to your heart leads you in the right direction."
taurus,2013-03-21,"Unexpressed emotions may increase your vulnerability today, but you probably can see a way through the situation. You are eager to share your perspective even if you aren't yet sure exactly what you will say. Give yourself permission to float without a solution for a while longer. If you're feeling isolated now, it might be of your own creation. Thankfully, you don't have to reveal anything until you are ready. In the meantime, writing down your thoughts helps move the process along in a healthy way."
gemini,2013-03-21,"Your silence enables you to hear your important thoughts today, even if you are slightly afraid of them. However, finding a way to express your fears may bring you closer to your goals, so don't use clever words to talk your way out of your funk. Instead, take your time and speak carefully to reveal an aspect of yourself that you normally keep hidden. This intentional disclosure can create intimacy, along with much-needed healing."
cancer,2013-03-21,"On the surface, everything seems copacetic today, but you're tuned into more subtle signals that suggest otherwise. Your energy is moving outward, toward the other people in your life, leaving little left over for you. It may be challenging to stay in contact with your emotions now that rowdy Mars has taken up residence in your 10th House of Public Responsibility. Luckily, you can consciously focus on your inner world long enough to evaluate what needs to be done and to fix what's broken."
leo,2013-03-21,"Although there are no parental authority figures or bosses to tell you what to do now, you might not be able to enjoy yourself until you finish planning your getaway. It's best to take your time and make sure all the details are in place, rather than assuming all the pieces will somehow fit together on their own. Keep your ideas to yourself while you're still developing them. There will be plenty of time later on to share the upcoming adventure once you're ready."
virgo,2013-03-21,"You might not follow through and execute all your plans today, yet you still can feel good about what you accomplish. Your peers may not appreciate the logic of your methods now, but you should be able to convince them to give you the room you need to get your work done. If you do fall behind, don't expect anyone to get on your case. Being your own critic motivates you to improve your work without waiting for someone else's judgment."
libra,2013-03-21,"Although emotional wounds received in the past may come back to haunt you today, it's finally time to let them go. Unfortunately, cutting the ties that bind you to your memories is easier said than done. Your best path to healing is through clear communication. However, everything won't be fixed with one quick conversation; you are undertaking a long-term project. Nevertheless, start it today now to maximize your chances to heal."
scorpio,2013-03-21,"You might be holding on to an old conversation yet, thankfully, you have an opportunity to move past this emotional blockage now. Whether it was last week or thirty years ago, this is the time to revisit the initial cause of your current pain. No action is required today; just bring your awareness to the origin of the problem while accepting that you are OK just the way you are. Being gentle with yourself is more important than turning your life upside down in the present moment."
sagittarius,2013-03-21,"You may be more serious than usual today as you seek to understand your emotional limitations. It could be challenging to be as optimistic as others expect of you, but don't waste energy worrying about it. Look back over the past few years to see how the obstacles you overcame made you stronger. Although you're appreciative of your support network, forget about what anyone else thinks now and do what you know must be done."
capricorn,2013-03-21,"You are deeply pensive today because you cannot understand why you are struggling so hard for something just out of reach. Family and friends may think that you're wearing an old scar like a medal of honor, but it's not healthy to glorify an old wound. Use what you know in the present moment to reframe the past so you can finally heal and move on."
aquarius,2013-03-21,"You may be feeling blue today for no apparent reason. Stern Saturn's trine to healer Chiron brings the failures of humanity into your life in such a way that you feel personally responsible. Consider that your eagerness to take on global issues might just be a way to avoid more personal ones. You have the potential to break through old patterns, and you can jumpstart the process by remembering an unpleasant aspect of your past with a compassionate heart."
pisces,2013-03-21,"You are immersed in deep waters now and your fantasies might be locked in a battle with your personal demons and ghosts of the past. The root of the problem is that you can unconsciously project your imagination on to your friends and family; but even if it appears otherwise, this is ultimately about you and not them. Don't be afraid to heal yourself, even if this seems more complicated than trying to heal others."
aries,2013-03-22,"Things are looking good, but conflicts hidden beneath the surface may suddenly explode today. The fireworks begin as your key planet Mars aligns with shocking Uranus to clear the bank of fog that recently moved in. Above all, remember that there is no danger from what you may feel. Real problems only arise now from trying to sidestep the issues instead of proactively facing them with courage."
taurus,2013-03-22,Memories that you thought were long gone may now resurface with a sense of immediacy that shocks you into a momentary awakening. Passions express from the deepest recesses of your subconscious mind today. Don't try to keep this stuff down. Learn from what you are feeling in order to make the most positive impact on your future.
gemini,2013-03-22,"You are figure skating on very thin sheets of ice today. As graceful as you may appear now, beneath the cool veneer is a pool of hot molten lava. You're afraid the ice will crack if you stop moving and down you'll go. It is the opposite, however, that is true. If you stay in motion, you won't get the chance to overcome that which scares you the most. Stop and explore your feelings; your irrational fears are more easily managed when you face them directly."
cancer,2013-03-22,"An ongoing dilemma is very stressful now and seems to require immediate resolution. You know what you want, but anxiety comes from your uncertainty about how hard to push the river of feelings. Even if you remember that the river always arrives at the sea exactly on time, you still wish you could actively participate. Work to clear the channel so the emotional waters move freely, but don't expect them to follow your timetable. Happiness is possible when you accept what you cannot change."
leo,2013-03-22,"Power plays may define your current circumstances, yet there is more going on than meets the eye. Your motivations, too, are more complicated than they seem. Self-control aids in your success, but that's not the same as denial. Express yourself, but do so in a way that has lasting value rather than just an immediate impact. It's easy to be dramatic when talking about the future; however, it requires more finesse to make the most of the excitement now."
virgo,2013-03-22,"Your usual cool, calm and collected demeanor is nowhere to be found today. Your mind is caught in a powerful whirlpool of intense feelings, needs and circumstances. There doesn't seem to be a graceful way out of the situation now. It feels like something is going to break. But don't wait for the earthquake to strike. Take a deep breath and move immediately and deliberately toward your next goal. Decisive action actually helps to clear the air and free you from the tension."
libra,2013-03-22,"Sometimes you need to step outside of people's expectations and do what you believe must be done. Being the peacemaking diplomat is not what the planets have in mind for you today. It's time to get down and dirty; jump into your feelings and don't be afraid to get messy. There's no need to say every single thing you feel, but you can benefit from fully experiencing each and every emotion. Moving beyond your comfort zone allows you to grow in ways you didn't expect."
scorpio,2013-03-22,"You get a fleeting glimpse of a bigger truth now, which can help you find your way through self-imposed restrictions. Don't avert your eyes when the lightning strikes today. Its power is yours to see, no matter how brilliant the flash. Just remember that, above all else, awareness is your friend. Breathe deeply and allow the transformation to begin."
sagittarius,2013-03-22,Unusual events on the home front may put you in touch with a new perspective on old memories. It's as if the lights are turned on and you can see what you've been missing all along. Don't turn away in denial even if it's difficult to integrate what you learn. Your future freedom depends upon your willingness to embrace the truth now. Taking an honest look at your past enables you to choose the best path into the future.
capricorn,2013-03-22,"Although you may be rewarded for your role in the community or your family, there's a part of you that just wants to cash it all in today and be free from the restraints of obligations. Be careful; if you come on too strong, you could cut yourself off from the same connections that normally help to support you. Bring up your frustrations gently without biting the hand that feeds you. Sharing your heart may be easier than you think."
aquarius,2013-03-22,"You are totally hyped up now and it's hard to control the thrilling feelings that are running through your body. However, if you don't pay attention to your intellectual reactions today, you will just have to deal with the ramifications of your own erratic behavior. Your grievances are real so work with the issues on a deeper level. This current dilemma won't be solved by a quick emotional outburst, so take your time and dig down to the source of the problem."
pisces,2013-03-22,"Your self-confidence is operating at a high level today and you believe that others should take more notice of your valuable contributions. Fortunately, the rocket has been rolled out onto the launch pad and ignition will follow shortly. And lift-off occurs none too soon because you have run out of patience. Go ahead and use your energy to express your unique personality and to display your true colors."
aries,2013-03-23,"Everything may appear to be in order as you head into a busy weekend, but something significant is lurking in the shadows. Instead of attempting to avoid an unpleasant encounter, simply ask questions and be prepared to hear the brutal truth. You'll probably feel better once you know what's going on, but the energy still could be quite intense. Count to ten before reacting; finding healthy ways to channel your feelings is your best strategy for now."
taurus,2013-03-23,"A little misunderstanding with a friend or partner today may escalate into a significant disagreement. The conflict might be as simple as whether or not to make a particular purchase. Unfortunately, you could argue about this forever without reaching a resolution. Push beyond your legendary Taurus stubbornness and demonstrate your willingness to negotiate a fair solution. Having it your way is not as important as you think."
gemini,2013-03-23,"It's nearly impossible not to maintain your joviality now that hopeful Jupiter is visiting your carefree sign. However, stern Saturn can rain on your parade today by requiring you to finish all the chores you have put off. You might feel as if someone is holding your feet to the fire, but don't try to escape. As the intensity increases, your conflicting emotions will blend together and then fuse into a new, stronger emotional alloy. Transforming the negative into a positive turns the gray skies to blue."
cancer,2013-03-23,"When confronted with unpleasant situations, you often pull into your shell where you are safely out of harm's way. Unfortunately, the danger of this evasive strategy is that your unexpressed anger may create more problems now than a short-lived conflict. You have a chance to positively impact your weekend, but you must be willing to take a risk and let others know why you aren't happy. Getting your feelings out into the open can be the game-changer you need to shake up your life."
leo,2013-03-23,"You might become stuck in an emotional cul-de-sac today unless you pay extra careful attention to where you are going. Sometimes -- especially when you think you are right -- you find it nearly impossible to take directions from anyone else. Even if you win the argument you might end up in the wrong place. Victory is admirable, but cooperation brings you closer to your destination."
virgo,2013-03-23,"A minor flap at home could turn into a larger problem today, especially if you can't let go of your attachment to expectations. When you want one thing while your friends or family want something else, there's no choice but to compromise. However, you may unconsciously misplace your resentment if you're not happy with the outcome. Monitor your feelings closely so you can process them before getting angry at the wrong person or upset for the wrong reason."
libra,2013-03-23,"It's challenging to live up to your reputation of being a gracious host today, especially if someone arouses your temper. Instead of engaging in an unnecessary conflict, examine your motives to learn why you are so upset. Don't talk about your feelings until you cool down ... or your emotions could lead you into trouble. However, keeping your annoyance in perspective enables you to get through a sticky interaction without a lot of extra effort."
scorpio,2013-03-23,"Your two key planets, Mars and Pluto, might have trouble getting along until the end of the week. In the meantime, you might try to bury your negativity, but suppressing your feelings is difficult. Even if you could conceal your emotions, they might only intensify until they explode. Therefore, your best course of action is practicing controlled release. Make sure the energy doesn't get stuck, or you may have a meltdown on your hands later on. Be smart and consciously reveal your vulnerability only when you feel safe."
sagittarius,2013-03-23,"Your life would be great if things were a little quieter now, but Jupiter continues to distract you as it travels through your 7th House of Relationships. It may seem as if others are encouraging you to waste energy on unnecessary tasks. Although this frivolity makes for some good times, you still need to put everything in order. Take responsibility for your own feelings and let others know what you want. Setting clear boundaries enables you to stay on track."
capricorn,2013-03-23,"It may feel like too many people are heaping too many tasks on you now. Or maybe you are so ambitious lately that you take on a variety of extra jobs because they sound like fun challenges. Either way, you're at a turning point. You can't keep doing more and more. Even if you might make someone angry with your decisions, it's time to resist the temptation to say yes. Today is your day to simply say no thank you with a smile."
aquarius,2013-03-23,"Your need for affection is strong today, but you may not be able to find the best route to satisfaction. Your current confusion isn't just about a romantic inclination; your powerful feelings can easily express through parental love or artistic creation. But one way or another, you must find a strategy that utilizes your emotions to bring you closer to others. Luckily, you don't have to try as hard as you think. A simple I love you might be enough to do the trick."
pisces,2013-03-23,"You are a powerhouse of bottled-up energy today and others may have to contend with your uncharacteristically forceful style. You might feel as if you are in survival mode as everything seems more intense and larger than life now. Be kind to your coworkers as you push for what you want. As long as you're operating from a place of love, there's no need to be ashamed of your drive for success."
aries,2013-03-24,"Your love antennae are particularly receptive now that sweet Venus is back in your sign until mid-April. Nevertheless, you may grow worried about all the things that could go wrong in a relationship. Fortunately, you can recharge through interactions with others by adopting a beginner's mind approach. Imagine that you don't have all the answers and that you must start from scratch. Taking things from the beginning allows you to refresh the energy and add a dose of excitement into your life."
taurus,2013-03-24,"Your key planet, Venus, is dressed up in a new outfit today for her thrilling trip through Aries. She's hot and ready to go for it. But you steady Bulls might not want to show all your stuff right away. You tend to keep your desires under wraps. Even if you feel a sense of urgency, open the closet door slowly as you let your needs see the light of day. You could be pleasantly surprised."
gemini,2013-03-24,"Your big ideas can get you into trouble of a pleasant nature as you tell someone exactly what you want today. It may not be a smart idea to over-personalize what you say. Keep your conversations on the light side. Otherwise, you can get so overly expressive to the point that others may not understand you. It's not that you are being unclear; it's just that your volume gets too loud when you aren't paying attention."
cancer,2013-03-24,"Your life may be running smoother these days, even if you have a lot on your mind. People are seeing in you a new light. Even things in your family and the community are changing for the better. You're more open to show more of yourself because you are attracted to others. This new behavior can create a bit of worry, because sometimes you like to remain safely hidden from the outer world. Don't create unnecessary problems as you come out of your shell."
leo,2013-03-24,"Love is a grand journey for you Lions now that Venus is skipping through your 9th House of Travel. You may be drawn toward new adventures and might even get to take that trip you've been dreaming of. Thankfully, your common sense is at work also. Talk as if you are ready to hop on a plane right now, but take care of practical matters before you actually go away."
virgo,2013-03-24,"A subtle shift pulls you into the fantasy of having to get what you want, yet this might not be as innocent as it appears. If you want love, you want it now. But, as always, look for the real thing that serves you best. Or, if you are already in a relationship, seek ways to deepen it. As the Moon returns to your sign today, do your best to fulfill desires, even if you don't fully understand your them."
libra,2013-03-24,"You Libras tend to be people-oriented, but your expression of love and affection is strongly emphasized through April 15. Your key planet, Venus, is traveling through your 7th House of Partnerships, inviting you to smooth over whatever problems that have developed with others. Most interactions during this time will bring you the pleasure that you seek."
scorpio,2013-03-24,"You are usually attracted to experiences that enrich and deepen your life. Now, however, Venus is encouraging you to act on your impulsive desires. This can bring about conflicting situations and might even put you in a position where you'll need to quickly work out the details of an unfolding relationship. Focus on other people, but make certain to also pay attention to your own physical and mental health too."
sagittarius,2013-03-24,"It is said that you Archers are always ready for a good time, but this isn't totally true. For example, you are moving into a phase when creative self-expression does lead to fun and games. Although love relationships are also favored, you may get so caught up in your own analysis today that you can't see the forest through the trees. Do some intense thinking, but don't talk yourself out of being spontaneous."
capricorn,2013-03-24,"It's difficult for you to escape your sense of duty. Even your need for love can be tied to certain practical considerations. Over these next few weeks, you might want one thing but find yourself doing something else. However, your actions are more important than your desires today. Be patient; there will be plenty of time to follow your heart in the days ahead."
aquarius,2013-03-24,"You may be caught between your need to be responsible and your desire to cut loose and do something exciting. In an ideal world, you would figure out how to do both ... especially since your mind is buzzing with wild ideas. Nevertheless, your patience is wearing thin and you want immediate fulfillment. Don't fight with yourself. Let common sense prevail while you take it slowly and do what is required."
pisces,2013-03-24,"Your senses are more highly tuned today, attracting you to do something very specific rather than idly dream about possibilities. The time for action is now, but you may be more concerned with financial matters, which could cause some doubt. Money matters can either be quite excellent or quite difficult; it's one extreme or the other. Either way, budget some resources to have fun, even if you have to be creative to pull it off."
aries,2013-03-25,"There is no need to make a long-term commitment today, unless you spend time carefully planning what you have to do first. If you say yes too quickly, it may mean additional trouble for you down the road. You are coming down from an optimistic period where opportunities seemed better than they really are. Now that reality is creeping back into your life, monitor your energy level. If it feels like you are trying to do too much, eliminate something before it is too late."
taurus,2013-03-25,"You are entering a more practical phase now and it feels great to dig in and get some work done. Fortunately, your current responsibilities don't prevent you from having fun. You are aware of your need to relax and are prepared to carve out time for playful activities. Luckily, the stress continues to lighten up during the next several days, so don't forget to add some enjoyable activities to your calendar while you can."
gemini,2013-03-25,"People can't easily see through your witty mask today, so they won't know what's going on behind your clever facade. You may be hiding your negativity so others won't see your vulnerability. However, it's best not to have too many secrets or you could inadvertently invite a minor emotional meltdown. Talking about your ailments with someone you trust is much healthier than keeping them to yourself."
cancer,2013-03-25,"Although you may be more talkative than usual, you still might not say what someone wants to hear. Others can tell that your incessant talking hides your insecurities. Luckily, you are on the edge of making an important breakthrough, so don't waste energy burying your emotions. Nevertheless, it's futile to force them up to the surface too quickly. Relax; there's no need for concern. Your feelings will bubble up at their own rate, allowing you to express them with ease."
leo,2013-03-25,"Your moodiness is settling back down to a manageable level now that the emotional Moon has left your sign. Although you might be more rational today, don't fall into the illusion of thinking that everything is fine. Whatever was disturbing you can suddenly erupt unless you closely observe your feelings. Don't wait for something to happen; talk about your emotions before they get blown out of proportion."
virgo,2013-03-25,"You may feel less emotionally balanced now because the moody Moon is traveling through Virgo again. But cool logic won't help you anyways, so don't try to rationalize your way through the day. Instead, let your heart's desires guide your actions. You'll know exactly what you need to do when the time is right. Trusting your intuition over the facts may sound scary, but it's exactly what you need to do today."
libra,2013-03-25,"This may be a tricky day to navigate, especially if you feel alienated from those you love. But don't worry if you prefer keeping things to yourself for now. Remember, you might have strong reactions when you're caught off balance by something unexpected today. Fate is working her magic on you and even the littlest event can turn into a major catalyst. Tune into the world around you so you can stay in touch with what's important."
scorpio,2013-03-25,"You are looking forward to connecting with others now that the Moon is traveling through your 11th House of Friends. But you may grow disinterested in social distractions when you realize that some of the planned activities are distractions from the real meaning of your life. Don't overreact and avoid a fun opportunity just because you are feeling serious. Instead, join the crowd for a while; you might be happily surprised by the fascinating people and the relevance of the conversations anyway."
sagittarius,2013-03-25,"Although you are doing your best to demonstrate your positive attitude, people still may expect you to give more than you have today. You are feeling performance pressure and there's not much you can do about it now. It's difficult if you believe that others are working against you. However, there's no need to fight back; just continue to gather the facts and be ready to tell your side of the story when asked. The only one you truly have to please is yourself."
capricorn,2013-03-25,"You may be working on significant long-term changes in your life with a singular focus. Nevertheless, there aren't sufficient reasons to make any big decisions today. Instead, it's more important to live your day in a practical manner. Even if you appear carefree and spontaneous, anyone who pays careful attention won't be fooled. Fortunately, there's nothing to be gained by hiding the real issues now, so do what you must and let others deal with their feelings accordingly."
aquarius,2013-03-25,"If you have invested too much time and energy attempting to be popular, you might finally realize that you can't fit into the shape required for your current situation. Others may see you as uncooperative now, but that is not your intent. You know how you feel and want to make your point as succinctly as you can. Remember, once you have made your case, you really don't have to try so hard to prove that you're a great friend."
pisces,2013-03-25,"All kinds of relationships are potentially the sources of conflict now as someone inadvertently brings up a hurtful issue. You might be doubly hurt if you think that another person's mean comments were said on purpose. Even so, be generous and give others the benefit of the doubt. Avoid a needless fight by allowing the energies to settle down for a day or two before you make your stand."
aries,2013-03-26,"You aren't in the mood to be messed with today and might act defensively, even if you are not personally attacked. An issue that has been on your mind now pushes you dangerously close to a meltdown. You can feel heat rising from the bottom of the volcano and are challenged to express your unresolved conflicts in a constructive manner. Be aware of the feelings of others and think twice before you speak."
taurus,2013-03-26,"Your need to maintain the status quo might land you in trouble now, even if you believe your actions are for the best. Don't hide behind your stubbornness or your unexpressed feelings can turn to resentment. The current emotional waves may be strong, but riding them is healthier than attempting to hold them back. If a conflict remains unresolved, let the energies settle down before trying the same dance with your heart again."
gemini,2013-03-26,"Everything feels very intense today, but don't let this prevent you from doing what is right. You may be apprehensive about what's happening at work because you are being transformed by events you cannot completely control. You might be tempted to sidestep the incoming pressures, but it's wiser to face them now while you still can. Hang in there; the easy way out is not necessarily your best strategy."
cancer,2013-03-26,"You breeze through the day with flying colors as long as you maintain your integrity and treat others kindly. However, if you are holding on to a secret or harboring resentment now, any interaction might suddenly turn into an emotional conflict. If you are afraid of losing control, you could get dragged into a melodramatic standoff. Don't get hooked by someone else's issues today. Taking the high road will help you avoid additional complications."
leo,2013-03-26,"Although something or someone might have looked good in the past, there are things coming to light today that you hadn't noticed before. Conflicts arise -- perhaps because you are so driven at this time in your life. Your ambition is tied to fulfilling your dreams and may be running rampant. Consider moderating your goals. Exercising flexibility could make your life much easier now."
virgo,2013-03-26,"Someone may be undermining your efforts today and the situation is complicated enough that you don't know what to do about it. One tactic is to analyze what you have done to arouse opposition. Even if you have to confront an authority figure about what's going on, it's to your advantage to alter your own course, too. If you don't handle your internal issues now, the outer resistance will just pop up again later. Stepping up to the challenge only makes you stronger."
libra,2013-03-26,"A close friend or associate may be on your case today. You realize that your response is required, but you're not quite sure how best to proceed. Talking about your options won't help you get what you want now, but it could be what's needed as long as you don't stop there. Be ready to fight for your convictions. Don't wait for something to happen. Take initiative while you can and run with it."
scorpio,2013-03-26,"Your two planetary rulers, Mars and Pluto, are dynamically squaring off in a tense showdown, ramping up your energy level to a near all-time high. Unfortunately, you may be so supercharged with feelings that they can be more than you want to handle. But they are your emotions, so you must deal with them. Even if you are at odds with someone, don't push the conflict too far. If you do, no one will come out a winner. Get busy and do something wildly constructive, instead."
sagittarius,2013-03-26,"You can get a lot of work done today if you have your mind set on a specific goal. However, you could encounter unexpected encouragement from a close friend or family member and strong resistance from someone else. You may be ready to try anything to be successful, so be careful not to exhaust yourself now as you attempt to accomplish the impossible. Even if others are impressed by your can-do attitude, you may be better off saving some energy for tomorrow."
capricorn,2013-03-26,"You have an exciting opportunity to confront your fears now, especially if you're willing to feel the pain of a past emotional wound. Your tendency is to avoid your feelings by placing your attention on outer accomplishments, instead. Don't just go out and make something happen today; it's equally important to focus on the internal transformations that can help you improve your life."
aquarius,2013-03-26,"It may seem as if you're doing battle with your friends and family today, rather than working or playing with them. Even if the circumstances feel extreme, it's not really that black or white. However, the middle ground is particularly difficult to find now because you can clearly see the problem without being able to solve it. Hold on to your perspective, but demonstrate plenty of flexibility when dealing with others."
pisces,2013-03-26,"You might be involved in a difficult emotional struggle today that adds turmoil to your life, and you need to take some of the responsibility for the current unstable situation. It may seem as if there's a problem with others, but half of this conflict originates within the confines of your own mind. Look for ways to change yourself before you try to change anyone else."
aries,2013-03-27,"Today's Libra Full Moon opposite your Sun sign might make your life more problematic because of the strong ambivalence it brings. You're ready to jump in with both feet, but the voice of restraint reminds you of the price you often pay when you dive in before testing the water. Something doesn't feel quite right and you're correct to trust your instincts. It's wise to pull back a bit to find a healthy balance before you say yes without thinking first."
taurus,2013-03-27,"Your key planet, Venus, joins the Sun during today's lovely Libra Full Moon, offering you the likelihood of a pleasurable experience. Unfortunately, you might have so much on your plate now that you have a valid excuse to avoid intimacy. Although you may not feel very playful, the Full Moon brightens your 6th House of Habits, reminding you to have fun as you do your work instead of putting it off for another day."
gemini,2013-03-27,"You may be running around in circles today, yet you don't feel particularly hurried. Perhaps you are busy having fun with the Libra Full Moon activating your 5th House of Spontaneity. However, you still might be distracted by something that's bothering you. Handle your problems while maintaining a light-hearted attitude. But don't bother trying to fake it; others will appreciate you more if you show your true self."
cancer,2013-03-27,"The Libra Full Moon shines in your 4th House of Emotional Security, tempting you to withdraw from a drama at work, which may leave you wondering what you missed. You might attempt to ignore your intense feelings, but avoidance isn't a useful strategy. There's no need to put up artificial walls just to protect yourself from non-existent childhood fears. Instead, start a dialogue with your subconscious, for that's where you will find answers to your current problem."
leo,2013-03-27,"The winds of change are blowing in like fresh breezes now as the Libra Full Moon illuminates your 3rd House of Communication. Expressing your unresolved feelings causes you to confront your shortcomings, rather than just your success stories. You may feel like you're not exactly where you want to be, but don't stress about it too much. Handling issues as they surface today can set you back on the right path."
virgo,2013-03-27,"Although today's rational Libra Full Moon highlights your 2nd House of Self-Esteem, it also reminds you to be practical when expressing your feelings. Nevertheless, the whole day has an emotional intensity to it. Others may think that you're backpedaling, but you probably aren't the one who is putting on the brakes. Don't let yourself get discouraged. Display the warmth you want to receive by keeping your heart open and your feelings close to the surface."
libra,2013-03-27,"The Full Moon's presence in your sign makes it challenging to hide your feelings, even if you wish you could retreat today. On the other hand, don't make a fuss even if you are unjustly criticized about your production or performance. Remember that the actions of other people are beyond your control, so nothing is gained by worrying about what they do. Instead, concentrate on your own emotional process, even if it happens to involve others for a while. Expressing your heart is key to your happiness now."
scorpio,2013-03-27,"Your emotions are on edge today as the Libra Full Moon in your 12th House of Destiny runs into a series of stressful aspects. You may try to conceal your feelings, and even those close to you might not be privy to your inner workings. Instead of withholding some of your love while you reevaluate your relationships, use logic to overcome your fear. Ultimately, expressing your emotions in a cool and collected manner helps to transform your negativity into a positive experience."
sagittarius,2013-03-27,"The lovely Libra Full Moon lights up your 11th House of Groups and Friends, activating the fun-loving, social axis of your chart. Unfortunately, you may be seeking romance while only finding platonic companions. There's nothing wrong with a wonderful friendship, but it doesn't have the same excitement as a love story. Don't let discouragement throw you into a tailspin of low self-esteem. Allowing others to see your real feelings creates an environment where your relationships can continue to grow."
capricorn,2013-03-27,"Everyone seems to be making demands on you at work now that the Libra Full Moon falls in your 10th House of Public Responsibility. Don't try to cover up your insecurities about not being able to meet all of your commitments. Although you might not finish everything, you still could end up exhausted. Find a sustainable pace and just do what you can. Be as direct as possible when letting others know exactly what you can and can't do; your honesty and work ethic won't go unappreciated."
aquarius,2013-03-27,"All aspects of communication are strained today as the Libra Full Moon opposes the Sun in your 3rd House of Information. Your schedule may grow so complicated and unwieldy that you feel like you can't even manage it. Unfortunately, there isn't an easy way out of this tricky situation. Be practical as you face the current circumstances. If there isn't enough time or resources, figure out how to do more with less. Try something different; the solution might not be what you think."
pisces,2013-03-27,"You may be afraid to let go of control today as the Libra Full Moon floods your 8th House of Intimacy. Thankfully, you are very well-equipped to handle the disintegration of boundaries during this Full Moon. One of the benefits of having such a rich fantasy life is that you are prepared for nearly anything. Don't waste energy trying to fight against the currents because intense emotional interactions could drain you. If you go with the flow; you'll emerge on the other side with your sense of humor still intact."
aries,2013-03-28,"Your emotional landscape changes abruptly as the Sun and Venus receive a jolt from electric Uranus in your sign. This unexpected surprise can mark the start of something new as cracks suddenly appear in a brittle shell that has kept you safe. It's time to emerge, so don't waste energy trying to repair the breach. Instead, dream about the new life ahead for the baby chick once it has broken free from the restraints of the eggshell."
taurus,2013-03-28,"You're buzzing today as original ideas and beautiful images cascade into consciousness. But you must be careful because your thoughts may not be as brilliant as you believe. Your unconventional desires could even border on craziness now, so listen to what a trusted friend says before doing something outrageous you'll later regret. Everything doesn't have to follow your plan; you can improve nearly any activity by letting go of total control and sharing responsibility with those around you."
gemini,2013-03-28,"Your friends and associates may seem unreliable today, disrupting previous plans that require their participation. This unpredictability can be challenging, since you must make choices based upon your ability to deliver on your promises. Nevertheless, you can't rely on the support of others at this time. Don't expect any extra assistance; if someone comes through for you, take it as a pleasant surprise and graciously accept their support."
cancer,2013-03-28,"Your reputation at work might shift abruptly today. If you suffer a minor setback, it's only to point out that something needs your immediate attention. On the other hand, others may think that you're a real genius if your radical idea actually works. Either way, the status quo is about to change, so don't try to hold on to the past. Reassess your direction and put your new plan into action as quickly as possible."
leo,2013-03-28,"You can close your door in an attempt to keep out the extraneous noise today. But everything is moving so fast now that you have to deal with the speed of change, even if you're overwhelmed by it. Attempts to stick to your current position won't work; the more you try to resist the future the quicker it will arrive. Let go and embrace the uncertainty of what comes next. Allow exhilaration to replace your fear and embrace the unknown."
virgo,2013-03-28,"You are fascinated by alternative explanations of complex mysteries today as you seek answers to the unsolvable questions of life. Whether it's a sudden interest in ancient philosophies, quantum physics or Astrology, your mind is quick to grasp new concepts now. But don't be too eager to close your heart as you open your mind. Your emotions must play an integral role in your current breakthrough in order for it to have lasting value."
libra,2013-03-28,"You may be tempted to step outside the box and surprise someone with your willingness to take a risk today. However, something unexpected could occur even if you act in an overly cautious manner. The hidden tensions that are suddenly released will either be initiated by you or happen to you. Ultimately, it's better if the catalytic action starts from within."
scorpio,2013-03-28,"It may be challenging to find a happy medium today as your reactions to trivial events seem to be either too much or too little. You might grow annoyed because others assume you want everything while you feel as if you're not asking for much at all. Instead of expressing your needs impulsively, let them simmer a while before sharing them. Thankfully, the extremes will begin to settle down in the next couple of days, allowing you to say exactly how you feel."
sagittarius,2013-03-28,"You might not be feeling very practical today, especially if you are in the throes of a new romantic attraction. Or, perhaps you are consumed by a captivating hobby or a competitive sport. Whatever the reason, you're ready to be pulled off course now. Just keep in mind that your approach doesn't need to be all-or-nothing as you seek exciting avenues of expression. Play with the edge and don't be afraid to move the boundaries, but be careful not to step on anyone's toes in the process."
capricorn,2013-03-28,"If circumstances at home are too complicated, you may be ready to try a more diplomatic approach today. However, emotions grow intense very fast once you start the discussion. Oddly enough, you might actually enjoy the fireworks, since a sudden outbreak could catalyze stagnant issues and provoke radical change. No matter how disruptive the situation becomes, the air will clear once the tensions are released."
aquarius,2013-03-28,"Your focus is on your career these days and, thankfully, your sense of duty holds you in good stead on the job now. But you're not willing to do the same old thing in the same old way. Be daring in your communication today, whether via email, phone or in person. Don't miss any opportunities to make new connections. You just might meet someone who could open doors to places you've never been."
pisces,2013-03-28,"Your emotions may be at odds with your logic today, especially if you want to do something that conflicts with your core values. It's challenging to embrace a desire that pulls you off balance, but suppressing an attraction won't make it go away. You are being gifted with a unique opportunity to heal something that you have carried around inside you for a long time. Soften your hard edges, forgive yourself and move on."
aries,2013-03-29,"You may be confused by your desires and would be smart to use some discretion when communicating with others. You feel as if you're in power since your emotions are so intense today, and you just want to express what's in your heart. Unfortunately, you might be a bit too much for people to handle now. Seal your lips even if you believe you know the truth; keep some things to yourself unless you want to scare everyone away. Wait until the energy settles down and then speak your piece to someone who will listen with a supportive ear."
taurus,2013-03-29,"You demand respect today and will likely receive it. However, you can unintentionally mislead yourself by inflating your importance. Accordingly, it's crucial to work toward your goals with careful consideration. If you expect too much, you could be setting yourself up for disappointment. Fortunately, there's no need to hold back if you run your ideas past someone you trust before acting on your assumptions. Adjust your sails if necessary, and then take off."
gemini,2013-03-29,"You are eager to be with friends or hang out with your family today, leaving your chores behind. It's not that you're irresponsible; it's just that you may believe you can catch up on your obligations later. However, your rational mind might be twisting your perspective of reality so you see everything in an optimistic light. Unfortunately, you can't make up for lost time with just good intentions and hard work. Stay on task and only head out to play once you are finished with work."
cancer,2013-03-29,"You are quite energized today and feel as if you have a million things to say before the day slips away. However, your drive to share what's on your mind clashes with your sensitivity to what others need. You're motivated to ask for what you want, but are uncomfortable being pushy enough to do it. Take a risk and get your thoughts out into the open; you'll be disappointed with yourself tomorrow if you don't."
leo,2013-03-29,"You're performing the lead role in your own personal drama now and are ready to play it for all it's worth. You are a hit, but it would be wise to end the show before it turns stale. Rather than starring in a make-believe role, try showing up as the real you. Step out from behind your mask and be vulnerable for a change. Give others the chance to like you for who you are, and not just for what you do. Open your heart and receive the validation you seek."
virgo,2013-03-29,"You can convince nearly anyone that you are right today, but you can't do it with words alone. Language is too shallow and won't convey your deeper intent. Your actions are ultimately the best sales tools now, as they truly speak louder than anything else. Ironically, you must also be willing to clearly explain what you are doing to have the greatest impact. Quietly go about your business until you have made enough progress to share with others."
libra,2013-03-29,"Relationships are often on your mind and today is no exception. But there is something else going on now because you're not interested in simply pleasing others. You are being motivated by a deep need to accomplish something that is of substance. You have a wonderful opportunity to create something positive, and you should be able to make it happen as long as you aren't overly selfish in your motives. You really can't go wrong if you follow your heart."
scorpio,2013-03-29,"You are receiving support from intense Pluto today, giving you the resources needed to complete a major project. Although everything seems to be going your way, there is more happening than meets the eye. The Moon's visit to your sign sets the tone for a transformational day. Even the most complicated tasks seem more straightforward now. Push relentlessly toward your goals but allow room for a miscalculation. If you run into trouble, take what you learn into consideration before trying again."
sagittarius,2013-03-29,"You have the determination today to manifest your vision. Although you realize that your long-term goals won't be achieved all at once, your current actions have a major impact on your future. But it's crucial to avoid acting for personal reasons alone. With relentless Pluto working on your behalf now, your progress will be steadier if you consider the needs of others in your current plans. In fact, consulting those around you inspires you to even greater heights."
capricorn,2013-03-29,"You hear two internal voices of guidance today and they both make convincing arguments. You know that you are in it for the long haul, so you're willing to play your cards strategically. However, you may believe you're holding a winning hand and cannot wait for the game to end. But unfortunately, if you come out on top, then others will lose. Before you show your cards, secretly change the rules so everyone can be a winner."
aquarius,2013-03-29,"There's no one to blame but yourself if your day is way too busy; you simply tried to pack too much into your schedule. Even if it seems logistically impossible to complete everything today, you can still make all the separate pieces work together if you rely on a bit of team magic. Let the group decide what's next. Ironically, giving up some of your control now enables you to accomplish more than you expect."
pisces,2013-03-29,"Normally, you don't like direct confrontation and may try to avoid conflict at any cost. You might even become anxious when you have to exert your will with any sense of authority. However, you can confidently push toward with whatever it is that you want today. Fortunately, you won't offend anyone with your bossy manner now. Just make certain that you know where you are going before you start giving orders."
aries,2013-03-30,"Investing the necessary time and energy in getting your message across ensures that your words are clearly understood. Conversations require careful listening to avoid confusion in matters of finances, especially involving joint property. But you can miss the point and throw a negotiation into reverse if you are too impatient. Set aside your defensive tendencies; open your heart and your mind in order to make the best connection."
taurus,2013-03-30,"You might want more than you're receiving from a friend or partner today, but don't assume that he or she knows your heart's desires. Being shy isn't going to help you fulfill your wishes, so describe what you want in as much detail as possible. You may have already stated your needs more than once already, but the past is past. If you crave satisfaction, it's appropriate to put in the extra effort now."
gemini,2013-03-30,"Today you don't know whether to look ahead to what's next in your life or to review what just happened. Circumstances might require you to take one more review of your recent past so you don't have to redo a task that you thought was finished. If you start a new project, make sure you double-check everything to avoid any complications. Paying extra attention now can save you time and energy later."
cancer,2013-03-30,"It seems as if other people want to play when you want to be serious today; however, they become contemplative when you are ready for fun. Your mental flexibility is necessary to adapt to the current frustrating conditions. Fortunately, you stand to learn more than you can imagine if you're able to make attitude adjustments on the fly. Knowing when to hold and when to fold is a useful skill that comes in handy now."
leo,2013-03-30,"The fallout from recent overindulgent behavior may create conflict at home today. It's tempting to let your pride get the better of you and make this a personal issue. Push past your initial response and listen carefully before angrily defending yourself. Sensitivity, rather than hostility, can turn the situation around and bring you and your family even closer together than before."
virgo,2013-03-30,"Your logic is very accurate now, but you could do more harm than good if others aren't ready to hear what you have to say. Luckily, your self-restraint helps you to find the right words at the right time. It takes more than mere facts to make your point, for people naturally want to feel understood and won't budge until you let them know that you care about their opinions. Taking the time to listen ultimately improves your chances of sharing your message."
libra,2013-03-30,"This is an excellent time for you peacemakers to exercise the diplomatic arts by building bridges between opposing sides of a conflict without getting run over in the process. Rather than saving the entire world, you may need to back out to save your own skin if the stress becomes too much. It's admirable that you want to be of service, but don't lose perspective or there won't be any energy left over for yourself when you really need it most."
scorpio,2013-03-30,"The most intense feelings are bubbling just beneath the surface and they can flood over the top without much warning today. Putting yourself in an emotionally pressurized situation increases the likelihood of an explosion. Thankfully, you can reduce stress by focusing on what is right in front of you and staying away from needless drama. Keeping things simple is a smart strategy now."
sagittarius,2013-03-30,"Your attention is pulled in several directions today, providing more stimulation than you truly need. Avoid the temptation to jump at all the  offers that come your way just because they sound like fun. Small distractions can lead to big complications that throw your entire day off track. You don't have the time to follow every interesting idea to its conclusion; choose only those that are of highest priority to your heart."
capricorn,2013-03-30,"A supportive friend may be encouraging you today while another person is being negative. But it's your life, so it's ultimately you who decides to pursue your dream or not. Either way, it's not worth the effort to debate a critic since the idea either works for you or it doesn't. The advice you attract now could be more confusing than practical, so listen to your own heart as your primary source of guidance."
aquarius,2013-03-30,"A small dose of optimism is constructive as you attempt to overcome someone's resistance, but navigating the energy is tricky now because others may not come out in the open with their thoughts. You normally aren't one to be drawn into someone else's drama, but you might be more than willing today, especially if you think you can help. Still, it's smarter to play it cool, rather than potentially complicating the situation by pushing your way into unknown emotional territory."
pisces,2013-03-30,"You are naturally sensitive to subtleties that others cannot perceive. Trusting these intuitive feelings is highly advised, since your radar is so keenly attuned now. However, you might not want to tell people what you're actually picking up today because they may not be open to your perspective, especially if they haven't asked for your opinion. Be careful to handle the situation delicately so that you don't needlessly ruffle anyone's feathers."
aries,2013-03-31,"There are complicated issues tugging at your psyche today. On one hand, the daily routine may be working just fine. But on the other hand, you believe that you must make a stand for what you feel. Consider the possibility of backing down from your original position -- not because you're wrong, but because you want to avoid instigating a meltdown. Thankfully, you can still talk about your desires as long as you don't assume that you have all the answers."
taurus,2013-03-31,"You thought you were going to express your ultimate truth today, but it's challenging to get to the bottom of your current emotional discomfort. You could be drawn into an intense disagreement that's motivated by a possible misunderstanding. If you aren't willing to share your deepest feelings, others might not be able to accept your words as sincere. Even if you don't have a specific outcome in mind, don't hold back. You will end up just where you're supposed to be if you follow your heart."
gemini,2013-03-31,"You have a wide spectrum of feelings that may be difficult to talk about today. Unfortunately, these emotions have a hold on what's happening in your outer world, even if they are unconscious. For example, if someone is trying to control you, your response might be to just let it slide. Keep in mind that whatever you don't deal with now will just surface again in a different context. Bring unresolved issues out into the open sooner than later for the best results."
cancer,2013-03-31,"You may not be able to stop yourself from acting out your feelings today, even if you previously decided to keep your insecurities or criticisms to yourself. It's not that you are particularly pushy now; it's just that you are following your intuition. Don't worry if a secret slips out. You'll feel a great sense of relief once everyone knows the truth."
leo,2013-03-31,"Your insecurity in a relationship could lead you to act more intensely and passionately today. It's not that you're faking anything; it's just that you might be experiencing uncharacteristic self-doubt now. Take a risk and start a conversation about your lack of certainty. The outcome may be worth the temporary discomfort, even if you don't know what's lurking in the shadows of your mind. Holding a candle to the darkness casts an entirely new light on the situation."
virgo,2013-03-31,"You may believe that you're successfully hiding your feelings today, but those close to you can read you like an open book. Nevertheless, you aren't sure that anyone truly understands your current needs. Pay extra attention to where your thoughts are leading or you might end up misleading others in a way that will be problematic for you. Fortunately, honest self-disclosure initiates a long-overdue conversation that could resolve a lingering conflict."
libra,2013-03-31,"It's crucial to concentrate on being practical today or you may end up obsessing about something you can't have. Your goal is a familiar one -- to find that elusive and inclusive middle ground that everyone can share. However, someone might not be willing to partake in your diplomatic process now. Nevertheless, don't be afraid to establish a playing field for negotiation because others will eventually join in once you set the parameters."
scorpio,2013-03-31,"Sensual Venus crosses paths with your key planet Pluto today, and you're not willing to play games, unless you believe they are leading to something more substantial. Lighthearted talk is only okay if it's the way into the shadowy world of Pluto, for that is really where you want to hang out now. Be clear when explaining your intentions; you can seductively entice someone to join you on your journey, only to discover later they have a completely different idea about the destination."
sagittarius,2013-03-31,"You're not following rules of logic today as you seek to fulfill your desires. The moody Moon in your philosophical sign encourages you to communicate with others, but your words may be just a smoke screen. You're in touch with needs that you cannot talk about now. A Zen master might suggest that you do nothing, but this tactic probably won't help your cause. Bring your feelings out into the open, thus avoiding unnecessary additional conflict later on."
capricorn,2013-03-31,"Sometimes people don't realize how deeply you feel. Just because you don't always wear your heart on your sleeve doesn't mean you are without passion. However, today your emotions may be overflowing, intensifying your interactions with others. You're aware that something deep is cooking but it seems too soon to take it out of the oven. Allow your process to develop before trying to explain yourself to anyone else, but remember there's nothing wrong with being vulnerable with someone you trust."
aquarius,2013-03-31,"Your emotional needs may differ from those of your friends and family, but it might feel overwhelming to stand up to anyone else at this time. You could be afraid of creating too much ill will by bucking the tide. However, resentment builds if you keep your feelings to yourself. An open and honest policy is your safest route to peace of mind, even if you must transverse some bumpy territory first."
pisces,2013-03-31,"You may be very accomplished at managing multidimensional living, but complex dynamics can put a strain on you today. You are being called to reevaluate your long-term goals and might need to do some powerful work within your dreams and fantasies. Take time to meander through your thoughts until your desires begin to settle down. However, sooner or later you must face your feelings through direct interactions with others. Wait for the right moment to act, but don't wait too long or you'll miss your chance to connect."
aries,2013-04-01,"You are riding an uplifting flow of energy today, yet your overconfidence can set the stage for a letdown tomorrow. Don't waste energy dreaming about unrealistic adventures. Instead, apply your creativity to the power of the present moment, and  new opportunities may reveal themselves. Concentrate on what you need to do now instead of what you want to do in the future."
taurus,2013-04-01,"You're intrigued by the possibility of withdrawing from the social scene today. You're inspired to retreat so you can recharge your emotional and spiritual batteries. However, responsibilities at home may make it difficult to relax. Plan your day in advance by scheduling your chores first and leaving enough time to reconnect with yourself later."
gemini,2013-04-01,"The evocative Moon's current presence in your 7th House of Partnerships raises the stakes by way of an emotional confrontation. Nevertheless, you are still able to maintain an upbeat attitude and can turn a difficult situation into a positive one. Don't be afraid to share your optimism since the Sun supports generous Jupiter in your sign, making you a natural at switching on the charm and getting what you want."
cancer,2013-04-01,"You may be in the mood to do something special today that applies your creative energy toward a crafty project. But don't put your desire to get things done between you and emotional intimacy. Instead of keeping busy to distract attention from the real issues, be brave and talk about your feelings. The first step is the hardest; the conversation will go easier once you break the ice."
leo,2013-04-01,"You don't want to express your true feelings today, even if they are very close to the surface. The good news is that others are more likely to listen to you and actually hear what you are saying. The bad news is that you are so eager to put your best foot forward now that your friends could be satisfied with only half the picture. If you have something to say don't withhold the difficult part, since it's the tough stuff that brings the biggest rewards."
virgo,2013-04-01,"Today would ideally be a day of rest, even if you have a number of obligations to fulfill. You may feel world-weary and need some downtime to relax. Unfortunately, people continue to expect you to show up and do your part. You might be tempted to break the routine and establish your autonomy by declining involvement. However, your moral compass probably won't let you off the hook that easily. Budget your resources wisely and you will be able to deliver on your promises and have some personal time, too."
libra,2013-04-01,"It's tricky to keep a healthy perspective today as the brilliant Sun sextiles buoyant Jupiter, making everything sparkle with potential. Even the most casual interaction can feel like a life-changing event. Although you're tempted to inflate the possibilities of an encounter with someone you like, a meeting could still turn out to be quite propitious. Just be certain to maintain a shred of objectivity so you're able to keep your expectations from getting out of hand."
scorpio,2013-04-01,"You may be dealing with an emotional attachment to your property today as the reflective Moon moves through your 2nd House of Personal Resources. But remember that your self-esteem can be one of your most prized possessions. If anyone questions your motives or your values now, don't be afraid to defend them vigorously. When you know what's most important to you, it won't matter as much what others think."
sagittarius,2013-04-01,"Often it can be challenging when the Moon visits your sign because you aren't necessarily comfortable with your feelings being so transparent. Now, however, your subjectivity overrides reality. Managing your emotions is more comforting than usual because the Sun is harmonizing with your key planet, Jupiter. Just enjoy yourself today; you might be pleasantly surprised when others are nurtured by your good intentions."
capricorn,2013-04-01,"Although you're certain to be an inspiration to others, you may wish that you could avoid the noisy crowds today. You might prefer hiding in your room rather than going out with friends while the emotional Moon is traveling through your 12th House of Secrets. Don't let your current penchant for seclusion override your need to communicate your deep feelings to someone you love."
aquarius,2013-04-01,"You may feel supported by your peers and emotionally nurtured by your friends now that the Moon is moving through your 11th House of Social Networking. You're motivated by your need to connect with your community and are willing to take a short detour to make something memorable happen. This healthy connection with others is heartwarming, but don't use it as a way to avoid your feelings, especially if an unresolved issue has been simmering on the back burner for a while. An honest dialogue might be the best thing on the agenda today."
pisces,2013-04-01,"Although you may have a lot of chores to do today, you're likely reconsidering your position at work and re-envisioning your long-term career goals. Be bold in your thinking now, for your current ideas will  blend your desire for success with your willingness to work hard to manifest your dreams. If nothing else, map out an ambitious strategy for the weeks ahead. A bit of advanced planning goes farther than you think."
aries,2013-04-02,"You are growing tired of your current responsibilities and are ready for a change of pace. You feel as if you have been working hard enough and now you are eager to take a break. Unfortunately, you may have to put off the fun and games a while longer while you fulfill the promises you already made to yourself and others. Thankfully, you'll really be able to let loose once you don't have unfulfilled obligations still hanging over your head."
taurus,2013-04-02,"You are deeply satisfied when your actions lead to tangible results. Although some projects are taking longer to complete than expected, at least you're starting to see progress instead of just pie-in-the-sky possibilities. Trust your intuition now when it comes to issues of timing. But don't be discouraged by unexpected delays; the rewards will surely be worth any frustration encountered along the way."
gemini,2013-04-02,"It's challenging to focus your mind on your immediate tasks today, but this is exactly what you must do. Temporarily set aside your desire for fun and pleasure so you can meet a deadline or make practical plans for what's ahead. Take full advantage of the present moment to accomplish as much as possible to pave the way for your future success."
cancer,2013-04-02,"Someone may step in to play the role of your boss today, possibly even making unreasonable demands on your time. You might resent their authority, whether or not they deserve your respect. But don't let your annoyance get in the way of your reactions. If you're better off doing what's being asked of you, then it obviously makes sense to go ahead and give it your best effort, regardless of your internal resistance. Open your mind and accept the reality check with a smile."
leo,2013-04-02,"There are so many things on your to-do list today you may not have time for any extracurricular activities. You are quite wise to focus on whatever is most practical now with the earthy Capricorn Moon's presence in your 6th House of Details. Remember that your positive attitude allows you to accomplish more than you expect, and might even permit you to escape for some fun later on. Taking a methodical approach to your work should do the trick."
virgo,2013-04-02,"Unfortunately, it may be your job to rain on someone's parade today, especially if your life will be negatively impacted by the other person's failure to produce as expected. Your standards are naturally high, often setting you up for disappointment. Thankfully, your day unfolds smoother if you're able to recognize potential instead of criticizing performance. Your ability to be flexible is being tested now; adopting a positive attitude enables you to turn a difficult situation into a valuable learning experience."
libra,2013-04-02,"Domestic responsibilities follow you around throughout the day, but you may not be able to attend to them until later in the evening. Perhaps memories of a painful childhood event distract you from your current work. If so, it may be time to forgive and forget so you can deal with more pressing issues in the present moment. Releasing yourself from your history frees you to create your future unencumbered by your past."
scorpio,2013-04-02,"It may be quite a challenge to keep up with your busy schedule today, especially if a previous commitment turns into a much larger job than you originally expected. Be as realistic as possible and clearly let others know what you can and cannot do. They will appreciate your direct approach and accurate assessment more than an unrealistic promise that can't be kept. Take a deep breath and smile; even superheros can't be everywhere at once."
sagittarius,2013-04-02,"Financial pressures may constrain social activities today, yet a lack of cash won't necessarily dampen your overall enthusiasm. But it's not as if you're overly excited, since you have a practical outlook these days. Don't let discouragement seep into your life as the day progresses or it might get in the way of your success. Thankfully, your efforts to stabilize your resources now can have long-lasting positive effects."
capricorn,2013-04-02,"You may be feeling quite emotional today, but it doesn't do much good to try to hold back the flow of your feelings. In fact, it only makes you more irritated when you can't express yourself clearly. Nevertheless, you still might try to leave your personal needs out of the equation now when interacting with others. In the long run, being yourself is always the best strategy."
aquarius,2013-04-02,"Even if you must perform your everyday job duties today, your real work dwells in the spiritual dimensions now. You may feel like a bit of a loner, but that is about to change. Use the first part of the day to explore the inner world of your imagination before sharing your experiences with someone special in the evening. Giving voice to your feelings inspires a spiritual or romantic connection."
pisces,2013-04-02,"You might be offered generous support from your friends today, but you may not be willing to pay the price. You will have to overcome your own resistance and expose your vulnerability, even if you don't want others to see your weakness. Move past your fears and just ask for the help you need. It's OK to lean on someone else for a change."
aries,2013-04-03,"It may feel as if the whole world is standing in your way now, but it's only a cosmic reminder to change your attitude and take the problems you face in stride. Fortunately, you can overcome most obstacles, but you need to get a bit more serious than you've been for the past few days. Your unwavering determination makes room for the fun to return by the weekend."
taurus,2013-04-03,"You are fully committed to your beliefs, but there are differences that may be worthy of discussion with your friends today. Don't take questions from others as personal attacks now, even if that's how they feel in the moment. You just might be a tad too sensitive and they might be overly zealous. If you think about what you're going to say before responding, you should be able to handle criticism gracefully and maybe even benefit from it in the process."
gemini,2013-04-03,"An initial offer may be placed on the table today, starting a serious round of negotiations. Don't try to make up your story as you go along or the other person might end up dictating the terms of the relationship. You have a better chance of getting what you want if you consider all the options and develop a sound strategy in advance. Practicing the art of compromise allows everyone to come out feeling like a winner."
cancer,2013-04-03,"You gain strength as the day progresses now that the Moon is visiting earthy Capricorn. But uncertain feelings may be upsetting at first as you seek the solid ground of clarity. Don't be afraid to take the initiative in any kind of relationship today. You can express what you want without sounding bossy. Remember, partnerships work best when all the cards are on the table and there are no tricks up your sleeves."
leo,2013-04-03,"It's time to channel your creativity into something constructive today. Imagination dissipates into the air unless it's grounded with direct action. Fortunately, your dedication and focus transform lofty possibilities into concrete realities. This creative process requires discipline and determination, but the final result is well worth putting in the extra effort."
virgo,2013-04-03,"Although you like exercising your authority, you may not feel like you have to be everyone's parent today. Paradoxically, you might even be more serious now, but others feel safe enough around you to let their inner children come out and play. There's a new level of creative confidence that can turn drudgery into fun -- and expressing a little joy along the way helps to get the job done even more efficiently."
libra,2013-04-03,"Your brilliant ideas and big promises are being put to the test today. Honesty and optimism are admirable, but require commitment in order to transform them into something tangible. Be a planner now; use your resources to make the difference between success and failure. Don't waste time thinking that no one values your efforts. You will receive recognition for your hard work when you stop waiting to be noticed."
scorpio,2013-04-03,"The work that you recently invested in yourself is almost ready to be presented to the world. Although it's not wise to stand on the sidelines and watch silently, you aren't quite ready for prime time yet. Demonstrate enough confidence to lead those around you, but don't attempt to take over. You don't have to assume all the responsibilities; just show everyone the right direction by example and let them respond accordingly."
sagittarius,2013-04-03,"Waves of heavy feelings may wash over you now that the Moon is visiting sobering Capricorn. It isn't the end of the fun, but important issues that require your attention are coming back into focus. Manage your time and money with the utmost care today. Aiming your intentions with awareness increases your chances of hitting the target. Your current journey can teach you a lot about yourself, but reaching your destination brings real satisfaction."
capricorn,2013-04-03,"You may feel as if people have been showing off recently and receiving unwarranted attention for their unprecedented actions. Finally, everyone seems to be ready to get back down to earth and talk to someone like you who really knows what to do. Don't overplay your authority card; a little modesty goes a long way now. It's great to be acknowledged for your expertise as long as you don't make others feel inferior in the process. It's better to be a valuable team member than to isolate yourself by being in charge."
aquarius,2013-04-03,"You and your buddies have hatched some brilliant ideas, but today you may run into a more conservative thinker who isn't ready to let you have your way. You could try to sidestep the resistance, but doing a runaround isn't likely to work at this time. You'll be better off to play by the rules now, even if you choose to change them later on. Cooperation cultivates trust."
pisces,2013-04-03,The load of responsibility that you are carrying on your shoulders may become a bit lighter today as coworkers or friends jump in to share the burden. Don't be afraid to ask for help if you have grown tired. The martyr act really doesn't pay off now and no one wants you to suffer needlessly. Plus there's more joy to be discovered by collaborating with others instead of struggling on your own.
aries,2013-04-04,"It's usually challenging to maintain your focus for a long period of time, yet it may be even trickier today. Don't pretend that you are concentrating on what's happening now if your mind keeps wandering off into future possibilities. Others may be annoyed that you're not paying attention to them, but they're even less forgiving if they think you are pretending to listen. Be truthful and admit your dilemma; you might be pleasantly surprised by the support you receive."
taurus,2013-04-04,"You are willing to do what is expected of you, even if you don't want to be seen by too many people. But instead of making waves about your irrational desire for privacy, stay present in the real world and act in a responsible manner. Your sense of satisfaction from a job well done outweighs the benefits of a temporary reprieve. Save the imaginative excursion into your fantasies for some other day when you really need to escape."
gemini,2013-04-04,"An exciting adventure may be awaiting you, but you must place yourself back into the picture before your dreams can manifest. However, you have a problem if you recently lost touch with reality because your fantasies seemed so close. You must reestablish an immediate connection with your current circumstances before you proceed. Fortunately, once you have your feet safely on the ground, you'll be able to imagine your future and move into it with grace."
cancer,2013-04-04,"The paradox of your day is that your emotions sink to a deeper place within your subconscious, while simultaneously disconnecting from your body. Unfortunately, if you're detached from your feelings, you won't be able to express your truth with the necessary power. Remembering an awkward family situation from the past may stir up unresolved feelings, but can be exactly the emotional catalyst you need to resolve your current dilemma."
leo,2013-04-04,"It's not easy if a friend or coworker claims to know just about everything. However, you must be careful not to alienate others by dismissing them prematurely. Remaining open to someone who is acting in an immature manner can bring surprising benefits today, especially if you have previously been emotionally unavailable to him or her. Move past your negative judgments and learn something useful about yourself in the process."
virgo,2013-04-04,"Seeking new ways to do your job might start off as an amusing pastime, yet it could pay off quickly if you make an improvement that others can use as well. However, don't fritter your creativity away by looking for pie-in-the-sky solutions to imaginary problems. It's much better to take a small positive step now and build a strong foundation than to make a leap of faith and fall short of your destination."
libra,2013-04-04,"You may think you need to clean up a situation from a recent disagreement, but you still haven't received the stable, long-term answer that you seek. If you are frustrated because you feel misunderstood today, avoid expressing your anger at a wrong target -- that won't make anyone feel any better. However, finding a healthy outlet for your pent-up physical energy can shift the focus and save the day."
scorpio,2013-04-04,"Today's high-frequency Aquarius Moon activates your nervous system, amplifies your anxiety and makes you more intellectually astute. Although you may be emotionally on edge, you're quite comfortable relying on your rational mind now. Reestablishing a solid mental connection with your past is the key that unlocks a door to your contentment in the present moment."
sagittarius,2013-04-04,"The Moon is traveling through your 3rd House of Data Collection today, turning up the volume on all forms of communication. Although the noise can be distracting, you might enjoy it as a welcome relief to your recent boredom. But don't fritter away your energy seeking the elusive truth. Instead of looking for a single concept to use as your foundation, motivate yourself with as many ideas as possible. Keeping your options open is your best strategy for success."
capricorn,2013-04-04,The nonconformist Aquarius Moon insists that you get to the core of your thinking and figure out a solution to overcome the obstacles in your path. Whatever project you began over the past few days when the Moon was in your sign must now be taken to the next level in order to ensure its success. All the fantastic ideas in the world are not as good as a simple one that endures.
aquarius,2013-04-04,"It's time to tear down any artificial walls you previously built using fear as the primary ingredient now that the Moon is in your sign again. Revealing your vulnerability in a socially appropriate manner can raise the level of intimacy in nearly any type of relationship. Instead of unconsciously using today's intellectual Aquarius Moon to increase your isolation, construct mental bridges with kindness and awareness to cross the gulfs everywhere you go."
pisces,2013-04-04,"The separation between objective reality and subjective perception continues to narrow now that the Moon is visiting your 12th House of Spiritual Mystery. You have entered a phase when your rational thoughts and irrational feelings can float around together in your dreams, detached from the specifics of what they mean. But don't stuff them back into the rows and columns of linear logic as soon as you awake. Give them permission to wander through the forgotten corners of your mind and wait to see what treasures pop up."
aries,2013-04-05,"You are often enthusiastic in the pursuit of love and may be eager to push the envelope today. There is a high level of excitement in your life now as new ideas, experiences, and people tempt you to explore uncharted territory. But avoid putting all your eggs in one basket. Instead, keep your options open by spreading your interests around. There will be time to focus your attention on a specific goal later on."
taurus,2013-04-05,"Although you're thinking about your role at work, there may be some confusion as to the best way to proceed in light of changing circumstances. You wish you could tell someone what you are feeling, but disclosure might seem inappropriate at this time. If something does hook you emotionally, don't be afraid to share your desires. You're more psychically sensitive now and your intuition can work in your favor, if you choose to listen."
gemini,2013-04-05,"You can teach someone a thing or two about charm today, but you must be careful not to use your ability to influence others for your personal gain. You're anxious to say what's on your mind, even if it isn't the normal lighthearted stuff that people expect from you. Although you have serious issues pressing now, you can appear innocent enough to rope others into your agenda. Don't misuse your powers of persuasion by being selfish; instead, work for the common good."
cancer,2013-04-05,"You might be uncertain as to your next move because you cannot tell how others will react to your emotions now ... and the possible fallout seems a bit scary. Remember, your inner world impacts your outer circumstances, so don't bury your heart deep away where no one can find it. Wear your heart on your sleeve like a badge of courage. Follow your intuition while remaining detached from the final outcome."
leo,2013-04-05,"This might be the day you were waiting for, but everything depends on how honest you are with what's going on inside your heart. You can successfully make your move in the department of love because you have the power that derives from your belief that you're doing the right thing. However, nothing you do today is casual, so initiate action only if you really mean it."
virgo,2013-04-05,You are often misunderstood in the realm of romance because your actions can be easily misinterpreted by others. But you're not necessarily aloof and cool just because you're willing to wait until everything is perfect. A developing situation may ignite your passions now. Don't be afraid to slip right past the practical words and into the emotional world of desires in order to make the most of the current connection.
libra,2013-04-05,"This is a high-energy day of conflicting messages that can force you to seek harmony in the midst of confusion. You crave romance, but your attraction isn't necessarily rational. The intensity of your fantasies has been turned up loud. Don't be afraid of sharing your heart. Although your illusions might get shattered, the potential positive outcome outweighs the emotional risk."
scorpio,2013-04-05,"Your feelings are already intense, and they may continue to deepen over the next week or so. However, emotions that are often dark or obsessive become more pleasant and easier to experience for a while. A melodrama can be played out with the help of an intimate partner now, or you can even do it by yourself. Just be careful not to inadvertently transfer your fears and desires onto an unsuspecting victim. Staying aware of your motives  positively inspires all of your interactions."
sagittarius,2013-04-05,"Relationships may grow quite passionate this weekend. In fact, everything could become more colorful for the next couple of weeks as you express needs that have been kept secret until now. Don't worry about scaring your partner away. If they cannot take you in this form, they won't be able to engage your energy down the road either. Whatever you've been hiding must be brought out into the open or it will only become more problematic later on. Trust in the truth and let the chips fall as they may."
capricorn,2013-04-05,"Normally, you are uncomfortable with the possibilities of what might happen if your emotions sink into dark places. However, you're more equipped to control your feelings now so you can shine the light of your awareness into the darkness. A healthy sense of detachment makes this journey perfectly safe -- even enchanting. Let go of your fears, close your eyes and surrender into the unknown."
aquarius,2013-04-05,"You may feel uneasy when situations pull you into places of intense feelings now that the evocative Moon is meandering through your sign. However, your desire to express your needs is enough to push you outside of your normal comfort zone and into unfamiliar realms. Move past the restraints of language in order to successfully sidestep a needless verbal confrontation. Take the high road and others will follow your lead."
pisces,2013-04-05,"The practical side of your life is in the spotlight now that several planets are visiting your sensible 2nd House of Resources. However, you're also spending more time exploring your own private dreamland. The deeper you travel inside, the more power you will display outside as your confidence radiates from within. Fortunately, you can engage the real world directly from your imagination by taking a chance and sharing your vision."
aries,2013-04-06,"Thinking before speaking is always a good idea, and today it's even more important if you don't want to spend your time cleaning up the messes you created. There's no need to be dishonest. The truth is absolutely required; however, it's less about what you say than how you say it. Don't upset any apple carts now -- unless you want to waste precious time picking up apples throughout the week."
taurus,2013-04-06,"You need to be cautious in your interactions because your emotions are a bit elusive today. You might not be able to escape from the fog, making it nearly impossible to understand what you are feeling. This, in turn, can create situations where you mislead others because of your own lack of clarity. Don't waste energy being dramatic; getting upset only blows things out of proportion. Be safe and zero in on real events for now."
gemini,2013-04-06,"Today is a perfect day to meditate, but this isn't something you'll be able to learn on the spot if you haven't already practiced. You may feel too restless to sit still for long enough to gain the benefits of this kind of metaphysical pursuit. In any event, keep reminding yourself to slow down. The less you do now, the more can enjoy yourself in the present moment."
cancer,2013-04-06,"Your feelings will come out into the open sooner or later, so you might as well bring them up yourself. You tend to avoid discussing an uncomfortable subject if you're afraid of how others will react. However, it doesn't really matter now. All that's important is for you to get busy and find a way to let some of your pent-up emotions flow through your protective shell. You must be willing to take a risk in order to reap the rewards of a supportive relationship."
leo,2013-04-06,"You may need to release some steam, but it's wise to do it gently even if you are feeling angry. One strategy is to keep the larger issues in check so that you don't blow your top. But stay open to your dreams because they help you maintain a healthy perspective on those things that seem so out of whack. Let your imagination run wild while keeping your words to a minimum. You can share your fantasies once their intensity begins to settle down."
virgo,2013-04-06,"You might believe that your concepts are brilliant today -- and perhaps they are -- but there's also plenty of room now for self-delusion. It may be challenging to ride your own ideas to their conclusions, because new ones float into awareness before the previous ones fully develop. Lay off the caffeine and focus your attention on what's right in front of you instead of letting your thoughts buzz around all over the place."
libra,2013-04-06,"It may take too much energy and concentration to keep up with your fantasies now, so don't bother to explain them to others. Instead, concentrate on creative activities. You might be able to burn off some of your excess energy by doing something that is spontaneous and fun. Let go of your plans for the day; you can return to your regular routine tomorrow with a satisfied smile."
scorpio,2013-04-06,"It may seem as if you're on a roller coaster of emotions today, but you'll be able to enjoy the fluidity of your feelings if you view the day as a wild ride. Don't try to push the energy up into your brain -- the current process requires you to stay in touch with your intuition rather than relying on analysis. Trust the images that are bubbling into awareness, for they hold the keys to your future."
sagittarius,2013-04-06,"You may be feeling as if you're on the edge of something big today, but you can't yet figure out what will happen. The past and the future have merged and it seems like the present moment should be clearer than it is now. You want excitement and adventure, but you're left dissatisfied with just a series of unrealizable daydreams. Accept them for what they are and move on when you are ready."
capricorn,2013-04-06,"The rock-solid ground you thought was underfoot has temporarily disintegrated. Something that is supposed to be stable has disappeared right before your eyes. However, this can be a magical and creative time for those of you who have faith. Use your imagination to sail past the very same obstacles that were previously in your path. The opportunity to rebuild your foundation will give you a better place to stand in the future."
aquarius,2013-04-06,"Your nervous system may be in a state of gentle rebellion as thoughts come quickly now, whether you ask for them or not. But you're not entirely in control of your own mind today. Don't try to stop the far-out ideas from popping into awareness; don't even attempt to understand them. Just be philosophical in your approach and let the images entertain you for a while."
pisces,2013-04-06,"It may still be challenging to narrow your vision today as the Moon in your sign contacts nebulous Neptune. You might feel as if there aren't any walls or boundaries now, making it tricky to know when to stop. You're on edge as little things can set off cascading reactions within your mind. Even if you aren't sure of where you are going, don't let the uncertainty slow you down too much. For now, just stay in motion. You'll learn more about your destination shortly."
aries,2013-04-07,"Your world is abuzz with excitement today, yet you may not notice if there's trouble on the way. It's not that you are in denial; it's just that your attention is fully dedicated to the present moment. You're so focused on what you need to do now that you might forget about the bigger problems and do nothing to solve them. Expanding your vision can prevent a major headache later on."
taurus,2013-04-07,"You still may have a secret that you're keeping to yourself, yet you also could get an opportunity to use some of what you know to gain the confidence of others. You are able to project a magical and charming image, enabling you to attract what you want. However, don't misuse your power of persuasion or things can backfire. Gain the trust of others by showing your vulnerability instead of smooth talking them into seeing things your way."
gemini,2013-04-07,"Be careful what you say today because others may take your words at face value. This is complicated by your current tendency to embellish the facts with added little pieces of your own information, which aren't necessarily factual. Your fantasies can inspire others, but you are better off telling the truth, instead of getting lost in the wonderful stories that you share."
cancer,2013-04-07,"Although your relationships are important to you, today they must take a temporary back seat to something that's happening in your professional life. Even if you are confused about what is most important, try to keep your focus on the outer circumstances now, rather than your feelings. You'll be able to return to your personal concerns once your responsibilities don't require as much attention."
leo,2013-04-07,"Although it's a high-energy day, you still might have to go back over some territory you already covered. If you bump into resistance, don't just push it out of the way. Instead, try to understand the lesson you are receiving. Look at everything as symptoms of deeper meaning. Once you get the message, obstacles will fall to the wayside."
virgo,2013-04-07,"Running willy-nilly into the day by doing one thing after another may not be the best use of your vivid imagination today. You are in the midst of a busy time, and the more structure you give to your calendar, the more time you have for fun and relaxation. You won't have to sidestep any of your responsibilities, but you need to cultivate your creativity if you want to do it all."
libra,2013-04-07,"Today you may face a recurring dilemma in your life as you struggle to find room for your own needs within the context of making your partner happy. Ultimately, it's about taking care of yourself versus taking care of others, even if you're not involved in an intimate relationship. Don't avoid the uncomfortable issues. Think about what you really want now, and then ask for it."
scorpio,2013-04-07,"It could be nearly impossible to keep your needs quiet now, but expressing them won't get you what you want, either. Unfortunately, attempts to keep your feelings tightly wrapped while you wait for a more opportune moment probably won't work. As much as you might like the advantage of right timing, circumstances may unwrap things just enough to get the ball rolling. However, you are better off to say what's on your mind and in your heart without harboring too many expectations."
sagittarius,2013-04-07,"Although you may be quite confident now, don't try to push too hard yet. You might not even realize how much energy you have behind your actions. Without any ill intent, you could inadvertently offend someone you want on your side. Think about what you need today, but extend your plans over the next week or so. This tactical delay allows you to make optimal use of the rising tide without upsetting anyone in the process."
capricorn,2013-04-07,"Although the universe is reminding you to loosen up, this is no simple task for you. You have too much at stake to just go along with the flow now, especially since you don't even know where it's taking you. You wish you were controlling the direction of the currents, but don't delude yourself into false feelings of grandiose power. Don't resist; instead, relax and float downstream for a while."
aquarius,2013-04-07,"You are not bored today; in fact, you're probably much busier than you prefer. Fortunately, you have enough energy to handle nearly anything that is thrown at you now. You also have the motivation to start a project that you've been dreaming about. Although you feel as if you're being called to action, remain as practical as possible. You need to have your plans in hand before you can begin construction on something new."
pisces,2013-04-07,"This is a very interesting day, for you are able to be in the world and not in it at the same time. You Fish often swim within a context of a rich imaginative life. Your dreams are vivid and your spiritual pursuit gives your life meaning. Thankfully, your inner life is in harmony with your outer world, so make the most of this equilibrium while it lasts."
aries,2013-04-08,"The Moon's return to your sign adds an emotional charge to the next couple of days. Although your life is already in high gear, this intensity just turns the volume up even louder. It's all too easy for you to act with conviction before you even think about how you might come across to others. Remember, everyone isn't as amped up as you are, so be gentle and patient while continuing to express your feelings with passion."
taurus,2013-04-08,"Something is brewing out of sight now as the evocative Moon visits your 12th House of Secrets. It's crucial to discover what you're missing or it could have a negative impact. An event may be set into motion that will require more from you than you can give. Remember, it's always best to catch any potential problems before they manifest and not after."
gemini,2013-04-08,"You want to participate in more social activities now, yet you must be careful not to be too aggressive in the process. You can easily exhaust others since they aren't built to travel at the same pace as you. Rather than charging ahead, try visualizing yellow warning lights at every interaction; proceed with extra caution, but don't come to a full stop. You have the potential to upset the apple cart today, so it would be wise to slow down before you have to clean up a mess."
cancer,2013-04-08,"A recurring dilemma about whether to push ahead or to retreat can demand your attention now. Unfortunately, today's mixed cosmic signals don't help you decide. On one hand, you are ready to take your idea to the next level. On the other hand, you're fearful of the changing tides and don't want to be left high and dry. Although you prefer to make a decision and be done with it, it's more advantageous to take your time and consider all your options carefully before choosing your path."
leo,2013-04-08,"Although you might try to avoid your inner voice that tells you to take life more seriously, you have probably already decided that it's not worth fighting the inevitable. If you could just let go, everything would likely take its course and you won't have to work so hard. But you cannot change your own somber disposition overnight. Be patient when honoring your feelings; your fun-loving spirit will return sooner than you think."
virgo,2013-04-08,"You may need to step beyond your comfort zone and be emotionally expressive now in a way that is uncomfortable for you. You are often eager to apply your logical analysis to the task at hand, but staying in your head today won't get you where you want to go. Thankfully, exploring your feelings allows you to enter a magical space where time slows down and you can run circles around everyone else. Don't hold back; it's your day to go for the gold."
libra,2013-04-08,"You can't get in a final word on a variety of topics today, and the more you try to make yourself heard, the less likely anyone will listen. Circumstances require you to initiate action, but nothing you do seems to alter the overall nature of the day. However, you can modify your attitude and that, in turn, changes everything. Take the events in stride and enjoy yourself in spite of the work you still need to do."
scorpio,2013-04-08,"You may quickly get yourself into trouble today as you start one thing after another, and finish the day without having much to show for all your running around. You must do a tricky dance now but, fortunately, you can turn this to your advantage. Visualize yourself wearing blinders to remind you to narrow your field of perception. And don't start the next big project until you're finished with your current tasks and ready to move on."
sagittarius,2013-04-08,"Although you're rather restless today, you still may feel like an eternal optimist. It's hard to turn off your brain even if you have scheduled a wonderful play day for you and friends. Thankfully, you have an overabundance of charm these days which can help you get what you want. Just be careful about what you ask for because you might actually receive it."
capricorn,2013-04-08,"You may be dealing with a complicated problem and you are right in the thick of things trying to discover a solution. What makes today even more difficult is that you are clearly missing a piece of the puzzle and are hesitant to take sides until you have a clear picture with all the facts. Be gentle with yourself and recognize that it's hard to come up with useful answers now. However, continuing your research will lead to success as long as you don't give up."
aquarius,2013-04-08,"As much as the idea of breaking out of a restraining situation is exciting, it may be wiser to wait a while longer. If you do turn your life upside down now, it might take a while for everything to settle back down. Even if you are committed to finding an effective way to work within the current limitations, you are still free to apply your rational skills and spiritual training to your work."
pisces,2013-04-08,"Taking a hard look at your finances is a high priority today and unfortunately, this isn't just about balancing your checkbook. You need to decide how you are going to optimize what you have and move into the future. It's time to be practical about your life. Don't try to make anything more important than it is; just put your energy toward getting your fiscal world in order."
aries,2013-04-09,"You may think your perceptions are so precise today that you don't need to consult anyone else. Unfortunately, you might understand exactly what's happening and take foolhardy action anyhow. Instead of acting in an overly confident manner and making grandiose gestures based on incorrect assumptions,  ask others what they want first and then take their ideas seriously. Feedback from someone you trust can help you make a positive breakthrough in your own behavior."
taurus,2013-04-09,"You may head into work with a secret today, not that you'll be able to keep it to yourself for long. Even if you promised someone else that you wouldn't talk, you could always try to justify your actions if you believe that telling the truth outweighs everything else. However, there are other factors to consider and playing your cards close to your vest is an admirable goal for now. Exercising discretion cultivates trust."
gemini,2013-04-09,"Hanging out with friends sounds like a fine idea now, but you can't run out on your work commitments just to have a good time. The good news is that you should be able to enjoy yourself today as long as you get your work done first. Taking the easy way out will not be as rewarding as you might expect. You'll like what you see in the mirror more if you deliver on your promises with a smile."
cancer,2013-04-09,"It's a challenge to rein in your impulses now, but telling others what they need isn't such a smart move. You can easily talk about your life, career goals and plans for the future, yet your message might not align with what's in your heart. It isn't that you are misleading anyone on purpose; it's just that you may currently be filled with ambivalence. Let your emotions continue to settle naturally without trying to push your agenda on to anyone else."
leo,2013-04-09,"Your Leo roar might be quite ferocious today as the expressive Aries Moon bumps into difficult aspects with stern Saturn and relentless Pluto. You are willing to stand up for your beliefs, even if it means engaging in an open conflict. Nevertheless, don't worry about what may happen down the road, because you don't have all the information at your disposal yet. Ironically, the whole story will come out if you don't dig too hard for the answers now."
virgo,2013-04-09,"This is the perfect day to discuss the larger issues that are often set aside in the name of getting things done in the present moment. Even if you can't find the answers you seek, just talking about your goals may be of a great help now. Open communication is not only the way into a deeper and more personalized relationship; it's also the way out of a dilemma."
libra,2013-04-09,"You are the partnership people of the zodiac and you tend to be even more engaged with those around you. Fortunately, you can easily accommodate the needs of others. However, your perceptions are so sharp that it's difficult to separate out your own feelings. Don't minimize your desires; taking good care of yourself enables you to be emotionally available to nurture those who need it."
scorpio,2013-04-09,"If you recently failed at an attempt to make changes in a diet or exercise program, now is a perfect time to try again because of all the planetary pressure on your 6th House of Routine. Although you may be tempted to do something in a radically new way, don't lose sight of your goals. Stay focused on your destination to minimize your boredom and keep on track. Making small healthy adjustments leads to lasting positive change."
sagittarius,2013-04-09,"This is a very productive day if you can find the maturity to capture your creativity instead of squelching it. But even if your spontaneous expression is not practical, don't let that stop you now. Ultimately, your unrestrained emotional disclosure may simply be a catalyst that gets you just where you wanted to go all along."
capricorn,2013-04-09,"If you have been wrestling with problems on the home front, things may appear to improve today, especially if going to work takes the pressure off your more personal concerns. However, keep in mind that the family dynamics will likely be waiting for you whenever you choose to return. Set your caution aside and delve into the issues at hand. Thankfully, your good intentions and sincere efforts won't go unnoticed."
aquarius,2013-04-09,"Your life can be quite exciting now, filled with a variety of things to do and people to see. But all this noise might also increase your anxiety, making it difficult for you to think about the real work at hand. It really doesn't matter if you are sure of the outcome. Just jump in and do your best. Good fortune may be delayed but, luckily, it's still on the horizon."
pisces,2013-04-09,"Others may think that you have a great deal of confidence at this time, but, ironically, you might feel as if you aren't standing on very solid ground. Unfortunately, it only makes matters worse when you project an air of false optimism. Instead, just be honest. It's best to let others know if you are experiencing uncertainty beneath your sunny veneer. Ultimately, everyone involved will breathe a sigh of relief once the truth is out in the open."
aries,2013-04-10,"Today's exciting New Moon in your sign is a great time to start a project, so clear out the old and bring in the new. Your self-confidence may be running strong, but don't get so wound up in what you can do that you let the morning slip away without actually putting an idea into motion. Once you begin, it's crucial to find a pace that you can sustain to maximize the potential; otherwise, your best efforts might be wasted."
taurus,2013-04-10,"You're standing on the edge of something big, but the Aries New Moon lands in your 12th House of Escapism today, making it crucial to move out of your fantasies and into the real world. Don't let your fear of change come between you and your goals. Your ideas are neither reckless nor impulsive, for you have been thinking about them long enough. Move forward with determination one step at a time and your confidence will grow."
gemini,2013-04-10,"The Aries New Moon falls in your 11th House of the Future, prompting you to take a risk to make your dreams come true. You feel as if you must act quickly or lose the potential of the moment. Don't waste time making more plans; flying by the seat of your pants actually allows you to react to the changing dynamics with greater flexibility. It will be better to make adjustments later on than letting an amazing opportunity slip through your fingers now."
cancer,2013-04-10,Today's spontaneous Aries New Moon in your 10th House of Public Status triggers personal conflict about your professional role in the world. People may be making demands that pull you out of your comfort zone. You might not want to go the distance until you realize that revealing your vulnerabilities is a better option than not showing up at all. Take a chance and open your heart.
leo,2013-04-10,"Your life is busy now that the enterprising Aries New Moon activates your 9th House of Big Ideas, tempting you to reach even farther. However, success may feel hollow if you are always yearning for something else. It's great to crave the attraction to someplace, something or someone new as long as it doesn't prevent you from experiencing the magic of the present moment."
virgo,2013-04-10,"Anyone who thinks you can't go the distance now just doesn't know very much about you. You are wired to a power source that keeps you strong, even if you don't express it all the time. Today's forceful Aries New Moon occurs in your 8th House of Intimacy, making you a likely candidate for an emotional breakthrough. However, you must apply both your logic and your intuition to the situation; learning to work in both worlds increases your chances for success."
libra,2013-04-10,"Your objective sense of social balance is called into action today by the Aries New Moon landing in your 7th House of Relationships. You won't fall victim to anyone's biases even if others are in disagreement with your perspective, allowing you to facilitate a workable compromise. Lean on your interactive skills by mediating a solution as you co-create common ground for everyone to stand on."
scorpio,2013-04-10,"The Aries New Moon's emphasis on your 6th House of Efficiency can be challenging if you feel like you aren't being allowed to do your chores your own way. You want to apply your intensity and focus on something you already started, but unexpected circumstances may require you to suddenly change direction. Although this instability can be annoying, don't fight it; you're better off just working your magic on whatever is right in front of you."
sagittarius,2013-04-10,"Your previously hidden motives may be revealed now, yet you don't necessarily feel more vulnerable. Actually, you want others to know who you are and what you are doing since the Aries New Moon falls in your 5th House of Self-Expression. You believe that you can make your position more acceptable by demonstrating your openness. Even if you don't convince anyone of the merit of your ideas, at least they will know exactly where you stand."
capricorn,2013-04-10,"Today's Aries New Moon's presence in your 4th House of Foundations reminds you there is much to be gained by withdrawing to take stock of your feelings. It may be stressful as you come to grips with what's actually happening within your own psyche, but it's crucial that you do the inner work. Thankfully, you're able to act with integrity once you understand yourself better, inspiring others to give you their enthusiastic support."
aquarius,2013-04-10,It's a busy day with the Aries New Moon occupying your 3rd House of Communication. This lunation can initiate a cycle with unexpected news that widens your perspective and presents a path that you had not previously considered. There may be so much information coming at you now that it's nearly impossible to know which messages are the important ones. Take time to prioritize the incoming data before wasting your energy on the wrong goal.
pisces,2013-04-10,"This is a great day to make decisions, for the Aries New Moon lands in your 2nd House of Self-Esteem and your values seem perfectly clear to you. You are certain of your intentions and you have a good sense of what needs to be done to accomplish your goals. If it seems as if you should take action right away, then listen to your intuition. But don't jump in unless it truly feels right. Now is only better than later if it is consistent with your core beliefs."
aries,2013-04-11,"You're driven to express yourself in a straightforward manner and there isn't much that will stand in your way. Although you enjoy the pursuit of romantic love, you might be overly aggressive without even realizing it. Check out the other person's feelings before you reveal too much, or you could find yourself in an embarrassing position. Exercising common sense as you move through the day is better than cleaning up an emotional mess after the fact."
taurus,2013-04-11,"Personal loyalties may come to the forefront now that the Moon is back in your sign, motivating you to make a tough choice. Unexpected circumstances might require you to be an anchor for someone else today. Basing your actions on your deepest convictions produces the most significant consequences in your relationships. You truly can't go wrong if you simply follow your heart."
gemini,2013-04-11,"You may be ready for some excitement today, but a quiet little voice reminds you that frivolous diversions are not what you need at this time. Unfortunately, you might not listen to this cautionary voice of reason because since you have your own ideas about how to deal with the current circumstances. Although you can be quite determined to have a good time, consider changing your plans and playing later when your work is done."
cancer,2013-04-11,"A relationship conflict may intensify now, which puts a damper on your day. However, it probably won't be serious enough to derail the train of success. You could be making steady progress in your career, but change and growth happen slowly. Even if you're uncharacteristically impatient today, keep your intentions out in front of you like a carrot on a stick. By positively motivating yourself, you'll be able to stay on track."
leo,2013-04-11,"You are eager to display your big heart in a way that shows everyone how much you have to give. However, this grand gesture can act like a double-edged sword because others also see how much you need. Your desires are very strong today and it helps to pay extra attention so that you don't inadvertently hurt someone's feelings. Generosity doesn't have to come with a price tag."
virgo,2013-04-11,"You may appear cool on the surface because you're tempted to downplay your feelings so others don't get caught up in your emotional drama. Unfortunately, the problem with this strategy is that your true passions might be blocked in the process. It's easier to pursue your needs if those closest to you know your real feelings. Coming clean can raise concerns because you don't want to sound inappropriate; nevertheless, it's time to act on your desires now without worrying about what others think."
libra,2013-04-11,"When things grow too intense, you often like to lighten the conversation and put others at ease. But you can still find meaning today from the magical spaces created in a close friendship or romance, even if you are more comfortable balancing out the energies. If you allow yourself to be pulled into powerful currents of complex feelings now, you might just emerge with a totally fresh perspective."
scorpio,2013-04-11,"You may feel as if you're riding a roller coaster today as you get bounced around by your changing moods. A stubborn friend or workmate might try to slow down your progress when the Moon opposes austere Saturn, but you are empowered to show up as your authentic self when the Moon harmonizes with passionate Pluto later in the day. Speak from the heart; relationships are more meaningful when you're living in integrity and expressing your truth."
sagittarius,2013-04-11,"You have a powerful inner resolve that you can rely on now, no matter what is happening in your outer world. Your life is changing quickly these days, but you may not fully understand how it affects your future. Don't worry about being left out; just let go of anything that stands between you and your success. There's no need to interfere with the process because room is being made for new opportunities which will enter your life soon."
capricorn,2013-04-11,"You are blessed with the extra endurance you need to hold your position today on the stormy seas of change. Meanwhile, your current situation is forcing everything around you to shift. You can feel something special in the air -- and, luckily, it seems benevolent. Get ready to dance with the unknown because if you try to ignore the music, it will just play louder and louder until you cannot shut it out."
aquarius,2013-04-11,"Although your day-to-day world is filled with busyness and excitement, you are growing weary of having to be so responsible. You long for a simpler existence where you have time to relax without running off to the next activity. But don't let the difference between what you have and what you want bring you down. Fulfill your current obligations while maintaining a grateful attitude. Thankfully, you'll get the chance to rest and recuperate over the weekend."
pisces,2013-04-11,"Your best application of today's powerful energy might be to spend it in silent contemplation, but you won't likely have the luxury to take a personal retreat. Instead of planning your escape, cultivate a spiritually conducive atmosphere in all that you do. Don't get discouraged; just make some time for quiet meditation or get outside in a natural setting that is good for your soul."
aries,2013-04-12,"You may be so excited about what's ahead that you can't get much work done today, but your feelings have to take a back seat to practicality. You still must do whatever it takes to meet your current obligations, even if it means cutting back on pleasurable activities. However, it doesn't make sense to go overboard and cancel everything on your schedule. If you settle down and concentrate on your work now, you might even have time left over for play later on."
taurus,2013-04-12,"Your friends and coworkers may look to you for guidance today, since you seem to possess a clear mind and sound judgment. Unfortunately, your current advice might not be so helpful because you have a tough time saying exactly what you mean. Instead of relying on words, let your actions speak for you. It's best to lead by example now and not by command."
gemini,2013-04-12,"You may feel like you're being unfairly restricted if you have too many commitments on your calendar today. Your imagination is on overdrive and you don't want to waste all your creativity on your job. You prefer to complete your work tasks quickly and then drift on mental currents, letting them sweep you along for a whimsical ride. Although this fantasy sounds sweet, it's smarter to harness your cleverness for something more productive and leave the dreaming for the weekend."
cancer,2013-04-12,"Concrete plans can drive you toward making conservative decisions at work today, but you won't likely be satisfied now unless you add a bit of risk to the picture. Relying on your common sense is a very practical strategy, but real progress happens if you take a chance on something other than the tried and true. Be daring and break out of a rut without worrying about jeopardizing your current security."
leo,2013-04-12,"Exhilarating adrenaline rushes motivate you to do something beyond the ordinary today. Your creativity is running wild, yet you can't shake a very practical perspective that inspires you to be productive ... even while you're having fun. If you have to make a decision about your future, erring on the side of caution now is better than reaching too far and falling short of your goal."
virgo,2013-04-12,"Having a good time while also doing the right thing often requires more effort, but today all the pieces fall into place. The greatest danger comes from taking yourself too seriously as you attempt to eliminate old patterns that no longer support your journey. Unfortunately, established habits can return even when you think you've seen the last of them. Small modifications are not enough to create the desired effect now. Don't be afraid to really shake things up with radical action to free yourself from the past."
libra,2013-04-12,"Your indecision may be challenging today as you figure out how to seek pleasure while also fulfilling someone else's expectations. However, it's difficult to second-guess your friends and associates now because they are not conforming to your plans. The current lesson for everyone is to live and let live instead of trying to balance your personal needs with those of the larger group. Focus on enjoying the present moment rather than worrying about the future."
scorpio,2013-04-12,"Relentless Pluto reminds you to let go of control as it begins its retrograde period today. Fortunately, you can turn your key planet into your best ally as long as you step up to tackle an emotional issue that you were previously trying to ignore. You could be rewarded with more appreciation than you expect if you're willing to follow someone else's lead. But don't assume that change will be immediate since it may take a few days to see any results from your current shift of perspective."
sagittarius,2013-04-12,"The cost of pleasure may actually be higher than you think now, but you might not realize it until after you say yes. You are enthusiastic about the possibilities, making it likely for you to be swept up in the excitement of the present moment. Your day can quickly become entangled in emotional drama, especially if there's a romantic attraction involved. Think about the consequences of your actions before doing something impulsive that will need fixing later."
capricorn,2013-04-12,"You are often the champion of responsibility, yet today your key planet, Saturn, receives an electric jab from spontaneous Uranus, prompting you to make a quick escape. But this exciting cosmic zap also sends mixed signals to your brain because you are nervous about running out on a promise. Even if you decide to play the energy conservatively, don't deny your feelings. Acknowledging your desire to shake things up may be enough to keep things together for now."
aquarius,2013-04-12,"You crave the excitement of variety in your daily routine, but today everything could become too chaotic to manage. However, don't just shut down and withdraw, for the lack of distractions may be even worse than too many of them. Blazing a moderate path between the two extremes can be challenging, yet it's the smartest option available at this time. Give yourself the chance to follow your heart."
pisces,2013-04-12,"Your plans for a vacation might run into an unexpected obstacle today, especially if your dreams are too big for your budget. Financial restraints could deter you from finalizing travel arrangements. Or, perhaps a lack of resources prevents you from enrolling in an educational course. Either way, don't just cave in and give up. Readjust the scope of your vision and try again in a few days once the energy improves."
aries,2013-04-13,"You may be busy all day, but it probably feels good to be in perpetual motion. Thankfully, you can accomplish a lot, but unless you concentrate on what you're doing today, you could stir up a commotion without completing anything. Don't jump into the next project just to escape the drudgery of the current one. Rather than ending up frustrated because you spread yourself too thin, applying a bit of self-control enables you to finish your work."
taurus,2013-04-13,"Your best plan is to continue working on a recently started project instead of throwing yourself into a new one that might lead to nowhere. Your mind may be running through a variety of possible alternatives now, but every time you think of another idea, you can turn it into something bigger and better. Unfortunately, if you let your thought-bubbles become too inflated, they will surely pop. Wait until tomorrow before initiating action, even if you're raring to go today."
gemini,2013-04-13,"Your thoughts and feelings rise to the surface once the evocative Moon returns to your sign this morning, and everyone can read you like an open book. However, you could react to others so fast that you might find yourself making promises you can't keep. Don't take on a large commitment before you consider how much time and energy you have to put into it. Taking a few deep breaths before saying yes enables you to step back and evaluate your options."
cancer,2013-04-13,"You are eager to follow your emotions all over the map ... but leading with your feelings won't make you any happier today. Actually, it may even have a negative effect if you get caught up in unnecessary drama. Practice detachment by imagining yourself to be more unattached than you really are now. If you can let go of your disappointment over  unmet expectations, joy might knock on your door sooner than you think."
leo,2013-04-13,"Your friends may be the source of more information than you need to know today. However, once you learn something, you are quick to integrate it with your evolving perspective. Don't try to hold on to whatever you thought was the truth. Be open to change and the day will roll along with greater ease. A flexible attitude is your key to living in harmony with others."
virgo,2013-04-13,"Your current dilemma stems from simply being too busy. You know what you must do, but you cannot find the time to focus your attention as one thing after another distracts you from your routine. Even if you try to stay on track, reality comes tugging at your sleeve. There isn't an easy way out of this predicament. You might just have to put up with the noise now while continuing to do the best you can. Thankfully, exerting extra effort today may bring unexpected rewards during the week."
libra,2013-04-13,"Visions of exotic places drift in and out of your imagination today. Perhaps you are overdue for some vacation time, or maybe you just long for a quick getaway to recharge your batteries. But don't let these fantasies end at idle daydreaming. Use your desire for adventure to motivate you to manifest the trip you want to take. Asking someone to join you adds to the fun and makes the expedition more likely to happen."
scorpio,2013-04-13,"Although your thoughts start to brighten today, you aren't ready to give up on uncovering the hidden meaning of life. Anything that stirs up your curiosity can quickly become the subject of a more intense investigation. Don't get lost in an endless search for Atlantis when your current environment also holds important truths for you to discover. Explore your world with an open mind and a compassionate heart."
sagittarius,2013-04-13,"The evocative Moon opposes your Sun sign now, reflecting your feelings on a variety of relationships in your life. This introspective awareness impacts both personal and professional associations as you integrate the events of the past few days. You aren't completely through this unstable period, but the situation may appear to settle down to give you a cooling off period. Don't become complacent ... you still have plenty of work to do next week."
capricorn,2013-04-13,"A jittery feeling washes over you in waves today and you aren't quite sure what to do with this sensation. You can't easily shake it off now, although your anxiety might motivate you into action. Working toward a goal can distract you from the annoyance, but it probably won't cure your underlying restlessness. Make positive changes in your daily routine to help ease your mind. Taking small steps is more efficient than trying to do everything at once."
aquarius,2013-04-13,"Your life takes a turn for the better today as the intense transits of the past week begin to wane. Meanwhile, the Moon is visiting airy Gemini, helping you reclaim your old familiar bounce. There is no reason to hide your light since your confidence is returning in full force. Sharing your dreams is the first step to making them come true."
pisces,2013-04-13,"The chatter of your own mind can make you feel a bit on edge today, but don't let your attempts at rationalization pull you off your creative course. Logic oftentimes steers you in the right direction, but now it only undermines your potential. Listen to your thoughts, but don't put too much credence in them at the moment. Trust your intuition and it will continue to work in your favor."
aries,2013-04-14,"You're tempted to act like a wise guy today, speaking before you think about the consequences of your sharp words. But don't be so quick to use laughter to mask your feelings. If you are responding via email, read each message twice before sending it. Although you might think that your first shot is your best shot, taking your time allows you to deal with the real situation rather than just covering it up."
taurus,2013-04-14,"You may need to update your budget at home or review recent expenditures at work. You might even be required to justify certain expenses. Or, perhaps you have to spend time on the phone managing a financial matter that demands your undivided attention. Whatever crisis surfaces now, your communication is likely about money. Deal with anything that affects your bottom line. Take care of business today so bigger problems do not surface later."
gemini,2013-04-14,"It seems as if you're being flooded with information now that the Moon is back in your sign. Although you might sense an approaching data gridlock, there's a part of you that actually thrives on the chaotic pace of life. Don't try to turn the volume down. Life will settle back to normal in a few days, so enjoy the ride while it lasts."
cancer,2013-04-14,"You might feel somewhat detached from your immediate surroundings today. It's as if you are hidden in a murky swamp looking up at the world. But everything seems warped out of shape by the ripples on the surface of the water. However, in this case it's not reality that is bent out of shape; it's you. Maintain a low profile until later in the day when your clarity returns along with your confidence. Playing the observer for a while teaches you a valuable lesson."
leo,2013-04-14,"A healthy sense of certainty is usually a positive trait, but not if you believe that you're the only one who truly understands what's going on today. Unfortunately, you might have to accept that you don't have a monopoly on the truth. Even if your sense of the situation is based on the facts, there are many ways to frame reality. Allow for multiple points of view because you're not the only person involved. Weaving everyone's perspective together creates a rich tapestry of meaning."
virgo,2013-04-14,"Some aspect of your spiritual vision is feeding your current success and inspiring the recognition you are receiving from your peers. However, there could be problems if you are motivated by power or by the need for control. Take a long hard look at your motives and make sure that your efforts are for the good of all. If everyone wins, so do you."
libra,2013-04-14,"If you're obsessing over unimportant details today, set aside the rational thoughts that arise from your overloaded nervous system. Instead of wasting energy defending your beliefs, create a coherent spiritual vision from your experiences. This forward thinking requires more imagination than facts, figures and references can supply. Faith has more impact on your future than logic now."
scorpio,2013-04-14,"Aim high when setting goals this week because you are entering an energetic period where you can accomplish more than you expect. You are given a chance to practice the art of transformation as you gear up for serious work. This is not just a rehearsal, but it is not quite the main event either. Don't cling to outdated assumptions. Instead, embrace the idea of change and dance with the unknown."
sagittarius,2013-04-14,Be careful what you say today and how you say it. You're moving faster than anyone around you and there is a possibility for a misunderstanding if you leave something important out of your communication. Soon it may be too late to just apologize and think everything will be okay. Don't wait until a crisis occurs. Make sure you build your case before jumping to a conclusion. Repeat the really important facts if you think you weren't heard the first time.
capricorn,2013-04-14,"There could be so many loose ends to tie up today that finishing your work may seem like a hopeless cause. Everything is taking longer than you expect and your regular approach doesn't seem to be working so well now. Normally, you make your ambitious plan and then get busy executing it, but this list of chores appears to have a life of its own. Do your best to maintain a positive attitude and rest assured that the unfinished tasks will wait for your return."
aquarius,2013-04-14,"Your attention may be focused on everything except work today because you are enjoying the variety of diversions that find their way to your door. Creative pursuits of all kinds are emphasized, as are spontaneous activities with children. Perhaps a trip to the playground or some other spring-like outing would be fun for all. Be flexible enough with your schedule to allow room for a surprise. You can still have a great time, even if the day doesn't end as it began."
pisces,2013-04-14,You may be more interested in sharing your current feelings or reminiscing about old memories with your family than you are in doing your chores. Your nostalgia might follow you around all day and make you very sensitive to your immediate surroundings. Retreat back into the safety of your home to find comfort today. Giving yourself permission to enjoy the sweet company of those who love you ultimately makes this day a memorable one.
aries,2013-04-15,"You've recently had your ups and downs, as if you've been riding an emotional rollercoaster. Thankfully, the erratic energy begins to settle now that romantic Venus is leaving your sign. Relationships may no longer be as thrilling as you like, but you're rewarded by the solid foundation they can provide at this time. Use the next few weeks to stabilize your resources and take determined steps toward building more value and meaning in your life."
taurus,2013-04-15,"Pleasure may start knocking loudly at your door once your key planet Venus moves into your sign today. However, excessively indulging in all kinds of sensory delights is one potential downside of this otherwise positive transit. Go ahead and enjoy yourself, but respect your limits. Remember, exercising moderation is the key to healthy living."
gemini,2013-04-15,"Relationship issues may grow more complicated  because subconscious forces are driving your actions now. Exploring your imagination helps you get in touch with repressed issues, enabling you to better enjoy the weeks ahead. Pay special attention to your dreams, practice meditation or prayer and spend time soaking in the beauty of nature. Doing anything that puts you back in touch with your spirit is a wise idea."
cancer,2013-04-15,"Your career goals may be shifting this week to include more social activities now that resourceful Venus is occupying your 11th House of Community. You're still concerned with meeting previous obligations, but you're ready to delegate some of your work to others today so you have room on your schedule to enjoy the camaraderie of those you admire. It's critical to make time to be with your friends so you can dream about the future instead of just working in the present."
leo,2013-04-15,"Opportunities to get ahead may come your way now, but these potential rewards can create a whole new set of problems. Your career could be taking off, but you might be required to commit more time to your job than you're willing. Don't jeopardize caring for your own personal needs. Discuss the possible consequences of your choices with someone you trust before making any final decisions."
virgo,2013-04-15,"Your thoughts are floating off into realms of possible travel or adventure today, but they might just be flights of fantasy. You may be quite determined to begin an activity that widens your current perspective. Even if you don't hop a jet to an exotic destination in the coming weeks, you can still journey to fabulous places in your mind without even leaving your neighborhood."
libra,2013-04-15,"Your ruling planet Venus is moseying through comfortable Taurus for the next few weeks, prompting you to dream about getting back to basics. Unfortunately, downsizing isn't all that easy now, since eliminating extraneous activities could be a primary source of anxiety as Venus moves through your complicated 8th House of Intimacy. Don't retreat from confronting your fears; engaging deep processes can ultimately add more beauty to your life."
scorpio,2013-04-15,"You may not be interested in an easy way out of a complex situation -- even as lovely Venus visits sensible Taurus. In fact, you might choose to take on emotional entanglements just to get the fullest possible impact from an intimate encounter. Your current dilemma is about balancing meaning and pleasure. Even simple joys have their place in your life ... and this is a smart time to explore them without complicating the dynamics."
sagittarius,2013-04-15,"Aspiring to escape on your next adventure is challenging if you have daily responsibilities that affect someone else. You may grow frustrated during the next few weeks as facets of these divergent desires clash. You want to explore somewhere new and do something different, but are limited because of your current circumstances. Don't stress needlessly; you will have another chance to pursue something exciting soon enough. In the meantime, complete any unfinished business so you are ready to take off when given the green light."
capricorn,2013-04-15,"You may have an easier time letting go of your responsibilities so you can enjoy yourself now that Venus begins her visit to your 5th House of Love and Creativity. This is a wonderful time to schedule special activities for children of all ages. In general, you will find more pleasure being playfully spontaneous during the next few weeks. Whatever you do, don't criticize yourself for having some well-deserved fun. Even hardworking goats need to kick up their heels now and then."
aquarius,2013-04-15,"You might want to stay home and enjoy a bit of peace and quiet today, especially if you have a creative project that you would like to push along. However, it may be difficult to get the alone time you want because of all the demands being made on you by others. Don't be overly concerned if satisfaction seems just out of reach. Bide your time by pursuing your interests in between meeting your obligations. Thankfully, within a few weeks you will be in a much better position to enjoy yourself as you wish."
pisces,2013-04-15,"Simple pleasures may be more available now, especially if you can talk about what you want. Don't waste energy spinning long yarns or sharing complicated fantasies. Words work in your favor only if you consciously stick with the basics. Think carefully about your desires and then state them as clearly as possible. You just might be pleasantly surprised with the results."
aries,2013-04-16,"You want to make everyone around you feel comfortable today, even if you aren't having a great day. However, you must understand that you can only control so much. Everyone has his or her own inner work to do and until you face your psychological and spiritual issues, balance in relationships will continue to remain out of reach. Thankfully, improving your attitude is a positive catalyst for those closest to you."
taurus,2013-04-16,"You're inclined to keep your life as simple as possible, but sometimes you don't say enough because you believe that everyone shares your forthright approach and therefore knows exactly what you mean. However, today you have a chance to clear up previous assumptions that may have created bad feelings between you and a friend. The deeper you dig, the more uncomfortable the dialogue becomes, but the more joy you will feel once it's all been said."
gemini,2013-04-16,"It may be challenging to tell if you were misled or if you actually contributed to setting up the misunderstanding that now needs to be ironed out. Others might take action based upon misguided information if they don't know your point of view. Don't be overly dramatic as you confront the situation. Your integrity is at stake, so be as clear as possible in all forms of communication. Speaking your truth succinctly is your best strategy."
cancer,2013-04-16,"You may be thinking about past events in your life when your feelings were hurt, and these memories bring you all the way back to your early childhood. Now, as you remember these thoughts, you might see things in your mind's eye. Although this emotional process could be difficult, your own healing can begin once you forgive those involved ... including yourself."
leo,2013-04-16,"You're feeling more secure as you settle into a reflective emotional posture today. Watch the current drama unfold because it's better now to be a spectator than a player. Nevertheless, your position is still tricky. You know there are things that you should say, but you don't want to hurt anyone in the process. Honesty is the best policy as long as you remember to be kind in your delivery."
virgo,2013-04-16,"It's no simple task to keep boundaries between reality and your fantasies today -- and you might take a while to sort it all out. One way to get your mind off your inner dilemma is to be more involved with other people now. Your best bet is to seek out activities with good friends who you share a common interest with to help you focus your attention on something new. Widening your social circles not only brings more joy to your life, but ultimately helps you gain clarity on your dreams."
libra,2013-04-16,"You might decide that it's not in your best interest to express every emotion today, but don't use this train of thought as an excuse to avoid your feelings. If you close off your heart, you could end up being controlled by your fears instead of by love. Even in the workplace, you can be torn between the safety of rational thought and the vulnerability of sharing your needs. Logic may create security, but it won't bring complete satisfaction."
scorpio,2013-04-16,"You have more stability now than you realize, even if you feel as if you are lost in a deep fog. The thicker the mists, the more you must rely on your intuition to figure out what is hidden in the clouds. Surround yourself with caring friends because they can give you the support that you need. Maintain your direction by using others as your inspiration today. Incorporating someone else's vision into your own helps you find the way to clarity."
sagittarius,2013-04-16,"Today you might recall the sacrifices others made for you at various times in your life. Or, maybe you're currently feeling vulnerable because someone isn't giving you what you need emotionally. Don't sweep your pain under the rug -- you can choose to explore how your feelings get hurt in relationships with family members, spouses or lovers. But then make certain to share your process with a trusted ally so that the healing transformation can take root. Opening your heart makes room for love."
capricorn,2013-04-16,"If a close friend or business associate rains on your parade today, look at it as a test rather than a setback. Ask yourself if you're willing to continue on your course regardless of the bad weather. If you believe in yourself, a storm -- or someone's negative attitude -- won't slow you down from reaching your destination. Express your truth, even if it requires additional effort on your part to wear raingear and carry an umbrella."
aquarius,2013-04-16,You might actively seek ways to avoid a confrontation at work ... especially if a particular issue has really been bothering you lately. Perhaps someone said something that put you off and you didn't tell him or her how it made you feel. The details don't matter as much as you think; and it's wise to talk about subjects that raise complications. Solving the relationship puzzle ultimately can reestablish a deeper connection.
pisces,2013-04-16,"It may be time to start thinking about an escape plan if you can't fit yourself neatly into the relationship that you've created. However, a worthy partner will surely be able to stretch and grow in order to allow for your needs, and ideally, would be happy to encourage your individuality. And although today isn't necessarily a significant day for making decisions, it offers important clues as to how you are doing and which direction you are leaning. Initiating an honest dialogue can stabilize your life and put you back on track faster than you expect."
aries,2013-04-17,"Crash! Bam! Kapow! You are feeling empowered now that your planet, Mars the Warrior, is lined up with the brilliant Sun. However, you may try to impose your will on everyone around you due to your exuberance. Be aware that your energy level is exceedingly high today and others might not be as engaged as you are in life. Petty ego disputes can lead to unnecessary conflict which would be a total waste of this planetary boost; use this powerful momentum to push toward greater accomplishments, instead."
taurus,2013-04-17,"Unexpressed emotions are currently being stirred and confronting them may bring up old unresolved feelings of anger. You are usually down to earth and have a common-sense attitude toward life. But today you might be mixing up memories from your childhood with current circumstances, making it more difficult to manage the situation. Being aware of the differences between then and now can free you from repeating old patterns once again."
gemini,2013-04-17,"You are likely to share your thoughts on a regular basis -- either verbally or in writing. Usually, you can say what you want and be done with it. But it may be more difficult now to separate your ideas and opinions from your identity. Unfortunately, you might end up being too aggressive in your own defense if you're overly attached to your position. Moderate your extreme emotions by acknowledging that others also have valid thoughts to bring to the table. Listen more than you talk and everything will work out fine."
cancer,2013-04-17,"Sometimes it's easier to express your annoyance by not saying anything at all. Crabs can retreat so far into their shell that no one on the outside can establish communication with them. This passive-aggressive tendency tempts you to withdraw from interpersonal interactions today. The problem with this strategy is that your anger doesn't go away -- in fact, it continues to hurt and eventually turns to resentment. Seek ways to gently express your feelings without going silent."
leo,2013-04-17,"The hyperactive Sun-Mars conjunction highlights your 9th House of Big Ideas. A little spark can start a fire in your belly that grows hotter throughout the day, driving you to pursue your adventurous dreams. However, you might grow restless if you're unable to break free from previous commitments. Nevertheless, it's critical to find healthy ways to burn off your excess energy today or you may get drawn into a needless fight. Exploring all your options now increases your chances for success."
virgo,2013-04-17,"You might feel irritable today and yet you can't put your finger on the source of your malaise. There may be hidden issues cooking in the minds of your friends now, and it's to your advantage to get them to talk about their secrets. However, others could misread your intent if you ask too many pointed questions. Ultimately, it's your insecurity that could exacerbate the problem. Setting your ego aside and expressing your willingness to listen makes all the difference in the world."
libra,2013-04-17,"There's some powerful energy coming your way today. However, the question is whether or not you can acknowledge it and put it to good use. If you are unable to ride the creative waves, you may take your frustration out on a friend by overstating your anger. However, if you find a way to integrate the intensity, you could come alive with amazing ideas. Be open to the potential of new ideas as your originality runs strong now. Draw your inspiration from the deepest wells in the most unexpected places."
scorpio,2013-04-17,"Your professional ambitions are riding high today. You are driven to accomplish more than normal now, yet this excessive behavior poses some danger. You may inadvertently create conflict with others in your quest to achieve your objectives. Remember that your happiness doesn't have to come at the expense of anyone else. Even if your ego is telling you otherwise, there is plenty of room for multiple winners. The more the merrier when it comes to success."
sagittarius,2013-04-17,"Today's planetary patterns bring a mixture of messages. The good news is that your high energy level is off the charts now. You're feeling invincible and think that you can do whatever needs to be done. Although you are outwardly optimistic, the bad news is that you might realize there's something you forgot. Keep revisiting recent events to uncover the missing clue. Don't give up ... you can find it if you just believe."
capricorn,2013-04-17,"One of your ongoing concerns is how to drive yourself along toward your goals without pushing others too hard. If you act too forceful, you'll feel the negative consequences as someone backs away from you. Your passion is hot right now -- maybe even too hot. Use your moral compass to keep yourself in line. You don't have to put out your internal fire ... you just have to find a constructive outlet for your irrepressible energy."
aquarius,2013-04-17,"The unique situation that is unfolding now may take various paths, depending on your current relationship status. If you have functional partners, you can work together to make something special happen. But if there is discord present, tensions could rise to the surface. Some conflicts are resolved immediately, while others take longer to fix. However, some topics just create a reason to argue or fight. Practicing compromise can be tricky, but it is exactly what's called for at this time."
pisces,2013-04-17,"If you are experiencing any health problems these days, this is a smart time to think about what you can do to improve your physicality. Take responsibility for your own body, but don't just rush off to another doctor looking for the latest amazing cure. Instead of trying to discover a magical fix, make changes in your diet and lifestyle that positively impact your well-being. Set yourself up for success by starting with small but significant improvements and build from there as you begin to see results."
aries,2013-04-18,"The excitement begins to smooth out today, but this isn't a permanent shift of energy. Although calmer sailing may be part of your immediate forecast, the fiery Leo Moon still energizes you because she harmonizes with assertive Aries. Even if you're eager for more action, catch your breath while you can. Making the time to recharge your batteries now enables you to be ready for the adventure around the next corner."
taurus,2013-04-18,"You wish you could reveal your innermost desires today as Venus in your sensual sign aligns with idealistic Neptune. However, you might have a tough time putting your feelings into words. Don't give up ... your determination empowers you to disclose something you normally would keep to yourself. You've been worrying about one particular secret long enough. Sharing it with a close friend may be the catalyst to allowing you to let go and move on."
gemini,2013-04-18,"It's not your thoughts that matter the most today ... but what's in your heart. Nevertheless, you still might need to hear those magical words of acknowledgment from someone special. A simple act of kindness can mean a lot to you now, especially if your insecurity has recently developed a life of its own. Ironically, expressing your affection helps you to get through this uncertain time. Remember, love is like music that soothes the savage beast inside you."
cancer,2013-04-18,"You continue to be highly motivated in your career and are driven to figure out your life purpose. You're easier to get along with if you are in touch with your imagination today because it's an important source of your happiness. However, it's challenging to keep your dreams alive when you're so distracted by all the events at work. Creating balance between your inner and outer worlds makes it easier to thrive in both of them."
leo,2013-04-18,"You may not understand what others are trying to tell you today. And, if they are judging you harshly, you probably won't even hear a word they say. You might turn the volume of your expression up so high that you're not conscious of any incoming information at all. Concentrate on cultivating greater self-awareness and you'll naturally grow more considerate of others. Your willingness to examine tough issues now is the key to becoming a better friend."
virgo,2013-04-18,"Someone might be working against you, but it's difficult to get to the source of the apparent negativity. Thankfully, this isn't a long-lasting situation and you should be able to resolve the problem without turning it into a major crisis. Instead of succumbing to fear and trying to uncover the facts, change the game by focusing on your best-case scenario. Your idealism now goes further toward dissipating the resistance than a more combative strategy."
libra,2013-04-18,"You may be pleasantly surprised by how a close friend or partner responds when you express your feelings now. This isn't about accommodating others by saying what you think they want to hear; just share exactly what's in your heart. Even if you're worried about the uncertainties ahead, let someone you trust know what's going on for you. This personal disclosure can initiate a discussion that paves the way for increased intimacy."
scorpio,2013-04-18,"You may focus your intense feelings on a single person or one particular situation if you obsess about a specific goal. You might want to employ your creative imagination to propel your life in a new direction, but everything seems to unfold too slowly. Even if you're still unsure of your next move, fix what's broken before rushing into your future."
sagittarius,2013-04-18,"By midday you're ready to trot, even if you're still stuck in the starting gate. You may try to make the most of your precious time, but you really don't want to wait much longer. You are eager to be living your adventure and creating your future right now, but you must be gentle with yourself. Your unresolved feelings need a bit more time to process before you can push them forward. Taking the scenic route still allows you to reach your destination in plenty of time."
capricorn,2013-04-18,"You can overcome your sense of self-limitation by ignoring the facts for a while today, especially since your current resistance stems from childhood fears. Eventually, you may have to look at these old hurts with a brand new perspective that motivates you to keep moving forward with less self-restraint. Nevertheless, don't go charging ahead just yet. For now, be methodical and take it one step at a time until you know where you want to go."
aquarius,2013-04-18,"It's difficult to contain your enthusiasm these days since it feels like anything is possible. In fact, you're so excitable now that it's nearly impossible to focus on the work in front of you. Others may demand that you move quickly, and although you don't need extra time to decide what you want to do, you don't particularly enjoy the pressure. Instead of overreacting, take a deep breath before you unconsciously push back too hard. Channeling your enthusiasm into a positive cause is the best revenge and sets a good example at the same time."
pisces,2013-04-18,"It's tricky to find the right starting point today ... making your day somewhat complicated to manage. It feels as if the whimsical breezes of your imagination are blowing you around and you cannot stabilize your thinking. You might believe that the current solution is to talk about your feelings. Unfortunately, the more you say now, the less clear everything becomes. Instead, practice being quiet in your mind. Your mental stillness opens the door for positive change."
aries,2013-04-19,"Although you may be feeling quite optimistic today, you probably won't want to play by the rules of the game. You have a preferred outcome in your mind's eye and can justify nearly any behavior that brings you closer to your goal. Unfortunately, karma isn't as forgiving as you wish and could teach you a harsh lesson if you step too far out of line. Play it safe -- there's no reason to court unnecessary trouble now."
taurus,2013-04-19,"You may be acting as if you know exactly what you're doing today, yet you're probably less certain than others as you try to smooth out a domestic relationship. Although you might wish you could ignore the problems and let them sort themselves out, it's wiser to share your opinion anyhow. But don't pretend that your solution is the only one. Being flexible is a smarter strategy than being right."
gemini,2013-04-19,"You could find yourself deeply involved in a conversation about global issues with a coworker today. Unfortunately, you might become angry if someone tries to shut you up because of your unpopular position on climate change, the world economy or international politics. It's not worth trying to win an argument; more talking now only increases a misunderstanding. Agree to disagree and come back to the debate another time after everyone's cooled off."
cancer,2013-04-19,"Although you might have a wonderful time sharing your feelings with someone special, his or her response could be less enthusiastic than you expect. Everything might seem pleasant enough at first, but be on the lookout for suppressed issues lurking just beneath the surface. Instead of shutting down emotionally because you're afraid of rejection, speak from your heart without worrying about the reaction you receive. Remain open to what others say without trying to read between the lines."
leo,2013-04-19,"The Moon returns to your sign for her monthly visit today, urging you to let your feelings flow without rational restraint. Although it's wise to explore several possible emotional responses to your current situation, don't fixate on any one of them. It's okay to be uncertain as long as you assume responsibility for your changing moods. However, everything runs smoother when you take other people's needs into serious consideration, too."
virgo,2013-04-19,"You're often recognized as a hard worker because you typically do what you've promised, but it may be time to let some of your chores slide. Cash in your sick pay and take a wellness day, instead. Rather than visiting the doctor, try traveling to the far reaches of your own imagination by losing yourself in a movie or book. Even if you can't get any time off from work today, do something that is outside of the box in which you normally contain yourself."
libra,2013-04-19,"It's easy to confuse friendship with love today when the heartfelt Leo Moon visits your 11th House of Social Networking. All types of relationships are highlighted, but some can be a source of extra uncertainty. Be careful when talking about your desires because it may be tempting to step over the line and say something you'll later regret. It's better to err on the side of caution now because you can always speak your truth later on if it still matters."
scorpio,2013-04-19,You're simultaneously pulled in different directions now. One part of you needs to hide away from all social obligations and just chill out. But another voice reminds you of how much fun you could have with other people. You can even create the meaning you seek while enjoying yourself this evening. Pick your playmates judiciously so you have the best of both worlds at your disposal.
sagittarius,2013-04-19,"Your future appears exceptionally inviting now, which is saying a lot because you Archers are naturally optimistic. But you should be skeptical since your vision can be misleading and you may unwittingly be part of a conspiracy to fool yourself. Don't try to sell others on a hair-brained scheme or it could quickly come back to bite you. Enjoy yourself, but don't take your ideas so seriously."
capricorn,2013-04-19,"Although your feet are planted on the ground, you may be sticking your head into the unknown now ... which could ultimately pull the rug out from under you. Yes, this kind of sudden change can even happen to you sure-footed Goats, especially when you climb too high up on the mountain. You might enjoy the exploration today, but don't lose your bearings. You'll be back to your earthbound perspective soon enough so enjoy the view while you can."
aquarius,2013-04-19,"If anyone comes to you with a grandiose idea today, be aware that there are more red flags than you currently see. Ironically, the plan might actually work. However, it still could appear better than it really is. Take off your rose-colored glasses before making any major decisions and look at each opportunity through the most practical lens you can find."
pisces,2013-04-19,"Although you have many chores to finish up today, your fantasies may be more captivating than reality. You could end up disappointed, even if your dreams are fulfilled. However, if you work efficiently and meet your responsibilities quickly, your day can still be as magical as you wish. No matter what, don't allow yourself to become overwhelmed by the myriad of details. Just attend to them as swiftly as you can and then get back to whatever fills your spirit with fire."
aries,2013-04-20,"You really don't want to wait for others to catch up with you because yesterday's anticipation has turned into today's impatience. Although practicing self-restraint would ultimately work in your favor, quicksilver Mercury joins unpredictable Uranus in your sign ... prompting you to announce that you're ready to take the next step right away. Thankfully, your bark may be bigger than your bite. Sit tight for a few more days; taking the additional time to fine-tune your strategy greatly increases your chances for success."
taurus,2013-04-20,"You prefer to make a plan and stick to it, but now you're likely to change your mind at the very last minute. You could receive an invitation to a social event that you might normally consider skipping. However, you're eager for new experiences today and may agree to participate in festivities that are outside of your comfort zone. Enjoy the change of pace without having to justify any of your decisions."
gemini,2013-04-20,"Your key planet, Mercury, hooks up with brilliant Uranus in your 11th House of Dreams ... provoking you to think about your future in a whole new light. You're suddenly inspired to head off in an entirely different direction. But instead of completely tossing aside your previous plan, demonstrate your true genius by applying your innovative insights toward your established goals. Minimizing disruption now prevents complications from hijacking your day."
cancer,2013-04-20,"You may feel anxious now because it's difficult to stop thinking about the plethora of possible paths in front of you. There's so much going on within your head that you can't filter through all the noise to hear what's really being said. However, the mental distractions can be a lot of fun if you're willing to engage others in a playful manner. Trusting that your life is on track enables you to let go of control and fully enjoy each moment as it comes."
leo,2013-04-20,"You probably think that your friends are acting weird today when they speak without considering the consequences of their words. Previously supportive allies could let you down because their indecisiveness leaves you in a difficult position. There's no need to feel desperate now, so don't overreact and lose your temper. Taking an unnecessary risk may not be as wise as it seems -- be smart and concentrate on becoming more self-sufficient."
virgo,2013-04-20,"You're itching to experiment with unconventional methods today, but a friend or partner may resist your efforts. Some of your outrageous ideas lead you on wild goose chases, but one brilliant thought might result in a real breakthrough now. Unfortunately, you cannot be certain that your plan will work until you test it, which could take quite a bit of time and energy. Thankfully, you don't have to invent a better mousetrap because you can feel fulfilled by simply being more unorthodox in your approach to your daily routine."
libra,2013-04-20,"You don't want any discord in your life, but believing that everything is perfect today could leave you feeling detached from reality. It may appear like everyone is having a lovely time, but this is not the entire picture now as anger lurks beneath a tranquil surface. It might be your turn to stir things up for a change. Don't be afraid to express what you're thinking. There's no reason to say everything the same way you did yesterday as long as you remain kind."
scorpio,2013-04-20,"Finally, you're able to get back to the research that you recently had to set aside. Your mind is like a sharply honed razor today and your intuition is working like a finely tuned sonar. Don't settle for traditional methods to locate the information you seek. Trust your inner voice, but don't overreact to what you learn now. Although an extraordinary breakthrough can be temporarily unsettling, you'll gain a sharper perspective on your future over the days ahead."
sagittarius,2013-04-20,"Others often want to play with you because they know that you are usually up for an adventure. Although you're looking forward to having fun, you may still find it difficult to kick back and relax as high-frequency static interferes with your senses today. It's not easy to let down your guard now if you are also worrying about more serious global issues. Moderate your intensity by balancing the political picture with your individual needs so you can celebrate in the present moment."
capricorn,2013-04-20,"You know that something significant is happening, yet you're distracted by weird ideas that you can't get out of your head. It's easy to slip into an obsessive pattern by resisting the stream of radical thoughts that flow through your mind. But struggling against the mental currents is futile now and only amplifies the noise. Stop fighting with yourself and enjoy the ride, even if you are afraid of being too impractical. You can experience a new sense of freedom by simply letting go."
aquarius,2013-04-20,Inventive ideas are popping into your consciousness so fast that you may not be able to keep up with them. Your originality soars now as your key planet electric Uranus connects with clever Mercury. Don't be overly concerned if loose ends are unraveling all over the place. Coloring outside of the lines is a symptom of your wild inspiration. You will have plenty of time in the next few weeks to clean up the mess and polish your plans.
pisces,2013-04-20,"Today's ingenious Mercury-Uranus conjunction strikes in your 2nd House of Resources, but it's challenging to make practical use of your current brilliance. Nevertheless, new concepts wake you up in such a way that you begin to see everything in a different light. But don't expect anyone else to rush in and support your unconventional plans right away. Your allies will come around to appreciate your point of view once they see lasting results."
aries,2013-04-21,"Secrets may be revealed today, changing the dynamics between you and a loved one. However, this surprising disclosure could create an uneasy awkwardness as the unexpected information is digested. Don't worry ... the initial shock will fade as you become realistic about what's ahead. Don't make a fuss about what you learn. Everyone will likely feel better once the energy has stabilized and the truth is out in the open."
taurus,2013-04-21,"A friend or coworker may share an intriguing scheme with you today. Your initial impulse is to avoid getting involved, especially if the plan is too unconventional. Fearful stubbornness doesn't have to be your default position just because you are uncomfortable with the idea of change. But don't let your immediate reaction stand in the way of a brilliant opportunity, even if it seems crazy. There's no harm in taking a closer look."
gemini,2013-04-21,"It seems as if others expect you to solve every problem that crops up today, but you could be distracted by a larger issue that you would also rather avoid. Nevertheless, don't attempt to talk your way out of your responsibilities. Instead, honestly share your valid concerns with everyone involved. After you have come clean, you will be more receptive to carrying out your duties without further resistance. Clearing the air turns the dynamics in a positive direction."
cancer,2013-04-21,"You're longing for a change to your regular routine, making it tough to settle down today and fulfill your obligations. Nevertheless, it's wise to let things evolve in their own time without forcing a resolution to an issue just because you think it will make you feel better. The current situation won't likely unfold according to your agenda anyhow, so it makes more sense to stay flexible."
leo,2013-04-21,"Deeply rooted emotions can have an immediate impact on your day because of an unexpected disclosure from someone close to you. Although listening makes good sense, you may not realize the consequences of truly hearing their words. If a poignant memory is stirred, don't attempt to stuff it back into your past. Integrating a significant recollection into your present perspective is a healthy antidote to what ails you."
virgo,2013-04-21,"You want to express your changing moods now that the Moon is back in your sign, even if your feelings don't conform to other people's expectations. You may become less popular by giving voice to what everyone already knows, but it's time to drag the truth out into the open. Thankfully, you won't be judged harshly for being honest. Ultimately, others will thank you for your courage to reveal what's in your heart."
libra,2013-04-21,There is no way to foresee the intense issues that might come up today if someone shares an amazing story with you. You need to have an open mind to understand the surprising information you may hear or you won't be able to intelligently respond to the exciting situation. Let go of your preconceived assumptions and embrace the unexpected if you want to pursue this opportunity for all it's worth.
scorpio,2013-04-21,"Your schedule could fall apart today like a house of cards, especially if you attempt to squeeze too much into one day. An unexpected addition to your to-do list can create a cascade of problems and turn your Sunday routine upside down. Instead of attempting to do everything, allow the day to unfold organically. Surprisingly, you will still get a lot accomplished even if you relinquish some control. Releasing your expectations early in the day allows you to relax and maintain a positive attitude."
sagittarius,2013-04-21,"You could be extremely creative now if you don't try too hard -- and inspiration can strike when you least expect it. Give yourself the gift of a midday excursion, such as a break to play video games or a casual telephone conversation with a friend. But don't be surprised if a great idea pops into your head in the midst of your little escape. An indirect route might be the most interesting and productive one today."
capricorn,2013-04-21,"It's a perfect day to take some time for yourself, even if you still have other obligations to manage. However, the daily grind has to come to a stop for a while so you can recharge your batteries. Ironically, you might not want to relax for long. Working on a project that is near and dear to your heart can be more revitalizing than taking a nap. The easy way out may be fine for others, but you'll feel better at the end of the day if you have something to show for your efforts."
aquarius,2013-04-21,"A highly charged emotional atmosphere could make you overly anxious. There may be too much happening in your immediate environment and there seems to be little you can do to turn it down. Forget about gaining control over your life now ... it's a smarter strategy to acknowledge the intense issues instead of trying to avoid them. Ultimately, you will be much happier if you don't waste energy attempting to change that which cannot be changed and fix only what you can."
pisces,2013-04-21,"You may be required to pick up an unexpected expense today, whether it's a surprise repair bill or an impulsive purchase. But stepping outside your budget now could temporarily wreak havoc on your finances. On the other hand, you might get lucky and receive a cash windfall. Either way, your financial situation isn't as stable as you thought. No matter what happens, do your best to take it in stride and keep your spending within reason. Hopefully, things should settle down by midweek."
aries,2013-04-22,"In the mythical race between the tortoise and the hare, you are surely the speedy rabbit that races ahead to achieve an early advantage. However, you can beat the game by role-playing the part of the steady tortoise that continues to plod along. If you don't slow yourself down to a sustainable pace, circumstances just might do it for you. Ironically, you may be pleasantly surprised by reaching your goal sooner than you expect if you take your time. Remember, this is a marathon and not a sprint."
taurus,2013-04-22,"You sense someone's emotional reserve today, making it difficult to feel the love that may be hiding just beneath the surface. If you think you've been rejected, just let the situation sit for a while. If you push harder, your behavior could validate your worst fears. But thankfully, acting with patient acceptance can warm everyone up slowly. As long as you don't try too hard to get others to like you now, they probably will come around to appreciate your point of view."
gemini,2013-04-22,"This can be a frustrating day because you keep bumping into invisible obstacles. Reality may be giving you a hard time now, especially if you recently overextended yourself. Slow down and take life more seriously for a few days. Consider what you need rather than what you want. But don't be disappointed if you aren't immediately successful ... because good things come to those who wait."
cancer,2013-04-22,"It's challenging to get people to see your point of view today as needy Venus opposes somber Saturn in your 5th House of Self-Expression. Your associates might think that you're all work and no play, but you just want reassurance of their loyalty. You may still have a few difficult issues to deal with before you're willing to let go of your fear and insecurity. Don't be satisfied with a quick fix -- set long-term goals instead."
leo,2013-04-22,"Your emotional pain isn't visible to others now because you resist wearing it on your sleeve. However, there's really nothing to gain by hiding your feelings. It's not a valid reason to withdraw just because something isn't working out according to your preference. Use this time to contemplate the lessons you have learned and what you might need to change in order to reach your goals. Cool your heels and allow time for the passion to return before deciding what to do next."
virgo,2013-04-22,"Logically, you know that your current shift of feelings is probably in your best interest. If a hot romance has recently turned into a more practical arrangement, it's okay. The passion isn't necessarily gone; it's simply transforming into a more stable energy that can withstand the test of time. Avoid the temptation to retreat into your shell. Instead of building a perfect relationship on your fantasies, make a commitment to creating real love that lasts."
libra,2013-04-22,"You are naturally attracted to the idea of beauty, but oftentimes your tastes are less than practical. Aesthetic perfection can be nearly impossible to manifest in the real world. But today you are drawn toward simpler pleasures. Make a concrete plan to move toward whatever brings you joy and then execute it step by step."
scorpio,2013-04-22,"You might suddenly realize that you've taken on too much emotional responsibility today. You are tired and don't feel up to being everything for everyone, although others may expect more from you. Acknowledge the limitations of your time instead of exhausting yourself. Take care of your own needs first or you won't have anything left over to give to anyone else. Even if you can't break away for very long, schedule a relaxing escape such as a massage or a movie just for you."
sagittarius,2013-04-22,"You are subdued by the walls of resistance you face at work now, and may feel frustrated that you can't just change your attitude. Although you often respond to a difficult situation with optimism, you might not be able to find a positive voice today. Don't struggle with your moods; instead, acknowledge the weight of it all without trying to change anything. It's healthy to take life seriously since your realism can spur you on to work harder and make changes necessary for your happiness."
capricorn,2013-04-22,"There shouldn't be any emotional surprises today because you are aware of your current expectations and how they contributed to your disappointment. Thankfully, while some people panic in times of a minor crisis, you can survey the situation and then quickly get to work making things better. Minimizing your own desires now enables you to take care of the larger problem at hand. Temporarily set aside your personal needs ... you'll get what you want sooner than you think."
aquarius,2013-04-22,"Your unexpressed desires tug on your psyche, but don't let them pull you off course. It's your turn to be responsible now instead of running off to join the party. Naturally, you would rather be enjoying yourself, but thankfully your self-restraint will be rewarded. Unfortunately, if you forget about your obligations, an unfriendly reminder could snap your attention back to where it should be. Fortunately, taking care of business first frees you up to have even more fun later on."
pisces,2013-04-22,"You aren't as spontaneous now as others expect. Or, you could be feeling the complete opposite. Either way, you may feel isolated from the mainstream of lighthearted fun and games. Don't waste energy pretending to be something you're not. Follow your heart and act exactly the way you feel. Others will appreciate your integrity in the long run."
aries,2013-04-23,"It's a mistake to believe that others will take your words at face value today, no matter how clearly you express yourself. In fact, you could share more than is necessary ... which dilutes your message and creates a situation where you are misunderstood. Oddly enough, you make your point most effectively now if you don't say anything at all."
taurus,2013-04-23,"You have taken the necessary time to organize your ideas so you can say exactly what you mean. However, also make certain that you mean what you say. Go ahead and contact the person you have been thinking about lately, since you are quite persuasive today. Stick to the unadulterated facts for the best response. Don't retreat; push steadily forward while the planets are working in your favor."
gemini,2013-04-23,"It's tough to find a work pace that you can sustain these days. Although you're doing better than you think, your perceptions may be out of whack. Concentrate on slowing down enough to continue your forward movement without burning out or running over anyone else. There are still exciting challenges and opportunities ahead, so conserve some mental energy for later on when you might need it most."
cancer,2013-04-23,"Emotional tensions might bring a minor conflict to a head today. Unfortunately, you may feel as if there is too much chaos for you to keep it all together. Nevertheless, it could be premature to discuss the details of your plans for the future. Try working your way into the subject by sharing a few thoughts about your long-term goals. Hopefully, this disclosure can open a path to a much-needed conversation about your feelings."
leo,2013-04-23,"Your dreams contain the seeds of your future and it's smart to pay careful attention to what they are telling you now. If you listen to the clues, you might crystallize a simple, yet elegant plan that could save the day. Don't hold back ... lay everything out in the open. Even inhibited thoughts from your imagination have significant impact today."
virgo,2013-04-23,"Talking about your core values may be easier today than integrating them into your daily routine. Powerful ideas pop into awareness now, but the strategy required to reach your goals might remain elusive. Although it can be quite challenging to align your actions with your intentions, don't be afraid to discuss your goals with someone you trust. Sharing what's most important to you is a critical first step to making your dreams come true."
libra,2013-04-23,"You are absorbing information from everyone around you these days. It's as if you're wearing an idea antenna and the signals keep coming your way. Activating your listening skills is always a wise move, but it may be easier to receive the data than it is to do anything concrete with it. Integrate theoretical thinking with the practical realm. If you can combine the real and the ideal, then you'll be able to apply what you learn to reach your goals."
scorpio,2013-04-23,"Your daydreams may reveal a vision that sends you on an amazing journey of the mind. You might be quite excited by your thoughts now as you do your metaphysical traveling. However, it's confusing if people miss the significant subtleties of your message when you share your ideas. Keep it simple. The more you talk, the less they understand. However, writing your dreams down in a journal helps you to create a fascinating map for the future."
sagittarius,2013-04-23,"Your ideas continue to grow by leaps and bounds today. Even if you attempt to maintain a healthy perspective, everyone seems to like what you are saying so much that you're encouraged to share more. You could set out to send a short email now, yet end up writing a philosophical treatise. It's fine to expound on your theories, but be certain to bring them back down to ground level where they can have the most impact."
capricorn,2013-04-23,"Although it's encouraging when others reflect what you want to hear, you might miss the critical feedback you really need. Similarly, you may be torn between telling the truth and saying the right thing that can get you what you want. You must face the consequences of having an unpopular point of view if you dare to be honest. Nevertheless, you'll feel happier if you remain true to your own vision and speak from your heart."
aquarius,2013-04-23,"Sticking to the facts might help you reach your goals, but this strategy won't be easy to follow today. You are so eager that you may unwittingly alter the truth to match your preconceived beliefs. Positive opinions can be very convincing when they appear to come from hard data. Be careful; you won't be as persuasive if you try to mold reality to fit your philosophy. The truth will set you free."
pisces,2013-04-23,"You may be caught in the heat of conflicting perspectives within a close relationship today. You have to face reality to get through the dilemma, and even if it's temporarily unpleasant, walking through the fire is ultimately for the best. Thankfully, you can work through nearly any disagreement as long as you stay true to your values. A heartfelt discussion brings you joy, but you must be prepared to engage in serious dialogue first."
aries,2013-04-24,"You may be eager to move on to your next experience, but you can gain more today by staying with one feeling for a longer period of time. A whole new reality opens as you tune in to the world that exists beyond the obvious distractions. Even if you are scared of what may happen, pushing through your fears can bring love closer to you now."
taurus,2013-04-24,"You want more than you have now and your non-negotiable determination could actually bring you the goodies you seek. However, keep in mind that there is a fine line between patience and stubbornness. If you put too much pressure on someone, you might inadvertently stir up a hornet's nest instead of building a love nest. Expressing your desires with a little flexibility can create a big impact on your immediate happiness."
gemini,2013-04-24,"You can deepen a love interest now by using your wit and charm as long as you don't sidestep your feelings in the process. The key is making others more comfortable with the emotional intensity. It's a tricky balancing act ... if you are too lighthearted today, you may lose the potential power of the moment. However, holding on to your agenda while changing your approach could be an unbeatable combination."
cancer,2013-04-24,"Acting on your feelings can result in a successful power play at work and gain you new respect at the same time. Just be careful not to push your luck because your friends and allies could resist your plan if you arouse their anger. Once negativity enters the equation, you may be required to waste valuable resources dealing with an unnecessary drama. Fortunately, sharing control at the right time isn't as difficult as it sounds and is one way of firming up your support."
leo,2013-04-24,"Lighthearted flirting can turn very serious today, so don't send out the vibe unless you are willing to put the muscle of your heart behind your romantic gestures. On the other hand, revitalizing a long-term relationship may be just as easy as starting up a new one. Remember that if the feelings get hot, you won't be able to cool the passion down as quickly as you fired it up. It's all good if both of you are on the same page ... but don't trifle with anyone's heart."
virgo,2013-04-24,"Unexpressed feelings intensify a relationship in ways you might try to avoid, yet the outcome could be more fruitful than you expect. Control issues may surface today, especially as family memories are activated by current circumstances. Keep in mind that your fears are more problematic than what's actually occurring now. Taking a risk and sharing your desires with someone special can result in a memorable experience."
libra,2013-04-24,"Potent Pluto and your key planet, Venus, hook up today to emphasize the best parts of any type of relationship. Even a casual interaction with a co-worker can lift your spirits. Still, pleasure won't come without good intentions and hard work ... desire is simply not enough. Be brave and share your feelings to start the ball rolling in the right direction. You might be happily surprised where the conversation takes you."
scorpio,2013-04-24,"Your key planet, Pluto, is on the receiving end of a delicious buzz from sweet Venus, motivating you to take a risk in love without being overly attached to the outcome. Expressing the feelings in your heart can be easier now if you are willing to go along for an emotional ride ... no matter where it goes. But others might have a different agenda from yours. Rise to the occasion and shift your focus from personal satisfaction to global compassion. Choosing the high road benefits everyone you touch."
sagittarius,2013-04-24,"You are blessed with a natural ability to shine your love light into the darkness, creating a more meaningful place without necessarily appearing overly serious. Still, there are heavy matters weighing you down now and you should take them to heart. Rest assured that your actions can begin to resolve the emotional tensions of the past few weeks. Adopting a positive attitude is the first step toward lightening your load."
capricorn,2013-04-24,"Although you're probably feeling passionate about your emotional attachments today, you might be reluctant to share them with your friends. Unfortunately, resistance to expressing your needs may reveal that you're not ready to open up. Even if you want to remain strong, showing vulnerability can clearly telegraph your availability to someone special. Take a chance and make sure your message is received."
aquarius,2013-04-24,"You might want to keep a professional relationship to strictly business, but the unexpected opportunity to share your feelings is intriguing. Naturally, it's crucial to respect appropriate boundaries, yet you still can let the other person know what's going on in your inner world. Making a genuine heart connection  strengthens the bond of friendship in amazing ways."
pisces,2013-04-24,"You may grow obsessed about purchasing a piece of jewelry, furniture or an item of clothing today. A burning desire to own something beautiful can lead you to compulsive behavior now, whether or not you actually acquire it. Keep in mind that this attraction could simply be a reflection of your growing sense of self-worth. Acknowledging the substantial value you bring to the table is worth more than anything money can buy."
aries,2013-04-25,"In theory, it's all very simple with three planets in steady Taurus, but in practice, relationships are more complicated than you prefer. Today's Full Moon Eclipse falls in your 8th House of Deep Sharing, requiring you to acknowledge facts and feelings that you previously missed. Even if your life is running smoothly now, you might not rest until you have stirred up the complexity you secretly want. Thankfully, being aware of your unconscious motivations can be enough to prevent things from going awry."
taurus,2013-04-25,"You may feel as if someone is testing you today as the Scorpio Lunar Eclipse stresses your 7th House of Partners. Fortunately, the current shift of energy will help to settle the dynamics of a relationship back down into a more manageable state of affairs. But first you must let go of your preconceived ideas and move willingly outside of your comfort zone or you could be pushed along kicking and screaming. You might just receive the support you want once you stop resisting change."
gemini,2013-04-25,"If new responsibilities are piling up, you might reach a breaking point today. Perhaps your routine has become too unpredictable to manage and you're not willing to put up with the chaos any longer. The Scorpio Full Moon is eclipsed in your 6th House of Work, indicating an unexpected change that could clear the air of frustration. Nevertheless, letting others know what you need is a good start, as long as you're not outrageous in your demands."
cancer,2013-04-25,"Nostalgically longing for the past won't help your current problems now. Although your life may seem too complicated these days, changing your schedule won't help. Instead, show up with integrity in the present moment. Today's Scorpio Lunar Eclipse shakes up the energy of your 5th House of Self-Expression. Don't worry that you might fall short of the mark ... share what you are feeling without any expectations at all."
leo,2013-04-25,"You might feel as if you're being stretched as far as you can go now. Unfortunately, there probably isn't a quick resolution to the stress in your life if professional and personal needs are pulling from different directions. Thankfully, things are about to change. Today's Scorpio Full Moon Eclipse rattles your 4th House of Foundations, indicating that you can ride this energetic shift successfully if you attend to your career activities while also making time for home and family."
virgo,2013-04-25,"You realize that change is in the air, but you cannot tell how your current plans will be affected -- and this makes you slightly uncomfortable. Falling back on your daily routines doesn't take enough pressure off the current situation now that the unsettling Scorpio Eclipse lands in your 3rd House of Immediate Environment. You might have to bring up a sensitive subject today, but your willingness to initiate a logical conversation is the catalyst for the transformation you are seeking."
libra,2013-04-25,"Although Libras are sometimes known for their ability to be wishy-washy, you won't have a lot of trouble making up your mind today. You can't afford to buy into this weak generalization about the ambivalence of the Scales. The pointed Scorpio Full Moon Eclipse polarizes your 2nd House of Values now, so take a position in your life based upon what's most important to you. Don't compromise your integrity for the sake of temporary convenience or to please anyone else."
scorpio,2013-04-25,"The Full Moon Eclipse is in your sign, making you more sensitive to the pushing and pulling of cosmic forces now. Your smartest strategy is to practice being your own witness. Embrace your emotions, but reserve a part of your awareness to also observe what you are feeling. Pay close attention to your reactions so you can learn from what's going on, rather than being blown around by the winds of circumstance. Instead of acting on impulse, hold steady in the storm."
sagittarius,2013-04-25,"Although you might not understand what's happening, something wonderful may be unfolding in your life. However, growth is often painful, especially with the Full Moon eclipsing your 12th House of Destiny. Unconscious motivations are pushing you in directions that aren't obvious to you. If you feel like everything is out of control, make a conscious decision to roll with the waves of change for a few days. You may be happily surprised with where you end up."
capricorn,2013-04-25,"So many things seem up in the air and there doesn't appear to be much you can do to bring them back down to earth. You want to take responsibility for your future dreams with today's Lunar Eclipse activating your 11th House of Long-Term Goals. But struggling with basic issues now isn't a sign of failure. In fact, letting go at the right time could be an act of grace. Living more spontaneously is the key to making the most of every single moment."
aquarius,2013-04-25,"Others are depending upon you now, even if you don't fully accept that you can depend on yourself. It isn't that you lack confidence ... it's just that you feel as if you're in over your head today. Thankfully, a Full Moon Eclipse in your 10th House of Responsibility could force you to be clear about your limits of time and resources. Once you establish a realistic scope of what's possible, get busy and deliver on your promises."
pisces,2013-04-25,"Sometimes your imagination helps you see things more clearly than others, yet this can be a burden because it isn't always easy to explain. However, you must describe what you are seeing now in ways that everyone understands, even if your intuition is more important than the facts. Today's Lunar Eclipse is like a lighthouse shining in your 9th House of Higher Truth, putting you in touch with your vision of the future. Do what you must to remain visible to as many people as possible."
aries,2013-04-26,"You might not bother to control your impulses today because you don't want to take the time to consider the consequences of your actions. Luckily, you can still manifest your dreams since your key planet Mars aligns with visionary Neptune. However, people may think that your behavior is immature if you just rush ahead with your agenda. Your ideas have a positive impact on others if you allow enough time to develop your plans a single step at a time."
taurus,2013-04-26,"Your coworkers and friends have a lot to tell you today, but you might wish you could ignore their advice and do it your way. However, you can benefit from the feedback you receive now while the Moon visits your 7th House of Partners. You must pay extra careful attention to be certain that what you hear is actually what is being said. It's tempting to drift off into a daydream, so validate your interpretation to make sure you really understand the message."
gemini,2013-04-26,"Responding confidently to a coworker's inquiries today won't prove that you actually know what you're doing. Thankfully, you're able to learn on the fly so quickly that it appears as if you're traveling on familiar ground. Nevertheless, it's smarter to tread with caution because a risky strategy can catch you in your own cleverness. Being able to think on your feet is a blessing as long as you don't try to fake your expertise. There's no shame in admitting that you don't have all the answers."
cancer,2013-04-26,"Your fears are quickly fading as your sense of certainty grows stronger now. However, make sure that your new-found confidence doesn't arrive at the cost of avoiding the facts. Although nearly everything seems to be on the up and up today ... ignorance isn't bliss. It's much healthier to be well acquainted with the truth, even if it temporarily complicates your life."
leo,2013-04-26,"A colleague might misinterpret something you say today, potentially tangling a web of intrigue and misunderstanding. The situation becomes doubly difficult if you don't realize that there's a problem before it's too late. It's wise to deal with the situation before others become involved. Remember that you don't need the chaos and confusion. But it's even more intelligent to consistently communicate carefully so there's no break from reality in the first place."
virgo,2013-04-26,"Although you normally require clean facts and clear communications, surrealistic Neptune in your 7th House of Partners is activated now by impulsive Mars to compromise the precision of your words and lure others into your dreams. It becomes highly challenging to control where your reality ends and the illusion begins. Don't jump to any quick conclusions today and make certain that you don't lose anyone along the way."
libra,2013-04-26,"You might feel less emotional now that the moody Moon has entered your 2nd House of Self-Worth, shifting the focus from who you are to what you have. Nevertheless, you still have unresolved stress to handle. Thankfully, everything should take a turn for the better today and you can daydream your way through the afternoon. Keep in mind that the beauty you perceive ""out there"" is actually a reflection of what you have within your own heart."
scorpio,2013-04-26,"You're probably relieved by the lifting of the heavy energy now that the Moon is freed from yesterday's chains of Saturn. Fortunately, whatever was impeding your progress begins to fade away, but don't assume that you can reach your goals overnight. Deceptive Neptune could trick you into believing that your destination is much closer than it actually is in reality. Nevertheless, holding a vision in your mind's eye enables you to successfully stay on track until your journey's done."
sagittarius,2013-04-26,"Everything at work continues to improve, yet you're still unable to turn an opportunity into something that can make a real difference in your life. Although a number of significant pieces are falling into place now, they don't quite fit together as easily as they should. Relax your approach and allow the events to unfold as they will, rather than forcing them to adhere to your schedule. Magically, you'll make real progress when you become one with the larger flow."
capricorn,2013-04-26,"It may be challenging to see any real purpose to idle daydreams, yet you can't turn off the switch to your fantasies as easily as you wish. You might attempt to overcompensate for your active imagination by acting in an overly practical manner. However, giving yourself permission to drift away from reality for a while could lead you to discover some very worthwhile ideas."
aquarius,2013-04-26,"Acknowledging everyone's needs grows tiring now, so it's wise to conserve your energy by establishing clear boundaries. Unfortunately, your strategy may grow problematic when you realize that you might want to change your mind along the way. Remember, arbitrary rules have the potential to limit your interactions. Don't attempt to blame your inconsistencies on others ... simply accept your contradictions and get on with whatever is next."
pisces,2013-04-26,"You may feel as if you have reached a point of balance between concrete career objectives and your spiritual life path. These two divergent roads intersect now, creating a magical moment when your hopes and dreams have a more lasting impact on your world. Make the most of your current metaphysical connections by trusting your intuition to steer you in the right direction."
aries,2013-04-27,"Your positive attitude overcomes a persistent obstacle that was in your way. Unfortunately, this wave of optimism may not bring the specific results quickly enough for you, so be patient if you're not making much progress today. Even if you're ready for something different, stay with what you've started for a while longer to give yourself the best chance for success."
taurus,2013-04-27,"You may be feeling uneasy now, and even a bit restless. Although you can usually make the best of any situation, you might lose interest in the dreams of your future if your fantasies aren't supported by the present circumstances. Give yourself permission to explore all possibilities, but don't confuse your thoughts with reality. Luckily, you should have more clarity about your long-term direction within a couple of days."
gemini,2013-04-27,"Your perspective on a personal issue might be very different from someone close to you today. Paradoxically, you're both probably working with identical sets of information. But don't get discouraged about this disagreement ... honest discussion may prove fruitful now. Thankfully, your flexible attitude enables you to get what you want, as long as you don't give up too soon."
cancer,2013-04-27,"You may have big ideas about routine work today, so it's crucial to maintain a realistic perspective on life. Open your heart and widen your vision to ease the tension on a specific situation. If you are caught up in a web of emotions, remember that your life is not as extreme as it seems. Taking little steps can create enough positive movement to give you the hope you need."
leo,2013-04-27,"Today can be an ideal day to fall in love with a helpful person or you may be attracted to an optimistic spiritual teaching. Either way, your fantasies could transform into reality now, but you need to give your dreams a creative nudge forward. Be daring and take a risk. If you don't make your move quickly, you'll never know what you might have missed."
virgo,2013-04-27,"Today's confident Sagittarius Moon encourages you to think in a holistic manner without having to take extreme measures. Still, this is unlike your normal tendency to focus on the details and create a concrete plan. You might work yourself into an anxious state as your mind jumps back and forth from the very big to the very little. If you are pulled off course, take a deep breath and get yourself back on track for the week ahead."
libra,2013-04-27,"You might feel a bit scattered today with the changeable Moon visiting your 3rd House of Communications. There's so much happening everywhere you turn that interactions may be distracting. Fortunately, they can also be fun. Don't waste energy attempting to quiet the day down to a comfortable level. Instead, go along for the ride and enjoy yourself while it lasts."
scorpio,2013-04-27,"You can use today's optimistic Sagittarius Moon to better your personal finances as she visits your 2nd House of Money. Fortunately, you have the necessary courage now to face issues that you have previously put off. However, too much confidence also makes serious problems seem less troublesome. Don't just avoid bad news by glossing over details. Instead, fire up a bit of your famous Scorpio intensity and jump directly into your chores before it's too late."
sagittarius,2013-04-27,"Your shifting moods could get the best of you now that the evocative Moon is back in your sign. However, you can also learn a very important lesson today if you are willing to stop running around and simply delve into your heart. Oftentimes it's more natural to philosophize or intellectualize your emotions. Nevertheless, it's time to explore your feelings without being overwhelmed by them."
capricorn,2013-04-27,"You are often the most sensible person around because you keep your feet planted on the ground while planning how to reach the top of the mountain. However, today you may be looking for an escape route as the intensity of your fantasies increases. Don't be overly concerned, for you won't lose your sense of reality. Give yourself permission to sink into your irrational dreams. You just might return with valuable wisdom that you can put to good use."
aquarius,2013-04-27,"Your positive attitude prevents you from losing perspective as you gracefully handle nearly all problems that surface now. Optimism may abound, but it isn't only about you. Everywhere you turn, people seem to be more encouraging and supportive. Do whatever you can to feel the love, since your current actions set the stage for the days ahead."
pisces,2013-04-27,"You may be approached by a co-worker for your advice or help today, yet your plan might not go as you imagine even if you have the best of intentions. Listen carefully to what others expect from you. Don't promise more than you can deliver just to avoid conflict. Establish your boundaries and everything could work out better than you expect. The sooner you get the discussion started, the better off you'll be."
aries,2013-04-28,"Time may appear to be running slowly today as everything seems to take longer than expected. You adopt a serious attitude this morning, especially if you must overcome an obstacle that catches you off guard. There's no time to complain about your bad luck or try to shift the blame to anyone else. You are being taught an important lesson now and the sooner you learn it, the quicker you can move on."
taurus,2013-04-28,"Your attempts to restore balance in a relationship may be thwarted today, especially if you think you can take the easy way out. Seriously consider what others say before rejecting a new perspective just because it's inconvenient. Rather than demonstrating how stubborn you are, graciously accept whatever situations arise now. Temporarily responding to the changing circumstances without resistance could turn a challenging moment into a pleasure-packed day."
gemini,2013-04-28,"Serving others today can bring you more contentment than you expect, even if your own needs remain unfulfilled. Someone's selfish behavior may upset you now, prompting you to resist doing anything nice. Nevertheless, overcoming petty annoyances is your best strategy because you won't be happy with yourself unless you take the high road. Giving someone the benefit of the doubt enables them to return the favor."
cancer,2013-04-28,"It's challenging to control your cravings for pleasure today, especially if you have worked hard and believe you now deserve some time off to replenish your energy. There is nothing wrong with pursuing happiness as long as you don't overdo it. Set aside a specific time to nurture your soul as well as your physical senses. Working your own needs into your schedule is the first step toward balancing your responsibilities with your desire to have fun."
leo,2013-04-28,"Maintaining an even keel on the home front can be an annoying struggle today, especially if someone is tempting you with the potential of a great party or some other fun-filled distraction. You might see everything through a very expansive filter now, but don't jump too quickly just because something sounds good. These are serious times and you could court unnecessary problems if you don't keep your balance."
virgo,2013-04-28,"You might kick your day off with the best of intentions by aiming to be methodical about accomplishing your goals. But as the day wears on, you could become increasingly lackadaisical and fall farther behind until you just give up. Don't be overly self-judgmental if you find yourself on the short end of the stick. Give yourself the gift of some additional time off without comparing your actual production to your high ideals."
libra,2013-04-28,"It's not helpful if you're indecisive about spending money today. Stick to your budget or you could find yourself in a difficult cash position sooner than you might expect. Conserving resources is the smartest thing you can do now ... since it's very easy to talk yourself into buying something you don't really need. If you have any uncertainty at all about a purchase, delay it for a few days and see how you feel about it then."
scorpio,2013-04-28,"Interactions with others may be strained today as the stubborn Taurus Sun opposes cautious Saturn from the 7th House of Partners. You might think the smartest solution is to withdraw from social activities ... yet keep in mind that retreat doesn't have to be an all-or-nothing decision. Don't pretend that everything is okay if it's not, since your evasive tactics will be more apparent than you suspect. Be truthful when discussing subjects of significance but don't say more than is necessary."
sagittarius,2013-04-28,"A religious or spiritual retreat can offer you much-needed peace today, but you must be committed to follow through with your practices if they are to have a long-lasting positive impact. You have a strong need for self-expression now that the Moon is moving through your sign, and rationalizing what you do might be difficult. Remember, it's not important to follow tradition or to explain why you are not doing so. Instead, seek your own path to enlightenment and stick to it."
capricorn,2013-04-28,"Determine what you should be doing today by concentrating on where you want to end up. Unfortunately, you might be drawn toward different activities. No matter what, it's crucial to achieve some balance between your immediate need for variety in your daily life and your long-term goals. Just be sure your dreams are truly yours and not the wishes of a parent, spouse or boss. The only person who can live your life is you."
aquarius,2013-04-28,"Your current sense of social responsibility is strong, yet you may be looking for a loophole in an agreement you previously made. It's not that you're ready to default on your commitments now ... it's just that if there's an honorable way out, you might take it. For all the time and energy this tactic could waste, you're better off meeting your previous obligations without trying to renegotiate the deal."
pisces,2013-04-28,"The Sun's opposition to stern Saturn in your 9th House of Philosophy encourages you to rationalize your actions with authoritarian ideas. But instead of wasting time justifying old patterns, you're better off using your mind to explore new metaphysical territory. The negative consequences of your current propensity toward over-intellectualization can be minimized by emphasizing practical solutions over idle theory."
aries,2013-04-29,"You are tempted to take a chance today, even if the odds of winning are not in your favor. It feels as if the wheel is still spinning, yet you're ready to play the game as long as there is even a remote possibility of a positive outcome. Nevertheless, your logic can raise doubts, making you less eager to blindly trust your intuition. Watch the signs carefully ... if you encounter resistance, don't be so eager to take a risk."
taurus,2013-04-29,"You may settle into a stubborn frame of mind and others won't easily convince you that your course of action isn't the smartest choice. Nevertheless, you feel as if you are coming to your senses now and are quite comfortable with your decision. Although your no-nonsense attitude will likely get you through the day, you could land in trouble if you don't pay attention to the more subtle influences at play. Just make sure to keep an open mind today when listening to someone you trust."
gemini,2013-04-29,"It's a long and winding road, but you can sense a payoff just around the next corner. Still, you must hold it together and keep moving until your well-earned recognition arrives. Be aware that everything may not turn out quite as sweet as you prefer, but you should begin to see positive results soon enough if you have done your work. Ultimately, the real reward is in the journey itself."
cancer,2013-04-29,"You wish you could run away from your busy schedule, but today may not be a great day for relaxation. Even if you want to take some time off for yourself, you might feel too responsible to kick back and do nothing. Unfortunately, the result is that you speed up when you should be slowing down. Instead of reacting unconsciously, explore creative strategies to add more balance to your life."
leo,2013-04-29,"Others can see your growing optimism now, but you don't necessarily feel as positive as you appear. You might be afraid that you can't sustain the momentum needed to get you over the next hump. You may be growing tired, but there is still so much to be done. Nevertheless, today is like halftime at a ballgame ... it's fun as long as you don't take things too seriously. Step off the playing field and take time to refuel before jumping back into the game."
virgo,2013-04-29,"Taking things one step at a time motivates you to get a lot accomplished. Even if what you produce today isn't crucial, you can still see what's left to do. Your glass may seem half empty rather than half full now. But don't get too discouraged, for the tides will turn if you can focus on what's right in front of you while maintaining a positive attitude about the big picture."
libra,2013-04-29,"Life can be quite stressful if too many demands are made of you today. Naturally, you want everyone to be happy, but reality doesn't always measure up to your ideals. You may be struggling to find a path through an obstacle course of confusion now, and it's hard to maintain the right pace. Make adjustments often until you discover one that works. But be ready to change your direction again without judging yourself. Finding a healthy balance between honoring your needs and fulfilling the desires of others is your real challenge."
scorpio,2013-04-29,"Your clear communication skills enable you to make quite a favorable impression on others. But you might find that an emotional drama is difficult to handle today because your words can increase your vulnerability. However, the solution is not to remain silent. Stand up to your own fears and share what's in your heart without any expectations. Let the conversation unfold without forcing it to go anywhere in particular."
sagittarius,2013-04-29,"Your unshakable confidence can pull you out of a difficult situation today, causing others to be motivated by your words and deeds. However, you may be hard-pressed these days to find the right thing to say. Don't hide your uncertainty by overcompensating and pretending that you have all the answers. Instead, just be your authentic self and you will be appreciated for being who you are rather than for what you do."
capricorn,2013-04-29,"Don't avoid current events by retreating into your own little world today since it's not an effective strategy. However, with the Moon's presence in your sign you need to get back in touch with your feelings ... and the best way to do this is to find time to be alone. Walk away from the computer and turn off the TV while you meditate, pray or write in your journal. Taking a short break to make contact with your inner authority allows you to be fully present in the moment."
aquarius,2013-04-29,"You might feel as if you need a break today because your emotional tension continues to build. However, you may be physically restless and it's fine to be active as long as you know when to stop. Giving yourself permission to drop into the fantasy realms for a while can help you relax, but don't linger there too long. You have plenty to do and you'll feel better once you return to your chores and channel your energy effectively."
pisces,2013-04-29,"It's challenging to get a realistic handle on your day because unforeseen changes seem to come in waves of positive and negative energy. You continue to be pulled between two extremes and may not be able to distinguish which direction you want to go. Fortunately, you don't really need to know yet. For now, just let your emotions carry you back and forth and observe your reactions. Once the turbulence settles, your heart will know which way to go."
aries,2013-04-30,"You don't want to wait any longer for your creative project to take off. Although it might feel as if you're going to explode, it could help to ease the pressure if you express some of your bottled-up energy. Unfortunately, talking it out may not help. Physical activity is your best bet now; if you don't go to the gym, at least take a good walk today. You can be more productive at work once you've let off some steam."
taurus,2013-04-30,"There's no need to let your anger get the best of you today, even if you feel stuck in a relationship with a tough boss or controlling partner. Instead of fighting to hold your position, practice compassion by trying to understand someone else's plight. Don't over-personalize the resistance you face. Shifting your focus from your individual desires to the needs of others enables you to walk away with your integrity intact."
gemini,2013-04-30,"Your drive to express your true inner nature is stronger today than your need to be clever. Still, you may feel thwarted by your own fear. You might be too quick to defer to someone else's authority now. However, your best strategy is persistence ... so don't give up even if you believe that accepting it is the easy way out. Look at your resistance as an opportunity to strengthen your overall plan. Holding your ground improves your chances of reaching your goal."
cancer,2013-04-30,"You might feel as if you have been tested long enough, but unfortunately the challenge is not yet over. Quitting prematurely is not advised because you stand to gain a lot if you can stick to your current position without retreating. Don't allow your self-confidence to waver or you could get sidetracked by your lack of certainty. Continue to lean steadily into the winds of change to fill your sails and obtain the smoothest forward motion."
leo,2013-04-30,"You may be so busy at work today that you are pulled away from handling an important family issue. Although you need to fulfill your professional commitments, don't use your job to avoid a difficult situation at home. If something from the past surfaces at this time, make time to deal with it once and for all. Anything you ignore now will only come back at a later date to haunt you."
virgo,2013-04-30,"It's possible that you have bitten off more than you can chew and reality is demanding that you meet all of your responsibilities. The frustration is that your energy is stretched too thin and you cannot complete everything in a timely manner. Thankfully, you have plenty of physical stamina and won't be easily discouraged. Adopting a positive attitude alone won't accomplish your work, but it sure helps to motivate you along the way."
libra,2013-04-30,"Your boss or some other authority figure could prevent you from making real progress today. You might not understand why your forward motion is being thwarted. Oddly enough, it could even feel like you have been set up by someone pulling you into a battle you cannot win. Your secret weapons are your imagination and determination. Taking charge and changing the rules of the game just may be your best way out."
scorpio,2013-04-30,"You have recently been riding a positive wave of energy, but today it might seem as if you don't have anything left to give. Unfortunately, it may not be that easy to walk away from your current obligations because you don't want to let anyone down. Instead of trying to impress someone who has authority over you, just work quietly and do your best. You'll be recognized for your hard work and dedication when it matters most."
sagittarius,2013-04-30,"Other people's demands on your time can make you weary now because you don't feel like your actions are enough to satisfy anyone ... no matter how much you do. This energetic dilemma could leave you feeling empty and frustrated unless you consciously shift your focus. Instead of trying to please someone else, set realistic goals for yourself and then do whatever is needed to achieve them."
capricorn,2013-04-30,"If one more person asks you to do something else today, you might just toss in the towel and quit. It's not that you're irresponsible ... it's just that you've had enough heaped upon you already. Instead of getting angry, channel your annoyance and negativity into a productive venture. There's really no time for complaining now because you have so much work to do. Thankfully, you can experience a wonderful sense of relief once it's all finished."
aquarius,2013-04-30,"The weight of your judgments is heavy enough now to motivate you to alter your daily routine. You're in a good position to evaluate your recent decisions, as long as you're flexible enough to leave additional room for change. Don't fence yourself in before you have had a chance to remember what it's like to breathe deeply in the wide open spaces."
pisces,2013-04-30,"You may feel very strongly about what you want to do with your time today, but it's smarter to rein in your personal desires and do what's expected of you. If you attempt to deviate from the plan, an awkward situation could quickly develop, teaching you a karmic lesson the hard way. Be careful because making progress isn't quite as simple as it seems. For now, it's better to be safe than sorry."
aries,2013-05-01,"You feel invincible now, believing you can overcome nearly anything that stands in your way. However, it's important to use the current emotional wave of power in an unselfish manner. Your ambition could backfire on you if you try to acquire too much personal gain out of the situation. Nevertheless, you're still able to reach your initial goals if you respect other people's needs, too."
taurus,2013-05-01,"It's more important than ever to embrace your energy, both physically and emotionally. If you feel stuck today, do whatever you can to propel yourself into motion. You may feel quite motivated, yet unsure about how to put yourself on the right track. Although this strategy might seem backward, don't wait until you've figured it out. Get started first; once you're making progress, things will fall into place faster than you expect."
gemini,2013-05-01,"Even those people who are usually admirers of your light and easy style will want more depth and intensity from you now. This penchant for a deeper experience comes at the perfect time, since you aren't in the mood to entertain others with your clever repartee. Instead, you're also looking for spiritual meaning, and others can come to your aid with the insightful perspective that you seek."
cancer,2013-05-01,"An emotional drama in your life reaches a turning point today as the evocative Moon forms a dynamic square to the Sun. It appears as if a major crisis is brewing, but behind the obvious dilemma presented by your expectations, you're certain about what you need to do. Even if you keep some of your feelings to yourself, exert your will while you have the opportunity to be the most effective. You don't have to play all your cards in order to make something positive happen."
leo,2013-05-01,"It may not be that easy to reach a decision today because one solution won't likely address all the needs that are now being expressed. Although someone might ask you for emotional support, you are tempted to pull back in an effort to handle your own affairs. However, make certain that you are acting for the greater good of everyone involved when setting your priorities. It might take some extra effort on your part, but you have the ingenuity and determination to come up with the answers."
virgo,2013-05-01,"You have an unrelenting desire to make deeply-rooted changes now. However, your current interest isn't about anything to do with your regular daily routine. Instead, you may feel passionate about transforming your entire life, including your personal needs and those of others in your immediate environment. Remember, taking everyone's feelings into consideration today will produce the most profound changes."
libra,2013-05-01,"Like an intense bolt of lightning out of the clear blue sky, something can happen that alters the direction of the path you're on. Your epiphany may not be a total life-changer, but it does open the possibility to make a shift that you've been putting off for too long. Downplaying your experience invites unwanted surprises. You'll run into less resistance if you act authentically with the same level of intensity that you're feeling."
scorpio,2013-05-01,"Your key planet, Pluto, is harmonizing with the Sun today, showing you an easier path to expressing your innermost thoughts and feelings. At some other time, you might encounter obstacles created by other people's fears or your own secretive nature. But for now the way is clear of negativity. Focus your attention on the truth while keeping your heart as wide open as you can. You may be pleasantly surprised where this emotional journey takes you."
sagittarius,2013-05-01,"You dream of flying through the galaxy at warp speed, except there's a more cautious part of you still worrying about what you might need to leave behind now. This current sentimentality isn't your typical reaction, but it's a good idea to give full power to whatever feelings of uncertainty you may be experiencing. The sooner you face your fear, the faster you can resume your cosmic adventure. Believing in yourself is the first big step."
capricorn,2013-05-01,"An inner battle overflows into the outer world today ... whether or not you're ready for the extra drama. You're confronted by the feelings of others and how they might alter the direction you thought you were taking. Think about your plans again, and this time include the feedback you receive in your new strategy. Not only will you gain the respect of those who matter, you'll also be able to make fundamental changes that move you closer to your goals."
aquarius,2013-05-01,"Your current dilemma involves the pull between wanting to be spontaneous and the need to withhold your feelings. You want to say exactly what's on your mind today, but might worry that you could offend someone if you speak the truth. Ultimately, you're driven toward expression, but not without experiencing some stress first. Remember, your true friends want the real you, not some watered-down version that is diluted to maintain social acceptance. Follow your heart and don't look back."
pisces,2013-05-01,"You are swimming in deep waters now -- so deep that sunlight doesn't easily reach you and the bright colors have faded into darker shades of gray. Don't get distracted by the otherworldly nature; it comes along with the territory. You have powerful work to do, so face your fears and shine your inner light into the darkness. Slowly return to the surface only when you are ready to reengage. Happily, your friends will be waiting for you with open arms."
aries,2013-05-02,"Getting together with friends or working as part of a team sounds like a good idea today with the Moon occupying your 11th House of Social Networking. However, you don't like it so much when others boss you around you without even asking for your input. You're not excited about living up to someone else's expectations and you might go overboard when telling them off now. Don't waste your energy being angry. Be smart and spend your time with those who support you the most."
taurus,2013-05-02,"You might feel obligated to nurture your coworkers now that the Moon is visiting your 10th House of Career. But you're not interested in babying someone who should be able to hold up his or her part of the bargain. You believe your opinion is correct and you're not likely to change your mind even if someone asks you to reconsider. Be open to discussing differing perspectives instead of going silent and resisting change. Remember, there is more than one way to interpret reality."
gemini,2013-05-02,"Normally, adaptability is one of your strengths, but today the notion of changing your plans for someone else's benefit rubs you the wrong way. It's difficult to get into the flow of the day because you have a particular idea about how things should go, yet they keep deviating from your agenda and pulling you off course. Even if you must modify your approach now, don't lose sight of your final destination. It's possible to have a singular goal with a variety of roads that will land you there, no matter which you choose."
cancer,2013-05-02,"The idea of exploring your emotions today with someone you trust sounds good at first. But differences of style or substance may have you questioning the wisdom of sharing what's in your heart. Even if you feel vulnerable, keep an open mind about where the process will ultimately take you. Don't get your hopes so high that you'll be disappointed no matter how well things turn out. However, your willingness to interact honestly can deepen a relationship in a surprising way."
leo,2013-05-02,"Unconscious motivations drive your ambitions to new heights today with four planets moving through your 10th House of Status. However, someone close to you may not be willing to play your game, and this wild card threatens your success. Attempts to control an independent person could be a study in frustration now, so go ahead with your plans on your own, if necessary. Believing in yourself empowers you to reach your goal even without the support of others."
virgo,2013-05-02,"You may approach your job in a totally unique manner today. Although you're quite certain your method will work, others might not share your confidence. In fact, they will resist your efforts if their goals are different than yours. Thankfully, your coworkers are likely to change their minds and join your team if they see that you're making progress on your own. Doing it your way is fine as long as you remain open to accepting assistance when it arrives."
libra,2013-05-02,You may be feeling a creative buzz today from the eccentric Aquarius Moon activating your 5th House of Self-Expression. But your mind isn't focused on the work at hand; instead you're busy imagining the distant future or visualizing a far-off land. Don't be too hard on yourself if you're unable to accomplish your goals on a practical level now. Sometimes exploring your dreams is just what the doctor ordered.
scorpio,2013-05-02,"You have plenty of data to substantiate your conclusions today, but not everyone buys your story. Someone may rub you the wrong way because of his or her refusal to acknowledge the truth. Unfortunately, logic won't convince anyone that you're right. Your actions will ultimately speak louder than all your facts and figures combined. Just make sure you don't fall victim to the same fate as your opponent by refusing to listen to a different perspective. The healthiest position is attained by keeping your mind open."
sagittarius,2013-05-02,"Although you might wake up on the wrong side of the bed today, a conversation with the right person quickly improves your attitude. You may be skeptical at first, but people can inspire you with their stories and excite you with their plans for the future. You're willing to work hard if you can see the potential rewards, but you're more likely to put your money on a sure thing now, rather than a risky venture. Don't be afraid to jump into someone else's game if you're invited."
capricorn,2013-05-02,"You may be weary of the recent emotionally stormy weather, but the sky begins to clear today and your life seems to be looking up. However, you can't just declare that everything is getting better and then hope it does because your rational mind isn't running the show now. Instead, imagine your ideal future and then start walking toward it. Manifesting your best-case scenario is possible if you have faith in yourself and still believe in magic."
aquarius,2013-05-02,"It's challenging to maintain your normally cool demeanor today because irrational emotions keep bubbling up into awareness. Even if your feelings grow more positive throughout the day, you naturally prefer a more intellectual approach. However, the evocative Moon is traveling through your sign now, and applying logic isn't useful when managing your changing moods. Instead of trying to explain what you need, wait and see where you end up when you let your desires carry you along for a little while."
pisces,2013-05-02,"The non-conformist Aquarius Moon stimulates your 12th House of Spirituality, highlighting your comfort with the metaphysical realms. Meanwhile, an otherworldly connection between philosophical Jupiter and surreal Neptune calls in the mists of illusion, preventing you from seeing things as they truly are. Don't push your dreams away now because you stand to gain new inspiration from your imagination as long as you don't confuse it with reality."
aries,2013-05-03,"Unrealistic hopes about the weekend could bring disappointment today when you realize that you waited too long to make something special happen. But instead of moping around if your plans fall through, find a way to enjoy your own company instead. Using the quiet time to recharge your batteries enables you to accomplish more in the days ahead."
taurus,2013-05-03,"The Moon's shift into your 11th House of Long-Term Goals inspires you to fantasize about your future. However, planning ahead may not be as useful as it sounds, especially if there are situations that require your attention in the present moment. Thankfully, you can be responsive to what's happening right now while also envisioning what's next if you keep your dreams to yourself until your chores are finished. You can let your imagination out to play over the weekend."
gemini,2013-05-03,"Although your workweek might be coming to an end, your current concerns about your career will continue to linger through the weekend. However, it's challenging to turn your worries into a concrete plan today because trickster Mercury is confused by surreal Neptune. Don't be too hard on yourself if you can't logically figure out your best move. Dream about your changing role at work without taking any action yet. The first steps toward transformation occur in your imagination."
cancer,2013-05-03,"You might think that today is a good day to make plans for a getaway -- perhaps even for this weekend. Unfortunately, there may not be enough time to get everything together for such a quick trip. But don't waste energy on being disappointed ... consider your current efforts to be a reconnaissance mission instead. Use your imagination to conjure up a variety of options without focusing on the details yet. Give it a few days and then begin to make your dreams come true."
leo,2013-05-03,"Although it appears that you are determined to succeed in your career, there are other issues beginning to distract you from your work. Fortunately, you have the weekend to pursue less material ambitions, including the exploration of your dreams, the expression of your feelings and the pursuit of happiness. This new emphasis on your inner journey can bring spiritual meaning to your life. Just remember to honor your previous commitments along the way."
virgo,2013-05-03,"You may be growing tired of your daily work routine and are already looking forward to spending more time with your family, friends or partner. But don't forget to let others know your desires as soon as possible or they might make other plans. It's better to iron out the details in advance so you don't run into disappointment later on. Sharing your hopes starts the ball rolling and paves the way to a memorable weekend."
libra,2013-05-03,"Demonstrating your originality is more important to you earlier in the day while the Moon is still visiting non-conformist Aquarius. But her shift into your 6th House of Service this afternoon reminds you that your compassionate behavior can positively impact others. Thankfully, putting someone at ease with your actions or your words also has a calming effect on you. Shine your light by performing random acts of kindness. Practicing this kind of enlightened selfishness benefits everyone involved."
scorpio,2013-05-03,"You might need to work hard this morning, leaving little room for you to retreat into your inner world. However, if you settle down and concentrate on the tasks at hand, you may be rewarded later in the day with time to pursue an activity for the sake of pleasure alone. Whether you choose to spend time on a hobby, participate in a sport, or just get together with a friend, you can find true satisfaction by expressing yourself in the moment without having to justify your actions to anyone else."
sagittarius,2013-05-03,"If you feel like you've been relentlessly on the go lately, you might actually get to slow down today and have time to smell the roses. Your friends and family may be worried about you if you choose to retreat from social activities, since their expectations could be based on their observations that you're not having fun. However, if you believe a bit of solitude is what you need now, there's no need to waste time defending your choice. Soaking in the sounds of nature is one simple remedy for nurturing your soul."
capricorn,2013-05-03,"It's tempting to obsess about your job now, especially if the taste of material success spurs you on. But subtle changes in your mood lead you away from a productive path today and lure you on to a scenic highway. Others notice your transformation as your energy lightens and a smile replaces your stoic businesslike demeanor. You've been working hard and deserve a bit of guilt-free playtime. Be nice to yourself and start your weekend early if you can."
aquarius,2013-05-03,"You may be unclear as to how your current efforts will translate into additional income, but your faith could be your greatest source of motivation. Ironically, you might derive tangible benefits from pursuing your dreams now. But it's not just about making money ... even if real rewards elude you, following a whim today replenishes your emotional well and revitalizes your soul."
pisces,2013-05-03,"You might try to bury your feelings today, but they will eventually escape from behind whatever walls you create to hide them. The Moon's return to boundless Pisces provokes the flow of emotions. Talk about your needs and your fantasies with someone who understands you. Sharing your visions of the future, however unformed they are, is the next step to making your dreams come true."
aries,2013-05-04,"Complicated dynamics in a relationship might have you wondering if achieving your goal is really possible. You might even declare defeat before you start, but this is not a wise course of action. Instead of blaming your difficulties on anyone else, take responsibility for your feelings and do something constructive about them now. Once you accept that you have something important to offer others, it will be easier to overcome your own internal resistance and swing into motion."
taurus,2013-05-04,"You may be feeling self-centered today with four planets traveling through your 1st House of Personality. However, you could attract situations that require you to act responsibly if you're too concerned with taking care of your own needs. Don't be so stubborn that you're blind to what's really happening. Expand your frame of reference by shifting your attention from yourself to others. Luckily, engaging with the outer world helps you restore balance to your life."
gemini,2013-05-04,"There's nothing wrong with wanting some more time to yourself, but you might be too busy today to fully enjoy any real downtime. Others may be making demands on your time and withdrawing could create more problems than it solves. Nevertheless, no one can prevent you from taking secret flights of fantasies while you're meeting your obligations. Keep your feelings to yourself and make the best of being able to travel in both worlds now."
cancer,2013-05-04,"You don't mind talking about serious things with someone you really like but it may grow tiring today if others act like you're doing something wrong. You don't take criticism easily and are tempted to end a conversation if you feel that you're on the wrong end of the stick. However, you could learn an important lesson about yourself now if you're willing to listen to the feedback you receive and then do something about it. A bit of emotional discomfort is worth it if it leads to a real breakthrough."
leo,2013-05-04,"There's nothing to be gained today by avoiding a serious conversation about your duties at home. You might think you can just go on with your day as previously imagined, but you won't be able to feel free if you're worried about running away from your obligations. Your smartest strategy is to face the music early in the day and readjust your plans as needed. You probably won't have as much time to play yet you'll end up liking yourself more for acting in a responsible manner."
virgo,2013-05-04,"Although you are happiest when there is some reliable structure to your day, you could go too far and micromanage your schedule. But over-planning sets you up for failure now instead of making you feel more secure; if one activity falls behind, the rest of the day suffers accordingly. Demonstrate your practicality and leave plenty of free time between events today to ensure that your calendar doesn't fall apart. It's easier to be flexible when you trust that everything will turn out okay."
libra,2013-05-04,"You might attempt to distract yourself from a serious romantic or financial issue today by acting very busy. You could bury yourself in details to show others that you're taking care of business, but your priorities may require reconsideration. Get back to basics and strengthen your foundation rather than wasting your energy on appearances. Work smarter instead of harder."
scorpio,2013-05-04,"Your weekend of creative expression continues, but the voice of reason might need to call you back to handle a mundane chore that's still unfinished. Unfortunately, the reminder may arrive through an acquaintance that seems to come down on you harder than necessary. You don't need to hear the criticism ... you know what's wrong and you're already working to improve the situation. Nevertheless, it never hurts to listen for the nugget of truth in what you're being told."
sagittarius,2013-05-04,"Although you might like to indulge in a day of relaxation, there's probably too much on your plate now to ignore. But it won't help if you try and do everything all at once so you can be done with your work. Running off in several directions isn't efficient, even if there are many unfinished chores on your plate. Instead, scale back your efforts. It's better to do a few things right than a lot of things haphazardly. Slowing down allows you to enjoy yourself in the process and ensures a higher quality result."
capricorn,2013-05-04,"You know what needs to be done and you have trouble understanding those who choose to walk out on a responsibility for the sake of seeking fun. Unfortunately, letting them know that what they're doing is wrong only compounds the problem. Your friends and family won't likely take your criticism well today, especially if you sound self-righteous. Soften your judgments and loosen the reins of control. Others will learn their lessons quicker when they have the room to make mistakes on their own."
aquarius,2013-05-04,"You are King of the hill today -- at least in your own mind. Others might question or even challenge your authority, especially if you attempt to establish your dominance. Give up your pretensions and your sense of entitlement ... the best way to end up on top now is alongside everyone else. Lead by being an outstanding participant in the community instead of telling anyone else what to do."
pisces,2013-05-04,"You expect to be taken seriously by your cohorts today, but your moodiness may get in the way. Although you want those close to you to know what you're feeling, your position is weakened when you deviate from the facts. Save your dramas for another day. Choose your words carefully and only talk about what's real. An emotional or spiritual discussion will have a more meaningful impact tomorrow."
aries,2013-05-05,"People probably get out of your way today because they can tell that messing with you isn't a smart idea. They may even worry that you'll overreact to make your position absolutely clear. However, you don't want to expend energy just to explain your point of view to everyone. Thankfully, you have enough clout to be taken seriously now, so simply declare your boundaries and then move on. Sorting out your priorities enables you to achieve your goals in record time."
taurus,2013-05-05,"You may feel invincible today as you gain momentum and strive to reach your goals. You might not have physical superpowers, but your sheer determination can be so strong and your energy so raw that obstacles dissipate as you approach them. However, overconfidence could lead to trouble now since there's still plenty of work to be done. Don't assume that success will come easily. Instead, get busy before you run out of time."
gemini,2013-05-05,"Although you might not be in charge today, others may look to you to provide logical answers to some tough questions. You may feel frustrated if you are being held accountable for circumstances that are beyond your control. Nevertheless, it's still wise to jump in and help out any way you possibly can. Just be certain to acknowledge your limits so you're able to keep some energy in reserve for additional tasks that could prove to be more rewarding. Fortunately, your pragmatic approach is what everyone really needs."
cancer,2013-05-05,"It may be a struggle to face other people's negativity about your ideas now, but it still makes sense to have a positive attitude if a powerful ally comes to your rescue. Unfortunately, you could mistakenly place your fears on someone who is actually on your side. Being optimistic requires a conscious effort, but it's your choice ... you don't have to automatically project your doubt. Act intelligently and graciously accept the help that's being offered today. And then pay the gift forward when you get the chance."
leo,2013-05-05,"It's time to make your move if you have been waiting for the right moment to start on a new career path. Your recent efforts may have been aimed at visualizing your future or repeating motivational affirmations. But today's planetary energy is about planting your feet firmly on the ground, finding your bearings and taking one step after another. As long as you have realistic goals in mind right from the beginning, your chances for success are greater than ever now."
virgo,2013-05-05,"You know exactly what you want today, yet you realize that life is more complicated than just fulfilling your immediate needs. You are concerned with larger dreams that may still need to take shape. Thankfully, you excel at setting goals and then focusing on achieving one at a time. However, it's wise to play it loose now, so you can take advantage of an interesting opportunity that might come along. Your smartest strategy is to plan ahead while still allowing enough wiggle room to react spontaneously."
libra,2013-05-05,"It's essential to overcome your doubts today so you can build on the foundation of experiences you already have accumulated. Lean on the structures that are in place, without feeling any pressure to start anew. Luckily, someone might offer you an exciting opportunity that actually expands upon your previous work. Don't be distracted by possibilities that aren't connected to your dreams. Take the time to carefully consider all the pros and cons prior to making a final decision."
scorpio,2013-05-05,"A magical connection between your two planetary rulers, fiery Mars and formidable Pluto, provides you with the strength of your convictions to drive you forward. Although engaging with others may present intriguing options, too many choices can scatter your energy while concentration assures your success. Don't spend time lost in analysis ... get out of your head and just follow your instincts. Which path you choose is less important than what you do along the way."
sagittarius,2013-05-05,"You're inspired by practical concerns today, empowering you to accomplish more than your fair share of work. Don't let up on the pressure just because things are progressing smoothly -- make the most of the positive vibrations while they last. However, if obstacles to your progress keep surfacing, consider your possible role in creating the problems. It's wiser to cooperate with your adversaries now, instead of opposing them. Working together produces positive results for everyone involved."
capricorn,2013-05-05,"You may be at the top of your creative game now with action-hero Mars firing up your 5th House of Self-Expression. Your emotions seem to be directly in line with your intentions. Nearly anything you want to do feels within your reach. You're emboldened to give voice to your ideas and then put your words into action. Run with this cosmic boost of energy, but there's no need to rush. Ultimately, you'll do better if you start slowly and increase your momentum as you go."
aquarius,2013-05-05,You are committed to defending and protecting those who are less fortunate than you. You might even feel intuitively drawn to help someone in need today. Your emotions are so passionate now that people could receive an extra boost of energy just from interacting with you. Don't hold back from expressing your heart ... your actions create more of a positive impact than you realize.
pisces,2013-05-05,"There isn't much time to waste today because you have important things to do. Although making steady progress toward your long-term goals is enough to keep you busy, your plans also inspire others now. Trusting your own instincts is a good start, but you must follow through by initiating constructive action. When your family and friends see what you're doing, they might become so motivated by your success that they try to duplicate it. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery."
aries,2013-05-06,"It's tempting to get swept up in a whirlwind of activity today because the impetuous Aries Moon kicks up a storm of energy. You might actually think you can do everything, but you cannot. Pay careful attention to your choices and scale back your agenda as needed or you'll end up exhausting yourself. Be sensible -- schedule your time in advance to prevent an unpleasant surprise later in the day. Following your heart can be exhilarating as long as you don't go to extremes."
taurus,2013-05-06,"Unexpected events might upset your sense of reality, challenging you to maintain a pragmatic approach today. You are capable of making intelligent decisions, but you may have trouble keeping up with everything that's happening. Prioritizing your goals is much easier if you take time to make a list. However, you still must be willing to modify your strategy as situations evolve. Taking a calculated risk now should bring positive results if you weigh all your options in advance."
gemini,2013-05-06,"You may want to have fun with your coworkers and friends today, but you should stand back and reevaluate your priorities before making any promises. Don't ignore your responsibilities for the sake of pleasure, even if you are pulled in opposite directions. Take the high road now instead of trying to rationalize reckless behavior. Rather than chasing a fleeting moment of excitement, consider the possibilities from a spiritual perspective before you decide what to do next."
cancer,2013-05-06,"The Moon's climb into your 10th House of Status encourages you to take care of business by nurturing others, but an inner voice demands more from you now. Although you want to feel the adrenaline rush, even if it comes from conflict, extreme emotional reactions aren't what you need. Nevertheless, you're tempted to take a chance, anyhow. Find a way to express your excitement without placing anyone in danger, including yourself. In fact, putting your passion into your work is the fastest way to achieve success."
leo,2013-05-06,"The Moon's current visit to your 9th House of Big Ideas prompts you to make plans that are larger than life. Although you must balance your lofty goals with earthly concerns, you don't have to rein yourself in. Go ahead and reach out beyond your comfort zone. However, you'll probably be disappointed if you expect a miracle to happen in one day. Stretching past your usual limits today produces positive results, giving you a much-needed boost of confidence."
virgo,2013-05-06,"Normally, you're an expert at making small adjustments to your life, but now you are being called on to make a larger change. Your need for perfection may be totally aggravating if the desired goal remains elusive. One simple solution to your anxiety stems from a willingness to graciously relinquish control. You can overcome the frustration and begin to relax once you accept the current circumstances. Transformation is possible if you choose to embrace the unknown."
libra,2013-05-06,"You're on a journey to restore balance in your world and today might bring the birth of your new purpose. Unfortunately, the current uncertainties are not letting your mind rest. You could blast forward into something completely new, yet you still struggle to let down your protective walls. Harmony continues to be elusive, but you feel better now if you simply moderate the extremes. Take time out for a walk in nature or a quiet meditation at home. Creating a peaceful state of mind is the first step to opening your heart."
scorpio,2013-05-06,"You are excited by a potential shake-up to your regular work routine and might be eager to jump in with full force. Unfortunately, you may end up wishing that you hadn't moved so fast. However, there's no way to go back now if you already committed to a project. Still, you could try and remember to take the next one a little slower. Ultimately, you are in control and can alter the pace of your day in a creative way that works to your advantage."
sagittarius,2013-05-06,"Waves of excitement inspire you to do something crazy since the energetic Aries Moon fires you up for something extraordinary. However, you're also feeling a bit cautious because you don't want to jeopardize your recent gains. You're best served today by exercising a touch of self-restraint. Making proper preparations at the beginning of your journey increases your chances of reaching your destination in record time."
capricorn,2013-05-06,"You intend to demonstrate your maturity, but you might not be able to deny your impulse to break free today. You can't bear the idea of having to work while being excluded from an exhilarating activity. Go ahead and throw caution to the wind and do what sounds exciting. Follow your heart while you can; thankfully, your temporary rebellion won't delay success. Most likely you'll still need to change your plans again when the instability of the moment passes."
aquarius,2013-05-06,"You are tempted by new and different activities that can break you out of the drudgery of your daily routine. The feisty Aries Moon hooks up with radical Uranus today, daring you to go over the edge to prove your independence. If you maintain the status quo, you'll probably end up wishing that you had the courage to give up control. But if you surrender to your urges, you might regret your foolish behavior. Whatever you choose, accept your current decision as the best one you could make in this moment."
pisces,2013-05-06,"You are eager to begin a new project today, but it's more constructive to concentrate on something you already started. Nevertheless, it's challenging to find a rhythm that enables you to sustain your current effort. Although your irregular pace could annoy others, you might do better if you alter your speed throughout the day. Don't worry about public opinion. Just focus on being as productive as possible and the rest will follow."
aries,2013-05-07,"You might not know how to manage your intense feelings today. Just when you thought you had everything under control, your emotions could lure you into new territory without giving you time to prepare for your journey. It's not a smart idea to act on every sudden attraction or you may be looking for your way back to familiar ground for a long time to come. Enjoy the view, but wait until the dust settles before involving anyone else in your rapidly changing fantasies."
taurus,2013-05-07,You may be surprised by an emotional encounter today. Be prepared to reevaluate your current relationship goals even if you think you know where the current situation is leading. Remain open to reconsidering a recent choice and making whatever corrections are necessary. Just don't alter your course on a whim; take plenty of time to delve into the heart of the matter before doing anything drastic.
gemini,2013-05-07,"You like the thought of avoiding a stressful conversation and moving on to a topic that's more palatable. But today something drives you toward finding the answers you seek. Fortunately, you can draw from powerful memories to get to the bottom of an unsolved riddle. But you could be so exhilarated when you finally uncover the truth that you make an impulsive decision. Don't rush the process now ... practicing patience will steer you in the right direction."
cancer,2013-05-07,"You might feel exhausted from all the emotional changes that lead you around in circles today. It takes a concerted effort to ward off peer pressure now, especially if a powerful person wants to involve you in mischief you wish to avoid. If you have any doubt at all, don't relinquish control for the sake of being a team player. The best thing you have to offer is your individual integrity, so be true to yourself no matter what."
leo,2013-05-07,"You can't help but wonder if you're heading in the wrong direction today, only to find your confidence returning a short time later. Be willing to take a risk, even if you're not sure that the outcome will be what you expect. But don't make any significant decisions on a passing whim. Your feelings are still in flux and it would be wise for you to wait until the mood swings begin to settle down before you go too far."
virgo,2013-05-07,"Although life may be full of distractions now, your power of concentration is intense as your key planet Mercury forms a harmonizing trine with potent Pluto. Your perceptions are extremely sharp, but your imagination kicks in and tempts you to daydream about the future. It's great to explore your fantasies as long as you remember to distinguish what's real from what's not."
libra,2013-05-07,"Your recent caution is replaced by an urgent need for excitement today. You might grow bored with a previous decision and feel the irrepressible desire to stir things up at work. But change for the sake of change won't help. It's wiser to have a realistic goal in sight and channel your enthusiasm toward something specific in the future, instead of running away from your past."
scorpio,2013-05-07,"Although you might be unsure how to utilize the information at hand, at least there won't be any question about the validity of your logic today. Mental Mercury's superconductive trine with powerful Pluto turns your mind into a tempered steel trap and there won't be any escaping from the truth. Be practical in your approach ... having all the facts in order minimizes your chances of jumping to the wrong conclusion. Nevertheless, your intensity could scare others away, so soften your words for the greatest impact."
sagittarius,2013-05-07,"You may be searching for a bit of fun, but the need to remain fully involved on the job prevents you from following your heart's desire today. Nevertheless, you might struggle to prevent your mind from exploring the back roads of your imagination. Trying to completely shut off your dreams could be a waste of energy, but postponing them for a short while works to your advantage. Meet your current responsibilities now so you can indulge in your fantasies later."
capricorn,2013-05-07,"It's challenging to establish your natural work rhythm today because so many distractions entice you away from your chores. Nevertheless, set a steady pace early in the day to harness the incredible creativity that's at your disposal. Thankfully, you may be the most productive if you take several breaks along the way, enabling you to return to the tasks at hand all charged up and ready to go."
aquarius,2013-05-07,"It's smarter to keep things light and easy today since sinking into someone's emotional drama won't bring you any closer to Nirvana. Unfortunately, you aren't in control of everything that happens ... you're only responsible for how you react. Acknowledge the power of your imagination, but don't let fear pull you away from happiness. You can achieve nearly anything you put your mind to now, so be sure to keep your thoughts aimed high."
pisces,2013-05-07,"You may grow discouraged if you're not feeling up for an important task now. Just remember that your self-esteem isn't dependent on whether or not you're capable of doing your work. It's more about your idealism and the challenges you must face when reality doesn't meet your lofty expectations. Happily, your confidence should start to return in a day or two so don't undertake risky behavior today just to prove your value. People appreciate you just the way you are."
aries,2013-05-08,"Although your bark is bigger than your bite today, you're actually less excitable than you were earlier in the week. However, others may not be able to read you correctly so they don't pick up on your impatience. Someone might misinterpret your assertive style and could even think that you're acting desperately. But your current persistence gives you greater strength than is apparent. Don't be sidetracked by what anyone else believes now; just focus on your goal and move forward on your own."
taurus,2013-05-08,"You are determined to get exactly what you want, yet you could become your own worst enemy now if you allow your fear of failure to run the show. Anxiety increases your stress level, and you may begin to shut down emotionally instead of remaining adaptable enough to respond to changes. Ease your tension by reminding yourself that worrying isn't helpful. You have an opportunity today to choose flexibility over stubbornness, making everyone happier in the process."
gemini,2013-05-08,"You may feel sluggish today, as if you cannot find a reason to start moving. However, this problem is less about physical laziness than emotional apathy. Although you know what you want, you can't decide if potential success is worth the effort. Ironically, weighing the pros and cons won't bring you any closer to an answer yet. Instead of spinning your wheels now, wait until after tomorrow's New Moon Eclipse before taking major steps toward your future goals."
cancer,2013-05-08,"You are willing to confront your own fears now so you can process them before exploring a difficult subject with a close friend or partner. Unfortunately, there are no shortcuts to happiness today, so you need to jump in and be willing to deal with whatever happens. You are traveling through mysterious terrain and it's crucial that you take it slowly enough to fully absorb the experience as you go along."
leo,2013-05-08,"If anyone asks you a question today, he or she better be ready to listen because you have a lot to say and you are eager to share your opinion. Unfortunately, you may not be able to give a simple yes or no answer. You have a story to tell and won't stop until you've delivered your entire response. Just remember that others might not have the time for the extended version so keep your message as uncomplicated as possible to get your point across."
virgo,2013-05-08,"You are playing for keeps today and there's not much that can deter you from your goal. Last night's Mercury-Mars hook-up may still trick you into thinking that your way is the best way to accomplish your work now. But there are many approaches to success and it's very likely that someone else will have a better idea. Remain open to what others say, for your ability to adjust your plans could bring you to your destination even quicker."
libra,2013-05-08,You may feel uncomfortable today because you typically rely on your intellect rather than on your emotions. But last night's Mercury-Mars conjunction is still blurring the boundaries between objective logic and impulsive actions. Leading with your heart is fine if you are aware of what you're doing. Your lack of clarity now should stand as a warning not to make critical decisions until after tomorrow's New Moon Eclipse.
scorpio,2013-05-08,"Your natural ability to explore the shadows of your subconscious mind can make you a really good friend to someone special. Your loyalty is unwavering as you jointly explore the darker side of passion today. It's much easier to stick with the intense process of transformation now when the spotlight is on another person, rather than you. Remember to be just as kind to yourself if your feelings are the ones being judged."
sagittarius,2013-05-08,"Practicality is easily integrated into your routine now, but you can still be off base even if you think you're using common sense. You must be careful because you could set your heart on a particular goal. It's possible to make a wrong decision, even if you approach the problem with your feet on the ground. You'll do much better after you gain more perspective, so allow a day or two to pass before giving your final answer."
capricorn,2013-05-08,"You may seem more intense today because every word you utter is supercharged with emotion. However, you won't likely waste words with communicator Mercury and several other planets in laid-back Taurus. Even if you attempt to make your point clearly, you might not be as logical as you think. Step back from any situation that gets you riled up now and consider all your options before saying anything at all."
aquarius,2013-05-08,"No matter what professional circumstances are impacting your life now, the behavior of your coworkers is less important than your reactions. Accordingly, you have more control over what happens next than you realize. Instead of trying to outmaneuver anyone else, strengthen your own foundation first. It's not about what others think ... it's about believing in yourself."
pisces,2013-05-08,"You might think that you're being extremely clear about your intentions and what you're doing today, but a close friend or family member still could misinterpret your behavior. Unfortunately, you become less believable as you try to justify your actions because your emotions speak louder than your logic. Your smartest strategy now is to follow through with what you started and save your explanations for another day."
aries,2013-05-09,"Rather than impulsively setting new goals, it makes more sense to proceed slowly now. Although today's Taurus Solar Eclipse in your 2nd House of Resources requires you to make changes, you don't have to alter your destination yet. Instead, rethink your strategy and reallocate your time and energy to improve your efficiency. There's no need to push harder today ... just work smarter, instead. Logistics are easier to manage if you adopt a creative approach."
taurus,2013-05-09,"Today's New Moon Eclipse in your sign signals a turning point in your life and it's up to you to figure out what comes next. It's time to wipe the slate clean so you're not restrained by previous plans. Although you might face uncertainty, you also have an opportunity to exert a higher level of self-determination during the weeks ahead. But you must be willing to make a decision now. Choosing which path to take isn't enough ... you also need to commit to giving one hundred percent until you accomplish your goal."
gemini,2013-05-09,"You might make an apparently trivial decision today that has unforeseen consequences since the Taurus Solar Eclipse activates your 12th House of Destiny. Although you are tempted to keep things light and easy, it's wiser to seriously consider the ramifications of your possible actions. If you are unsure of what you really want, refrain from making any changes until you gain clarity. Taking your mind off your worries for a while enables you to return to your problems with a fresh perspective."
cancer,2013-05-09,"You may have social responsibilities that must be fulfilled today, but you don't have to be overly concerned with concrete decisions that affect what's happening at work. Instead, acknowledge the Taurus New Moon Eclipse in your 11th House of Long-Term Goals by managing the present situation as efficiently as you can while also leaving time to plan for your future. Be bold in your thinking, since your current bright ideas are more pragmatic than you realize."
leo,2013-05-09,"Apply your excess energy to advance yourself at work instead of getting caught up in anger over something you can't control. Today's Taurus Solar Eclipse rattles your 10th House of Career, prompting you to start a project today without even having a plan in mind. Instead of initiating work on a new venture now, think about your options and create a timeline for the future. Once you have your strategy in place, you can boldly charge ahead with a confidence that exudes success."
virgo,2013-05-09,"If you are thinking about enrolling in a course to expand your career horizons, today's determined Taurus New Moon Eclipse in your 9th House of Higher Education could push you further along that track. But if your idea of learning doesn't involve the classroom, you might want to go on a working vacation that allows you to travel and widen your perspective. One way or another, open your mind to possibilities not previously considered and you may be surprised at what you discover."
libra,2013-05-09,"Relationships are naturally important to you, so today's Taurus Solar Eclipse in your 8th House of Shared Resources is a reminder that working on a joint venture may offer you more advantages than starting something on your own. Naturally, there are pros and cons to consider before giving up your autonomy, but the right partner might just hold the key to reaching your goal. Making a smart alliance could be your best move now for achieving success."
scorpio,2013-05-09,"Although it's challenging to forget a hurtful memory, you are able to see beyond your old limited point of view and reinvent a new frame of reference now. Your emotional IQ is supplemented by your common sense today as the Taurus New Moon Eclipse activates your 7th House of Relationships. No matter how much your life continues to change, you can always benefit from a supportive friendship if you are willing to consider the untapped potential of the present moment. Honoring the best in others brings out the best in yourself."
sagittarius,2013-05-09,You may not be as optimistic about a new project today as you might be on other days because the Taurus Solar Eclipse shakes up your 6th House of Work and reflects your need for self-restraint on the job. It's not that you lack creative vision; it's just that you're more concerned now with completing what you have already started before beginning something else. Keep it simple until you know where your previous commitments will take you. Wrapping up your past makes room for your future.
capricorn,2013-05-09,"You're stepping into a highly creative phase now and eagerly anticipating all the amazing possibilities. Although you aren't interested in building castles in the air, this is a great time to start a project if you harness your current enthusiasm. However, today's New Moon Eclipse falls in your 5th House of Spontaneity, so if you're facing restrictions, find other artistic outlets where you can still express your ingenuity."
aquarius,2013-05-09,"Set a stake in the ground that you can use as a cornerstone on the foundation you are constructing. There are many deep changes ahead, yet establishing stability in your life is crucial now as the New Moon Eclipse polarizes your 4th House of Security. Your future is less certain if you hold on to your present vulnerability as a shield. However, if you feel safe enough to let go of your fears, you should be able to successfully build on your previous work."
pisces,2013-05-09,"Today's Taurus New Moon Eclipse highlights your 3rd House of Communication, insisting that you stick to the basic facts in all your interactions. Although you may be an idealist, temporarily set your dreams aside and deal with things exactly as they are now. Demand the simple truth from others and give them the same in return. But don't worry about your current lack of creativity ... it will surely return in the days ahead."
aries,2013-05-10,"If you are still conserving your energy, it may be time to experiment with letting go of control now. Fortunately, you don't need to upset the status quo. Instead of trying to make anything happen right away, be patient, even if you don't make noticeable progress. There's no reason to force your agenda on to everyone else since your best efforts will take time to reach critical mass."
taurus,2013-05-10,"It makes sense to anticipate the future so you can be ready for any contingency. However, it's quite another thing to be so wrapped up in what might happen that you lose control of the present moment. Even if you are already thinking ahead, slow down today or your frustration will soon outweigh your enthusiasm. Thankfully, paying attention to what's happening right now enables you to effectively react to nearly any changes you might encounter."
gemini,2013-05-10,"The Moon's shift into your sign can be like an emotional wake-up call that moves you out of your head and down into the rest of your body. Although you may become so entangled in a drama that you lose perspective, you have a chance to grow more aware of how your thoughts are influenced by your changing moods. Nevertheless, go easy on yourself if you don't yet want to share what's on your mind. A little introspection is just what you need at this time."
cancer,2013-05-10,"At first you may lose interest in anything you start today, but it's just that your mind is on too many things at once. You might feel distracted and even a tad discouraged. But your concerns should pass quickly once you realize how much you're doing, even if others don't see the results of your efforts yet. Keep any negativity to yourself for now ... that way it won't have a detrimental impact on your current work. Concentrate on possibilities and not on obstacles for the best results."
leo,2013-05-10,"Career-related issues finally seem to be under control now, blessing you with enough free time to think farther into the future without having to be so practical. Of course, you won't be able to leave your current responsibilities behind ... it's just that they don't require a lot of your attention at this time. Nevertheless, it's still a smart idea to keep an eye on your workmates because someone might try to steal your thunder when you're not looking. The best offense is a conscious defense."
virgo,2013-05-10,"It's likely that you were doing fine yesterday, but now your sense of order seems to be quickly falling apart as you are deluged with contradictory data. This is a test, but thankfully, you don't even need to give the right answer to pass it. Believe it or not, your best path to success today could involve a little procrastination at the right time. Avoid the negative consequences of a hasty decision by putting it off for a few days. Timing is everything."
libra,2013-05-10,"You were fairly certain about your point of view yesterday, but your confidence may wane today. Part of your current dilemma is that there appears to be even more choices than you initially realized. Although you thoroughly like having more options now, too much variety complicates the issues and makes it harder to pick one over all the others. It will be easier to choose your selection once you realize that it doesn't have to be your final answer."
scorpio,2013-05-10,"The stubbornness of a friend may have tested your patience over the past couple of days. You might even have reached a point where you felt as if you were negotiating with an obstinate mule. Thankfully, your annoyance might be diminishing now that others aren't so stuck in their ways. You can make a good situation even better by meeting someone else's new-found flexibility with some adaptability of your own. Establishing shared goals is ultimately better for everyone involved."
sagittarius,2013-05-10,"If you are struggling to break out of a rut or eliminate an old habit, it may be time to find someone to help you out today. It's surprising how much a bit of support boosts your confidence and enables you to push along toward a goal. But others might not be there exactly how or when you need them, so don't put all your faith in anyone else's advice. Trust your own wise counsel to guide you in the right direction."
capricorn,2013-05-10,"You may be out of step with your environment today because you don't have the same intense level of focus that you had yesterday. You might even start a task, only to leave it unfinished as you move on to something else. Too many loose ends increase your anxiety, so remember to ""just say no"" to the next distraction that comes along. Even if circumstances feel restrictive now, complete one job before beginning another."
aquarius,2013-05-10,"The electric light bulbs in your brain begin to flash with brilliant creativity today. You feel alive and refreshed, ready to make good use of all the ideas that are coming your way. But turning an inspiration into a concrete plan is tricky business, so you're inclined now to handle it slowly and deliberately. Nevertheless, don't be overly cautious ... respond to each opportunity with a willingness to take a calculated risk."
pisces,2013-05-10,"There's plenty of chit-chat at home or on the job now, and you may have difficulty keeping up with it all. It's not that you lack interest ... it's just that you don't have the energy to follow up on each idea or feeling that is expressed. However, dropping out of the conversation isn't a viable solution, either. Establishing limits to the amount of time you spend communicating with others today is the smartest way to manage your resources without burning yourself out."
aries,2013-05-11,"You are eager to express your core beliefs in a direct manner today, without withholding anything that's of significance. Unfortunately, other people won't necessarily agree with your perspective even if you're willing to discuss the differences. However, you may be so in tune with your intentions now that once you announce your position, there's no need to talk about it any further. Remember, your disclosure is like planting a seed ... it needs time to germinate without additional interference. Step back and watch it grow."
taurus,2013-05-11,"You may oversimplify things today which can create problems, especially if others take what you say at face value. However, what you see doesn't begin to touch the complex dynamics impacting your life now. Be careful, since a small misunderstanding about a missing fact might turn a simple discussion upside down. It's much easier to prevent the conflict beforehand than to untangle it once it's begun. A stitch in time saves nine."
gemini,2013-05-11,"Conversations grow complicated now because your message may be garbled as interactive Mercury is lost in the intense brightness of the Sun's rays. You might be thinking quite clearly today, but even the most straightforward thoughts can become overly subjective with the Moon back in your sign. It's okay to have faith in your convictions but don't try too hard to use logic to convince anyone else of the validity of your point of view. Let others draw their own conclusions when they're ready."
cancer,2013-05-11,"Your social life might seem very simplistic today as the plodding Taurus Mercury-Sun alignment grinds your thoughts to a temporary standstill. Instead of relying on your brain to figure things out, gather your courage and acknowledge the power of your heart. Don't be concerned if your friends want you to get more involved with complex group dynamics. However, only join in if it feels right to you."
leo,2013-05-11,"Mental Mercury's conjunction with the Sun fires up your mind and makes you eager to talk about your aspirations. However, you can also broaden your perspective by listening to people describe their professional goals. Your brain is overflowing with sensible ideas today, prompting you to initiate action immediately. Trusting your logic is smarter than waiting to receive approval from anyone else."
virgo,2013-05-11,"You may be fantasizing today about doing something that will take you far from your mundane world. Consider pulling out all the stops and dream about your future without holding back. Visualize splurging on an airline ticket and heading off on your great adventure. It might be difficult to transform your thoughts into reality now, but it's possible as long as you have faith and take it one step at a time."
libra,2013-05-11,"You truly want to do what's right, but you might be challenged to figure out exactly what that means today. Although it's easy to discuss your plans with someone you trust, saying too much now could disperse the energy prematurely. Avoid going overboard ... share your ideas but only on a need-to-know basis. Less turns out to be better than more this time around."
scorpio,2013-05-11,"The verbally adept Mercury-Sun conjunction lands in your 7th House of Partnerships, smoothing ruffled feathers in most of your interactions throughout the day. Nevertheless, you still may become annoyed if you discover that someone has already made a decision about who you can talk with now. Stand up for your rights, but don't back yourself into a corner in the process. Start from the assumption that others have your best interests at heart and go from there."
sagittarius,2013-05-11,"You might feel the stress today as you attempt to complete unfinished chores from last week. It isn't that there's so much left over to do... it's just that you want to manage your responsibilities methodically now. However, this approach prevents you from broadening your perspective enough to move past your immediate obligations. Don't just jump in and start working if you're not ready ... instead, step outside and get some fresh air if you need to clear your head first."
capricorn,2013-05-11,"You naturally feel comfortable if you have enough safety and security so that you don't need to worry about the basics. This peace of mind can free you up to enjoy magical connections with others, since you won't need to constantly focus on those things you must have for survival. Go ahead and take a chance by doing something that you've never done before. And don't bother looking for instructions ... just trust your intuition, instead."
aquarius,2013-05-11,"It's difficult to move through your own rigidity today as your need for family connections conflict with your desire to creatively express yourself. The problem is that if you don't listen to the needs of others, you could be left high and dry with unfulfilled emotional desires. Exploring both the personal and humanitarian aspects of your world helps to restore a healthy balance to your life."
pisces,2013-05-11,"You want to believe that all is well, yet you aren't surprised if you run into a serious obstacle today. You're unwilling to take no for an answer and could work extra hard to overcome any problems that surface now. Unfortunately, your desire to reach your destination may not be enough to guarantee success. Consider relaxing your timetable or changing your agenda. Being flexible is your secret weapon ... don't be afraid to use it."
aries,2013-05-12,"You have a bounce to your step and a mischievous twinkle in your eye today because you believe that you can put one over on reality. Unfortunately, you may be so clever now that you fool everyone, including yourself. Be careful ... everything might appear to be light and easy but there are still potent forces at work just beyond the limits of what you're able to sense. Nevertheless, your goals are attainable if you're willing to dig beneath the surface."
taurus,2013-05-12,"Your current mental agility has you fox-trotting around facts and tap-dancing to tall tales today. Unfortunately, you could be so hypnotized by your own smooth style that you don't even notice when the music stops. You might be a lot more productive now if you concentrate on the tasks at hand rather than demonstrating how skillfully you can maneuver around the truth. Don't forget that actions speak louder than words."
gemini,2013-05-12,"Your thoughts are racing a mile a minute and there's no simple way to slow them down. Normally, you might consider this adrenaline rush to be exhilarating, but now it's more of an irritation than anything else. It's one thing to think quickly, but it's unfortunate if your current mental process is leading you around in circles. Nevertheless, don't resist the repetition, for it could bring an unexpected breakthrough when you least expect it."
cancer,2013-05-12,"You are preoccupied with your fantasies today, but thankfully, no one needs to know what's going on within your brain. You can easily keep up normal appearances now, enabling you to come and go as you please. Just don't get so overconfident that you stop paying attention to your immediate surroundings or you could miss out on something in the real world which is even more delicious than your colorful daydreams."
leo,2013-05-12,"You want to relax with a small group of friends or family, but you still have to fulfill your responsibilities in the real world. Luckily, you may not have to choose one over the other now if you do a little planning in advance. Instead of frittering away your day, make a list of things to do and then focus on each item until it's done. If you concentrate your efforts, you'll be surprised at how much time you have left over to enjoy the camaraderie you seek."
virgo,2013-05-12,"People may look to you for acknowledgment today, but you don't believe that you should have to put your stamp of approval on everything that happens. Luckily, you have enough common sense to remain uninvolved if a situation doesn't concern you directly. However, this detachment could annoy a friend or family member because your attitude might be misinterpreted as displeasure. Take whatever time you need to make sure that everyone knows exactly how you feel. Negative feelings can be minimized by engaging in clear communication right from the start."
libra,2013-05-12,"You may feel distant from the real nitty-gritty of today's events, but it isn't because you have consciously withdrawn. In fact, your exuberance could be running at a fever pitch now, yet your words sound so philosophical that others might not  understand what you're saying. Visualizing your ideal world can be useful, but it doesn't change anything unless you bring your ideas back down to Earth. Think globally, act locally, and speak practically."
scorpio,2013-05-12,"Your special gift today is being able to discuss a challenging personal experience in a manner that doesn't make others feel awkward. You can feel the intensity while describing it in a straightforward style that carries no blame. Thankfully, your openness acts as a catalyst now, triggering a totally unexpected conversation. Even if you have a specific agenda, be open and talk about it with those you trust. When the topic shifts, simply adapt to the new landscape with a smile."
sagittarius,2013-05-12,"A close friend might talk your ear off today but you can't seem to find a graceful way to stop them. You are known to speak your mind without realizing that your direct approach may offend those with thinner skin than yours. But now you would be wise to bite your tongue and listen to what's being said. Surprisingly, your practice of discretion could even lead to learning something important about yourself. Keep in mind that your unselfish support has a deeper impact than you will ever know."
capricorn,2013-05-12,"You might secretly freak out for a moment when you realize you have a wild tiger by the tail today. However, your calm demeanor and steady persistence will soon have even the most vicious cat purring. Unfortunately, there's no step-by-step diagram to show you how to manage the situation successfully. Luckily, your survival skills won't let you down if you just do what comes naturally. Follow your primal instincts and you'll have things under control faster than anyone expects."
aquarius,2013-05-12,"You believe that you are due a real day off as a reward for your recent hard work. You're ready to schedule a bit of rest and relaxation today, but unexpected complications may get in the way. Don't make it worse by falling prey to the trap of complaining, since your negativity only annoys everyone around you. Instead, be responsible and handle whatever pops up with a can-do attitude and a smile. Laughter is contagious so utilizing your sense of humor now is a must."
pisces,2013-05-12,"Rather than running around in circles trying to accomplish something, retreat behind the walls of your home today. Pick up a book that you recently set aside and sink into it. Listen to some special music that inspires you to meditate and dream. Talk on the phone, chat online with a friend or put your feet up and escape into TV-land. It doesn't really matter which distractions you choose. However, don't let others make you feel guilty for taking some personal time ... you deserve it just as much as anyone else."
aries,2013-05-13,"It's difficult to be certain about your plans today, especially if your friends send you mixed messages. It seems as if others set clear limits and then, once you respectfully acknowledge them, they wonder why you have withdrawn. Confusion grows when either party makes hasty assumptions. Although the truth appears to fluctuate, always be ready to fall back on honest communication. If in doubt, check it out."
taurus,2013-05-13,"Your key planet Venus is the goddess of love, yet you're befuddled when it comes to romance as she squares delusional Neptune today. However, this irrational aspect can also activate your highest ideals. Although your personal relationships could be affected, the current emphasis on your 2nd House of Finances is likely to trigger a lack of clarity around money issues. Don't make any unnecessary expenditures since your desires may change dramatically over the next several days. Pay attention to your dreams without acting on them just yet."
gemini,2013-05-13,"It's difficult to concentrate on the present moment because Venus, the planet of personal attraction, is doing battle with nebulous Neptune today. Venus is dancing through your dualistic sign, tempting you to head out in two entirely different directions. Even if the consequences of your choices aren't very clear, don't give in to temptation now. Listen to the cool voice of reason instead of letting your imagination run wild."
cancer,2013-05-13,"You are dreaming in bright colors today, however, the vivid beauty of the images is less important than the serious message that the symbols convey. But it's not helpful to be overly analytical in your interpretations because your rigid logic could limit your creativity. Instead, do something to capture the magical energy that is flowing through you now. Ultimately, you can learn what you need to know by taking the scenic route."
leo,2013-05-13,"You're not ready to reveal too much about what's on your mind today because your words can't convey the subtlety of what's happening. Taking time for things to settle down enables you to make smarter choices about how much to verbalize. Until you know for sure, it's wiser to err on the side of discretion. You can always say more later. However, once you start to open up, you won't be able to take back what has been said."
virgo,2013-05-13,"You might appear more wishy-washy today because affectionate Venus squares fuzzy Neptune in your 7th House of Relationships. It doesn't matter what you say, your words still won't be specific enough to please anyone else. Instead of angering someone with your incorrect assumptions or faulty logic, wait a few days and then start your search for the truth again when you have more information at your disposal. In the meantime, stop thinking and just float in the realms of your imagination for a while."
libra,2013-05-13,"You're busy planning the next big adventure with your planetary ruler Venus visiting your 9th House of Big Ideas, yet her anxious square to diffusive Neptune muddies your thinking. You may be overwhelmed by your dreams of a perfect holiday or a great escape. But as you move closer to your ideal future, it could disappear right in front of your eyes. Don't accept defeat when life is offering you an opportunity to shine. Instead, create a more realistic set of goals and try again."
scorpio,2013-05-13,"You are wary today as you tiptoe around a delicate relationship situation. However, your feelings are real, even if your desires are colored by your well-hidden vulnerability. Nevertheless, it's okay to trust the higher wisdom of the universe ... you probably don't need to keep to yourself as much as you think. Others may not understand your actions now, so take time and explain yourself as clearly as possible so no unspoken words get in the way."
sagittarius,2013-05-13,"You attempt to keep your feelings in check today, but your desire to be heard will likely win out over your need to play it safe. However, your message may be muddled because you don't actually know what you want and the more you talk, the worse it gets. Don't bother trying to justify your motives yet. Thankfully, you should do better when your clarity begins to return tomorrow. In the meantime, keep your communication on the simple side to avoid misunderstandings."
capricorn,2013-05-13,"You're in for a bit of melodrama today if your plans fall apart because of lack of proper execution. Although you usually have a knack for making your dreams come true, your ideas are less practical than you think now. Taking another run at achieving your goals is a smart idea because you can gain better traction later in the day. But don't give up ... inching forward slowly is still much better than turning around and quitting too soon."
aquarius,2013-05-13,"You may be required to field an unexpected curve ball today that impacts your financial condition. Although you like to believe that you're always on your toes, you could overlook an apparently unimportant detail that suddenly becomes problematic. Thankfully, you still can react quickly by coming up with an ingenious solution as long as you don't assume that you are in complete control. Exercising flexibility works in your favor now."
pisces,2013-05-13,"You want to wear your heart on your sleeve while Venus squares Neptune in your sensitive sign today. Nevertheless, you may be confused because you aren't certain if others understand your feelings. Actually, those closest to you will be able to sense your emotions before you say anything at all. Avoid overcompensating by talking too much and diluting your message. The best magic is created now without uttering a word."
aries,2013-05-14,"You might start the day off feeling invincible, but your plans may crumble if overconfidence makes you careless in your execution. Being prepared for what's ahead is crucial today and rewards are possible if you don't try to skip over the necessary details. Be realistic while setting your goals now, because aiming at the right destination is the first step to being successful."
taurus,2013-05-14,"You were recently tempted to surge forward in a burst of enthusiasm, but now you're less certain about your best course of action. Slowing down so you can sustain a steady pace today is essential to reach your goals. Others may blast ahead while you rely on your common sense and build foundations that stabilize your growth. Thankfully, a more cautious approach will likely prove to be your smartest strategy in the long run."
gemini,2013-05-14,"The ease with which you interact with your world often makes you appear like a magician, but you are so charming that your cleverness could ultimately get in your way today. You may be so distracted by unrealistic possibilities that you actually head off in the wrong direction. Take time and deepen your current relationships, rather than running off to meet someone new. There's no need to go exploring faraway lands when there's uncharted emotional territory closer to home."
cancer,2013-05-14,"You may grow anxious now that the evocative Moon is back in your sign, stimulating intense feelings that you have recently avoided. However, staying aware of your emotions helps you to calm down, but it doesn't mean you must express them. Fortunately, you're able to reconnect with your center and feel more grounded as the day wears on. Take enough time to balance your internal state before you become annoyed. Focusing on the present moment inspires your friends and associates to respond positively."
leo,2013-05-14,"You may feel a bit of an emotional letdown today, but this is only a temporary dip in the intensity level. However, it's a challenge to balance your desire for success with your current responsibilities now. What you want probably isn't as wonderful as you imagine and the current circumstances aren't as bad as you think. Being in the middle is actually a pretty good place to be, at least for a little while."
virgo,2013-05-14,"Sometimes direct action is a challenge when it comes to telling others what you want. However, today you could go overboard with an authoritarian approach as stern Saturn forms an awkward aspect with resourceful Venus. Instead of trying to control everything, allow yourself to be guided by your intuition now, even if it doesn't make logical sense. Rather than following a detailed plan, you'll be surprised at how well it works when you just make it up as you go along."
libra,2013-05-14,"You're quite skillful when it comes to handling others, but you might give up your own power today as you strive to make those around you feel comfortable. It's nearly impossible to know how far to go in your efforts to be gracious as your key planet Venus is overshadowed by hard-nosed Saturn. You may even end up exhausted if you focus all your energy on everyone else. Instead, set an example by acknowledging that your personal goals are important, too, and remain true to yourself no matter what."
scorpio,2013-05-14,"Your stamina is increasing and you have ample energy to come through for others now. However, you must be cautious about using your new-found power for your own personal gain. Fortunately, you may be receiving help from unseen dimensions. Unfortunately, it's hard to know what's real and what's not. There's no need to back down from your position, but it's a good idea to play it just a little bit cooler than you actually feel in order to leave room for adjustments, if necessary."
sagittarius,2013-05-14,"You might be feeling less confident today with the Moon's presence in reflective Cancer, but a little self-doubt won't be enough to keep you down for long. It's usually your preference to independently charge ahead with your plans, but now it's wiser to include others on this part of your journey. Sharing nearly any experience with someone you like will only make it more enjoyable than doing it on your own."
capricorn,2013-05-14,"Even if you're feeling healthy, this is still a great time to upgrade your diet and exercise program and make whatever modifications are desirable. This doesn't mean that you are doing anything wrong in particular now, but there is always room for improvement. Set a realistic goal that can have an enduring positive impact on your life and then get to work."
aquarius,2013-05-14,"You may be tired of all the intense people in your life, even if they are offering you exciting alternatives to your current routine. You might even become uncharacteristically nostalgic and long for the relaxed pace of the good old days. But there's no returning to your past. Take whatever downtime you can find today because you'll need your vitality over the days ahead when the rhythm picks up even more. Thankfully, staying current with everything now means you can coast later in the week."
pisces,2013-05-14,"If complex issues on the home front have grown even more complicated lately, this is your chance to concentrate on the current situation. Your sensitivity is high and your determination is strong now, so don't wait for a better time to dig into the hidden dynamics of your relationships with family or close friends. As long as you don't set up unrealistic expectations for a miracle solution, your ability to listen compassionately allows you to be much more effective at finding answers and restoring equilibrium to your life."
aries,2013-05-15,"You might be a bit sleep-deprived from all the energy that you have been expending lately. Nevertheless, you're probably still raring to go today. Quicksilver Mercury enters airy Gemini, fanning your fires and fueling your enthusiasm. You could push yourself too hard now, so remember not to overdo it by piling more distractions on your busy schedule. Set priorities and focus your attention on one thing at a time so you have something positive to show for your efforts."
taurus,2013-05-15,"You have been waiting for the right time to express something that's been on your mind for a while. Although today may not be better than any other day, your current frustration might provoke you to start a difficult conversation. However, your friends will lose interest if your words wander aimlessly. Be direct and keep your message short and sweet. Reassure everyone that you're not looking for a quick answer ... you simply want to be heard and appreciated for your contribution."
gemini,2013-05-15,"Your sense of starting anew is confirmed today when rational Mercury enters your sign. However, there may be so many choices in front of you that it's nearly impossible to pick only one. Make time to think about something in your life that has already served its purpose and then consider what you want to replace it. Focusing on your immediate needs now can have a positive impact on your future."
cancer,2013-05-15,"Your thoughts may be running off in many directions today, but communicator Mercury's move into your 12th House of Privacy hides your inner process from everyone else. You are quite self-contained now and even those closest to you might not realize the magnitude of your unsettled emotions. But avoiding your truth isn't healthy in the long run. If you choose not to express your feelings, at least stay conscious of them."
leo,2013-05-15,"A family member might place unspoken demands on you today and you're not sure how to respond. You believe you're clever enough to dance around the unknown, but you quickly realize that logic cannot help you regain control of your day. You may attempt to guess the motives of those around you, but this strategy only brings frustration. Practice emotional detachment to alleviate the current pressure now, instead of failing the impossible task of pleasing everyone. Be courageous and initiate an honest dialogue if you want to know the truth."
virgo,2013-05-15,"You're uncertain how to establish new objectives at work today because you are pulled in two directions at once. Furthermore, it's challenging to separate the useful information from everything you learn as your ruling planet Mercury enters noisy Gemini and your 10th House of Career. Evaluating all your choices is a daunting task if you feel like you must make a long-term decision now. Thankfully, you have more time than you realize to figure out your next move."
libra,2013-05-15,"You might have more of a bounce to your step today, as a wave of lightness washes over your body and activates your cells from the top of your head to the tips of your toes. Thankfully, Mercury shifts into your 9th House of Future Vision, inspiring you to stretch beyond your old limits. Give yourself permission to dream about what's ahead without worrying about whether or not it's actually possible. Today's fantasies can grow into tomorrow's reality."
scorpio,2013-05-15,"Mercury's move into curious Gemini today brings intellectual acuity to your 8th House of Intimate Sharing, reinforcing your drive to intensify your emotional interactions. Nevertheless, you still must be careful, since you could become overwhelmed by unconscious desires if you don't monitor what you feel as you go along. Naturally, digging deep is a significant part of being a passionate Scorpio. Thankfully, exploring the shadows from a more lighthearted and logical perspective now produces positive results."
sagittarius,2013-05-15,"Interactive Mercury enters your 7th House of Others today, shifting the emphasis to how you respond in a relationship, rather than what you might do on your own. Unfortunately, if you attempt to take the lead now, things could quickly grow more complicated. Keep in mind that you can have more fun if you're willing to step out of the spotlight for a while and play a supporting role, instead."
capricorn,2013-05-15,"It's challenging to stay serious all day today, even if you have important obligations to fulfill. Mercury's move into flighty Gemini scatters your thoughts to the wind as fast as you refocus them on practical matters. Every time you concentrate, something more exciting comes along to pull you off track and down a curiously fascinating path. Stop resisting the inevitable ... instead of trying to be productive now, just let go for a while and see where the intellectual detours take you."
aquarius,2013-05-15,"Pleasing planetary positions pull you away from meeting your commitments today. You might aspire to high goals at first, but the opportunity for play outweighs the potential rewards for hard work as the day progresses. Mercury's shift into your 5th House of Fun indicates that it's smarter now to set aside your previous plans and simply make up new ones along the way. Spontaneous bursts of creativity can bring more joy into your life."
pisces,2013-05-15,"Even if today is a work day, you may consider staying home anyway. Your friends and associates might assume that your current desire for solitude is a sure sign that something is wrong, but they couldn't be more off target. Making some time for personal matters is an excellent way to get in tune with logical Mercury's move into your 4th House of Roots. Don't be overly concerned about what others say; your inner security counts more than anything else now."
aries,2013-05-16,"This isn't a day for staying out of the spotlight. You might think that you will quietly play a supportive role for a loved one today, yet you won't likely be able to contain your excitement long enough to complete your mission. There's no need to apologize for being yourself ... just be as kind as possible while still expressing your enthusiasm. Showing sensitivity to others makes it difficult for anyone to stay mad at you for very long."
taurus,2013-05-16,"Someone close to you may expect you to set aside your needs today so you can assist your family or friends. Unfortunately, other people's expectations are annoying because you can't really see what you have to contribute and don't want to be burdened with the extra responsibilities. Taking care of yourself is crucial, but try not to let anyone down more than necessary. Coming through for a loved one now could prove to be more rewarding than you expect."
gemini,2013-05-16,"A minor move on your part today could be very significant to someone else. Others may misinterpret your behavior because of their own expectations and assumptions. Or, perhaps, your actions are actually misleading because you don't want anyone to know what you're really up to now. It's wise to be honest about your boundaries up front so you don't unintentionally alienate your allies. A simple explanation might be all that's needed to clear the air."
cancer,2013-05-16,"You might believe that clarity is returning because you're ready to take initiative today, especially if you have been waiting for the right time. Unfortunately, something is lurking just beyond your perceptions and you can't bring it into awareness. Nevertheless, following your heart makes much more sense than analyzing your next move. Don't try to explain yourself -- your actions will be enough to tell your story."
leo,2013-05-16,"Today may be an extremely social day, yet paradoxically you won't likely be the center of attention. You are more interested in loving others now, rather than wanting to be loved. However, if you try to get recognition today, your scheme could backfire, causing you to regret a hastily executed plan. Nevertheless, being generous in spirit lets others shine and ultimately casts you in a favorable light."
virgo,2013-05-16,"You are more effective working behind the scenes, but you might say something today that stirs the pot and puts you in the middle of a controversy. The problem is that you could accidentally reveal feelings that you meant to keep secret. There's no need to be overly self-protective now because hiding your intentions only draws the spotlight closer to you. Find a way to express what's on your mind without crossing any lines."
libra,2013-05-16,"Life may become more exciting today, especially if others choose not to follow your script. Surprisingly, when someone acts in an unexpected manner, it frees you up and gives you room to be more creative. Instead of planning your day based on preconceived outcomes, make up scenarios where anything can happen. Your out-of-the-box approach could bring pleasing results if you just give it a chance."
scorpio,2013-05-16,"You cannot escape from your life today, even if you just want to relax in solitude. You must get out and socialize with others, either for work or play. However, you won't be satisfied with simple distractions ... you want interactions with depth and meaning. Real happiness is within your reach now if you participate in activities that allow you to passionately engage life in a creative manner."
sagittarius,2013-05-16,"Visiting an old familiar haunt with a friend may sound like a good time today, but you'll probably wander into uncharted territory pretty quickly. Discovering new places is particularly enticing now if you can share an adventure with a special companion. Pushing boundaries and stretching outside of your ordinary routine brings out your highest potential even if you're on your own."
capricorn,2013-05-16,"You might attempt to withdraw from the noisy distractions at work today to focus on improving your health. Pay extra attention to your personal routine because whatever you do now has more consequences than you realize. If you have been considering a new exercise program, don't wait a moment longer. Start immediately so you can feel better about yourself sooner than later."
aquarius,2013-05-16,"Being physically active rejuvenates your body and mind. But it's not enough just to think about doing something today ... you have to actually get up and do it. Your anxiety could increase in the coming days as you face additional stress, so it's wise to find playful ways to work off your excess energy now, before it reaches a tipping point. Having fun isn't just an escape -- it's a proactive way to improve your health."
pisces,2013-05-16,"There is a lot more happening in your life than anyone can see, but this is, in part, a result of how well you hide the truth today. Your current scheming isn't about lying or even attempting to misrepresent the facts ... it's simply that you want more privacy now. There is nothing wrong with redefining boundaries if that is what you must do in order to feel secure at this time. Establishing a solid foundation is more important than worrying about how others might react."
aries,2013-05-17,"Although your life appears to be moving forward at first today, your progress becomes less certain as the day wears on. You are ready for action, even if you don't know where you are going now. Nevertheless, trust your instincts if they're telling you to cool your jets. However, your frustration won't likely dissipate until you get your bearings again. Thankfully, it will be easier to head off in a new direction tomorrow once the fog begins to clear."
taurus,2013-05-17,"You might lose patience with someone who turns a small problem into a major crisis. But even if you understand that some damage control is necessary today, you may not be in a position to do what's required. You'll be more effective if you wait until next week to assume a leadership role. Instead of pretending that you have a plan, ease up on the reins and allow events to unfold on their own."
gemini,2013-05-17,"You think that you are clever enough to manage others successfully. You're so good at spinning stories now that you could even convince yourself that whatever you say is true. However, it's as if you are walking through a fun house of mirrors and your perceptions are out of whack. Step back and allow someone else to assume control today so you can avoid additional complications next week. In the meantime, plug your colorful imagination into a creative outlet and see what happens."
cancer,2013-05-17,"Although you're highly sympathetic to other people's feelings, you may try to hide behind a protective shell because the energy is so intense now. The Moon's visit to your sign complicates your life because there are so many crosscurrents that you cannot tell which way to go. Don't let anyone intimidate you into making a decision prematurely. It's much easier to change your mind before you commit rather than after you sign on the dotted line."
leo,2013-05-17,"You may be a bit befuddled today because you want to push forward, yet the flow of energy is predominately inward. The Moon in your sign reflects your current need to escape from the hustle and bustle of the outer world so you can get in touch with your changing moods. But a difficult situation pressures you to take a stand now. If it seems like you're riding an emotional roller-coaster, just hold on tightly and wait until your feelings smooth out before letting others know what's on your mind."
virgo,2013-05-17,"Others frequently come to you for advice when they need your sharp analytical mind to assess their predicaments. However, you're the one that's now seeking a reality check. Unfortunately, you can't rely on anyone else today, for everyone is just as perplexed as you are with the situation. Delay all important decisions since your mental acuity will return next week. Although answers may be elusive for a while, you can find solace through contemplation in the interim."
libra,2013-05-17,"It's challenging to settle your nerves today because your current anxiety stems from several different sources. Unfortunately, isolating individual problems and solving them won't address the overall big picture. Instead of seeking solutions that require practical plans and specific actions, you're better off now working on improving your attitude. If you can be flexible in your thinking, you'll realize that you don't have to waste energy worrying about things you cannot control."
scorpio,2013-05-17,"It may seem as if someone is dragging you into an unwanted leadership role today, but you don't want to take charge now because you're not really sure about the future. Nevertheless, everyone is still looking to you for direction. There's no need to pretend that you know more than you actually do. You can still effectively share your experience while acknowledging that you might not have all the answers. Meanwhile, don't forget to give yourself permission to feel special because your peers truly believe in you."
sagittarius,2013-05-17,"Your concern over someone's behavior may present a problem today. You're tempted to share your passionate opinion, especially if you think that your ideas will help others see the truth. But it's not as straightforward as it appears because self-righteousness can lead you astray. Watch for warning signals if you start to believe that your way is the only way. Keeping an open mind might be enough to turn a huge obstacle into a small bump in the road."
capricorn,2013-05-17,"You may be annoyed about having to deal with associates who won't acknowledge their real motives today. You are willing to be flexible now if you know the truth, but you don't want to draw your conclusions based upon incomplete data. Unfortunately, misinterpretations are likely because the information isn't as clear as you want. Stop struggling; your current disorientation will only last for a day or two more. In the meantime, step away from your desk for a while to cultivate your dreams."
aquarius,2013-05-17,"If someone shares a personal dilemma with you today, don't make snap judgments based upon how you might react in a similar situation. You are naturally wired to be cool and calm, even in the midst of a highly charged emotional storm, while others are more likely to get caught up in the drama. Be a real friend now and don't be overly critical; simply listen to their stories with a supportive ear and offer your shoulder when needed."
pisces,2013-05-17,"You may believe that you're being extremely productive today and want others to notice your contribution. But it's not a good idea to draw too much attention to yourself now because your work isn't necessarily as great as you think it is. Your fantasies are flowing freely, testing your ability to maintain a clear perspective. Your desires are warping your perceptions, so lying low and remaining under the radar might be your smartest strategy at this time."
aries,2013-05-18,"You are on the hunt for some excitement today, but you're not sure how much to say about what you want. Although you can cleverly justify your desire to steer clear of any emotional entanglements, you still might not be able to avoid getting hooked by a difficult situation. Your feelings could change throughout the day so don't judge yourself too harshly if you need to backtrack later and make a new plan. A rational approach helps to keep you on track."
taurus,2013-05-18,"You want to be sailing on calmer emotional waters, but you may have to stir up a few waves of your own today if your values clash with someone else's. There's a fine line between maintaining your integrity and just being stubborn. Don't give up before making your point. However, let go of your need to convince everyone that your position is the only correct one. You have the power to rise above conflict by choosing your battles wisely."
gemini,2013-05-18,"You are entering an emotionally intense period when you must learn something important about yourself. The information you receive today might rattle your previous assumptions. Although you like to keep your options open, you could be forced to make a choice now. Even if none of the alternatives appear one-hundred percent perfect, be as realistic as possible when making an important decision. Thankfully, you can always modify your course of action later on."
cancer,2013-05-18,"You can quickly see what's wrong with someone's big scheme today, which prevents you from investing too much time or money in an unrealistic project. However, your unspoken criticism can be perceived by someone else as negative energy you should overcome. The truth of the matter is somewhere in the middle and it's up to you to find a path of compromise that works for all parties involved."
leo,2013-05-18,"It isn't always easy to hone right in on what you offer others, but thinking about your contributions may be a very interesting exercise for you. Meanwhile, applying your energy to a mundane task isn't a waste of time if you practice self-reflection along the way. Something as uninspiring as paying your bills can be uplifting today ... if you keep your mind focused on what's real. Ultimately, others will appreciate your ability to make the most of the present moment."
virgo,2013-05-18,"You normally don't like too many distractions, yet you're still obsessed with gathering as many facts as you can now. Unfortunately, possessing an abundance of information isn't as reassuring as having certainty. As much as you attempt to let your common sense reign supreme, your optimism can sorely tempt you to mislead others today. Use your natural discretion to prevent heading off course."
libra,2013-05-18,"Knowing what to expect from a serious relationship makes the difference between a brilliant success and a discouraging failure. However, a setback could be an opportune time to collect enough information so you are able to convince others that you are sure of what you want. Thankfully, you don't have to try so hard. Relationships will have a better chance to flourish if you don't oversell your case."
scorpio,2013-05-18,"Having a discussion about intimacy and actually being intimate with a loved one are not the same thing. It's easier to approach this delicate subject from the point of view of an observer, even if you are confident enough to jump right into the fire now. Remember that the right amount of detachment can help you deal with your feelings much more effectively than letting yourself be overwhelmed by them."
sagittarius,2013-05-18,"Although you're often better at describing a general concept than zooming in on the individual facts, today's Virgo Moon enables you to separate the fine points from the big ideas. Meanwhile, a rugged Venus-Pluto alignment makes it tricky to gauge how much resistance you might need to exert in order to get what you want. Move slowly and reconsider all your options prior to making any critical decisions."
capricorn,2013-05-18,"You may be charmed by someone who behaves in a flirtatious manner toward you now. Unfortunately, other people's words can be confusing and could lead you down a dangerous path if you fail to sort through all the incoming information. Remember that your analytical ability is one of your greatest strengths. Carefully think everything through instead of impulsively following your instincts."
aquarius,2013-05-18,"You might feel like you're riding a creative streak, but you're still struggling with putting your best ideas into concrete action. Unfortunately, you could give up prematurely today if you aim your sights too high and set yourself up for frustration. However, if you don't establish any goals at all, you may miss your chance to demonstrate your talents when doing extraordinary work. Quit thinking so much and just let your imagination flow."
pisces,2013-05-18,"Your closest friends may ask for your undivided attention now. Ironically, their encouragement is  also just what you need to support your current growth. However, you might have such unrealistic expectations that everyone falls short of their goals and lets you down today. Still, it's crucial to appreciate what you have ... you cannot afford to waste any energy on negativity. There's no need to expect miracles; shining your light is enough to save the day."
aries,2013-05-19,"You may easily underestimate the time needed to finish your chores today, but this judgment error could be compounded if you overlook the details. Everything won't magically come together if you just keep pushing forward with blinders on. Or you might go to the other extreme by getting lost in trivialities. Establish a workable balance between concentrating on each individual task and visualizing the overall scope of your project."
taurus,2013-05-19,"You are quite practical when scheduling your time today because you don't want to miss out on any of the fun. Unfortunately, participating in recreational activities may require more advanced planning than you think. But don't tie your day up worrying about insignificant details or you won't be able to positively respond to the unexpected changes that pop up along the way. A mix of preparation and flexibility allows you to make the most of your day."
gemini,2013-05-19,"You may have to respond to a surprising situation today, especially if you encounter resistance from your friends and family. You might need to justify your choices, even if you prefer not to talk about them now ... you simply want those closest to you to acknowledge your support. Nevertheless, be clear about your intentions and avoid giving in to self-doubt. Staying focused on your destination will improve your chances for success. Those you love will come around in time."
cancer,2013-05-19,"Although you wish you were planning a vacation getaway, the chores in your immediate environment won't leave much time for idle daydreaming today. A show of anger won't help you get what you want, but neither will hiding your feelings. Work with the push and pull of responsibility and opportunity by expressing your concerns without putting the blame for your frustration onto anyone else. Clearing the air might just be the catalyst needed to set things right."
leo,2013-05-19,"Financial difficulties may limit your spending now that the Moon in your 2nd House of Money is forming an anxious alignment with resistant Saturn. You cannot look to others for sound advice today because they might misunderstand your perspective and could even encourage you to overextend yourself. Naturally, the power of positive thinking can improve your situation, but disregarding the facts is definitely not a good idea. Take all variables into consideration now and make a rational choice."
virgo,2013-05-19,"You would like to be able to count on others today, but you may need to rely on your own survival skills instead. It's not that there won't be anyone around to help you ... it's just that your friends seem a bit erratic now. You won't be as frustrated if you simply accept the hard work in front of you and get on with your day, even if you're left to your own defenses. Real progress waits for no one."
libra,2013-05-19,"You may be on edge today because it feels as if a storm is on the horizon, yet you are still unable to see it. Advanced preparation is complicated by your inability to tell where trouble is coming from or when it might arrive. Instead of spending your time battening down the hatches, trim your sails and get ready for an amazing adventure. If you are willing to take a risk, you could be pleasantly surprised by an unusual friend who offers you a helping hand."
scorpio,2013-05-19,"Making concrete plans is tricky today because your friends might not be able to follow through with their promises. For example, your schedule could be thrown into a state of confusion if someone lets you know at the last minute that he or she is running late. An emotionally restrained response is crucial because you are much better off if you don't infuse your own negativity into the current dynamics. The good news is that you don't need to rely on anyone else to have a great day."
sagittarius,2013-05-19,You don't want to be in charge today because you already feel the weight of the responsibility falling on your shoulders -- and you don't particularly like it. You are challenged to find the most appropriate way to express your opinion when you can clearly see both sides of the coin. But you could respond to the contradictory options by making a rash choice under duress. Encourage your friends to stand up for themselves ... you only have to make decisions for yourself.
capricorn,2013-05-19,"It's nearly impossible to focus your attention on social events today because you have too much going on in your own life. You want to feel as if you're an integral part of an extended family or tribe, but you might take yourself so seriously now that you get wrapped up in your own personal story. Nevertheless, don't withdraw completely. The love and support you have to offer others will also benefit you in the long run."
aquarius,2013-05-19,"Your key planet, Uranus, is in the planetary mix for the next few days, accelerating the speed at which emotional issues come to the surface. However, discussing your feelings isn't all that comfortable, unless you can emotionally detach yourself from the situation. You might even wait for someone else to get the ball rolling. Keep in mind that the conversation becomes harder the longer you delay it, so you may as well start now. Be an active participant in the change you wish to see."
pisces,2013-05-19,"It appears as if a relationship is dangling from a giant pendulum as your emotions swing back and forth between optimism and pessimism. However, you could land in a heap of trouble if you actually believe that you must choose one side over the other today. Unfortunately, everything could get out of whack as soon as you lock in on a singular point of view. Ironically, practicing procrastination helps; delaying your final answer may be the smartest thing you can do now."
aries,2013-05-20,"Your abrupt communication style might anger someone at work today, but don't hold on to any negative feelings or your attitude could impede your progress. Your associates are willing to offer you the support you need, but you must meet them halfway. Your natural spontaneity works to your advantage because you're acutely aware of the present moment. Reconsider your current situation without dwelling on your past. Looking ahead is more useful now than looking back."
taurus,2013-05-20,"No matter how confident you feel today, there still are pragmatic reasons why it's not smart to charge ahead and just take what you want. Fortunately, you are willing to wait, and your patience serves you well. Acting in a forceful manner only complicates things, while taking small, deliberate steps now increases the chances of reaching your desired destination. There's no need to panic ... you have more time than you think."
gemini,2013-05-20,"Maintaining a positive attitude is crucial today, especially if someone misinterprets your behavior. Thankfully, it grows easier throughout the day to say what needs to be said, but you still might not overcome the resistance without an open conflict. Don't back down, even if you need to stand up to another person's power trip. Ultimately, your clear conscience and clever persistence will win others over to your side."
cancer,2013-05-20,"Your ambivalence runs deep today if someone demands that you take sides in an open disagreement at work. It might be best to keep your opinion quiet since you understand both points of view. Ultimately, you're acutely aware that you're an observer and the conflict isn't necessarily your problem. Even if you're willing to lend a sympathetic ear, this distraction can adversely affect your productivity. Stand firm in your impartiality to allow others the chance to find a resolution on their own."
leo,2013-05-20,"You have to make some difficult choices so you might as well start doing your research now. Unfortunately, your goals could be overly ambitious. Simply let the day unfold with as few commitments as possible. There's wisdom in being flexible in the changing winds, as a kite opens to the shifting breezes of spring. Stay unattached from the clock today to increase your chances of grabbing an amazing opportunity if it appears out of the blue."
virgo,2013-05-20,"You know exactly what you must do to successfully achieve your goal now, but you might actually prefer to be doing something totally different. Your internal struggle over an apparently unsolvable dilemma can be quite intense. Luckily, you have a greater degree of control than you think. Remember that your happiness is not dependent on any one event or any one person, but rather on how you respond to life's twists and turns. Your resilience may be tested today, but you're certainly up for the challenge."
libra,2013-05-20,"An uncharacteristic emotional meltdown could clear the air of bad feelings today, allowing you to get back to business with a lighter heart. Fortunately, cooperating with others is easy when you care about the same issues. Sadly, someone may be dishonest with you now, making you unsympathetic to an alternative perspective and shaking your trust. Nevertheless, it's wise to suspend your judgment for a while until you have all the facts at your disposal."
scorpio,2013-05-20,"Your patience is wearing thin today, even if your intentions are honorable. You're tired of the same old issues popping up again and again, even though you already processed them and moved on. Thankfully, you can tell that others are really trying to change and grow, but everything might not be unfolding fast enough to your liking now. Being honest and expressing your frustration in a calm manner reduces the tension and strengthens a key relationship."
sagittarius,2013-05-20,"You may be known for your charming social ways, but you have to practice self-restraint now or your exuberant style could offend someone important. But rather than completely withdrawing, try toning your enthusiasm down just a touch. Keep in mind that exercising self-discipline doesn't mean you have to remain silent ... it's about saying the right thing succinctly. It's essential to know when to speak and when to stop talking. Being a good listener gives you the chance to see others in a different light."
capricorn,2013-05-20,"Someone may send you mixed signals today, requesting your help and then suddenly asking you to back off. You might not have a clear preference about what comes next, but you're dissatisfied with the uncertainty that comes along with a change of plans. Accept the lack of direction now with an open mind instead of wasting your energy chasing an elusive solution. There's no need to push for clarification ... if you're not careful you could inadvertently open a can of worms that's better left alone."
aquarius,2013-05-20,"You're standing at the edge of a major breakthrough today, but you may be juggling too many tasks to successfully follow up on any one of them. Thankfully, your routine work assignments won't stop you from pursuing a more intriguing adventure. Your commitment might require working late hours, but setting clear priorities allows you to meet your obligations while still having sufficient time to explore a more inspiring path."
pisces,2013-05-20,"Your subconscious mind is sending you powerful messages now, yet they may stem from old fears rather than current events. The more time you put into analyzing your memories today, the more intense your feelings become. There's nothing to be gained by feeding your negativity; instead of reminiscing about your past, focus all your attention on appreciating what's happening in the present moment."
aries,2013-05-21,"You may be eager to resolve a relationship issue today, but the discussion might not go as smoothly as you wish. Unfortunately, hiding your emotions isn't a smart strategy in the long run. Your good intentions won't be enough -- you must also be willing to compromise in order to get what you want. Acknowledge the reality of the other person's feelings first, and then work together to find common ground where you both can stand."
taurus,2013-05-21,"The reliable methods that help you finish your work on another day won't be good enough now because of your unwavering desire to surround yourself with beauty. It isn't sufficient to just answer a nagging question or handle a lingering problem ... today's Libra Moon also wants the solution to be elegant. Nevertheless, you may have to let go of your unrealistic expectations to arrive at a plan that will be practical enough to work. Luckily, making a small sacrifice pays off sooner than you think."
gemini,2013-05-21,"You can breathe a sigh of relief and finally enjoy some playtime now that the Moon is dancing in your 5th House of Fun and Games. Take this opportunity to do something special with children today ... or if that isn't possible, try unleashing your own inner child. Even if you have to throw out previous plans, a spontaneous activity could turn the day into one that is delightful for all involved. Laughter is contagious, so start spreading it around."
cancer,2013-05-21,"You may be feeling some ambiguity about socializing with close friends or family members today. You look forward to relaxing and catching up with everyone, yet you can't help but worry that others might pressure you into taking sides in an ongoing conflict. Spending some time alone could be your wisest option ... there's no need to justify your choices to anyone else. Once you have had a chance to regroup, you can return to the fray in a much clearer state of mind."
leo,2013-05-21,"You prefer to maintain some control over the flow of events, but your long-term planning may fall apart when an unforeseen obstacle slows you down. Instead of struggling to stick to your schedule today, respond with common sense and quick thinking. Take immediate care of the most pressing issues and let the less important ones fall temporarily to the wayside. Setting priorities is a great idea as long as you are flexible when change is required."
virgo,2013-05-21,"You find it difficult to make financial decisions if you're yearning for something that's outside of your budget. But rationalizing your extravagance is a waste of energy now, even if your potential acquisition is a good deal. Save your money and spend it on another day when you are more certain about what you want. A cool and collected approach today can help to stave off unnecessary stress when it's time to pay the bills."
libra,2013-05-21,"Now that the reflective Moon is back in your sign it's even harder to take sides because you can see an issue from both perspectives. Don't give in to someone else's pressure to choose one answer over another unless it's quite clear to you. Your ambivalence may annoy others, but it's also your greatest strength. Maintaining an open mind enables you to save the day as you play the role of a shuttle diplomat, going back and forth until the best solution becomes apparent to all."
scorpio,2013-05-21,"The Moon's visit to your 12th House of Spiritual Mystery amplifies your dreams today, but you may have trouble giving them concrete interpretations. Although you want to understand the symbols of your subconscious mind, you could work yourself into a state of frustration if you assume that everything has a hidden meaning. Excessive analysis can detract from the magic of myth, so trust in the process and let go."
sagittarius,2013-05-21,"You may be discouraged today if you share something significant with your friends, only to receive their disapproval. But they probably aren't as negative as you assume because you could have set your expectations too high before giving anyone a chance. You'll receive more support if you involve others in the process than if you overstate your case in the beginning with a dramatic show and tell. Start off slowly and build a solid foundation before adding another level of complexity."
capricorn,2013-05-21,"If you feel strongly about a current situation, let others know your opinion today instead of playing games and keeping it to yourself. Rather than trying to manage hidden agendas, it's healthier to put everything out on the table so everyone knows exactly where you stand. Don't worry if you meet resistance now ... overcoming people's objections will only serve to strengthen your plan and define your character."
aquarius,2013-05-21,"It might appear as if your friend or partner is jockeying to get credit for something that he or she doesn't deserve. Your annoyance could become an issue because you don't think that others are paying enough attention to you today. Even if you believe that you're being completely objective, you may have biases that arise from a temporary lack of support. Don't blame anyone else for your hurt feelings now -- work on improving your own game."
pisces,2013-05-21,"You have a low tolerance for people who make plenty of promises and then spend too much time on public relations, rather than just doing the work. You don't want to make judgments, but it becomes more challenging if someone doesn't hold up his or her end of the deal now. Unfortunately, openly criticizing others probably won't help the current situation. Take the high road today ... bite your tongue and wait to see what tomorrow brings."
aries,2013-05-22,"You're excited to express what's on your mind today, but by day's end you may wish you hadn't said so much. Even if you believe your ideas are good ones, it's likely that changing your tactics will be in order anyway. Irritating someone with your arrogance rarely works to your advantage. Instead, soften your stance with a bit of humility. Remember that there's a lot you don't know when it comes to the feelings of others. Listen just as much as you speak and you might learn a few surprises along the way."
taurus,2013-05-22,"It's challenging to remain receptive if someone places emotional demands on you today. In fact, you may quickly grow defensive when others make assumptions about your availability without even asking you. Nevertheless, it isn't wise to put up too much resistance now just because you want to prove your independence. Ultimately, you feel at your best when you help out as much as you can without allowing your negativity to stand in the way. Your easygoing nature is appreciated more than you know."
gemini,2013-05-22,"Your goal is to stay neutral in a complex political squabble that's unfolding at work. But you grow less interested in idle chatter and more entangled in the current melodrama as the day wears on. Forget about gossiping and social networking, even if you're enjoying yourself in the moment. You cannot afford to have any distractions vying for your attention now, so re-prioritize your day and concentrate specifically on the tasks at hand."
cancer,2013-05-22,"Your mind is sharp today, yet you might be feeling lingering anxiety as you try to put the pieces of your life back into place. The mists are dissipating and you have more mental clarity now than you have had in a while. Even if you must finish your chores, make some time for creative and playful activities later in the day. And get as much rest as possible tonight so you can build up your immune system and resist the stresses that are still ahead."
leo,2013-05-22,"You wish you had more quiet time so you could revisit childhood memories ... unfortunately, you might not find exactly what you're seeking anyway. Naturally, your perspective continues to evolve, but you still may be reluctant to declare a new allegiance. Thankfully, you gain power from expressing yourself with integrity now. The depth of your convictions is intense so don't be afraid to say what's on your mind today so others know where you stand."
virgo,2013-05-22,"You're doing your best to live your life according to the limitations of other people's rules and expectations. However, coloring within the lines isn't always the best idea for you personally. Don't worry about what anyone else thinks today. Gently pushing beyond your current boundaries should prove to be quite exciting now, especially if you are willing to let your heart be your guide."
libra,2013-05-22,"It isn't easy to be around those who lose their composure over trivial things. But even if you feel like you're the one riding an emotional roller coaster today, you probably have enough common sense to wait for a better moment to express yourself. When the moody Moon leaves your sign this afternoon, it may finally be time to say what's on your mind. Don't be in a hurry -- open up the conversation only when your feet are back on solid ground."
scorpio,2013-05-22,"You're on edge after the evocative Moon enters your intense sign this afternoon, and you could exhaust yourself if your mood swings are too tricky to manage. Fortunately, you can take them in stride if you know what to expect and plan accordingly. Delaying an important decision is wise now, so don't let anyone talk you into making a choice under duress. Be smart and wait until you're completely ready before making your move. In the meantime, take proactive measures and make sure to get plenty of physical exercise and rest."
sagittarius,2013-05-22,"You're riding large waves of feelings that are probably better kept to yourself for a few more days while the Moon transits your 12th House of Privacy. However, it's crucial that your motives are clear if you think you need to keep a secret now. Remember, withholding the truth to gain power is a strategy that will ultimately backfire on you. However, acting for the good of all is an insurance policy that should work well for everyone involved."
capricorn,2013-05-22,"It's hard to act on your good intentions now because your energy feels somewhat scattered. However, as the day wears on you can regain your focus and catch up on the productivity that you lost in the morning. Although it's challenging to trust your intuition today, it's better to override your self-doubt and do something positive, rather than taking no action at all."
aquarius,2013-05-22,"You're feeling very passionate about your job today, which enables you to take on more responsibility without a lot of extra effort. But you aren't in a mood to do everything in the same old way. Don't hold yourself back, even if you think that your actions will surprise your co-workers. You have more latitude now, so shake things up a bit while you can."
pisces,2013-05-22,"You may be dreaming about taking a trip, and no one can talk you out of it no matter how hard they might try. Choose your destination as soon as possible and move forward with your planning. However, don't worry if your adventure doesn't actually happen ... exploring your fantasies without restraint has the potential of opening up all kinds of possibilities you haven't previously considered."
aries,2013-05-23,"A relationship may feel as if it's running out of control, but you aren't too worried because you believe that you can pull everything back together. You might even enjoy all the emotional drama today. Surprisingly, you can actually get what you want if you don't act too impulsively. Slow down your pace and turn up your charm. Your witty ways could score you major bonus points if you remember not to push anything too far."
taurus,2013-05-23,"Unexpected events on this exciting day boost your aspirations and tempt you to reach beyond your current goals. Although you believe that anything is possible, you are also concerned about someone else taking your ideas in a different direction than you want. There's more going on behind the scenes and you're intrigued by the notion of untangling all the threads to figure it out. However, you might do better by stepping back, letting others be in charge for a while and seeing where it all goes."
gemini,2013-05-23,"Brilliant ideas keep popping into awareness all day, enticing you to expect more from the current situation. Unfortunately, your fantasies might be fleeting and quickly fade back into the shadows of your subconscious. Although it's difficult to slow down your thinking process, it's best not to overdo it with too much caffeine or too many mentally stimulating activities. Enjoy the buzz without going over the edge."
cancer,2013-05-23,"You might be dreaming of being on stage today as the Moon moves through your 5th House of Self-Expression, but you probably get nervous thinking about being in front of so many people. If you're unable to follow through with a performance, try exploring other ways to demonstrate your creativity. One key to your current happiness is your willingness to reach out to others ... talking about your fears is a sensible first step to overcoming your own resistance."
leo,2013-05-23,"It's challenging to interact with other people today, only to realize that you are actually facing angels and demons that originate within your own mind. You could be drawn toward unusual experiences, prompting you to step outside of your comfort zone before you are ready. Establishing clear boundaries is a workable strategy, but you still need to follow through by enforcing them when necessary. Thankfully, the power of positive thought is strong enough to overcome your fears and doubts."
virgo,2013-05-23,"You may not be very clear about what is expected from you now, but this ambiguity won't likely prevent you from trying to be everything to everyone. Of course, it makes sense to focus on the clarity you need. However, don't minimize your desires today, even if they seem out of character. Remember that logical analysis can only take you so far ... exploring unfamiliar territory might be just what the doctor ordered."
libra,2013-05-23,"You're tempted to go overboard in order to obtain satisfaction today as obsessive visions of the future drive you further than logical analysis. Meanwhile, expressing your needs is extremely difficult because you don't want to show your vulnerability. Luckily, peace is possible when you can find a healthy balance between appreciating what you have and striving for what you want. Exerting a bit of self-control when setting your goals increases your chances of achieving success."
scorpio,2013-05-23,"It's exhilarating when you express your desires today because what you say actually appears to be heard. You don't want anyone to fix anything ... you only need acknowledgment from someone who won't disappear when the emotional pressure increases. The Moon's current visit to your sign deepens your intensity and pumps up your adrenaline until you are all wound up. Keep in mind that you don't have to push anyone past his or her resistance just because you've already moved through yours. Patience, grasshopper ... all in due time."
sagittarius,2013-05-23,"Your words have more impact than you realize now as the willful Sun in your 7th House of Partnerships aligns with authoritative Saturn. However, rather than motivating others with your inspirational speech, you prefer to set aside your work to pursue simple pleasures. Although having fun is often your top priority, today you have important cosmic messages to deliver first. Putting the needs of someone else ahead of your own gives your heart a chance to shine."
capricorn,2013-05-23,"Your ability to stick to your plan may be tested today, but you should be able to develop the momentum that's required to do the job. Although your route might be a roundabout, veering off course could be the best way to reach your target. Do whatever is necessary to keep your spirits high ... even if you secretly wonder if your current goals are unattainable. Activities such as yoga, meditation and exercise won't increase your productivity, but they can help you find the peaceful balance that you seek."
aquarius,2013-05-23,"Your mind may be crackling with excitement today, and you're unable to settle down. You might even fall in love or, at least, flirt with someone you admire. However, retreating to a more secure place for a while is wise if the action heats up too fast. Emotional connections are extremely important, but you're also wise to spend time listening to what's in your heart. There's no need to do too much all at once since slow and steady change is easier to navigate now than turning your entire life inside out."
pisces,2013-05-23,"The energy on the home front may not feel as stable as you would like today. You have many things you want to say, but you might be fearful that your honesty could stir up more trouble than it's worth. However, worrying about what someone else thinks can prevent you from taking much-needed action. Speak directly from your heart and deal with the consequences as you go along. Thankfully, coming from a place of compassion makes flying by the seat of your pants much easier to manage."
aries,2013-05-24,"You may think you can justify nearly anything you want to do today. Unfortunately, your logic doesn't seem all that rational to someone else. Even with admirable motives, your impulsive behavior stirs up trouble if an over-confident Sagittarius Full Moon Eclipse leads you to do something you will later regret. Keep in mind that it's wise to heed the cautionary advice that you're given now even if it temporarily puts a crimp in your style."
taurus,2013-05-24,"You have great ideas today, but may lack a plan that enables you to successfully reach your goals. Although your footing can be a bit shaky, your sense of urgency motivates you to involve others in your scheme with the Full Moon Eclipse highlighting your 8th House of Deep Sharing. Unfortunately, now isn't the best time to start a project, yet you can't just wait for some magical moment when everything is perfect. Remember, encountering a delay is not a valid reason to give up and walk away."
gemini,2013-05-24,"Your quick wit often helps you smooth over an uncomfortable situation, but you might not be interested in this evasive strategy now with the Full Moon Eclipse rocking your 7th House of Relationships. You aren't willing to hide your feelings any longer, but confronting a significant issue isn't as enjoyable as delivering a snappy comeback. Don't worry about stepping into unfamiliar territory ... your friends and family will jump in to help when they realize that you are attempting to keep it real."
cancer,2013-05-24,"Today's inspirational Full Moon Eclipse rattles your 6th House of Details, drawing your attention to the loose ends that are still left dangling. But being aware of what you must do isn't the same thing as doing it. Don't try to complete everything now; there is no need to apologize for what remains temporarily unfinished. Handling your chores one at a time will help you to concentrate your efforts and accomplish as much as possible."
leo,2013-05-24,"Your thoughts are a bit scattered today, challenging you to follow any one idea to its logical conclusion. Fortunately, the inspirational Sagittarius Full Moon Eclipse activates your 5th House of Self-Expression, freeing you from your own self-limiting beliefs. Just don't get so carried away with all of the amazing possibilities that you turn a practical plan into an unrealistic dream. Nevertheless, it's still better to pick one idea and run with it as far as you can."
virgo,2013-05-24,"You may get caught up in a struggle to balance quantity with quality today as the boundless Sagittarius Full Moon Eclipse in your 4th House of Security pits your appetite for adventure against your need for emotional safety. Unfortunately, your newfound desires might be at odds with your usual preference to focus your energy and be more efficient. Consider this eclipse as an opportunity to practice your powers of discrimination. Wrapping up your work early allows you to do something exciting later in the day."
libra,2013-05-24,"This is an information-intense day with the Full Moon Eclipse shaking up your 3rd House of Communication. Unfortunately, you may have a very strong opinion that isn't necessarily well thought out. You might even become hooked into a debate without actually knowing which side is right. Ironically, withdrawing from the discussion and seeking a quiet place is your smartest strategy for now. Contemplating your own thoughts today is healthier than impulsively overreacting to the outrageous ideas of others."
scorpio,2013-05-24,"It's easy to overestimate your cash flow with the optimistic Sagittarius Full Moon Eclipse illuminating your 2nd House of Money today. On the other hand, you might be fully aware of your financial situation -- yet still decide to take a dream vacation, anyway. Either way, you could end up discouraged if the conditions of your fiscal reality don't measure up to your fantasies. Nevertheless, fretting is a waste of time and energy; it makes much more sense to cut your expenses and save your money, instead."
sagittarius,2013-05-24,"It's nearly impossible to contain your dreams as today's Full Moon Eclipse lights up your exuberant sign. But instead of going off on your own, tag along with a friend or partner since this Lunar Eclipse activates your relationship houses. However, you cannot rely on others for sound advice now since they might encourage your scheme even if it's not very practical. Continue to fine-tune your plans for a few more days before embarking on your next big adventure."
capricorn,2013-05-24,"You prefer to handle your responsibilities early in the day so you can relax later on. But you might feel so overwhelmed today by your ambitious agenda that you just want to hide from everything. Don't despair ... instead of starting on your list of chores right away, the Full Moon Eclipse in your 12th House of Escapism requires you to take your time to contemplate your next move. Once you decide what you need to do first, break the job down into manageable tasks. Successful small steps now assure the steadiest progress."
aquarius,2013-05-24,"The extravagant Sagittarius Full Moon Eclipse falls in your 11th House of Social Networking, tempting you to say yes to every invitation you receive today. Although interacting with others sounds great, you may already be overcommitted. Unfortunately, you can't fully enjoy yourself if you're supposed to be somewhere else. Don't wait until your schedule is out of control; eliminate some of the extraneous activities before you're in over your head. Ironically, you will have more fun if you have less to do."
pisces,2013-05-24,"Today's indulgent Sagittarius Full Moon shines in your 10th House of Career, inspiring you to set unreachable professional goals. But it may quickly become apparent that you cannot live up to your own exaggerated expectations. Ultimately, this Lunar Eclipse can reveal your excesses and require you to restrain your enthusiasm. Gradually apply the brakes to maintain control of your energy before things go awry. Paradoxically, slowing down allows you to reach your destination on time."
aries,2013-05-25,"It's great to be so enthusiastic about your current activities or about what you hope to do in the future, but you must be careful today so you don't exhaust yourself. Often your waves of excitement can come and go quickly. However, you are stepping into new territory now and you may be required to sustain a high level of intensity for an extended period of time. Don't burn all the logs on the fire at once ... a little patience and persistence will serve you well."
taurus,2013-05-25,"You often find it challenging to respond to a lot of change all at once; you typically prefer a slower and more methodical approach to life. However, there is no time to waste now, so you might as well set aside your fears and find a way to flow with the current energy. Don't take your anxiety out on someone else -- resistance really is futile. You may be pleasantly surprised at how quickly you adapt once you completely let go."
gemini,2013-05-25,"Skip that extra cup of coffee this morning; your world is already jumping and you have a much better chance to enjoy the high-frequency buzz if you don't overdo it. Nevertheless, the temptation to say yes may be irresistible because everything sounds so great. Unfortunately, nearly every avenue of exploration is also a possible distraction. Be selective or you'll end up facing the music at the end of the day when you realize all the things you didn't accomplish."
cancer,2013-05-25,"You may choose to set aside your normal concerns so you can take a risk today, but eventually your common sense will most likely prevail. Whatever you decide, you might wish you took the other path. If you go after your heart's desire, don't be afraid of falling short of your goals. And, if you let an opportunity slip by now, don't be hard on yourself because more chances are already on the way. Consider the current situation a practice run for the amazing possibilities ahead."
leo,2013-05-25,"You know what you must do now and you're okay about doing it. Still, you might be left with an empty feeling in the pit of your stomach because something isn't quite right, yet you cannot express your feelings in words. Even if you are extremely busy today, take time for quiet contemplation so you don't lose sight of what's most important to you. Your current bout with self-doubt is alleviated by simply listening to your heart."
virgo,2013-05-25,"Assimilating so much new information all at once can be quite the dilemma. You would prefer if incoming data arrived at a regulated pace so you have time to process the news and open up to what's next. Unfortunately, you could be deprived of this luxury now because you might not be able to slow things down. Fortunately, you can take charge in small ways by filtering out anything that's not pertinent to your immediate future. Set priorities and focus on your work today while leaving the logical analysis for another time."
libra,2013-05-25,"You may want to run and hide from someone today because you would like to minimize the unpredictability and chaos they bring into your life. Although others might seem a bit too wired for your laid-back style, you will probably still miss the exhilaration as soon as you retreat. Simply acknowledging your ambiguity now can help relieve your current level of frustration. Ultimately, you'll enjoy life more if you stop trying to control all the variables."
scorpio,2013-05-25,"You don't usually feel threatened by an emotionally intense interaction because you recognize that it often paves the way to intimacy. But other people's avoidance of an issue now is enough to make you want to scream. Someone could push your buttons if he or she stubbornly resists taking a discussion to the next level. The more you try to bring up the subject, the greater the tension grows. Rise above your current personal agenda and save the talk for another day when others are more willing to meet you halfway."
sagittarius,2013-05-25,"It's nearly impossible for you to relax today because you don't want to miss a thing while you rest. You may be afraid that others will gain a competitive edge over you if you're not up on the latest trends. However, if you do learn something new, you could be annoyed that you must integrate it into your existing perspective because that only means extra work. Stop trying to second-guess what you should or shouldn't do. If it's important, you'll find out about it in due time."
capricorn,2013-05-25,"You want to tell an important story today, but it could be challenging to find the right person to listen. You really don't want to open up your heart to just anyone ... it needs to be someone that truly understands you. But your words may elicit unexpected reactions that derail your original agenda. Nevertheless, you might be happily surprised by what you discover if you're willing to follow a conversation wherever it leads."
aquarius,2013-05-25,"You have grandiose plans that involve others, but it still could get tricky trying to convince them to join you. It's difficult to understand why anyone would resist the possibility of creating a memorable event, but your idea of a good time isn't necessarily the same as everyone else's. Surprisingly, you'll find more fulfillment today if you spend less energy being a ringleader and more time supporting the dreams of your friends."
pisces,2013-05-25,"You may feel like a mother hen today as you try to take everyone under your wings. Be careful; you could push your compassion in action too far by letting your own responsibilities slide while you help one more person who needs your assistance. Remember, even performing good deeds has its limits. Save some time and energy for yourself or you won't have any available for anyone else."
aries,2013-05-26,"You are quite sure of what you want one moment, only to doubt yourself just a few minutes later. This uncomfortable pull between certainty and uncertainty can lead you in circles today, unless you are smart enough to consciously disengage from the cycle. When you understand that you do not have to make any final choices now, you will be able to relax and wait for resolution at a later time."
taurus,2013-05-26,"Your inner world is a source of inspiration today, even if your outer world is full of contradictions and chaos. You might be tempted to search for a solution and then stubbornly fix on it so intently that it's hard to react positively to the changing external events. Fortunately, you can consciously practice being more flexible now because there are four planets traveling through versatile Gemini. Recognizing the need for change is the first step to successfully adapting to a new situation."
gemini,2013-05-26,"Although maintaining anonymity might be appealing to you now, you still prefer being lost in a crowd than left alone. Nevertheless, you can accomplish more if you retreat from the social noise and go about your business by yourself. Even if your priorities aren't clear, just choose a direction and get started. It may take a few days to see any real progress, but focusing on your goals will bring substantial rewards if you are patient."
cancer,2013-05-26,"Your lofty imagination lures you into strange waters today, but the Moon in your 6th House of Work keeps pulling you back to your unfinished chores. Involving your feelings can complicate your recent commitments because it's harder to deal with your uncertainty when you're in the public eye. However, suppressing your emotions will only make you angry. Seek healthy ways to let off steam without alienating your friends and family. Share your dreams instead of your fears and others will admire your courage."
leo,2013-05-26,"You usually have a terrific game plan, even if your big ideas fall flat sometimes. The problem is that you might sound so brilliant today that others endorse your solution, even if it isn't the most practical one. Instead of declaring that your approach is the best one, express your vulnerability and admit that you really don't know what will work. If it's clear that you don't have all the answers, it will give the group an opportunity to put heads together and develop a winning strategy."
virgo,2013-05-26,"You might be your own worst enemy today, especially if you feel like you're channeling the ultimate truth. Normally, you can be very logical, but now your fantasies are all mixed up with your thoughts, tempting you to leave your common sense in the dust. Don't assume that your perspective is better than anyone else's ... there may be other options that you haven't yet considered that deserve a fair chance."
libra,2013-05-26,"You may not be able to graciously accept someone's advice today even if he or she claims to know the answer. Nearly everyone seems to simplify the situation for the sake of expediency while you can't decide what to do. Trust your own intuition if you think that your friends don't have enough information to form a clear opinion, but keep an open mind when hearing out their ideas. Be patient ... a viable solution can be found if you don't lose faith over the days ahead."
scorpio,2013-05-26,"You want to believe that there is a correct path amongst the many, but it appears that there are even more possibilities than you initially realized. You are intrigued with all the different scenarios, yet picking one over the others becomes a daunting task. Don't get lulled into thinking that you must do something definitive today. Wait for the most sensible course of action to surface, even if it takes another day or two. In the meantime, explore your options with an open heart."
sagittarius,2013-05-26,"You may be feeling extremely creative today as super-hero Mars forms an anxious aspect with inventive Uranus. Unfortunately, this isn't a cosmic license to do anything you please, since you're motivated by emotions that aren't necessarily conscious now. Don't talk yourself into believing fairy tales about treasures at the rainbow's end. Aim at a realistic target and try not to lose focus as you continue on your course."
capricorn,2013-05-26,"You're in a very unique position to share your vision of the future -- and luckily -- there's little reason to hold back. Don't worry about being practical today; this is your chance to dream aloud. Keep in mind that you aren't proposing an action plan, so your thoughts need not be strictly grounded in reality. Making up a fantastic story can be more inspiring now than sticking to a step-by-step strategy for success."
aquarius,2013-05-26,"Your head is buzzing with contradictory thoughts today, making it difficult to share them with everyone else. Your friends and co-workers may grow increasingly resistant to your ideas because you appear to know everything, even if you are obviously confused about the facts. Keep in mind that traveling on the two-way street of communication is smoothest when you stop and listen first."
pisces,2013-05-26,"The Moon's visit to your 11th House of Social Networking may trick you into believing that your personal finances are in better shape than they actually are now. Thankfully, you could be riding a productive wave, which increases your chances of receiving recognition for a job well done. Nevertheless, things are not as they seem today, so don't make any more promises until you can clearly see how you're doing on the current ones."
aries,2013-05-27,"You feel lucky today, prompting your hopes to run high. You might even feel as if time is running out, which motivates you to take on more than you can finish. But if everything doesn't fall your way now, you can still set your expectations aside and enjoy yourself anyway. However, if boredom turns to dissatisfaction, bring your thoughts back to the present moment to change your attitude and improve your day."
taurus,2013-05-27,"You might suddenly break out in spontaneous laughter today as you receive an extra boost of confidence from jolly Jupiter, making it tough to be too serious. You can't even try to hide your glee now, but you don't necessarily need to flaunt it, either. Remember, it's all about your attitude. No one can find fault with you for feeling good as long as you continue to share your joy with your friends. Positivity is contagious -- pass it on."
gemini,2013-05-27,"Even if you experience a series of lovely social encounters today, something can still hold you back from fully enjoying yourself. Although you often keep your options open until the very last minute, your fear of getting stuck could backfire when you least expect it. Unfortunately, your nagging worries have the power to prevent you from being really happy now. Take control and don't let negative thoughts hijack an otherwise positive day."
cancer,2013-05-27,"It's challenging to trust what you hear today because everyone seems to be exaggerating. You might want to believe that you are being told the truth, but your instincts tell you that something isn't quite right. Everything sounds too perfect, considering that your insecurities could make for an unnecessarily hard judge. Thankfully, you may be pleasantly surprised if you let go of your fears and just be open to what happens. Accepting the abundance isn't always easy, but it's the lesson you must learn now."
leo,2013-05-27,"You should be quite happy with your productivity today, as long as you can keep your attention on your goals. However, you could also end up blaming others for your own lack of concentration if you don't get a lot of work finished. Don't be so quick to judge the situation. Remember that there are many ways to measure success and you might make significant progress now without yet having the tangible results to show for it."
virgo,2013-05-27,"You are running on a creative high today, yet you may be content to just take a nature walk, stroll through an art museum or listen to a new band. Unfortunately, no matter what you do, your inspiration must ultimately come from within. Therefore, you will be happier now if you don't avoid the hard work of making something yourself. Sharing your gifts with others could feel like a heavy responsibility unless it comes directly from the heart."
libra,2013-05-27,"You may be feeling confident about an unusual relationship that might have had you feeling down only a few days ago. Thankfully, luck is on your side now as optimistic Jupiter comes to your rescue. Nevertheless, too much self-assuredness could turn things tricky if you follow your bliss without stopping to think about someone else's needs. As always, it's smart to ask others what they want before blindly stumbling ahead with your plans. Compromise works in everyone's favor."
scorpio,2013-05-27,"This is a great day to initiate a major project because nearly anything you start today will likely be blessed. Although wealth and happiness may be fleeting, today's joyful Jupiter aspects make it seem as if bountiful rewards are close at hand. The material world is more tempting now than usual. Your willpower is on the line, so keep striving toward living the kind of life you want to lead without letting extravagant behavior pull you off course."
sagittarius,2013-05-27,"You are eager to exaggerate the facts today as your key planet Jupiter magnifies chatty Mercury. You could become so obsessive about an idea that it monopolizes your whole day. But practicing a sensible amount of restraint may be sufficient to prevent you from going overboard. However, it's not necessary to go to the other extreme by pushing away a potentially enjoyable experience. Just be smart and establish appropriate limits so you don't get into any trouble later."
capricorn,2013-05-27,"Your friends may believe that you're overreacting today. However, you are much more stable than you appear. There are two different perspectives unfolding now. The first is about your current eagerness to try nearly anything new. The other story is about your unrelenting determination. Remember, there is a calm energy around you these days; if you're willing to dive beneath the rough waters, you can find peace and share it with others."
aquarius,2013-05-27,"You may feel as invincible as a super-hero today, but your secret weapon is safe from the inquisitive minds of others. Your current powers stem from your subconscious mind, beyond the sensory perceptions of anyone else. Although exploring these hidden non-physical realms can be transformational now, don't lose touch with the real world in the process."
pisces,2013-05-27,"Your current optimism may be confusing today, especially if others seem to be critical of your new plans. You don't understand their negativity and might respond by placing more trust in your faith than in planning. However, attending to details now pays off in the long run. You have an excellent chance to make some money and even have a bit of fun along the way if you can keep your unrestrained enthusiasm in check."
aries,2013-05-28,"You may be very comfortable with your current mode of operation, even if you have to deal with minor annoyances such as going to work, paying bills or juggling other responsibilities. However, a sudden change of circumstances might require you to set aside your previous agenda to capitalize on an unexpected opportunity. Your flexible attitude could lead to an entirely new way of reaching your goals as long as you don't assume that you already have all the answers. A bit of humility works wonders today."
taurus,2013-05-28,"Opulent Jupiter joins luscious Venus to fill your world with abundance now. Fortunately, too much of a good thing can still feel pretty darn good today. Although your senses are awakening, you might feel rather lazy. It would be a perfect day if your noisy thoughts didn't get in the way. Nevertheless, it makes good sense to enjoy yourself as much as you can while the stars are on your side."
gemini,2013-05-28,"You magically pull one brilliant idea after another out of thin air today without much apparent effort. You make it look easy because you're having so much fun expressing your originality. However, turning a clever thought into something useful is more challenging. Still, there's no need to struggle. Let go of your desire for a specific final outcome; staying open to all the possibilities increases your chances for success."
cancer,2013-05-28,"It's tempting to gloss over an important fact today, especially if reality gets in the way of your plans. You may be more concerned with experiencing pleasure now than you are with uncovering the truth, so you're not likely to step too far out of line for the sake of integrity. A little bit of self-indulgence is fine; just don't overdo it or you'll spend too much time later recovering from your lack of good judgment."
leo,2013-05-28,"Today's delightful Venus-Jupiter conjunction  sweetens your 11th House of Social Networking, encouraging you to express your generosity toward others. It's easy to overcome any uncertainty that may be stirred if you need to put your reputation on the line. Thankfully, the potential rewards seem great enough that the risk isn't difficult to justify now. However, it still pays to have a sensible plan before you embark on your next adventure."
virgo,2013-05-28,"A big-hearted supporter could enter your life now, bringing a business opportunity or a chance to further your dreams. Receiving a generous gift is another possible manifestation of the wonderful Venus-Jupiter conjunction falling in your 10th House of Status. No matter what happens, you're likely to be pleasantly surprised. There are no cosmic guarantees, but be ready to graciously accept what is being offered to you at this time."

However, the sweet Venus-Jupiter conjunction in your 9th House of Adventure suggests that you're willing to take a chance if something sounds intriguing. These are exciting times now as shocking Uranus releases a surprise, revealing a few twists and turns. Be smart; take care of your obligations early in the day so you're free to respond to an unexpected opportunity with open arms."

It's easy to just say yes because nearly anything you do today will serve to further your goals. Your passionate nature is your greatest asset now. Don't be overly concerned if you cannot figure out where the currents are carrying you. Just jump in and enjoy the ride.
sagittarius,2013-05-28,"Your success today may depend upon your ability to combine your individual creativity with your persuasive charm. Friends and associates have the skills and resources you need, making it difficult to accomplish your goals on your own. Paradoxically, being productive isn't as important now as feeling good about your work. If you can find a way to enjoy yourself, you might be happily surprised at how easy it is to get along with those who want to help you."
capricorn,2013-05-28,"Relaxing may not feel like an option today, especially if you get swept up in the anticipation of what might happen next. Even if something wonderful catches you off guard, it's challenging for you to stop working long enough to enjoy it. Luckily, you can make a conscious decision to bask in the sweetness of the present moment instead of running off to something else. Gently remind yourself to stay put each time you get the urge to move on."
aquarius,2013-05-28,"Today's lovely Venus-Jupiter conjunction blesses your 5th House of Fun and Games, making it tough to miss the positive effects of this cosmic gift. You're able to step gracefully into the spontaneous flow of events, inspiring others with your soaring optimism. However, you can take the everything-is-beautiful approach too far; a sudden twist of fate could be a wake-up call from the future reminding you to pay closer attention to reality."
pisces,2013-05-28,"It's nearly impossible for anyone to bring you down today because delicious Venus dances with your key planet Jupiter in your 4th House of Security. Paradoxically, your unrestrained confidence can put someone else in distress unless you moderate your enthusiasm. You should be able to make a positive impression more easily now, but no one likes a know-it-all. Express your joy in a supportive manner without flaunting it unnecessarily."
aries,2013-05-29,"Hard work combined with a bit of enthusiasm may have the desired impact today, but you still could have trouble concentrating on a specific task. Instead, you're looking around, searching for something that's more interesting than your current responsibilities. However, you won't likely find satisfaction because you want more, no matter how much excitement you experience. You will be happier in the long run if you remember to appreciate what you have while honoring your commitments in the present moment."
taurus,2013-05-29,"Your key planet, Venus, continues to inspire you to ask for what you want now. Unfortunately, you might incorrectly jump to the conclusion that you should get whatever you wish. But the world doesn't owe you the comfort you believe you deserve. Ironically, releasing your attachment to personal gratification today could actually make it easier to obtain your heart's desire."
gemini,2013-05-29,"You may feel even more socially driven today than usual, but your youthful eagerness might be annoying to your friends and associates. Your exuberance makes it difficult for you to respect people's boundaries because you won't likely take the time to consider their feelings. Fortunately, your good intentions should pull you through now. Step back just enough to give others the space they need and remain open so you don't miss the constructive feedback you're offered."
cancer,2013-05-29,"If someone you like seems to be cooling off today, it's helpful to recognize your role in the current situation. You might not even be aware of the mixed messages you've been sending lately. Although you may desire an emotional connection, your words and actions could be demonstrating something else. Thankfully, you can easily change the dynamics by simply talking about your feelings, even if it isn't comfortable at first. Honesty cultivates trust."
leo,2013-05-29,"It can feel scary when you open your heart, especially if others can't match your fiery intensity. You may overcompensate by demonstrating how emotionally detached you are from the outcome, instead of admitting how much you really care. Rather than keeping score, remember that everyone expresses love differently. Your fears begin to dissipate when you graciously accept what is currently being offered without further judgment or comparison."
virgo,2013-05-29,"The Moon's visit to humanitarian Aquarius while the Sun is traveling through your 10th House of Public Responsibility prompts you to get more involved with a social cause. You can be of great service if your goals are consistent with a larger group. But if your idea of success isn't shared by others, you may feel out of place. Thankfully, you aren't seeking recognition so you don't necessarily want anything in return for your good deeds. Relishing the feeling that you did something of value is enough of a reward now for your contribution."

But this isn't just about making an artistic statement; it's about reasserting your personal connection to a higher spiritual purpose and expressing yourself in a way that empowers others to see their own true nature.

scorpio,2013-05-29,"The independent Aquarius Moon is traveling through your 4th House of Home and Family today, reconfirming your desire to get away so you can gain perspective on your personal life. If you are entangled in emotional issues, it's wise to escape from them for a bit, instead of trying to decide under pressure what to do next. Although stepping back won't solve the underlying issue, it can help you see what's really going on with more objectivity."
sagittarius,2013-05-29,"You may not be able to separate the cause from the effect today. Even if you think you're being sufficiently rational, you can't discern your perceptions from your feelings. Although your logic is clear, remember that your facts are still dependent upon opinions. You can find yourself in hot water now if too many people believe that you possess the right answer when all you really have is a unique point of view."
capricorn,2013-05-29,"The evocative Moon's current visit to your 2nd House of Finances tempts you to spend money on a technological toy that you might not need. You may recall a time from your childhood when you coveted something but couldn't afford it. Or perhaps you recollect an event when you weren't allowed to buy what you wanted. But don't make a purchase for the wrong reasons now. Wait a day or two before deciding on your potential acquisition ... if it still seems like a good idea, go for it."
aquarius,2013-05-29,"You may pride yourself in being an independent thinker. However, you could become emotionally hooked to what others feel today because the moody Moon in your sign directly influences your heart. Even if you attempt to show how cool you are by remaining flexible, your real desires are still readily apparent. Don't bury your feelings now -- take a risk and reveal your insecurities to someone you trust."
pisces,2013-05-29,"You might attempt to come clean by expressing your feelings today. But if you aren't ready to open up just yet, you should be able to get away with keeping your emotions to yourself for a while longer. Go ahead and enjoy your private daydreams while you still can.

Be careful now; your anger isn't created by anyone other than yourself. When you change your perspective, everything else about the day changes too."
taurus,2013-05-30,"An innovative coworker or acquaintance may act as a catalyst today by simply showing you an unfamiliar path. You're unusually excited about exploring new territory at work, so you might be overly eager to charge ahead without worrying about the consequences. Unfortunately, moving forward too quickly can be more complicated now than doing nothing at all. If possible, find a way to honor your desire for change without jeopardizing your stability in the process."
gemini,2013-05-30,"You have an unconventional approach to leadership today that may include suddenly taking charge without considering other people's feelings. Ironically, your peers are turning to you for guidance while you secretly wish everyone would take more personal responsibility now. Whatever happens, this is your chance to march in the front of the parade instead of cheering from the sidelines. Remember, you can set a wonderful example by being sensitive to the needs of others."
cancer,2013-05-30,"Your common sense prevents you from taking an unnecessary detour today, especially if you check in with your intuition to see what's around the next corner. Unfortunately, others might resist following your lead now because they don't trust your premonitions. Keep in mind that you can still hold onto your dreams, even if you don't initially receive the support that you want. Acting with conviction inspires more people to join in your efforts as time goes by."
leo,2013-05-30,Expressing your changing perspective today is more challenging than trying to hit a moving target. Something dear to you could become an emotional trap that lures your idealistic hopes so far off track that it's difficult to find your way back. Once again it feels as if time is running out; acting immediately really is a smarter strategy than waiting for a better moment. Trust your instincts and take a leap of faith.
virgo,2013-05-30,"Your coworkers seem to have a few surprises up their collective sleeves, yet it's crucial to take everything in stride today. However, it isn't wise to relinquish total control now, although employing some flexibility and faith will surely help. Ultimately, accepting change isn't as problematic as your fear of uncertainty. Try to keep calm, even if your sense of stability is tested; it's amazing how quickly a fresh attitude can shift the energy in a positive direction."
libra,2013-05-30,"You might seem rebellious as you seek ways to express your excess energy today. However, you could exhaust yourself if you're running on pure adrenaline. Be sure to take care of yourself physically since you'll still need to give an extra push sooner or later so that others will pay attention to what you are doing. Nevertheless, don't count on anyone else to help you through this hectic phase; instead of waiting to be bailed out, show everyone your true colors and do it yourself."
scorpio,2013-05-30,"You have good intentions to stay even-tempered today, but a trivial misunderstanding between friends may create some emotional trouble. Although you need your independence now, you're not necessarily trying to avoid intimacy. Nevertheless, stop and consider how your actions might be impacting others. A compassionate approach enables you to strike a healthy balance between deepening a meaningful connection and maintaining a bit of detachment."
sagittarius,2013-05-30,"Transitions are typically tough, and your personal life may be thrown for a loop now if a new scene starts to emerge before the old one has faded away. The current situation could be complicated even more by a lack of concern for someone's emotional security. There's no need to force your solution onto others. You'll be happier in the long run if everyone has a say in deciding what happens next. Take time to ask the important questions and then make sure to listen closely to the answers you receive."
capricorn,2013-05-30,"You might think it's smart to stick to your preconceived agenda today, but the more you try to hold it together, the less likely you'll stay in control. It's much better now if you can be more fluid in your thinking, making decisions throughout the day instead of being tied to a rigid schedule. Although your self-esteem may be tested, you should be able to accomplish plenty if you are a bit less ambitious and a lot more flexible."
aquarius,2013-05-30,"The Moon's visit to your sign enables you to rapidly shift your perspective. But your conceptual breakthrough won't just arrive out of the blue. You have thought long and hard about your direction in life and when you learn something new, you try to integrate it into your core beliefs. Even if you feel extra pressure to take your current ideas public, remember to listen to your own instincts before you just do what you're told. Following your heart is the only solution that makes sense."
pisces,2013-05-30,"Although you may be quite serious about the decisions ahead, others could read you entirely wrong today. Someone may even accuse you of being immature or irresponsible, but neither of these labels actually fits. Nevertheless, it's a mistake to engage in an open conflict now, for arguing only increases the polarization. It's probably best to keep your thoughts to yourself until tomorrow when everyone will likely have a brighter perspective."
aries,2013-05-31,"Even if you want to be the leader of the pack, you might be growing tired of having to fight to prove your point. However, giving in isn't nearly as simple as it sounds because whatever you gain from relinquishing control may not be worth it. Fortunately, you'll probably win any argument that you start today because fiery Mars moves into witty Gemini, providing just the words you need as your adrenaline rises. Just remember you don't have to make anyone else wrong for you to be right."
taurus,2013-05-31,"Your friends seem to be so scattered today that you can't figure out what motivates them. Ironically, you may grow to appreciate their lack of practicality as your emotions begin to take precedence over logic now. Even if you can't rationally justify your choices, listen to your peers and take a risk to follow your heart's desire."
gemini,2013-05-31,"You may have a difficult time staying on track today as feisty Mars bounces into your inquisitive sign. Every thought that passes through your mind opens a door to another string of fantasies. Although you consider resisting your daydreams now, your mental meanderings could take you on quite a pleasant journey. Enjoy the diversions, but don't let them interfere with your plans for the day. Wander through your imagination, but remember to return to your real work back on Earth."
cancer,2013-05-31,"The boundaries that separate your feelings from those around you are thin now, making it difficult to distinguish which reactions are valid. Your compassion is running strong today as trickster Mercury slips into your emotionally sensitive sign and you want to help anyone less fortunate than you. Instead of jumping in with a quick fix, contemplate how every person is equal from a spiritual perspective. Remember that caring for yourself first enables you to better nurture others in the long run."
leo,2013-05-31,"You may want to help rescue an underdog today, but this altruism clashes with your admiration of a real winner. Nevertheless, your idea of a top dog isn't necessarily a traditional one, since you intrinsically understand that success goes way beyond fame and fortune. Although you can easily admire a kind and creative person who is willing to take a risk, there are others that might also appreciate your generous assistance now.  Everyone benefits when you shine your love light."
virgo,2013-05-31,"The boundless Pisces Moon's presence in your 7th House of Others can make everyone seem confused, but you're probably just projecting your own feelings today. It's as if your friends and associates don't know what to do next and are looking to you for guidance. You could become frustrated and get annoyed if someone can't clearly express his or her intentions in a simple dialogue. Be gentle; remember that when you're judging anyone else now, you're also judging yourself."
libra,2013-05-31,"You must focus your physical and mental energy in order to take care of today's business, but you're not likely in the mood to concentrate. This resistance isn't about laziness; you have plenty of stamina to fulfill everyone's expectations. Instead, you're bored doing the same old routine and are eager to use your creative talents elsewhere. Shake up your workday by doing something totally out of the ordinary without asking for  anyone's approval first."
scorpio,2013-05-31,You may feel more like a Fish than a Scorpion today with the dreamy Pisces Moon visiting your 5th House of Self-Expression. But you're not necessarily interested in playing anyone else's game now; you want to make up your own rules that move you closer to your goals. Compromise and meet someone halfway; it will be much less stressful than you think and much more rewarding than going it alone.
sagittarius,2013-05-31,"You could be under your own magic spell today that makes you believe everything is copasetic on the home front. Nevertheless, it's more important to be realistic than optimistic now since the haze of your ideals can cloud your sound judgment. It's wise to delay a big decision for a while longer. Fortunately, clarity should begin to return later in the day if you're willing to ask someone you trust for advice."
capricorn,2013-05-31,"Normally, you can be quite methodical when communicating your ideas, so be patient today if your closest confidants tell you that they don't understand you. Ironically, you could probably repeat what you said and they will still miss your point. However, don't give up; continue to recycle back to the basics and you'll soon see the light bulbs of awareness turn on one by one over their heads."
aquarius,2013-05-31,"Watch your spending today because you may be lost in a fantasy about purchasing something special to change your image. Unfortunately, money won't buy happiness, even if you're hooked by the idea of acquiring a piece of artwork, furniture or jewelry. Looking at material possessions as the source of satisfaction will ultimately leave you feeling frustrated. It's time to turn your thoughts inward and consider what you can do to improve your life, rather than dreaming about what you could own."
pisces,2013-05-31,"Don't worry if your moods get the best of you now because the Moon is in your sign and aligned with irrational Neptune. Acknowledge your feelings while remembering that you don't have to express every reaction. You can't control all of the circumstances in your life, but you can manage how you respond. Taking a few deep breaths when you feel emotionally overwhelmed may be sufficient to shift your attitude in a positive direction."
aries,2013-06-01,"Hiding out sounds like a great plan for the day, especially if you've been burning the candle at both ends. Fortunately, you won't have to worry about being alone for long because you are never too far from the action. Nevertheless, it's time to rest and coast for a bit while you can. Once the Moon returns to your fiery sign tomorrow, you'll be champing at the bit and no one will be able to stop you in your pursuit of happiness."
taurus,2013-06-01,"You aren't interested in agreeing to everything that's asked of you today, especially since you don't like to waste energy jumping from one project to another. Actually, it makes sense to schedule some time when you can just chill out and dream about your future, rather than running around trying to please everyone. However, keep in mind that you can't avoid being part of the group for too long, so take advantage of the time you have now to relax and take care of yourself."
gemini,2013-06-01,"Paying extra attention to career matters is a smart plan now that the Moon is visiting your 10th House of Public Responsibility. However, your dreams can overtake reality when you're thinking about your professional objectives. Instead of assuming that anything is possible, temper your vision with a bit of pragmatism. You can't just believe your way to success; you also need a sound strategy and the determination to follow through with it."
cancer,2013-06-01,"Your emotional involvement in setting long-term goals makes it challenging today to separate your desires from reality. You might believe that your perception of a current situation is valid, yet it's colored by your opinions more than you realize. Instead of being overly judgmental now, simply describe an event the best you can, without showing your bias. There will be plenty of time later to express your feelings when it really counts."
leo,2013-06-01,"Your intuitive sense is functioning very well today, enabling you to know what's going on beneath the surface. You don't need anyone to tell you the details, but you should be careful because your perspective may be warped by an old fear that now comes back to haunt you. It's healthy to remember what happened as long as you understand the difference between the present and the past. Trust your instincts and follow your heart."
virgo,2013-06-01,"You may be concerned that you're too busy today, but you don't see any way to cut back on your activities. You're known for your reliability and typically do as others expect, but your dreams can be more pressing now than your current responsibilities. There's no reason to frustrate yourself by trying to bridge the gap between reality and your imagination. Give yourself permission to explore all the amazing possibilities without having to make any of them come true."
libra,2013-06-01,"You can't seem to make much progress today because your idealism is fueling your strategy and your plans may not be concrete enough. Unfortunately, your grand ideas won't fit into the narrow confines of a calendar or a spread sheet. You'll be happier now if you take action when you feel like it, rather than forcing your creativity to conform to someone else's clock. Don't worry ... ultimately, your big dreams will lead you to success."
scorpio,2013-06-01,"A creative stream of images flood into your awareness now, but you might have a tricky time expressing your ideas. Although you may have a very clear picture established in your mind, it fades as your day unfolds. If you want to start a project that truly captures your imagination, do it today. Don't wait for anyone's approval because your excitement could begin to dissipate unless you act soon."
sagittarius,2013-06-01,"Today's Pisces Moon may feel like the beginning of an end because you think you're ready to call it quits. You want to start something new, but you could be jumping the gun. Stick to what you're doing for another day or two, even if you're already bored. You'll gain more now by sinking into your feelings about your past than distracting yourself by prematurely changing your direction. Exploring your personal history lays a strong foundation for relationships in the present."
capricorn,2013-06-01,"It's challenging to manage your time effectively today as the diffusive Pisces Moon moves through your 3rd House of Immediate Environment. You might even miss an important appointment. But reining in control by paying attention to details won't work either, for someone else may be the source of trouble now. Practice detachment and let your plans unravel a bit if they must. Don't worry; you'll be able to put the pieces back together in a way that will work better than your original agenda anyhow."
aquarius,2013-06-01,"A full-on effort to demonstrate how important your values are won't stop others from ignoring you if they disagree with your ideas. You still might try your hand at making an impassioned plea to muster support for your point of view. Fortunately, your words may have more of a impact than you realize at first. Say what's on your mind and then let it go. Don't judge your progress right away because it could take a while before you notice any tangible results."
pisces,2013-06-01,"The Moon's monthly visit to your sign usually intensifies the colors of your dreams. However, the edges of reality are softened now, luring you into believing something that may be quite irrational. Don't try to distinguish the differences between fact and fiction today as you flip back and forth without much concern for logic. See what changes the next few days bring before you make up your mind about what is really true."
aries,2013-06-02,"A heightened sense of urgency today provokes you to express yourself, no matter what you are feeling. Your self-confidence enables you to try several different strategies as you search for the most efficient one to complete your work. However, caution is advised because a wild and unpremeditated approach might cause more problems than it's worth. Although you can think quickly on your feet, acting more slowly now is the way of the wise."
taurus,2013-06-02,"An obsession with your wish for a longer weekend could spoil an otherwise fine time. Nothing is to be gained from complaining, so change your attitude and transform your frustration into action. Don't waste energy imagining how you can improve your life today; instead, just do it. By turning your discontent into a positive force now, you should be able to enjoy the day more than you expect."
gemini,2013-06-02,"You are ready for nearly anything that sounds like fun today, but your impulsive reactions could over-complicate your life. Your lighthearted style can quickly turn an uneventful family function into a thoroughly enjoyable party. Be adventurous and take a risk if everything looks good, but before you do anything be sure to establish sensible limits -- and then set a good example by following them."
cancer,2013-06-02,"Your self-esteem may be soaring today, but it could also lead you into trouble. One of your greatest strengths is your patience; normally, you are able to wait until the right moment before taking action. Although watching for traps can prevent foolish behavior, it might also cause you to miss a great opportunity now. Even if you're ready to jump quickly into something new, a little extra forethought never hurts."
leo,2013-06-02,"It's tough to settle down today because you're distracted by imagining your travels to a mountain retreat or a desert isle. However, there's no restraining your dreams now. Nevertheless, turning a fantasy into reality may be more challenging than you think. Remember, anything is possible, so don't give up on your grand adventure until you have exhausted all your options."
virgo,2013-06-02,"You may be intrigued by something you don't know now. You realize that you're missing a part of the picture and this uncertainty motivates you to delve deep beneath the surface to uncover what's hidden. You might even strike it rich by discovering a fantastic treasure trove of information that leads you into a new discipline. But don't struggle too much if you can't find all the facts, since you might already have all the answers you need."
libra,2013-06-02,"A friend might appear very assertive or even aggressive now, suddenly taking charge of a difficult conversation with a less meaningful train of thought. You don't want to expose your vulnerability in light of someone else's negativity. Instead of being defensive and putting up protective walls if others are on your case, just watch where the discussion goes until you understand the source of the current emotional charge. Biding your time prevents you from overreacting in the moment and then regretting it later."
scorpio,2013-06-02,"Shake up your weekend routine and go have some fun today. Of course, you may need to schedule your little escape for later in the day because you can't simply walk away from your current commitments. You should be able to finish your chores in a hurry because you can produce a prodigious amount of work in a very short amount of time by focusing your attention. All you need to do is find your voice, state your intentions, and concentrate on what's left to finish."
sagittarius,2013-06-02,"A creative breakthrough prompts you to take immediate action today. Although it's often smarter to wait a while before charging ahead, this time you don't need to be afraid to shoot from the hip. Taking careful aim is advised when you have the time. However, don't hold back now; the fastest response contains your purest of intentions and produces the strongest impact."
capricorn,2013-06-02,"It seems as if social rules have been rewritten, allowing you to say what you mean today without having to worry about what other people think. Hiding your feelings won't bring you what you want. Nevertheless, it's hard to know what to do when discussing topics that make you uncomfortable. Contemplating your actions ahead of time doesn't help now; it only makes you more nervous. Be brave and start talking; he who hesitates is lost."
aquarius,2013-06-02,"Your words pack quite a punch today and the power of your convictions could scare someone close to you. Although you may not feel angry, you're still willing to fight for what you want. Others might be confused by the uncharacteristic emotionality of your intentions now; assure them that you mean no harm and that you're just very passionate about your position. Then take a more straightforward approach and tell your story as objectively as possible."
pisces,2013-06-02,"Something is about to change, but you can't quite put your finger on what it is. You might believe that good news awaits you around the next corner, even if your emotions are raw and you're completely exhausted. You're on edge today because it's difficult to express your feelings. Rather than trying to describe your point of view, just act on your gut instincts. Actions speak louder than words, and you can always explain yourself later on, if necessary."
aries,2013-06-03,"You're not inclined to start a project today unless you already have a concrete plan in place. Fortunately, you're able to think through several contingencies and map out a sound strategy. But don't let logic limit your options; it's smarter to combine your rational approach with visionary ideas. Don't give up too soon; your unwavering commitment to reach your goals is the best way to ensure your success."
taurus,2013-06-03,"It's crucial to practice self-discipline today because you might struggle if you try to accomplish too much now. Nevertheless, you have an excellent opportunity to finish what you start if you establish attainable goals and then concentrate only on the most essential tasks. Positive thinking is a definite plus as long as you don't assume that your attitude is the only thing that matters."
gemini,2013-06-03,"Your ruling planet Mercury is working overtime today to smooth over the rough spots in your life. Unfortunately, your ability to rationalize is so natural that you could be the victim of your own cleverness. Be careful not to sidestep an unpleasant discussion now because denial can come back and make things difficult later on. Believe it or not, facing the truth isn't as tough as running from it."
cancer,2013-06-03,"You excel at communicating your feelings now that chatty Mercury is in your sign; unfortunately, even a close friend might not fully understand your perspective. The problem is that some complex emotions do not fit into language; something can be lost in translation unless others understand the intentions behind your words. Remember that your actions also speak loudly, so make sure your behavior is consistent with the message you're trying to get across."
leo,2013-06-03,"Although you might not seem insecure, you still may be concerned with a coworker's emotional response today. Your strategy could backfire if you try to hide your anxiety by being purposefully vague. Ultimately, it's wiser to disclose as much information as possible, even if you do it gradually. Your supporters can help you even more if they are fully informed. Thankfully, there's no reason to carry your burden alone."
virgo,2013-06-03,"Today you might be able to get away with some sloppy thinking or even fall for a bit of trickery as long as you don't take things too far. Your planetary ruler Mercury receives positive vibes from authoritative Saturn and compassionate Neptune, enabling you to turn on the charm while maintaining a sense of control. Thankfully, others will probably cut you some slack if your logic falters as long as you remain true to your spirit and let your imagination run free."
libra,2013-06-03,"You often minimize your needs to make a situation more pleasant for someone else. However, you could go overboard today, trying to fix an emotional melodrama that really isn't your responsibility. Nosing around in other people's affairs rarely helps anyone, but you can still be a true friend by listening and showing your support. Caring for those you love is wonderful as long as you remember to take care of yourself, too."
scorpio,2013-06-03,"Your emotional needs are often complex, prompting you to keep them to yourself. However, your dreams are wildly vivid now and you may be even less interested in having others involved with your inner process. But you don't have to close yourself off completely; confiding in another person can help you process your feelings and deepen your relationship. Give yourself permission to wait until you're ready to share your fantasies with someone you trust."
sagittarius,2013-06-03,"You're lost in a sea of deep thinking now, but you might not want to go public with your thoughts. Nevertheless, you could come across as if your emotions aren't very important, especially if you talk about them in an offhand manner. Ironically, you may believe that changes are occurring, even if nothing is happening yet. Be courageous and seek your voice. Take a risk and express what's really in your heart."
capricorn,2013-06-03,"Although fulfilling your obligations quickly fills up your schedule, you still might believe that you can fit more activities into your day. Unfortunately, even the time you set aside for relaxation is rapidly disappearing now. Thankfully, you're able to keep your schedule from falling apart by making smart choices before anything gets out of hand. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure."
aquarius,2013-06-03,"You may feel uncomfortable if a conversation at work becomes too personal today. Perhaps you have an emotional moment, provoking you to say more than you normally might share and inspiring a real heart-to-heart connection. Although it could feel great at first, the mood likely grows awkward as the discussion continues. Don't withdraw completely or you might undo the potentially positive consequences of breaking down an unspoken and unnecessary boundary."
pisces,2013-06-03,"It's tempting to slip into a caretaker role today because you are so empathic when it comes to the feelings of your friends. It may be a real challenge to avoid playing the role of a martyr now, but giving away too much of yourself too quickly might turn compassion into resentment in the blink of an eye. On the other hand, you can truly help those you love in the long run if you remember to maintain healthy boundaries when opening your heart."
aries,2013-06-04,"You might inadvertently step on someone's toes as warrior Mars aspects independent Uranus. But you may not even notice how reckless your behavior is today because the self-directed Aries Moon urges you to act first and think later. However, a knee-jerk response can get you into trouble because your immediate reaction could be off the mark. Take the time to play out all the alternatives in your mind before picking the best one."
taurus,2013-06-04,"You're anticipating the Moon's return to sensible Taurus today and you want to make the most of it. Opening your heart to your desires is the healthiest strategy now, but you may find it difficult to distinguish your fickle attractions from what's absolutely critical. Make separate lists for your needs and your wishes to help you prioritize what's in front of you. Knowing what's real empowers you to make better decisions in the long run."
gemini,2013-06-04,"You cannot prevent the noise from reaching your ears today, even if the words don't offer the hint of a solution. Irrepressible Mars in your sign spurs you to initiate conversations by firing your thoughts into a stream of consciousness. However, the wild emotional waters morph into a gently meandering river later in the day. Your sense of urgency might dissipate, but your conviction won't. Don't put off making a big decision if you already know what you want."
cancer,2013-06-04,"You might show your strong and silent side today so others don't realize how lost you are feeling. Your thoughts race around in circles like a hamster on a wheel, making it difficult to reach a logical conclusion about what's happening. Your current strategy is to keep your insecurities quiet rather than acknowledging any confusion. Although you're correct to believe you should only share business matters on a need-to-know basis, discussing your fears with a trusted friend can help you feel much better about the situation."
leo,2013-06-04,"Although you may be pushing to finish a significant project, it appears that it might take longer than you first expected. You're tempted to blame someone else for your delay, but the current obstacles are most likely in your way because of you. Pay attention to both the wise encouragement and the fearful restraint of the universe; slow down your pace now while you still can solve the problems in front of you."
virgo,2013-06-04,"Finish your big tasks early in the day since you might become more lackadaisical once the Moon enters stable Taurus. Instead of worrying about everything you want to accomplish now, you're more interested in avoiding stress. Even if you think you're being practical by maintaining the status quo, you could be rationalizing your current resistance to change. Adopting a more flexible attitude may lead to a sweet surprise as the day unfolds."
libra,2013-06-04,"You don't like being put on the spot, especially if it's on your own territory. However, you might choose not to express your annoyance today because you can also see things from other points of view. Following the course of least resistance is the smartest response for now. Luckily, you can make any performance a successful one. Keep your personal opinions private until you are absolutely sure of your final answer."
scorpio,2013-06-04,"You can easily exhaust yourself today as you run through a mental obstacle course over and over again. However, each time you attempt to manage the resistance in the same manner you believe that your strategy will work. Unfortunately, you could end up wasting valuable resources by relying on old tactics. You may be pleasantly surprised by the outcome if you take a radically different approach now."
sagittarius,2013-06-04,"It feels as if you're running out of time, so stop procrastinating ... sort things out and initiate a new plan of action. Don't fret if there are still miscellaneous details to uncover now. You should be able to fill in more missing pieces as the day unfolds. Grab the opportunity while it lasts; take advantage of the enterprising Aries Moon's presence in your 5th House of Expression before the energy mellows later this afternoon."
capricorn,2013-06-04,"You can't rush anything now; although you want to create something constructive for your future. You will intuitively know the right moment to make your move. Keep in mind that your mental preparation is the key ingredient in realizing success for your current enterprise. You are being tested today, so narrow your vision and concentrate solely on accomplishing your goals. Monitor your progress and nudge yourself back on track if you're lured off course for any reason."
aquarius,2013-06-04,"You're willing to connect with nearly anyone today and, more importantly, you have a great time doing it. Unfortunately, you might also waste precious energy doing something that is not critical to your goal. It's wise to rein yourself in early on or you could lose control of your schedule before you know it. Fewer distractions now make it easier to find the satisfaction and success that you seek."
pisces,2013-06-04,"You're ready to move forward with a collaborative project today. However, you're so eager, you might try to create something special on your own. Thankfully, you receive kudos for your current efforts and gain enough recognition to make your new venture worthwhile. But exercise caution, nonetheless, for you could become so enamored with your ideas that you forget others can make an important contribution, too. The synergy of working together is a winning formula for success."
aries,2013-06-05,"The frenzied pace of life slows down a bit now that the Moon is in grounded Taurus. It's as if something shifted and you awake to a quieter and gentler world today. You don't have to charge ahead to prove yourself; instead, consider taking a bit of time away from work to do absolutely nothing at all. At first this retreat might sound boring, but think of it as nurturing food for your soul."
taurus,2013-06-05,"Contentment is your key word today with the Moon returning to your sensual sign. Thankfully, you're able to relax while remaining in touch with your feelings. Although staying open to the idea of pleasure could be enough to attract a memorable experience now, you can't take it easy all day. Scheduling your downtime in advance ensures that you'll get your work done and enjoy yourself, too."
gemini,2013-06-05,"Your mind might be racing a mile a minute now, but it seems as if everyone else is shifting to a slower pace. Needless to say, this disconnect can be quite annoying. It's not that you are stuck doing something that you don't enjoy; on the contrary, you may be riding an exciting wave of creativity and wish there were more like-minded people to share your thoughts with today. Don't be afraid of stirring up some mischief if you need the mental stimulation. You'll accomplish more if you're having fun."
cancer,2013-06-05,"You might suddenly feel like canceling your upcoming party. Or, maybe you want to bow out of a social engagement and just stay home. Either way, you'll probably regret changing your mind so close to a planned event; instead, follow through with your commitments. Once you get into the groove, you'll remember why you were excited about the activity in the first place. Life is precious; the memories you make now will last forever."
leo,2013-06-05,"You're expected to take care of someone today and you might not have much of a choice in the matter. Others are relying on you and you must deliver on your promises. Even if you have misgivings about a prior obligation, everything will likely turn out better than you think. Remember, maintaining a positive attitude gives you the head start that you need to fulfill your responsibilities."
virgo,2013-06-05,"You're quite comfortable today because you like it when your feet are rooted so firmly on the ground. Although tension may arise later, you're still able to make the most of the current situation by comparing what you want with what you already have. Nevertheless, you'll be better off if you work diligently now, even if you're not worried about the outcome. Fortunately, your persistence won't go unnoticed."
libra,2013-06-05,"Relationship dynamics seem off-kilter today and it's difficult to put your finger directly on the problem. Thankfully, you have a good chance to enjoy yourself anyhow, but you might need to sidestep some of your current responsibilities now. Instead of trying to make everyone else happy, allow others to go out of their way to do something nice for you. Contentment is found somewhere in between the extremes of work and play."
scorpio,2013-06-05,"You might have to confront a stubborn person who doesn't want to meet you halfway today. But instead of increasing your frustration level by attempting to convince someone of what they are doing wrong, solve this dilemma from the opposite direction. Re-evaluate the issue until you can clearly see both points of view at the same time. Even if you don't get your way, you'll be left with more compassion for an opposing position. Others will appreciate your efforts to be fair-minded and that may be enough."
sagittarius,2013-06-05,"Unfortunately, the Taurus Moon plodding through your 6th House of Routine can saddle you with boring chores, so you might as well begin early today and finish them as soon as you can. It's not a smart idea to further fuel your irritation with unsuccessful attempts to escape from your commitments. Instead, use your creativity now to accomplish your goals in the most sensible way. Once you meet your obligations, you will be in a better position to let down your hair and fully enjoy yourself."
capricorn,2013-06-05,"You receive a beneficial boost of energy from the earthy Taurus Moon today, but don't attempt to complete everything in a quick burst of adrenaline or you'll just wear yourself out. Unfortunately, you could work hard all day and still have more to do. Instead, it's smarter to slow down and move through the day with less speed and more determination. Taking a more deliberate approach enables you to accomplish more than you expected, leaving you satisfied at the end of the day."
aquarius,2013-06-05,"Free-floating anxiety may plague you throughout the day for no specific reason at all. Although you might be able to rationalize each of your emotions, it's crucial to get past your nervous energy rather than wasting time justifying your position. Being right should not be a higher priority than being happy. Remember, the power to turn your negative attitude into a positive one resides within you."
pisces,2013-06-05,"You might be in for a major disappointment today if you think you can fantasize your way around a difficult issue. But facing a problem directly will ultimately give you a much-needed sense of security because you won't need to waste energy trying to figure out what to do next. Don't fight against an inevitable tide. For now, simply showing up and being real is sufficient to keep your day on track."
aries,2013-06-06,"You have a lot to do today, yet you may suddenly realize how tired you are from running around in circles. Don't avoid the signs; rather than pushing yourself harder now when you really feel like resting, listen to the wisdom of your body. Fortunately, you can relax even more once you acknowledge that productivity isn't the only thing that's important. Your health is a priceless asset that can't be taken for granted."
taurus,2013-06-06,"Although the Moon's current visit to determined Taurus amplifies your desires, you might not be motivated to fight for what you want now. Although you know how hard you've been working, you don't necessarily have much progress to show for your efforts. Nevertheless, it's not time to give up. Don't let negative emotions stand between you and success. Focus on your future and don't look back."
gemini,2013-06-06,"You might owe a co-worker an apology now, or perhaps you still have some professional commitments to fulfill. Unfortunately, your good intentions may have slid off the tracks due to unexpected circumstances. Thankfully, a hectic phase appears to be coming to an end. Retreat and regroup; spend whatever time is necessary to review your current direction and reassess your capabilities before making any more promises you can't keep. Demonstrating your sincerity by making amends is a good first step to turning things around."
cancer,2013-06-06,"Your empathy doesn't have to impede your success as long as you're able to control your emotions. Although you pretend you're not interested in sharing your feelings today, you still may be wearing them on your sleeve for all to see. Sometimes you can be moody even if you're in denial. Hiding from yourself is not a viable path to happiness. Stay in tune with what's happening and keep the communication channels open."
leo,2013-06-06,"Your daydreams may be subtle today, yet they grow more colorful and vibrant if you share them with someone else. Unfortunately, you may give up too easily now because your idealistic goals seem just beyond your grasp, leading to frustration. Remember, you feed your own anxieties by creating unrealistic expectations. Focusing on your vision rather than your progress empowers you to avoid self-doubt."
virgo,2013-06-06,"You might lose motivation today, especially if your work has become too routine. The problem is exacerbated by your overactive imagination, making it nearly impossible to concentrate on the necessary details. Revealing your vulnerability to someone you trust will make a difference. If you pretend everything is perfect now, then no one is able to step in and lend a helping hand. Accepting assistance from your friends doesn't make you look weak; it makes you more human."
libra,2013-06-06,"You want others at work to lean on you today because you are confident that you can provide the necessary support. However, it may be quite useful to establish clear boundaries so you don't lose yourself in the service of someone else. Your compassion is truly admirable, but make sure to take enough time to nurture yourself as well. Fostering your independence inspires those close to you to develop their own self-reliance, too."
scorpio,2013-06-06,"The Moon in your 7th House of Relationships may create an awkward situation that quickly reflects your feelings back to you. It's natural to identify with others, yet you might forget that their emotions are ultimately yours -- even if they seem as if they are external. Instead of seeing encounters as you-versus-them, imagine yourself on both sides of the playing field. It's much easier to find common ground once you realize that everyone's on the same team."
sagittarius,2013-06-06,"It's time to take a fresh look at your work priorities while the practical Taurus Moon is visiting your 6th House of Daily Routine. You may need to set aside big plans so you can tie up loose ends on an unfinished job. Even if you must be practical and apply your common sense in the present moment, it's still not a good idea to completely ignore your fantasies. Ultimately, it's your dreams that motivate you to aim beyond today's list of things to do."
capricorn,2013-06-06,"Your friends and coworkers seem needy today, but you won't likely lose your patience even if their dependency makes you feel uncomfortable. It may be wise to acknowledge that you're uneasy with expressing personal feelings in a formal work environment. You can be very effective at soothing tensions if you are courageous enough to bring your natural resistance out into the open and push beyond your comfort zone."
aquarius,2013-06-06,"The presence of unresolved feelings clashes with your more detached intellectual style to increase your anxiety. Instead of approaching every interaction rationally, the evocative Moon in your 4th House of Foundations encourages you to set logic aside and let your intuition be your guide. Don't even bother to explain or justify your dreams; your current practice is to simply follow your vision for the future with an open mind and a trusting heart."
pisces,2013-06-06,"You're able to express yourself lovingly today without wasting a lot of words. Luckily, you can manage lots of activities at once now without necessarily appearing too stressed out.

You might even believe that you can talk someone into seeing the world through your eyes.

But remember to stay acutely aware of the differences between fact and fancy, or the outcome won't be what you expect."
gemini,2013-06-07,"You're thrilled that your most colorful dreams are now ready for harvest. However, don't let your confidence run away with the show just yet. You might actually think that you can be successful without working hard today, but this illusion fades as the game intensifies. If an idyllic fantasy disappears as you get closer to it, it's best to let it go and move on to something else. You may only need to wait another day or two for a new opportunity to knock at your door."
cancer,2013-06-07,"It feels as if you have all the words at the tip of your tongue to describe your hopeful emotions today. However, you still can't initiate a conversation about your dreams of the future. Don't waste your time trying to explain your vision until you have a good reason to share it.

Thankfully, you can maintain the status quo for a while longer by temporarily keeping your emotions to yourself and simply appreciating the moment."
virgo,2013-06-07,"It's challenging to go with the flow because you're afraid of what may happen if you don't resist the prevailing emotional currents. You prefer to be rational and in control one hundred percent of the time ... but in this case, you are not. Therefore, your most reliable strategy is to avoid being overly attached to your desires. Paradoxically, denying your needs only strengthens your fears. Escape your regular routine; lead with your imagination and not your analytical thoughts to end up somewhere amazing."

Your positive attitude is the most important factor now in deciding whether or not you can find time to enjoy yourself later on.

sagittarius,2013-06-07,"Your imagination is wildly vivid today, inspiring you to combine your daydreams with your reality.

pisces,2013-06-07,"A personal issue -- domestic or romantic -- rattles your nerves today, and you don't quite know what to do next. It's tempting to shut out your problems for a while by withdrawing into your imagination. But escaping into Fantasyland works for only brief moments of time now. Tangible solutions are closer than you think if you're willing to face the music and meet others halfway."
aries,2013-06-08,"You want everyone to know what you're feeling today, but you don't like the idea of actually sharing your emotions. Thankfully, you can ease your concern about saying too much by actively listening to what others have to say.

The dynamics are changing and you're ready to ask for what you want now. Choose the right moment; how many words you speak is less important than the quality of what you say.

Even if it seems difficult at first, something valuable may be gained if you can demonstrate your vulnerability by explaining your inner process. It isn't useful to speak in vague generalities now; positive results are possible if you're specific about your feelings. Sharing your heart with a trusted companion is a leap of faith worth taking."
aries,2013-06-09,"It's smart to withhold your anger now, rather than expressing everything that you feel. Remaining tight-lipped may seem safer because of your concern that you'll share too much once you get on a roll. Unfortunately, relationships can turn cool if your suppressed emotions cultivate resentment. Sinking into denial is not a viable option today; confront your fears, put your thoughts in order and then speak your truth. Clearing the air might be all you need to do to set things right."
taurus,2013-06-09,"Your dreams may pull you far off the beaten path today, making it difficult to find your way home. Your emotions seem overwhelming at first, but they gradually morph into your allies. Remain open to whatever happens now because your current goals will likely change as you become more pragmatic.

Although you have the good sense to resist, you don't like being placed in such an awkward position.

virgo,2013-06-09,"Dealing with the fallout from other people's reactions can be unsettling today, especially if someone who is usually your ally is now resisting you at every step you take. Although you don't want to retract your recent words, you might wish you hadn't gone so deep when sharing your current feelings. Working with your emotions may not be all fun and games, but it should prove to be quite rewarding if you're willing to stick with the process."
libra,2013-06-09,"You might not be very certain about a few of your recent choices. Asking tough questions of yourself is helpful today, but harboring self-doubt is not. The next few days could be frustrating, especially if you can't see very far into the future, making it nearly impossible to finalize your plans. Instead of succumbing to the stress, engage the energy by doing chores around the house or working on an unfinished project. Rest assured that the dust will settle and you'll gain the clarity you need regarding your final answer."
scorpio,2013-06-09,"You may feel as if you must give up personal control today and go along with external circumstances that seem to be outside of your authority. Although you worry that mild concerns could trigger more serious fears now, an emotional safety net will protect you from falling. An irrational outburst only stirs up more trouble than it solves. There's no need to overreact before you know what's going to happen. Take a deep breath and trust the process."
sagittarius,2013-06-09,"You're often quick to share what's on your mind, but your impulsive tendencies might have you backtracking today. Ironically, your analysis of the current situation is probably correct; it's just that everything is in flux now and you may jump to a conclusion prematurely. Thankfully, you should have ample opportunity to reevaluate your choices and change your mind based upon what you learn later in the day."
capricorn,2013-06-09,"A close friend or partner might appear overly emotional today, prompting you to withdraw into your rational world. You aren't eager to be sidetracked by someone's issues when you have your own situation brewing. Stay present with your feelings to avoid drawing unnecessary battle lines. A serious conflict won't produce any winners now; resolve your problems through open dialogue, instead. Make sure that everyone involved is willing to compromise before you surrender more than you should."
aquarius,2013-06-09,You're pulled between delving into your feelings today and overruling them by initiating action. The illusion is that each approach appears to exclude the other. The solution isn't straightforward because a sensible strategy must incorporate both your internal process and your external behavior. There's no shame in admitting  that you don't have a clue as to what to do next. Engaging in a meaningful conversation with someone you trust is more constructive in the long run than running around in circles.
pisces,2013-06-09,"You may be challenged to stand up for your beliefs now, especially if someone in your immediate environment thinks they know how you should live your life. You might be reluctant to admit that your position is different because you're really not interested in defending your choices. Although the same issue could resurface at a later date, it's still best to wait it out and say as little as possible. Oddly enough, what seems critical today won't be as important next week."
aries,2013-06-10,"Your family and friends are familiar with your impulsive behavior and they understand you mean no harm if you step on their toes. However, people who don't know you as well might question your motives if you inadvertently do something hurtful now. You're uncertain if it's best to talk about the issue or if you should just forget about it and move on. Even if you're tempted to run away, it's healthier to face the stress with a willingness to listen and an open heart."
taurus,2013-06-10,"Finding the right companions to join in your fun today can be quite a challenge now. You just want to enjoy yourself, but it's tricky when everyone else has their own ideas of what a good time means. Some of your friends want to do more than you're willing and others want to do less.

gemini,2013-06-10,"You may have your mind set on doing something completely out of the ordinary today, but financial limitations might put a damper on your plans. Luckily, you can salvage a part of your original agenda, but you must be creative to make it happen. Don't sulk if everything goes differently than you wish. Make the best of the current situation without comparing it to what could have been; sometimes, the best things in life are free."
cancer,2013-06-10,"Your dreams may be at odds with those of a partner or close friend. Or, perhaps, circumstances beyond your control seem to be working against you today. No matter what happens, don't take it personally; this isn't a cosmic conspiracy trying to do you in. Instead of giving up now, take responsibility for what you can change and temporarily let go of the rest. The external pressure helps you become more aware of a major issue you need to work through over the next few weeks."
leo,2013-06-10,"You may feel singled out today, as if someone is going out of his way to bug you. Unfortunately, even if your fears are validated, it won't do much good to confront others because that will bring them the satisfaction they seek. Fortunately, you can change your mind even if everyone else's feelings are beyond your control. Resolve to move through your day with a positive attitude. Luckily, once you decide to take the high road, your opponents might choose to follow."
virgo,2013-06-10,"Although your workweek might not start the way you prefer, things should begin to smooth out this afternoon. Your day improves if you can energetically retreat, thereby reducing the drama around an emotional conflict. But you need to be careful or your self-imposed isolation could amplify your anger. Avoid taking the easy way out by blaming anyone else for your feelings. Examining your role in the current dynamics enables you to change your perspective for the better."
libra,2013-06-10,"Your ability to see both sides of an issue is a blessing in disguise as responsibilities push you one way and desires pull you another. Although it may feel as if you have to make a choice today, it could just be an illusion whispering within your mind. It's not about sidestepping the issues; it's about keeping your options open now. Don't fall victim to someone else's agenda and decide your fate prematurely. There's no need to show your hand yet; hold onto your cards and let the circumstances continue to play out for a while longer."
scorpio,2013-06-10,"You want to please everyone today, yet you secretly may not believe that satisfaction is likely. There might even be some casualties now as the pressures pile up and you are caught in the middle of a drama that has grown out of control. How you respond is crucial, since you could provoke intense emotions if you go to extremes. Acknowledge what's in your gut without fanning the flames of discontent. You can be honest without being unkind."

You may think that others should be able to let go of hurts from the past, but, unfortunately, this isn't the case today. There's no need to seek excuses to escape if a lighthearted discussion turns heavy. No one will hold a grudge if you take responsibility for your words and apologize for your insensitivity. Appreciating the present moment brings everyone together."
capricorn,2013-06-10,"It's wise to downplay your emotions now because you might seem much more intense than you actually are. However, don't pretend that all is well if you are unhappy with someone else's behavior. Nevertheless, caution is advised because others can easily misinterpret your words by thinking that you're judging them too harshly. Express yourself succinctly without letting your feelings run the show. An honest dialogue opens the door to a closer relationship."
aquarius,2013-06-10,"Your emotions are all over the map today because you're worried about your friends and family. Your stress increases if you also start thinking about how much work is ahead of you. Remember, it's up to you to choose where to focus your attention now. Although it's healthy to acknowledge someone's hurt feelings, it's a mistake to take responsibility for them. Don't try to fix anyone else; instead, concentrate on your behavior and let your actions speak for themselves."
pisces,2013-06-10,"You can't calm anyone else down today if you are frazzled yourself. You might wish you could escape, but your participation in an unfolding drama is very helpful to others. In fact, the experience can also be healing for you if you open your heart. There's no need to be in a hurry to force your solution onto a situation that is still in flux. You want to ease everyone's anxiety, but there's nothing you can do to accelerate the process. Thankfully, just being present with your feelings is enough to inspire others to do the same."
aries,2013-06-11,"Although you may be quite sure of a recent decision, it still takes a lot of energy to remain steadfast as someone shows you a different point of view today. Others might claim that they're not trying to change your opinion, but you feel pressure being applied anyhow. Even if it's a challenge, you can open your mind and widen your perspective without surrendering your dreams."
taurus,2013-06-11,"Your ruling planet Venus entices you with her sweet beauty, but there might be a hidden price to pay for courting pleasure today. Although you may believe that you won't fall prey to deeper passions, they could surface anyway. But total avoidance of your feelings isn't a viable strategy, either. Instead, initiate a discussion about your fears in a manner that does not blame anyone else for your irrational emotions. The way out of your current dilemma is through the center of the storm."
gemini,2013-06-11,"It's difficult to avoid the heavy emotions in the air now no matter how much your clever wit dances around the issues. You are often a champion at skipping over tough spots, but it's not worth exhausting yourself in the process. If you are willing to let go of your rigid agenda today, you have an opportunity to increase the level of intimacy in a relationship. But conflict is likely if you cannot be flexible enough to compromise. Finding the right balance between give and take is the trick."
cancer,2013-06-11,"There are obstacles to overcome today and you may need to confront hurtful memories to reach your desired destination. You wish you could break down the emotional walls between you and a loved one, but you might be afraid that the current intensity of your needs will be frightening to someone else. Your passion is not the problem now; rather, hanging on to a past wound keeps getting in the way of your satisfaction. You'll feel a lot lighter once you finally let go."
leo,2013-06-11,"You might act as if you're willing to go along with the group consensus, but you could harbor secret resentments if your wishes are overlooked. It's not that you need to have your way today; you just would like others to consider your point of view, too. Express your feelings as gently as possible. Taking responsibility for your own emotions can help to alleviate your anger without shifting the blame to anyone else. If you want to cultivate authentic relationships, you have to be honest."
virgo,2013-06-11,"If you're having a hard time choosing a direction in life now, making a decision may be complicated by your struggle with a spouse or romantic partner.

However, it may be you who could benefit from diplomatic intervention today to help you through an emotional battle with someone who is pushing your buttons. Don't look at this as a conflict between two people; instead, see what you can learn about the relationship issues that are now being raised."
scorpio,2013-06-11,"Your feelings are intensified today as Venus opposes your key planet Pluto, turning a minor disagreement into a major conflict. You can probably see both sides of an argument, but it's still challenging to be objective when it feels like so much is at stake now. However, there may be more going on than meets the eye. Don't be distracted by the current drama; instead, delve beneath the surface to understand the deeper issues that are fueling the debate. Playing detective is safer than starting a fight."
sagittarius,2013-06-11,"You may become upset if you believe that others aren't being totally honest. In fact, you would prefer to have all feelings aired so you can decide your level of involvement based on full disclosure. Unfortunately, you might not be able to uncover everyone's unexpressed intentions now, so your best strategy is to respond cautiously and wait for the entire story to emerge on its own. In the meantime, don't let anyone else's behavior rain on your parade."
capricorn,2013-06-11,"Your ability to remain neutral today in the midst of an emotional clash enables you to jump into the fray without even choosing sides. But your detachment is a very clever tactic because when you come out on top, it doesn't really matter how you got there. Be careful, for your calculated approach can also reveal your fear of following your heart. Take time to check in with your own needs even if it makes you feel uncomfortable at first. Your personal integrity matters most."
aquarius,2013-06-11,"It isn't that you're completely immune to the melodrama being played out around you now, but you may be somewhat removed from center stage. Luckily, your intellectual approach empowers you to talk about what's happening without being swept up by everyone else's intense feelings. Avoid taking sides in a dispute; your objective outlook is the cool voice of reason that others need to hear at this time."
pisces,2013-06-11,"It's challenging to find your own voice if your feelings are drowned out by the magnitude of everyone else's. But it's not that you don't have an intense reaction to the current commotion; it's just that you're not interested in fighting to be heard. You're tempted to suppress your passions by giving up before you even try to express them. Nevertheless, it's best to say what's on your mind or a temporary annoyance could grow into an enduring resentment. Clear the air and move on."
aries,2013-06-12,"You're likely to freak out those close to you if you tell them how you really feel today. You might claim that you want tranquility, but you also need to balance it with a bit of excitement. There may be a problem if you're not concerned with what others think of your choices. Unfortunately, you could inadvertently overstep someone's limits now. Acting with a little consideration can ultimately improve a relationship without getting in your way of achieving personal satisfaction."
taurus,2013-06-12,"Your key planet Venus brings pleasure into your life today in ways that are fresh and different. Unfortunately, the opportunity you have for enjoyment comes at a high price now. But don't bother trying to get a stamp of approval from a friend, unless you're specifically seeking to deepen that particular relationship. Communicating your feelings isn't all fun and games; it takes hard work and a vulnerable heart. Nevertheless, the potential rewards are well worth the effort."
gemini,2013-06-12,"You may think that being discreet is necessary today because you assume that your eccentric tastes will appear too weird for those around you. It's true that others could judge you harshly if your current preferences seem strange to them. However, they might also envy you and wonder how you get away with expressing yourself as you do. But don't slip too far away from social conventions; there are some rules you need to follow just like everyone else."
cancer,2013-06-12,"You may turn out to be your own nemesis today, especially if you're trying to calm your worries about your emotional security. You naturally crave the safety of a nurturing relationship, but you still might grow restless now. Even if you want to break out of your current routine, balance your desire for excitement in the moment with the long-term stability that you ultimately need."
leo,2013-06-12,"You think you know what's best when it comes to your schedule, yet you're willing to suddenly discard your current plan if the right temptation comes along today. Unfortunately, your friends don't help your situation by encouraging you to join them on their amazing adventures. Nevertheless, you long for some excitement and might just say yes if an invitation arrives when you are ready to escape. Remember, your work will still be waiting when you return."
virgo,2013-06-12,"Your friends and associates could surprise you today if they resist going along with a previously agreed upon plan. Although you might feel as if there is a mutiny in progress, the plot is probably a cry for freedom rather than a play for power. Don't try to change their minds; if necessary, continue on your way without the support of others. You'll feel better in the long run if you stick to your agenda no matter what anyone else thinks."
libra,2013-06-12,"Your goals pull you in two different directions now, but you know you can't take both paths. Although your sense of urgency is high as your key planet Venus squares Uranus, you're not quite ready to close one door in favor of another. Even if you wish you could postpone your decision, today's events catalyze your thinking because others are directly impacted by your actions. No matter how ambivalent you may feel, just make a choice and move forward without looking back."
scorpio,2013-06-12,"Your feelings are shifting back and forth today, making them more complicated to share than ever. You can easily convince yourself to keep your emotions private because you're worried about other peoples' reactions to your electrically charged desires. Or, you might believe that your inner process isn't anyone else's business. Although your concerns are valid, you still would be smarter to take a risk and show your vulnerability. Nothing ventured, nothing gained."
sagittarius,2013-06-12,"You're naturally optimistic and don't see anything wrong with asking for what you want today. However, feeling good may be easier than looking good and your friends might not be so quick to endorse your unorthodox desires. Nevertheless, expressing your emotions could be the catalyst you need to abruptly change an old behavior pattern. Obviously, you cannot predict how anyone will react, but revealing your true self is a step in the right direction."
capricorn,2013-06-12,"It's unsettling if you're suddenly attracted to the very same instability that you typically try to avoid. Nevertheless, you may be totally fascinated by someone's radical style or eccentric idea today, even if you can't see any practical value in it. Your unusual reaction might worry you, but there's no reason to curb your enthusiasm. Shake things up while you can; you'll return to your more conservative approach to life in a couple of days with a fresh perspective."
aquarius,2013-06-12,"Your ruling planet Uranus is often associated with emotional detachment, but today its square to magnetic Venus brings a sudden awakening of attraction and desire. However, you aren't drawn toward the same old things; instead, you want to explore uncharted territory. Don't try to rationalize what's in your heart. For now, the crazier your fantasy, the more satisfaction you can derive from acting on it. Follow your bliss, but don't lose your common sense along the way."
pisces,2013-06-12,"You have the right to be as different as you want today because nonconformist Uranus activates romantic Venus in your 5th House of Love and Creativity. You aren't interested in appearing just like everyone else now, so be courageous, show off the twinkle in your eyes and enjoy the extra bounce in your step. It doesn't matter if anyone else can hear the beautiful music that's stirring your soul. Dance with wild abandon as if no one is watching."
aries,2013-06-13,"You're eager to start a creative project today since the expressive Leo Moon fires up inventive Uranus in your sign. Thankfully, you can see potential trouble ahead and may try to moderate your wild enthusiasm before things get out of hand. Nevertheless, you still might not be able to contain your excitement. You won't have to apologize for just being yourself with those you love as long as you are sensitive to their needs."
taurus,2013-06-13,"A close friend might expect you to put your personal priorities aside so you can play a more active role when guiding your family or friends. But you may grow irritated with this current arrangement because you don't want to be burdened with additional responsibilities. Keep in mind that it's just as important to take care of yourself today, but try not to let anyone else down more than is necessary. Take pride in the fact that people can depend on you when it matters."
gemini,2013-06-13,"A heartfelt gesture seems like an insignificant move on your part now, yet it still could be of major importance to someone else. Unfortunately, an acquaintance may misinterpret your actions because of unrealistic expectations. Or, maybe your behavior is purposefully confusing because you want to throw others off track. State your boundaries clearly today so you don't unintentionally deceive those who are already on your side."
cancer,2013-06-13,"You continue to improve your strategy today, preparing to make your big move. You have been waiting for just the right time, but there's still something that's beyond your reach. It's as if a piece from a jigsaw puzzle is purposefully being hidden to prevent you from being so confident about your solution. Don't waste time trying to explain yourself; your actions will tell the entire story better than any words could."
leo,2013-06-13,"The Moon's current visit to your extroverted sign can turn this into a very social day. However, mental Mercury and beautiful Venus are still hanging out in your 12th House of Privacy, so you may not want to be the center of attention. But if you go out of your way to seek the spotlight, your plan could backfire and make you regret your actions. Luckily, it's more important now to love others than it is to be loved. Your generosity of spirit is greatly appreciated by those around you."
virgo,2013-06-13,"You may be quite effective in the execution of your chores as you work behind the scenes. However, you still might say something that causes others to stop and take notice of you today. Unfortunately, you could bring the wrong kind of attention to yourself if you accidentally reveal a well-kept secret. Relax and blend in with the crowd, for hiding only draws the spotlight toward you like a magnet. You can still be wildly productive without making big waves."
libra,2013-06-13,"Nearly everything seems to be growing more confusing these days, especially with respect to love and relationships. Keep in mind that you may not know what is best now because it's tough figuring out what others expect. Try a more creative answer to the current problem. Instead of having to choose one solution over another, develop a scenario where both are possible. You might end up surprised because the least conventional plan could quickly turn into the most constructive one."
scorpio,2013-06-13,"You are not meant to sit around the house today or take it easy at work. Kicking up your heels sounds good, but you'll be able to enjoy yourself more if you fulfill your job responsibilities first. Get outside later in the day and do something just for the fun of it. But don't think that you can be totally satisfied with a string of trivial distractions now. Find an activity that engages your mind with the deeper questions of life to feed your soul."
sagittarius,2013-06-13,"Exploring with a friend might sound like a lot of fun today, yet you can push beyond familiar territory pretty quickly. Discovering new places or digging into unanswered mysteries is quite enticing now, especially if you're able to share this adventure with someone just as fearless as you. Nevertheless, flying solo is okay, too; as long as you're traveling outside of your normal comfort zone, you can't help but have a memorable time."
capricorn,2013-06-13,"Take a few steps back from all the distractions in your life now and concentrate on the details of just one project. You will be aptly rewarded if you can successfully change one small thing instead of trying to turn your whole life upside down to no avail. Your health regimen could be a good place to start; if you are considering an improvement to your diet, do it now. It's better to begin sooner than later, even if you ultimately need to make more adjustments over the next few weeks."
aquarius,2013-06-13,"It's not enough to consider ways to increase your physical activity now; instead, you need to stop talking, get out there and do it. However, you're tempted to wait for your friend or partner to join you in your workout today. Nevertheless, it isn't healthy to shift the responsibility for your actions on to anyone else. Whether you accept it or not, the ball is in your court. Lead by example and others will follow your positive direction."
pisces,2013-06-13,"You are tempted to make a big deal about what you want to accomplish at work, but it's really not necessary to draw any further attention to yourself today. You don't want to misrepresent anything; it's just that you need some more wiggle room as you describe reality. Remember, there's nothing wrong with believing that your outlook is special as long as you don't claim that it's the only valid one. Let your actions do the talking now."
aries,2013-06-14,"You often enjoy the anticipation of what's next, even when the results of your actions are unpredictable. However, your current dilemma could have you anxiously tied in knots because you know something significant is about to happen and you don't yet know what to do about it. It's not easy to be patient because you are ready for a change now. Although waiting is hard, keep your spirits up. You should know more by tomorrow."
taurus,2013-06-14,"You are dreaming of a less hectic lifestyle, but it doesn't appear that your daily pace is calming down in the near future. The difference between what you want and what you have could be enough to make you grow quiet today. It's nearly impossible to express your desires now when satisfaction seems so far away. But this is no time to let negativity creep into your thinking; you are entering a time of dramatic change and your attitude makes all the difference in the world."
gemini,2013-06-14,"You are wired with excitement because ingenious Uranus forms a magical quintile with the radiant Sun in your sign today, opening the floodgates of mental originality. Unfortunately, your mind may be moving so fast now that it's difficult to hold on to any one thought long enough to do something constructive with it. However, practicing concentration can drastically change the game, so act as if you are who you want to be rather than waiting for an opportunity to knock at your door."
cancer,2013-06-14,"Your need for pleasure is heightened these days as delicious Venus travels through your sign. However, pursuing your desires doesn't come without a price. You could set yourself up for disappointment now if you know what you want but fail to share your feelings with someone close to you. Don't assume that a loved one knows what you're thinking today. Take a risk and give voice to what's in your heart. You still might be pleasantly surprised, even if the outcome isn't exactly what you wished."
leo,2013-06-14,"You have experienced so many turning points in the past few weeks that you may not have high expectations for the next one. But your life is truly evolving and you're finally moving into new territory now, instead of revisiting a variation on the same old familiar ground. Don't settle for less just because you recently encountered a setback. You have a larger role in creating your future than you might realize, so set high goals and then stretch to reach them."
virgo,2013-06-14,"You're entering a more social phase now, so get ready to have some fun. But there's a more serious side to this shift, too, since your career goals are in the spotlight during the weeks ahead. Meanwhile, the Moon's return to your sign today puts you in more immediate touch with your feelings and enables you to express them with greater ease. Even if you're not completely comfortable with the current circumstances, honesty is still the best policy. Sharing your heart clears the path for something wonderful to happen."
libra,2013-06-14,"You may receive high praise at work for something you recently completed. Or, perhaps, you notice that others are being friendlier now, even if you haven't changed your behavior. Paradoxically, too much attention might prompt you to compensate by stepping out of the spotlight today. However, don't shy away too quickly because acknowledgment of your contribution ultimately gives your confidence a well-deserved boost."
scorpio,2013-06-14,"Your strong sense of loyalty might have prevented you from breaking free until now, but you are right at the edge and eager to make some major changes. Fortunately, you may not be inclined to do anything radical today, since there are certain parts of your life that are working just fine. Still, you are antsy enough to overreact and, unfortunately, impulsive actions can lead to unnecessary complications. Take a few deep breaths and consider all of your options before you take a leap of faith."
sagittarius,2013-06-14,"You have work that needs to be finished, yet time is quickly running out. You may be tempted to take an unproven shortcut to the finish line or try a risky new strategy to save steps. Although it is possible to get lucky and win the race, it's not very likely today. Stick with the tried and true method now by making your progress in the old-fashioned way of combining sheer determination with hard work. A conservative approach ensures your success down the road."
capricorn,2013-06-14,"You still may have some loose ends to tie up, but you're already feeling as if you are free from the heavy energy that was recently placed upon your shoulders. You might even experience such joy and exhilaration that you forget about your previous commitments. However tempting it is to escape from your responsibilities, you have accomplished too much to mess things up now. Keep your nose to the grindstone today and you'll be able to really relax tomorrow."
aquarius,2013-06-14,"The Sun's brilliant quintile to your key planet Uranus today reminds you of your own natural intelligence. Although it's unrealistic to assume that you have all of the answers, it's probable that your innovative thinking can produce an important breakthrough now. However, you must step outside of the box, question authority and stretch the rules to achieve your greatest potential. Be courageous but not reckless."
pisces,2013-06-14,"Your feelings are flying high one minute and crashing down to earth the next as alternating currents of excitement and worry distract you from your obligations. You know you should be concentrating on the details at work today, but you may be too inspired by the big picture to pay attention to tiresome trivialities. Remember, you have the capability to control your thoughts; focusing on the fine points now can make the difference between a mediocre performance and true brilliance."
aries,2013-06-15,"You may become more concerned about changing your habits to sustain your physical energy and improve your overall well-being now that the Virgo Moon is occupying your 6th House of Health. However, it's a smart strategy to avoid doing anything drastic if you are feeling under the weather. Instead of suddenly announcing that you are going on a week-long fast, make small but manageable improvements to your diet. Tiny steps can make a really big difference."
taurus,2013-06-15,"Explore new ways to enjoy your time off while the practical Virgo Moon is hanging out in your 5th House of Fun and Games. But don't ignore your chores, because you still need to have a sense of accomplishment. You may be interested in combining a playful distraction with a more useful activity, such as arts and crafts. Scheduling some downtime in advance for relaxation is the best way to make sure that it actually happens."
gemini,2013-06-15,"Although the Moon is in your 4th House of Home and Family, you are tempted to sneak out for some fun today instead of fulfilling all of your domestic obligations. You're not interested in working all day long, even if you're managing a lot of responsibilities now. On the other hand, it's not a very smart idea to postpone your current commitments. Keep your promises first ... then you will be free to join your friends at play with a clear conscience."
cancer,2013-06-15,"Although the perfectionist Virgo Moon is visiting your 3rd House of Communication, an argument with a friend doesn't have to ruin your whole day. You like to cling to your experiences, nostalgically replaying the wonderful times and even sometimes recreating the hurt attached to more difficult memories. But too much self-reflection may set you on a downward spiral today, leading to self-doubt. Thankfully, good times are waiting for you in the present moment if you can leave the past behind."
leo,2013-06-15,"Someone may take you by surprise today, talking his or her way into your heart and then turning your entire world upside down. There is likely to be a clash of values now that the evocative Moon is traveling through your 2nd House of Core Beliefs. It's healthier in the long run if you aren't so critical of yourself and others. Don't try to control the emotional currents because you could exhaust yourself pursuing an impossible goal. Instead, go along for the ride to see where it takes you."
virgo,2013-06-15,"The Moon's current visit to your sign blesses you with the ability to say exactly what's on your mind. But having the right words at your disposal to describe your emotions may be dangerous, since you're more likely to share feelings now that you might otherwise keep to yourself. Nevertheless, it helps to follow through on a conversation once it's been started. Thankfully, your self-expression can have a positive impact if you don't push your opinions too far."
libra,2013-06-15,"The timid Virgo Moon's trip through your 12th House of Spiritual Retreat may be problematic today if you overbook your schedule. Unfortunately, it might be difficult to find time to check in with your inner world. However, you can benefit by reserving a bit of your mindshare to acknowledge that there are bigger and more significant issues than what is happening in your own life right now. A realistic adjustment to your perspective enables you to re-frame a complicated situation in a simpler manner."
scorpio,2013-06-15,"No matter how preoccupied you are today, it's crucial to set aside a block of time when you can imagine the possibilities ahead or freely talk about your hopes for the next phase of your life with a close friend. The Virgo Moon's current visit to your 11th House of Long-Term Goals takes your mind off the everyday logistics of your job. Give yourself a break from the intensity; instead of worrying about next week, extend your vision much further into the future where your dreams will come true."
sagittarius,2013-06-15,"You would like to play out your role as an effective leader at work or in the community now that the industrious Virgo Moon is shining in your 10th House of Public Responsibility. Unfortunately, it isn't useful to force your personal agenda onto others; your insistence only stirs up resistance. Instead, you can win the support of generous allies by maintaining a high level of integrity in all that you do."
capricorn,2013-06-15,"If you are considering a vacation or even just a quick getaway, this is an excellent day to start making your plans. Fortunately, you're more practical than you realize, yet the Moon's presence in your 9th House of Big Ideas inspires you to honor your adventurous spirit now. But don't get too wrapped up in figuring out all the details. Set a date and a destination; the rest of the missing pieces will fall into place when the timing is right."
aquarius,2013-06-15,"The Moon's visit to your 8th House of Shared Resources indicates a good time to make a financial investment. But it's tricky to decide how much time and money should be put into a project now. Your behavior may not be as clear as your thinking so you need to stick closely to the facts. You have enough information to make a choice today, even if you don't take action on your decision for a few more days. In the meantime, share your plans with a friend and listen with an open mind to the feedback you receive."
pisces,2013-06-15,"You may be involved in a tiresome disagreement, increasing the tension between you and your friends. Your frustration tempts you to throw in the towel and walk away from the whole mess. However, trying to escape isn't such a smart idea because you'll just have to deal with the same issue again if you avoid handling the situation now. A direct approach makes the most sense when resolving a current conflict. State your case and move on."
aries,2013-06-16,"You might believe that you can rationalize the most outrageous ideas today, but no one is buying your version of the story. Even if you're telling the truth as best you can, others may be nervous because you're not following the established guidelines. Tone down your rhetoric and adjust your attitude, since you really don't need to make any enemies at this time. Luckily, changing the way you go about your business now puts those around you at ease."
taurus,2013-06-16,"There is no valid reason for anyone to question your integrity today because you're consumed with doing the right thing. Although, you might normally take time to hear someone's ideas before saying no, even the slightest hint of a problem will send you back to the safety of your more simplistic plan. Playing by the rules is the honorable thing to do, but don't get so comfortable with your position that you miss what's most important. Increase your chances for success by keeping your eyes and ears open."
gemini,2013-06-16,"You may be engaged in a battle with yourself today as the narrowly focused Virgo Moon squares the willful Sun in flighty Gemini. You're able to think like a laser beam which can certainly sharpen your analytical skills. Don't restrict your curiosity too much, or you could do yourself a disservice by overlooking a crucial piece of data. Just remember, one of your greatest strengths is your natural ability to connect a variety of experiences in ways that others cannot see."
cancer,2013-06-16,"You naturally feel more secure if you err on the side of being silent, rather than becoming overly emotional to make your point. Thankfully, you don't have anything to prove, so being right might not matter all that much. Nevertheless, it isn't wise to sacrifice integrity for the sake of political expediency. If you have a good idea, find a way to share it without offending others in the process. Your contributions are more valuable than you think."
leo,2013-06-16,"It may be difficult to step out of the spotlight, but playing a supportive role is your smartest move today. Even if you realize that you could do more than you are currently contributing, a partial retreat demonstrates your confidence in others. Don't worry ... you will have your chance to shine soon enough, so let someone else take center stage for now."
virgo,2013-06-16,"People have a challenging time reading your energy today because you seem both cautious and exuberant. It's difficult to understand how you can act respectful one moment and rebellious the next. Nevertheless, your ability to hold opposing views is one of your strengths now, yet it may also appear confusing to everyone else. They might think you're being wishy-washy, but following multiple paths requires real courage. Trust your own instincts to ultimately steer you in the right direction."
libra,2013-06-16,"Your mind is probably already made up, but you might not be ready to announce your decision today. It isn't that you're trying to hurt anyone's feelings; it's just that you want everyone to make their choices based on his or her own best interests. There is no need to get caught up in playing any misleading games by saying something that you don't even believe. Honesty is always the best policy, but how you deliver the message is critically important now, too."
scorpio,2013-06-16,"Making the best use of your time today is crucial, for you won't be satisfied if you're unproductive while hanging out with your friends. But it doesn't really matter whether you are alone or in the company of others. Stay focused on your agenda now. No matter where you go or what you do, you'll feel good about your day if you make some sort of progress toward your original goals."
sagittarius,2013-06-16,"A bit of good old-fashioned common sense goes a long way today as you handle family politics. Instead of attempting to take responsibility for something that's out of your control, narrow your perspective and put your efforts toward transforming that which you can change. Spreading yourself too thin is a mistake you can't afford now. It's better to do one little task well than trying to fix everything all at once."
capricorn,2013-06-16,"Even though you are normally capable of tackling a complicated job by breaking it down into smaller tasks, you seem to be at the very top of your game now. You can earn recognition from your peers today because your managerial skills compliment your goals. Just be very careful not to let other people's expectations get out of hand or you'll end up disappointing them no matter how much you actually accomplish."
aquarius,2013-06-16,"Unspoken emotional concerns complicate your family relationships now. Although your intentions may be clear to you, it's still challenging to bring the complex web of feelings out into the open so everyone can deal with things as they are. Instead, you feel as if you're walking on eggshells, afraid that one wrong move could cause a catastrophe. Wait a day or two before doing anything you might regret; in the meantime, be smart and continue to gather and disperse information to keep the ball rolling."
pisces,2013-06-16,"You may feel as if someone is raining on your parade today by criticizing your efforts or micromanaging your work. You might grow frustrated enough to react before thinking about the consequences. Unfortunately, your unrestrained response could just make matters worse. Instead, observe your feelings without actually doing anything about them. Make your move tomorrow when you can take action without turning a minor disagreement into a major conflict."
aries,2013-06-17,"You are excited about your goals now, and you're willing to do almost anything to reach them. Fortunately, your key planet Mars supports your impulsive behavior today with a cooperative sextile to unorthodox Uranus. Go ahead and push up against the restrictions; they just might give way and let you pass. But your journey may not go smoothly; there still could be a few difficult bumps along the way. Don't let anything deter you from pursuing success."
taurus,2013-06-17,"You are feeling restless and reckless as your sense of calm determination is challenged today by warrior Mars and wild Uranus. You typically prefer a straightforward route to your destination, but your current path to success might be a crooked one. Instead of attempting to hide your uncertainty with arrogant behavior now, wait until your best option becomes more apparent. Remember, you don't have to act on every passing whim, even if it's tempting."
gemini,2013-06-17,"You may feel as if you're at the top of your game today, empowering you to show off your charm and quick wit. However, you might be so clever at telling your tale that you get excited and step over the line that usually separates fact and fiction. Your ability to put a positive spin on everything now enables you to impress everyone, including yourself. Nevertheless, it's smarter to stick to the truth right from the start."
cancer,2013-06-17,"People might seem overly intense today and you don't have much luck at calming them down. Ironically, this drama probably isn't about anyone else; it's about managing your discomfort that arises when someone appears to be out of control. Your primary lesson now is to realize that you are only responsible for your own emotions. Pay attention to your feelings without putting up any unnecessary defenses in the process. Recognizing that everyone has their own perspective enables you to be more compassionate in the moment."
leo,2013-06-17,"It feels as if you should be preparing for a showdown today, but you might not even know why. Someone may behave in a peculiar manner and something just doesn't make sense. You're tempted to express your frustration as anger now, even if you don't have a logical reason. Although you want to respond immediately, be smart and allow the situation to unfold on its own until you have a more complete picture. You can make better choices once you're fully informed."
virgo,2013-06-17,"Your innate analytical skills might not be of much help today if you need to react quickly to a situation at work. Although you can see a number of different routes that could further your career goals, you just want to take the path of least resistance now. Fortunately, the most creative solutions will come to you while you are in motion, so there's no need to waste time sitting on the sidelines, trying to logically decide your next move. Follow your intuition and you can't lose."
libra,2013-06-17,"Your schedule may be thrown off course today by someone close to you who does something totally unexpected. Luckily, what seems like a setback at first could turn into an exciting journey of discovery. However, you might miss out on a magical little adventure if you try too hard to resist the changes. Let old plans fall to the wayside now and allow the unknown to pleasantly surprise you."
scorpio,2013-06-17,"Frustration sets in today as irrepressible Mars in breezy Gemini scatters your energy in ways you can't control. Although you crave a deeper level of interaction, the current work pace may be too hectic to support the kind of in-depth communication you want. Don't push too hard or the intensity you seek will reappear in the form of resistance from others. Keep up with the rapidly changing circumstances as best you can. Fortunately, they will settle into more meaningful exchanges by tomorrow."
sagittarius,2013-06-17,"Fun and games are at the top of your list today, but the high level of excitement level could be a bit too much to contain. Your feelings are rather inconsistent now, and whatever you choose to do, it still might seem as if you should be doing something else. However, the lack of stability increases your desire to experience the thrill of the uncertainty. Enjoy the buzz while it lasts, for things will begin to settle back down in a couple of days."
capricorn,2013-06-17,"You may not be comfortable with all the current emotional turmoil at work now. Unfortunately, nothing you do seems to calm the turbulence. You are better off to let go and ride the rough waves today, instead of trying to exert control over your direction. Thankfully, your anxiety begins to dissipate once you concentrate on maintaining balance, rather than trying to manage all the variables in your environment at once."
aquarius,2013-06-17,"Your current strategy at work isn't very obvious to others, so they might not understand your true intentions. You don't see reality in the same light today as everyone else does because your plan isn't bogged down in office politics or sentimental attachments. However, you can be so objective that you might miss an important emotional component. Don't worry about ruffling someone's feathers to express yourself; your brilliance shines through as long as you maintain your integrity."
pisces,2013-06-17,"You are overly eager to try something outside your usual comfort zone today, and your risky actions can take others by surprise. Unfortunately, they may judge you unkindly because of your erratic behavior and accuse you of being immature and irresponsible. However, this is your big moment of truth, no matter what anyone else expects. Shine your inner light with confidence and proudly express who you are and what you want."
aries,2013-06-18,"Although you're rarely interested in scheduling too far ahead, you can benefit from sharing your travel plans with a close friend now. It may be a bit disconcerting to go on the record about your dreams for an upcoming adventure, but an in-depth discussion might open doors that lead you in an exciting new direction. At least, consider taking a short trip to shake things up; make the most out of any time you have to escape from your regular responsibilities."
taurus,2013-06-18,"You may experience a financial windfall today or simply make more money than you expected. The propitious Sun-Jupiter conjunction in your 2nd House of Income also means that this could be a good day to ask for a raise. Or, if you play the lottery, it might make sense to buy an extra ticket now. Although this lucky transit can be a blessing, you won't get a free lunch unless you deserve it. Remember, the greatest fortune will still be the result of your tenacity and hard work."
gemini,2013-06-18,"The expansive Sun-Jupiter conjunction lights up your sign, widening your horizons and clearing a path to success. Luckily, the diplomatic Libra Moon dancing in your 5th House of Creativity can bring artistic people into your life who inspire you to express yourself. Show your intelligence now by listening to those who are more experienced than you. It's one thing to have an amazing idea; it's another thing entirely to have the wisdom to actually do something constructive with your vision."
cancer,2013-06-18,"It's no simple task to contain your enthusiasm today, even if you know that sharing your optimism might irritate someone else. Your intention is to be considerate, but you might not be able to stop yourself anyway. Normally, self-control comes to you easily, but you don't want to keep your good fortune hidden now. Nevertheless, going to extremes with your exuberance can prematurely dissipate your creative energy. Saying less and doing more is a smart strategy until things settle down."
leo,2013-06-18,"Your social life is taking off now that your 11th House of Friends is blasted wide open by the opportunistic Sun-Jupiter conjunction. You might even be able to get away with saying yes to more than you can typically handle as you rise to the occasion. Although you don't have to overstep your limits in order to thoroughly enjoy yourself, take pleasure in dancing on the edge without being overly concerned about going too far."
virgo,2013-06-18,"You're looking sharp in the eyes of others at work now, and you might even think that you can do no wrong. But foolish behavior won't be rewarded, so don't push your luck. Focus on why people like you rather than taking their approval as permission to do whatever you want. It's easy to avoid negative consequences if you simply spend a little time considering the impact of your actions before going overboard."
libra,2013-06-18,"Although you have your heart set on a lofty goal now, you could end up running around in circles with little to show for your efforts. Unfortunately, you are likely to turn mole hills into mountains today, and then wonder why the summits are out of reach. Thankfully, you might still reach your destination if you don't scatter your energy. Everything falls into place if you just concentrate your efforts on one thing at a time."
scorpio,2013-06-18,"You may convince yourself that it's not smart to spend money on something that makes you feel good today, even if you can afford it. However, there's no reason to let your fears get in the way of your happiness. Even if your finances are a little tight, treating yourself well now is an investment that still might be worthwhile. You don't have a license to waste what you've earned. However, you probably deserve more pleasure than you're willing to admit."
sagittarius,2013-06-18,"A magical Sun-Jupiter conjunction shines in your 7th House of Others, indicating that a friend or partner could open a window of opportunity for you. An innovative person may enter your life, bringing several original ideas that merit follow-up. However, the real choice now is up to you. Although someone else can aim you in the right direction, it's still your job to set priorities and then take the first step."
capricorn,2013-06-18,"You might feel lazy or even self-indulgent today, choosing to skip your exercise routine or head straight for the dessert table without eating your vegetables. There are so many enticing distractions on your plate now, you can't decide where to begin. Even if you can get away with a bit of extra pampering, it's not a good idea to stretch your limits too far. Think about the consequences of your actions before you try to bend reality in your favor."
aquarius,2013-06-18,"Today is a day you can have your cake and eat it, too. Your friends think you're the life of the party, even if no one is celebrating anything. However, you actually could be working harder now than anyone realizes. You're able to do your chores without being noticed, as if you are wearing an invisibility cloak. Meanwhile, a flamboyant Sun-Jupiter conjunction in your 5th House of Fun and Games overshadows everything else, so you might as well relax and let the good times roll."
pisces,2013-06-18,"You're eager to set new priorities as the philosophical Sun-Jupiter conjunction falls in your 4th House of Foundations. However, it makes sense to look to your personal life now rather than your professional world for the meaning that you seek. Your vision of the primary importance of home and family outshines your career ambitions today. Don't worry about any long-term fallout from your newly developing perspective. Just keep things simple and enjoy your day."
aries,2013-06-19,"You might feel so excited about life today that nearly everything sounds like a great idea. Although there could be a lot of new information flooding your brain now, you quickly realize that more data doesn't necessarily mean more wisdom. It's fun to interact with others, but you need to form meaningful connections, too, or you'll end up being disappointed in the end. Make the good times last by moving beyond the facts and acknowledging the reality of your emotions."
taurus,2013-06-19,"There is a powerful relationship between being confident about yourself and wanting to buy a memento to preserve the memory of a wonderful feeling. Nevertheless, keep your credit cards in your wallet now because you may be tempted to spend more than you have on something you don't really need. Even if you're thinking about purchasing a gift for someone you love, material possessions can't express what's really in your heart."
gemini,2013-06-19,"The energy is over the top today as exuberant Jupiter hooks up with the radiant Sun, giving you something special to celebrate. Although it's the middle of the workweek, you might find it difficult to concentrate on your job responsibilities. You would rather spend your time pursuing creative outlets now than meeting your current obligations. Your key to happiness depends on finding a middle ground between feeling free and acting responsibly."
cancer,2013-06-19,"It's challenging to feel satisfied with your current activities because your imagination is running wild now. You see unlimited possibilities nearly everywhere you turn. Your thoughts are harder to untangle today since you cannot necessarily distinguish between the way things are and how they could be. However, exploring your fantasies is still important as long as you don't let them get the upper hand. Dream about the future, but remember that you must live in the present."
leo,2013-06-19,"It's healthy to think that your friends and associates are capable of doing great things as long as you're not unrealistic. You may expect too much from them today, possibly leading to disappointment later on. However, sharing your hopes and dreams gives others a sense of what's important to you these days. Just don't expect someone to share your same level of enthusiasm for your favorite project. If something excites you now, don't wait for anyone else to champion your cause; just go for it."
virgo,2013-06-19,"You may receive good news on the job today. Although it might not be totally unexpected, it can still be quite exciting, nonetheless. However, you will likely have hard work to do in order to follow up on your end of the deal. Thankfully, some of the most demanding tasks could already be completed. Trust your instincts; if you stop analyzing everything you'll know what's coming next. There's no time to waste, so make the most of the current opportunity while you can."
libra,2013-06-19,"It's natural to grow excited today about an upcoming event or getaway. However, don't let your anticipation get the best of you if you're planning to travel. It's wonderful to build fantasies about going somewhere special, but grandiose thinking could transform a realistic vision into an imaginary journey. If you truly want to go on a meaningful adventure, avoid the temptations of bigger, better and more. Maintaining a healthy perspective could be the key to making your dreams come true."
scorpio,2013-06-19,"Although you may be more secure when navigating solo in logical realms today, surprising thoughts could quickly pull you into deeper emotional waters. But instead of letting yourself feel vulnerable, your immediate reaction is to withdraw from the current situation. Don't try to oversimplify things too quickly because retreating might not be the best remedy now. There's much to learn while exploring the exquisite complexities of relationships if you're willing to keep your heart open."
sagittarius,2013-06-19,"Your interactions with others can lead you in an entirely new direction now. You might want to question the significance of this unexpected turn of events, but logical analysis won't necessarily tell you what you need to know. Stay open to your current experience without trying to classify it. Even if an amazing opportunity falls short of your expectations, the ride will be well worth the risk."
capricorn,2013-06-19,"Forget about your old assumptions and bad habits that usually hold you back. There is no reason to process the very same things that you have already handled more than once. It's finally time to look straight ahead and set a new course based on what you want to do rather than what you want to change. But don't bite off more than you can chew. For now, it's all about big visions and baby steps."
aquarius,2013-06-19,"It's thrilling when you can see amazing possibilities in almost any situation. Luckily, you're ready to take action now in order to realize the potential. But your heightened sense of urgency today may provoke you to jump in without considering the consequences. Be smart and keep your eyes on the distant horizon instead of being distracted by the anticipation of immediate gratification."
pisces,2013-06-19,"There are major rumblings rattling the depths of your inner world now. Fortunately, you're being offered magical glimpses of where your life could take you if you redirect some of your professional ambitions toward your personal life. It might even be time to start a project around the house or in the garden. Perhaps your visions are simply a reminder that emotional growth is just as important to your overall happiness as success in your chosen career."
aries,2013-06-20,"Remaining present with your feelings is tricky if your emotions raise issues that you prefer to avoid. You're ready to swing into action so you can evade a troublesome subject before it even comes up. Admit your vulnerability, instead of pretending that your infinite powers will overcome any awkward circumstances. Facing your very human limitations solidifies a new friendship or deepens an existing relationship. Opening your heart inspires others to do the same."
taurus,2013-06-20,"You may realize that your participation in a discussion won't necessarily be of much help today. You're eager to assist someone through a sticky situation, but it's important to acknowledge that you don't have any quick answers. You might respond by keeping yourself so busy that you don't have time to engage in anyone else's melodrama. But rather than relying on evasive tactics, it's healthier to just be honest and establish comfortable boundaries right from the start."
gemini,2013-06-20,"You wish that you could jump around and enjoy one fun activity after another, but your fearful emotions might unexpectedly hijack the day. You may be feeling so overwhelmed today that you worry yourself into a state of panic before you ask for help from anyone else. Covering up your true feelings is counter-productive. Sincere communication with someone you trust can quickly turn your day around."
cancer,2013-06-20,"A recent emotional conflict or a disappointment in a relationship might be the cause of your current feeling of loss. Now, however, these distractions are starting to dissipate, leaving you with sufficient time to find your direction anew. But don't be afraid of the silence; listening to your own thoughts can bring the clarity you seek. Even if everything isn't exactly the way you want it, your inner wisdom will tell you what you need to hear."
leo,2013-06-20,"Today is another turning point on your continuing journey of change. However, there could be a lot of internal movement that remains invisible to others now. Your current dreams hold significant keys to your future, even if they seem disconnected from the practicalities of everyday life. But there's no need to share your visions with anyone else yet. Keeping up outer appearances gives you plenty of room to pursue your meaningful inner work."
virgo,2013-06-20,"Your perspective on what's happening today is generally positive, but the secretive Scorpio Moon's presence in your 3rd House of Communication indicates that it's wise to keep your thoughts to yourself. Even if your ideas are amazing, they may still require more time to develop. Sharing what's on your mind now could disperse the energy that's better put toward fine-tuning your plans. Be patient; you can always tell your story tomorrow."
libra,2013-06-20,"Managing your money should be top priority today, especially if you're insecure about your fiscal situation. The Moon's current visit to your 2nd House of Personal Resources brings your material world into focus, raising concerns about whether or not you can meet your financial obligations. Ultimately, your fears may be more intense than your circumstances warrant. Remember, your positive attitude could be all it takes to shift the energy in the right direction."
scorpio,2013-06-20,"You might feel as if you're on the edge of an emotional cliff, yet you realize there is no one else to blame for your current predicament. Thankfully, you have a strong inner resolve and are able to navigate your way through the situation that you created. But this isn't just about your strength of character; it's also about your ability to transmute fear into love. Although you might feel isolated now, someone's support is waiting for you if you allow yourself to be vulnerable enough to receive it."
sagittarius,2013-06-20,"It's challenging to accept the reactions of others at face value, especially if they quietly retreat or just look at you with bemused puzzlement. Your confidence is tested because you might not receive all the positive feedback that you expected. Fortunately, you're able to find bright spots, even if you wish you had more support. Nevertheless, don't lose faith in yourself; let your imagination create the future that you want."
capricorn,2013-06-20,"It's crucial to reconnect with your life purpose today, especially if you have been standing on unstable ground. You are more confident if you know exactly where you are and what you are doing, but you probably won't have that luxury now. Give yourself time to regain your footing. Don't just blindly continue on your old path; regroup and set fresh goals before calculating a new course."
aquarius,2013-06-20,"Your emotions are all riled up today, but that doesn't mean you want others to know how you're feeling. You might wish that you had a plan to keep your turmoil to a minimum, but your worries may bubble up to the surface anyhow. Nothing will be gained by pretending everything is fine, but you don't have to share more than you want. A magical healing process is unfolding yet attempts to control it will only slow it down."
pisces,2013-06-20,"It's true that your goals are lofty, but you can make significant headway toward them if only you set your mind to it. Fortunately, you're confident about your ability to stay on track today, and are less likely to be distracted by your shifting moods. Focus on your dreams and follow your heart. Remember, you don't have to prove anything to others now; all you need to do is concentrate on your destination."
aries,2013-06-21,"You may be caught off guard today as your key planet Mars forms complicated aspects with serious Saturn and suspicious Pluto. Even if you were planning on a relaxing day, you don't mind working hard if pleasure is your ultimate goal. But you may be like a moth lured to the flame; it looks enticing until you get so close you need to fly away to avoid being burned. Don't be in such a hurry to reach satisfaction; the truth is it's more about the journey than the destination."
taurus,2013-06-21,"It's tempting to sit back and soak in the good vibrations today as mischievous Mercury hooks up with your key planet Venus in receptive Cancer. Others see an easygoing side of your nature as you lazily move through the day, but they can't perceive your inner angst. Although you might enjoy yourself, you're also experiencing a bit of restlessness. For now, focus on the current activities instead of thinking about the future. The key to your happiness may be right in front of your nose."
gemini,2013-06-21,"In true Gemini fashion, you're being pulled in two distinct directions today. Feisty Mars fires up your enthusiasm about the exciting potential in your life. Yet you're also bored with your current obligations and regular routines. Instead of attempting to temper your extreme feelings and find a middle ground now, try holding on to the opposite desires until you're ready to resolve the energy creatively. Exploring all your options gives you the best chances for success."
cancer,2013-06-21,"The Sun's shift into your emotionally self-protective sign reminds you that you no one can force you to be social unless you are so inclined. Although you deserve time to rest, it may take extra effort to find your desired level of solitude now, especially if others pursue you and try to cheer you up. There's nothing wrong with asking for some peace and quiet. Be kind yet firm when establishing your boundaries; you simply need some time alone."
leo,2013-06-21,"You may feel a bit stifled today as prior obligations restrict your activities and prevent you from doing exactly what you want. However, don't be too quick to judge the situation. Slow down and ask yourself how you can benefit from fulfilling your responsibilities now. Even if your mental restlessness has you jumping all over the place, you'll be happier if you stay in one place long enough to make it feel like your own."
virgo,2013-06-21,"For some reason it's tough to follow through on tasks that should be very simple today. The problem is that you are tempted by one distraction after another. Although you can draw from an inner reserve of willpower, making one tough decision is not enough. You'll need to be vigilant and continue to put yourself back on track again and again throughout the day. If you manage to stay focused now, you will be happy with your progress by the end of the day."
libra,2013-06-21,"You appear easygoing, but you have an agenda and you won't let much stand in your way of getting things done now. Naturally, you would choose peace over conflict, but your key planet Venus forms an otherworldly septile with stern Saturn today. You're willing to take on a serious adversary if he or she tries to mess with your plans. Nevertheless, pick your battles carefully or you'll waste energy fighting for something that doesn't really matter."
scorpio,2013-06-21,"Your stubbornness can be so intense today that you might win an argument even if you're wrong. In fact, you may choose to sidestep a conflict now because you have the ability to wait out your opponent; you might be successful even without direct confrontation. But this kind of victory is less than satisfying and could create an uncomfortable power dynamic. Facing the issues sooner than later prevents needless problems before they happen."
sagittarius,2013-06-21,"You may try blaming your current uneasiness on others, but it's not really about them. The problem is that your friends and family aren't necessarily in the same frame of mind as you are today. Even if you encourage them to be independent, they're not ready. Yet, their unwillingness to settle down pushes your buttons as you seek more stability now. Keep in mind that your security comes from within and is not as dependent on anyone else as you might believe."
capricorn,2013-06-21,"Confronting someone who tries to control you is a strategy that won't likely pay off today. Other people are very subtle with manipulative behavior now and could probably justify any action while also defending their innocence. Instead of trying to change anyone else, a workable solution can be found by adjusting how you respond to the current circumstances. Luckily, your positive attitude is nearly impossible to resist."
aquarius,2013-06-21,"You want to skate through the day, but you probably fall short of your own expectations as you get pulled into a melodrama that might not even involve you. It doesn't matter what your intentions are today, since engaging in a conversation is enough to make you a participant and not an observer. You can be most helpful now by actively listening, clearly stating your position and then not wandering too far from what you say. It's not about being right or wrong; it's just about offering others a different perspective."
pisces,2013-06-21,"Romantic interests may be piqued today, but you might not get exactly what you expect. In fact, you'll likely encounter disappointment if you set your goals too high. Fortunately, your eagerness to show up with an open heart can win you the love you seek. Allow the process enough room to develop at its own natural rate without being too pushy. Love will find a way."
aries,2013-06-22,"You may feel like you're on top of the world now as the pieces of your life begin to fall into place. However, your recent planning isn't as useful as you hoped. Your overall strategy might still be the same, but an onslaught of information is changing things and you need to reconsider your options. Don't be afraid to make new decisions along the way. Do your best to manage your enthusiasm or you'll inadvertently take on more responsibilities than you can handle."
taurus,2013-06-22,"Just as you think your life is settling down, everything becomes hectic again. Fortunately, it isn't necessarily unpleasant; it's just that your day may overflow with a variety of activities that don't allow you to get your much-needed downtime. Nevertheless, there still are choices you can make throughout the day that have a calming effect if you stop long enough to think about the various alternatives. The trick is finding a balance between taking it easy and making the most of the moment."
gemini,2013-06-22,"Someone may have very high hopes for you, but pursuing your desires is more important now than fulfilling anyone else's expectations. Keep in mind that those who believe they know what's best for you could be working on incorrect assumptions. Listening to sage advice is often a smart strategy, but you don't have to follow it unless you actually think it's useful at this time. You're the only one that knows exactly what you want."
cancer,2013-06-22,"You may feel overly confident about what you can accomplish on the home front today, and your unrealistic expectations could set you up for unnecessary failure. Instead of making lists of the projects you want to finish, take the time to make a detailed plan for just one. Although this level of intense preparation doesn't guarantee success, it certainly does increase your chances of having something tangible to show for your day."
leo,2013-06-22,"You may declare the game of waiting officially over today, but the Moon's current visit to your 5th House of Spontaneity doesn't tell the entire story. You would like to take a risk in order to avoid sitting on pins and needles any longer. However, you can still receive benefit from glimpses of the possibilities ahead without initiating action yet. Talking about your move with a good friend brings more clarity, helping you to make some last minute improvements to your plan."
virgo,2013-06-22,"A barrage of domestic distractions makes it challenging to stay focused today. If it's not friends unexpectedly stopping by to chat, then it may be family commitments that demand your attention. Luckily, the current situation can teach you the power of having faith in a larger process. Even if you aren't able to methodically push your way through your chores now, a more laid-back approach can ultimately get the job done, too. Thankfully, there are many paths to the same destination."
libra,2013-06-22,"You might run around today trying to do a zillion things, which actually could prevent you from doing any of them effectively. However, balancing work and play is more difficult when you can't catch up on your obligations. Making one too many promises might prompt you to consider walking away from your commitments without even trying to fulfill any of them. But don't be foolish; it's best to pare back your responsibilities before you're in over your head. Setting boundaries allows you to find some much-needed time for yourself."
scorpio,2013-06-22,"Building on what you recently started is a good idea in concept, but it will be challenging to actually do until you find your groove. Even if you are struggling today, you can see the pieces of a complicated puzzle starting to fit together in ways you never imagined. But don't be too assertive yet. It's much wiser to build momentum gradually at first and then turn on the steam in a few days once you have your goal in sight."
sagittarius,2013-06-22,The evocative Moon's visit to your optimistic sign can quickly work up your enthusiasm to a fevered pitch. But frenzied excitement isn't constructive because it's difficult to follow through on all your promises. The trick is to maintain your newfound confidence without taking on so much now that you disappoint others and lose faith in yourself. Others will enjoy your company more today if you keep your exuberance from going to an extreme. You can still be inspirational without being the loudest person in the room.
capricorn,2013-06-22,"Even if you have good reasons to celebrate today, you might not want to tell anyone else just yet. Instead of announcing your exciting news, you may choose to keep it hidden for a while longer because you don't want to deal with someone's envy of your good fortune. Unfortunately, this kind of protective logic could backfire on you as your friends might feel cheated out of sharing in your success. Let others know what's going on without embellishing your story or gloating too much. There's nothing wrong with taking pride in your progress."
aquarius,2013-06-22,"You're excited about the prospect of spending quality time with friends and dreaming out loud about your ideal fantasies for the future. Unfortunately, you cannot be bothered with the boring details of financial planning now. You just want to think about the big picture and not deal with money issues until absolutely necessary. Nevertheless, be smart and set aside some time to manage your fiscal affairs before committing to anything else."
pisces,2013-06-22,"You may be more concerned with making a public appearance now that the extroverted Sagittarius Moon is highlighting your 10th House of Status. It's okay if you don't really want to talk about anything of substance so you can take a break from sharing your feelings. For the present moment, keep your conversations limited to the broad strokes of your creative brush. You can always fill in the details in a day or two when you are ready."
aries,2013-06-23,"Even if you're planning to stay home today, the Capricorn Full Moon's presence in your 10th House of Public Responsibility indicates that you still have your mind on work. You might have taken on one too many projects and now you have to show up and deliver the goods, whether or not you feel like it. Fortunately, a methodical approach and consistent effort increases your current progress toward reaching your goals."
taurus,2013-06-23,"You're more determined than ever about taking a major trip, even if your dream seems to be in jeopardy. But instead of just working harder, you also need to think smarter. The Capricorn Full Moon falls in your 9th House of Big Ideas, motivating you to step out and take a chance. However, the breakthrough you seek can only occur if you are willing to travel outside of your safety zone and try something new. A calculated risk may be required to make something big happen."
gemini,2013-06-23,"You don't want to reveal too much today because withholding information prior to negotiating might give you a secret advantage. Interactions with others are complicated by the Capricorn Full Moon shining in your 8th House of Transformation and Regeneration. Nevertheless, if you want a relationship to last, you need to follow your emotions without knowing where they will lead. Shared intimacy is a reward that you must be willing to work for on a continuing basis."
cancer,2013-06-23,"Today's calculating Capricorn Full Moon lands in your 7th House of Relationships, stirring up some trouble or excitement. A current partnership might run into obstacles, requiring you to concentrate on your emotions and communicate what you're feeling as honestly as you can. If there's someone new in your life, resolving a touchy conflict now could set the foundation for what comes next. Either way, you'll do better if you respond directly from your heart."
leo,2013-06-23,"You must maintain consistency in your daily routine now, but it's challenging if your heart isn't completely connected to your actions. You can't pretend for long before your behavior starts to impact your day in a negative way. Nevertheless, the pragmatic Capricorn Full Moon illuminates your 6th House of Habits, telling you not to make any drastic changes to your regular schedule. Hold steady to your course; take faith in knowing that you'll gain traction again soon enough."
virgo,2013-06-23,"The Capricorn Full Moon emphasizes your 5th House of Self-Expression today, urging you to reveal your feelings rather than analyze them. However, it's tricky to find the right words in the moment. Instead of attempting to respond spontaneously as you're experiencing an emotion, simply let it pass. It's more productive to talk about your process once the intensity settles back down. In the meantime, exploring a creative outlet inspires your heart to shine."
libra,2013-06-23,"You're eager to proudly shine your light now that the radiant Sun is illuminating your 10th House of Career. However, the Capricorn Full Moon floods your 4th House of Foundations, indicating that a situation at home needs your immediate attention, too. You might think that you can't do everything, but your logic doesn't need to stop you from trying today. Be innovative and look for solutions that are outside of the box. Ultimately, you're capable of a lot more than you currently believe."
scorpio,2013-06-23,"Today's sobering Capricorn Full Moon intensifies your 3rd House of Communication, inundating it with data that might be overwhelming to integrate. The intensity has been building for a while, giving you the chance to prepare for the hectic pace of events. Don't hesitate to lean on friends if you need emotional support. Surprisingly, they'll respond more positively now than you expect. It may take a few days, but you'll be able to get the rest you need once the deluge is over."
sagittarius,2013-06-23,"You have one foot in your past and the other foot in your future today. The restrictive Capricorn Full Moon falls in your 2nd House of Values, binding you to old beliefs and traditions. However, you're tempted to leave everything behind and make a mad dash forward. Unfortunately, your tendency to aim high means that you could overextend your energy. Focus on reaching a conservative goal now, instead of falling short of an unrealistic one. Success is yours if you keep your feet on the ground."
capricorn,2013-06-23,"Someone with power or authority may ask for your support today. Luckily, you're sympathetic to other people's pain now because the Full Moon in your earthy sign sensitizes you to your personal priorities. However, you might hold someone else's angst at bay to protect your feelings. Unfortunately, this defensive reaction can prevent you from being in touch with your own emotions. Consciously listen to what others say and then respond honestly from your heart."
aquarius,2013-06-23,"Today's serious Capricorn Full Moon shines in your 12th House of Destiny, foreshadowing the consequences of your current choices. However, it's easy to place too much importance on making your decision now and not enough emphasis on following through with concrete action. Don't be so quick to talk about your plans. Instead of putting your energy into endless conversations, let others find out about your new direction from your actions. Talk less; do more."
pisces,2013-06-23,"You may think that others are trying to trick you into putting aside your agenda and following their plans as the practical Capricorn Full Moon reflects the needs of your 11th House of Teamwork. Even if you're an integral part of a work group, you might feel isolated for a while if your ideas differ from everyone else's. Nevertheless, it's crucial to honor your instincts and do what feels right. Don't succumb to peer pressure now just because you want to feel connected. Sometimes being a maverick can be lonely, but you are never truly alone."
aries,2013-06-24,"You are determined to reach your goals today and might not slow down, even if someone stands in your path. Unfortunately, direct confrontation isn't always the best way to respond. You may be overly obsessive about whatever you desire now, even if you simply want to rest. Demonstrating your ability to adapt to the needs of others ultimately helps you along your own path. The truth is that it does make sense to relax now while you have the chance."
taurus,2013-06-24,"Your fixed nature can land you in big trouble now, or it can serve you very well if you are already on your desired course. However, you might need a little help from your friends to steer you in the right direction, even if you don't want to listen to their opinions. Remaining open to the sensible advice of a trustworthy workmate today is a good place to start."
gemini,2013-06-24,"You might feel uncomfortably restricted by circumstances since you don't have much leeway to express yourself now. You are being challenged to limit your thinking so your ideas will fit into the environmental constraints of the day. Luckily, focusing your attention on a limited spectrum of possibilities today may help you be more effective than you ever imagined."
cancer,2013-06-24,"Someone may get on your nerves today, especially if he or she is touting a plan that doesn't necessarily match up with your own. You are apt to lose patience when others assume that you'll set your agenda aside to take care of them. But keeping your true feelings quiet and just acquiescing won't work for you now because it's important that your opinion is heard. Ultimately, common sense rules, so stick with the most practical idea, regardless of who thought of it first."
leo,2013-06-24,"Releasing unresolved feelings now isn't as easy as it sounds. You might not trust your intuition even if everything seems ready to shift. Nevertheless, others won't likely notice your frustration since they don't see your inner process. No matter what, you can't keep up appearances much longer. Instead of waiting until you reach your boiling point, express your emotions as gently as possible. Long-lasting positive change is possible if you start off on the right foot today."
virgo,2013-06-24,"You are at the beginning of a spiritual journey that's for your steps alone. You're exploring ways to reclaim your power, but the current dynamics might not fully support your growth. Don't try to manipulate circumstances in your favor. Realign with your core values now and exhibit the highest integrity possible in all that you do. Your strength will grow naturally as you rediscover your metaphysical center of gravity."
libra,2013-06-24,"You could be annoyed with yourself today if you didn't tell someone exactly what you were feeling. Thankfully, you can gain clarity now in a way that previously eluded you even if you choose not to share anything at this time. Don't question your analytical skills just because you can't integrate all the data at your fingertips. Although worrying about your next move is a waste of your energy, living in the present moment positively impacts your future."
scorpio,2013-06-24,"You might be more open to receiving emotional support today, even if you feel it's long overdue. Although extra demands may be placed on you now, your world is gradually becoming a friendlier place. Nevertheless, you still have to set aside an unresolved relationship issue, but there's no reason to continue worrying about it. Instead of waiting for someone to rush to your rescue, concentrate on staying afloat as the big waves of feelings wash through your life. Owning your power enables you to do things you never dreamed you could."
sagittarius,2013-06-24,"You may be relieved that your life isn't so hectic today even if there are still a few serious issues to handle. Unfortunately, it's not easy to relax now because there are so many different avenues that lead to your future, yet you cannot yet see what's around the next corner. Everyone needs a bit of downtime, so accept any peace and quiet as a gift from the cosmos while you're waiting for the next round of inspiration to strike."
capricorn,2013-06-24,"You are most comfortable when your feet are planted firmly on the ground. You prefer knowing exactly where you're going and when to take your next step. Although you may be feeling uncharacteristically uncertain today, it won't last long. Meanwhile, you can still enjoy expressing yourself as the reflective Moon travels through your sign. But don't get lazy; do your planning now instead of waiting until you're in the middle of the next storm."
aquarius,2013-06-24,"You usually trust your mind instead of relying on your heart when making important decisions. However, the tables are turning now. You like the idea of intimacy and may be willing to sacrifice hard-core data for the chance to intensify a relationship. You want to push past your resistance today, but powerful emotions can still make you uncomfortable. Fortunately, you aren't required to share everything all at once. Nevertheless, it's a good time to start manifesting your fantasies into reality before the opportunity fades."
pisces,2013-06-24,"It's wise to involve your friends and co-workers in your planning process today since group participation makes your day more enjoyable and efficient. People with important keys to your future may enter the picture now. Don't allow old fears of failure to sabotage your current fantasies by discouraging you before you even start. If you don't entertain your dreams, you'll never find out what is possible."
aries,2013-06-25,"A problem at home that has been lurking around in the background could shift to the forefront today. You may feel as if you are being prompted to say something, even if you prefer to remain neutral now. Unfortunately, your words have more consequences than you realize and might even make things worse. Before you start talking, consider if your disclosure will actually improve the situation. If not, remain silent for a while longer until your emotions settle down."
taurus,2013-06-25,"Worrying about something you should have said to a close friend or associate stirs up unresolved feelings today. But your concerns may stem from your current sensitivity to the energy in your immediate environment. Don't intrude into someone's life unless you have been specifically invited. Although it is healthy to acknowledge your compassion for those closest to you, it's also necessary to remember that you're not responsible for anyone's emotions except your own. Show others you care without saying a word."
gemini,2013-06-25,"You may feel as if you're in over your head today, but you are also clever enough to outwit even the toughest opponent. However, there's no time to waste on hopes tied to blind optimism. Pay careful attention to everything that is said before making your case as succinctly as you can. Thinking quickly enables you to emerge victorious now, but only if you're realistic about your limitations and confident of your skills."
cancer,2013-06-25,"You can feel the pressure to say more than you want to now. However, you're still trying to resist the need to jump into the flow. The more others push, the more you resist their efforts. Nevertheless, you might be relieved to have a group discussion to bring everything out in the open, even if it's challenging to move the conversation along. Break through your own reticence, because nothing will change if you wait for anyone else to speak for you."
leo,2013-06-25,"Even if your patience has reached its limit, you still may try to balance your needs with what others want now. You might feel resentful if someone is standing between you and your potential enjoyment. Paradoxically, keeping your anger to yourself only strengthens it. A smarter strategy is to get your annoyance out in the open as kindly and gently as possible. Thankfully, your negativity can be transformed once it is seen for what it is. Being honest right away starts your day off right."
virgo,2013-06-25,"Several planets visiting your 11th House of Friends connect you socially on a deeper emotional level now. Although you might feel good about playing an integral role on the team, you could easily be absorbed by the group process. Finding a healthy balance between your personal life and your professional one is often tricky. Even when working with others today, it's an excellent idea to make certain that everyone knows that your needs matter, too. Ultimately, setting boundaries is all up to you."
libra,2013-06-25,"You're often inclined to keep your opinions to yourself to maintain the peace. However, someone may push your emotional buttons today and provoke you to say more than is necessary. Although it's wiser to listen to logic, you're motivated by your sense of fair play to set the record straight. Nevertheless, practicing diplomacy is still your best strategy; you can be honest without having to get everything out in the open in one single blast."
scorpio,2013-06-25,"Although several planets comfort you while they are visiting emotional Cancer now, your words may seem more confrontational today than you intend. Your key planet, Pluto, is in a prolonged tug-of-war with your need for security, prompting harsh words to slip off your tongue before you can stop them. The consequences of your current honesty could stir up a hornet's nest of complex feelings. Unnecessary stress can be avoided if you stop to consider other people's reactions first."
sagittarius,2013-06-25,"Your window of opportunity is closing and you could lose your chance to say what's on your mind if you don't initiate an overdue conversation soon. You may be uncomfortable showing your vulnerability, but you are able to quickly adjust to the situation now. However, impulsive disclosures tend to be shallow and might not lead to true satisfaction, so make your plan and execute it while you still can. Although your natural confidence is a blessing, be smart and move slowly at first."
capricorn,2013-06-25,"You may be obsessing about a friend or partner today, whether or not the relationship has a viable future. You might choose to withdraw now because retreating from non-essential interactions could be healthy in the long run. Letting go is often painful, yet making believe that everything is fine is even worse. You can always reconnect later once you feel more like yourself. Instead of giving away all your energy, take time to replenish your vitality now."
aquarius,2013-06-25,"You might be holding out for a better deal today, but it's still wise to reconsider your demands and be open to negotiation. Your natural ability to see things from a rational point of view isn't working as well as it usually does, making it harder to disconnect from a complex web of feelings now. Acknowledging that you are human just like everyone else will make it easier to express what is in your heart. Cultivating trust is the first step to establishing common ground."
pisces,2013-06-25,"Although you might attempt to go quietly about your business today, frustration levels could build to a breaking point because you believe that someone isn't being totally honest with you. You would rather hear the truth than waste your energy trying to fill in the missing answers. Ironically, the more you question others, the more they withdraw. Instead of going on the offensive, process your own feelings now without pushing for resolution until more facts come to light."
aries,2013-06-26,"Oddly enough, today's stress is your friend because it can motivate you to take care of business. You're eager to put in extra effort without messing up all that you have gained. Your current impatience may provoke you to rush into action before thinking about the consequences. However, a steady approach and a methodical follow-through are needed to reach your goals. There's no need to gamble with your future if you consider your options without expecting to change everything all at once."
taurus,2013-06-26,"Fascinating fantasies about new ways to make money fill your head with all kinds of schemes today. But instead of executing a sound business plan, you may be entranced with all your clever ideas. Nevertheless, you can exert more control over your future once you realize the importance of practicing self-discipline. Rather than letting your imagination run wild, make a sensible choice and concentrate on achieving one worthwhile goal."
gemini,2013-06-26,You can't afford to behave irresponsibly today if you have already made prior commitments. But it's difficult to stay focused and deliver on your promises if you believe your fantasies are worth pursuing. Avoid the temptation to escape; it's wiser to keep bringing yourself back to reality so you don't have to pay too high of a price later on. Honoring your previous obligations now paves the way to your future success.
cancer,2013-06-26,"Big thinking means letting go of the details, so prepare to scale back your plan on a moment's notice. It isn't worth exhausting yourself now by waging a battle you cannot win. But don't surrender your dreams either. Instead, find a middle path that doesn't require you to sacrifice your ideals. Balance may be elusive today, but dogged persistence moves you in the right direction. It's possible to compromise without giving up what matters most."
leo,2013-06-26,"Feeling emotionally lighter may be tough these days, but moving through your own resistance is your only sensible option. Luckily, a current situation gives you a chance to demonstrate a new and improved you. There are many paths to choose from at this time; but ultimately, it's up to you. Surround yourself with fun-loving people who can help you enjoy the healing properties of laughter and love."
virgo,2013-06-26,"Mercury's retrograde turn pulls you in too many directions today. Your anxiety increases because you may be overwhelmed by so many things to do that you must eliminate some of them. Perhaps your life has become more complex, but you must do something about it. Although change doesn't often come easily, you can alter your future and accomplish almost anything now if you set your mind to it."
libra,2013-06-26,"Your sign is sometimes known for being indecisive because you're naturally able to temper extreme ideas and find common ground. However, today you may be ready to jump one way or the other, because you don't have much time in order to make up your mind. It's more important to be swift in judgment now than to be perfect. But even if you make your decision and move on, there's nothing wrong with shifting directions as your perspective changes."
scorpio,2013-06-26,"You have a lot to say now but you'll probably keep your feelings to yourself until someone asks for your opinion. You might justify your silence by believing that others won't understand what you're going through, anyhow. Nevertheless, you might be happily surprised with the support you receive if you take a risk and share your unresolved feelings today. The current process of transformation will be gentler than you think."
sagittarius,2013-06-26,"Even if everyone thinks that you're open to feedback from your peers, your convictions are stronger than they seem now. You're focused on your long-term plans, even if someone is telling you to pay more attention to what's happening today. Nevertheless, you may think that your friends are just trying to make matters worse by distracting you with their opinions. Fortunately, you have the tools to keep yourself on track and it's up to you to use them."
capricorn,2013-06-26,"You might feel a bit disorganized today, but you can still effectively push toward your goals nonetheless. You don't like being spread too thin. However, it helps if you concentrate on just one specific goal at a time. Instead of worrying about your schedule, sit down and make a list of what you want to do. Prioritize your tasks before rolling up your sleeves and getting to work. You'll accomplish more and feel better about your day if you approach it in a more logical manner."
aquarius,2013-06-26,"Your most serious concerns at work could become overwhelming today, prompting you to make an overdue decision. But every little problem is tied to a larger issue and there's no way of getting around it. Be prepared to dig your way to the bottom, if necessary. But don't be in too much of a hurry; the only urgency is your own psychological pressure. Ultimately, using your moral compass enables you to navigate through the alternatives and choose the best one for your long-term success."
pisces,2013-06-26,"You are emotionally stretched as far as you can go today, yet your current confidence might prevent you from compromising. You don't mind constructive criticism from a friend or partner, yet it may seem as if positive feedback is hard to find now. If you encounter resistance, set firm boundaries. Once you know that you're on the right track, stay with it. Your actions will speak louder than anything you can say."
aries,2013-06-27,"There's little need for worry if you are overwhelmed by strong emotions today, because ultimately they will lead you along an inspirational path. However, it's tempting to linger in this irrational realm once you start to become comfortable. Nevertheless, you have work to do as an action hero, so why spend too much time now lost in your feelings? Beauty is all around you; learn your lessons and then move on to more creative endeavors."
taurus,2013-06-27,"The evocative Moon swims into your 11th House of Social Networking, bringing emotional support from friends and associates. Thankfully, you won't have to work very hard to get the assistance you need. Although being accepted by your peers is a blessing, you might be tempted to set your professional agenda aside in order to focus on your relationships. However, it's smarter in the long run to concentrate on your work today and let everything else just fall into place."
gemini,2013-06-27,"You're not looking for anyone to give you direction today since you intuitively know what you must do. Even if you experience some self-doubt, trust the guidance you receive from within. There's no need to have a specific goal in mind now as long as you acknowledge your feelings. Since talkative Mercury is retrograde, it's best to bypass language. Instead of falling back on logic, just go with the flow and see what happens."
cancer,2013-06-27,"Although you have a healthy understanding of the big picture today as you visualize your future, you ultimately want to know what's in it for you. There's nothing wrong with looking out for your own interests as long as you also remain open to a more global perspective. But even if you're tempted to do as you wish now, the price of independence may be more than you expect. Instead of acting impulsively, take a deep breath and remember that your long-term goals are more important than immediate satisfaction."
leo,2013-06-27,"There is something that you want, but you haven't been able to acknowledge it publicly. However, magnetic Venus enters your dramatic sign today, inspiring you to express your heart's desire. Nevertheless, significant pieces of your truth still lurk in the shadows, requiring you to face an old fear. Thankfully, the outcome is good so don't fret. Muster up the courage that you need to erase any lingering negativity and get on with the show."
virgo,2013-06-27,"Your friends and associates may be so concerned about your emotional well-being now that they go out of their way to connect with you. However, you can sense that something isn't out in the open, making you uncertain about their motives. It's not that anyone is trying to mislead you, but it appears that you're not getting the whole truth. Don't go looking for a fight; you won't gain anything by forcing an issue today. Let the story unfold on its own and then you will know what to do next."
libra,2013-06-27,"Take care of your responsibilities the best you can today, even if you don't know exactly what is expected of you. Unfortunately, your inquiries won't likely uncover the information you seek. Instead of filling your mind with useless details, just attend to the most immediate problems as they surface and don't worry about the rest. Taking things one step at a time requires faith in the abundance of the universe, but a conscientious attitude helps you achieve success."
scorpio,2013-06-27,"It seems as if one phase of your life is falling away, and you aren't all that unhappy about its demise. If you have been floating along, waiting for something to inspire you, this could be your chance. It's as if you are expecting guests, yet you don't know who they are or when they will arrive. Nevertheless, there is a lot to do right now in preparation of your next adventure, so get busy without wasting a precious moment."
sagittarius,2013-06-27,"Too many responsibilities at work today may prevent you from spending time at home and connecting with your family. Ultimately, you would like to have long conversations with people you trust. But this level of relaxation will probably have to wait until you have fulfilled your more pressing obligations, which obviously must take precedence now. Ironically, just being grateful of life's blessings could be enough to improve your attitude so you can enjoy the day, no matter what it entails."
capricorn,2013-06-27,"Relationship dynamics are about to change for the better. Even if you don't know what's going to happen yet, you can sense the potential. Perhaps you recently experienced a positive interaction with a workmate who truly understands your intentions and now this acquaintance is about to go through a powerful metamorphosis. Quit worrying about things beyond your control; taking your transitions in stride will lead you to a better place."
aquarius,2013-06-27,"The Moon's presence in your 2nd House of Money indicates that you may receive some positive financial news today. However, you might fool yourself if you imagine everything to be perfect. Avoiding problems could cause them to snowball and become less manageable in the future. Luckily, your current ability to envision a positive outcome combined with your commitment to hard work enables you to make the most of an opportunity."
pisces,2013-06-27,"The Moon's return to your sign puts you in a hypersensitive state of awareness today as she merges with psychic Neptune. However, it can be difficult to separate your accurate hunches from a wishful fantasy. Unfortunately, too much analysis pulls you out of your intuitive state and replaces trust with fear. Meditation might help to clear your mind of anxiety. Even if you believe that you must do something right away, it's smarter now to wait a bit and allow your unconscious feelings to bubble up to the surface. Slow down and take the time to listen to your heart."
aries,2013-06-28,"Dreams that are floating around at the edge of your awareness could actually take shape today. Although this process sounds lovely, fantasies complicate your life if they become real. Thankfully, you don't have to fall prey to fears that can sour a sweet situation. Keep in mind that there's nothing to prove to anyone now. All you need to do is show up with a pure heart and an open mind."
taurus,2013-06-28,"If a friend or coworker requests your help today, you probably won't be able to say no. You might think it's better to mind your own business and get on with your work, but rational detachment won't subdue your feelings now. Don't fret if you are overwhelmed with sympathy for an underdog because there's nothing wrong with assisting those in need. Just remember that accepting your own limitations can prevent frustration down the road. Even if you can't fix everything, lending a hand is better than doing nothing at all."
gemini,2013-06-28,"Things at work might not go according to your plans today. Your day could even be turned upside down because someone else's behavior negatively impacts your schedule. You can't maintain control over all unexpected events, but you can alter the outcome by consciously managing your reactions. Anger is easily misdirected now, so take the high road when you have a choice. Practicing forgiveness produces the most positive results."
cancer,2013-06-28,"You can easily misread someone's intentions today even if you want to believe the best in them. You may have suspicions that others aren't being very supportive of your efforts. You might even think they are working against you, but you could just be afraid of being rejected. However, processing your own emotional insecurities now is more crucial than worrying about anyone else. Paradoxically, changing your attitude positively impacts the attitude of everyone around you."
leo,2013-06-28,"This is an intense day, especially if you have a disagreement with a close friend or partner. Thankfully, you have an opportunity to turn an uncomfortable dynamic into a positive one by establishing new boundaries. Rather than analyzing your current choices within the narrow confines of your personal beliefs, step past your old limitations. Reframe your experience in the spirit of gratitude and abundance. It's not about getting more ... it's simply about appreciating what you have right now."
virgo,2013-06-28,It's too soon to make a detailed plan because you might not have a very solid grip on your future goals yet. Creating a map before you have established a specific destination is like putting the cart before the horse. Don't get caught up in the small stuff today. Keep an open channel to your heart's desire and wait a few days before figuring out a sensible strategy. Have faith in the process and give yourself permission to dream.
libra,2013-06-28,"Someone's unexpected actions at work may take the air out of your balloon and send your confidence into a temporary tailspin today. Thankfully, you should be able to pull out of it gracefully; your sense of humor can save the day if you let it. At first, you might think you made a mistake, but you were likely given incorrect information. You didn't do anything wrong; once you stop blaming yourself, it's easy to turn things around and fly off to your preferred destination."
scorpio,2013-06-28,"You can say the right thing today without even trying, making it easier to get what you want while also feeling good about yourself. However, you still may need more time to consider the variety of options in front of you now. Don't cave under pressure ... wait until you are ready before making a serious commitment. In the meantime, bask in the love that's all around you without feeling the need to choose one way or the other."
sagittarius,2013-06-28,"Powerful emotions draw you toward someone special today, but you may be unsure as to what comes next. Normally, you are content to just make it up as you go, but you're more hesitant now that you're walking on unfamiliar ground. Ironically, there isn't any hurry to go anywhere; you are already where you need to be. Nevertheless, your current position can be significantly altered once you change your mind and relax."
capricorn,2013-06-28,"Someone may express positive feelings toward you today, which can turn an easygoing moment into an awkward one. You might be uncertain how to react and could even choose to put up defensive walls to maintain stability. However, it probably isn't the other person you are avoiding; your own issues could appear in projected form if you try to ignore them. Paradoxically, as you grow more comfortable talking about your emotions, you also become more open to everyone else."
aquarius,2013-06-28,You may be confused at work if someone appears to be ignoring you today. But don't take it personally if he or she is a bit shy and needs to withdraw emotionally to create safe space. There's no need to pursue others who aren't eager to interact now. Let them be as they are without any judgments or expectations on your part. Give your friends the same breathing room that you normally want from them.
pisces,2013-06-28,"Although it's not easy to express what's in your heart today, the inspirational Pisces Moon gives you the courage to take a chance if you feel ready. However, the response may not be what you expect since others might be irrationally threatened by your disclosure. Saying too much could reveal information they don't need to know. Remember, you don't have to share every single thing. Watch your audience along the way before telling too many secrets. Other people's reactions will help to clarify your next move."
aries,2013-06-29,"You aren't likely to take yourself too seriously today, even if you stop and think about what you are doing. After a few moments of concerned contemplation the spontaneous Aries Moon has you ready to return to action, whether or not you  handled the underlying issue. Remember, you can't escape from the truth. Avoiding it now means you'll have to reprocess your current experience another time when it could be more difficult. There's no time like the present moment to be real."
taurus,2013-06-29,"You might not have as much to hide as you think you do today, because your story will probably come out into the open sooner than you expect. If you attempt to mislead anyone on purpose now -- even if only by a lie of omission -- an otherwise lovely moment could turn sour pretty quickly. Secrets can get in the way of a special connection with a friend. Even if being honest is difficult, keeping communication channels open is essential."
gemini,2013-06-29,"Today may be more fun than you expect, even if you have lots of work on your plate. Attempting to escape from your responsibilities is a waste of energy; instead, find a way to enjoy yourself while meeting your obligations. Even if your mind wanders now, pull yourself back from the enticing world of daydreams. Focusing on practical issues isn't easy, but it allows you to take more time off later when you can truly relax."
cancer,2013-06-29,"Although you might have the day off today, you still have inescapable responsibilities to fulfill. Instead of procrastinating, it's healthier to recognize the financial or psychological benefits of putting in extra effort until your chores are finished. Thinking about something that you want to do later could encourage you to give a task all you have now. As long as you are feeling inspired, anything that motivates you can be turned into constructive action."
leo,2013-06-29,"You can use your contagious enthusiasm to enlist others to assist you with your project or join you in an enjoyable activity. Just remember not to say too much; the more verbose you are now, the less sincere you sound. Pretend you're on a secret mission to get someone's attention. But once your message is delivered, stop talking. Strategic communication enables everyone to see you in your best light."
virgo,2013-06-29,"It can be annoying when your family and friends seem to be so optimistic, especially if you believe that they're avoiding the truth. However, their actions are only half the picture today, since you could actually benefit by indulging in your fantasies. Thankfully, no one needs to know what occurs in the privacy of your imagination; you're not required to tell anyone what you are thinking now. Giving yourself permission to engage your inner world also softens your judgments on those you love."
libra,2013-06-29,"Relationships are highlighted by the reflective Moon's presence in your 7th House of Companions today. Unfortunately, your most supportive allies may seem argumentative now, even if they claim to be on your side. Keep in mind that you could be projecting your own suppressed anger on to someone else and that it might actually be you who is in denial. Tune into what's happening with your heart instead of your head. Empathy, not rationalization, is your current path to peace."
scorpio,2013-06-29,"Taking a chance and doing something new and different for your health is a smart idea today. The enterprising Aries Moon is visiting your 6th House of Routine, encouraging you to reassess the daily habits that contribute to your current lifestyle. It's time to blaze a new trail if you're not feeling your physical best. Modifying what you eat and intensifying your exercise routine could create long-term positive results. Mixing things up pushes you out of any unhealthy patterns before you get stuck."
sagittarius,2013-06-29,"The fiery Aries Moon harmoniously trines sweet Venus in radiant Leo, heating your emotions and tempting you to burn your candle at both ends. You are inspired now to share what's in your heart, but it's crucial to avoid spinning wheels of words that go round and round in the same old circles. Take a gamble and try a different approach just to shake things up; you may be pleasantly surprised by what happens next."
capricorn,2013-06-29,"Your integrity is your greatest strength now because others won't have a good reason to resist your efforts when they see that you are consistently walking your talk. However, your current goals aren't limited to observable accomplishments in the real world. There's no need to waste any energy explaining yourself; just express what's most important through actions rather than words. Your heart shines through every kind move you make."
aquarius,2013-06-29,"Playful interactions with others are lovely today, but a simple misunderstanding could temporarily create tension in a friendship. Luckily, this may be more like a family squabble than anything else. Nevertheless, express hurt feelings before any trouble arises. Negativity can't linger to do damage if you consciously decide to talk it out. The faster you can clear the air, the better. The less time spent in anger, the more time for fun."
pisces,2013-06-29,"The Aries Moon is hanging out in your 2nd House of Money, supplying you with new ideas about potential sources of income. But don't spend too much time obsessing about any one possibility since over-analysis can restrict your creativity, preventing you from having the next inspiration. However, if you believe that there are many opportunities ahead, this is your chance to explore several of them at once without any pressure to pursue just one."
aries,2013-06-30,"You know what you want today since the enterprising Aries Moon reflects your current needs. But publicly declaring your desires isn't necessarily your smartest move now. Unfortunately, everyone doesn't share in your passions, creating an awkward situation or an uncomfortable dilemma. It may be in your best interest to keep your feelings to yourself for a while longer as you continue to study the various options. You might even surprise yourself and change your mind along the way."
taurus,2013-06-30,"You may believe that you don't have to say a word today because your closest friends and family members already know what you are feeling. There are many ways to demonstrate your affection, and although verbal communication might seem to be the most obvious, it isn't always the most efficient. Planning a sweet surprise for someone special will get your message across faster than anything else."
gemini,2013-06-30,"Your unbridled enthusiasm has a strong impact on your partner or lover today. However, a long and drawn-out speech may be the wrong approach unless you quickly follow through with sincere actions. People might tire of your smooth words and easy promises if you don't start walking your talk. Remember that fulfilling your obligations requires a lot less chatter and plenty more action."
cancer,2013-06-30,"It really shouldn't be so complicated to just let someone know how you feel. Unfortunately, it can be difficult to express yourself today, prompting others to think you're not being very sincere at all. This relationship dynamic may be very frustrating, but you can avoid a big misunderstanding by sticking to the facts and simply speaking from your heart. It won't be as hard as you think once you get the ball rolling."
leo,2013-06-30,"It's difficult to know if you should call it quits now or get ready to launch a major initiative. Unfortunately, your words cannot tell the whole story. You might choose to embellish your tale since charming Venus is hanging out in dramatic Leo in your 1st House of Personality. Nevertheless, it's smarter to cut it short in order to make it more believable. Don't be shallow; covering up the truth is harder in the long run than simply admitting what you don't know in the first place."
virgo,2013-06-30,"Practicing social diplomacy helps to grease the wheels of relationships today as you dig beneath the surface to get to the truth. Your task will be easier if you can convince others to partake in your research. However, if you can't find anyone to assist you, a visit to a counselor or therapist might be enough to take the edge off. Nevertheless, softening your approach enables others to understand your point of view; keep in mind that there is no right or wrong when it comes to matters of the heart."
libra,2013-06-30,"Emotional dependency is a familiar trap, yet it's still tempting to base your responses on how you believe someone else will react. Naturally, your attitude is crucial to what happens next, so express yourself in a way that also conveys kindness and demonstrates your flexibility. However, instead of weighing the impact of your words; just go ahead and say them aloud as they enter your awareness. Others will appreciate your honesty whether they agree with you or not."
scorpio,2013-06-30,"Approach your day from a new angle today because as you change your attitude, you also alter the roles that others have in your life. But it isn't easy to choose your part in the play with your emotions being pulled in so many directions. Instead of falling back on performing a familiar character, try getting to know yourself and others better first. This radical strategy could also bring alternative choices to the table, offering you paths you haven't yet considered."
sagittarius,2013-06-30,"You might be concerned about revealing too much today because everything appears to be happening so quickly. However, there's no reason to take the easy way out by building self-protective walls or you'll only increase your loneliness. Instead, muster up enough courage to stand up and say exactly how you feel to someone you trust. Healing old wounds begins with opening your heart and expressing your truth."
capricorn,2013-06-30,"It's no fun to tiptoe around on eggshells just because you don't want to stir up intense feelings now. Unfortunately, your caution might have the opposite effect of what you want. If you find yourself in a conversation about your feelings today, don't hold back. Be as brutally honest as possible while remaining kind to others. Ultimately, you can maintain your integrity while still showing compassion."
aquarius,2013-06-30,"You may be quite excited about pushing into new emotional territory today. However, you tend to be less passionate with your words than how you actually feel in your heart. Paradoxically, it's much easier now to express your feelings through bold actions rather than writing or talking about your needs. Remember, you aren't responsible for how others react. Just walk your talk and see where it leads."
pisces,2013-06-30,"You might be feeling quite positive about what you have to offer a good friend or potential lover now. Or, maybe you are ready to explore your newly found confidence by sharing a big idea with friends or coworkers. Just remember that others may not react with the same level of optimism. You'll sound more convincing if you speak matter-of-factly, without trying to sell anyone anything at all. A few words are all you need to let your enthusiasm shine through."
aries,2013-07-01,"You often act impulsively without listening to your common sense. But flying on automatic pilot doesn't necessarily mean that you are always following your heart's desire. Even if you have strong convictions about what you're currently doing now, it's still a smart idea to look beyond your first inclination to withdraw emotionally. Making time for contemplation today will allow you to take subtler concerns into consideration before making a choice."
taurus,2013-07-01,"Rather than doggedly plodding your way forward as usual, consider changing your current approach to getting things done. It may be beneficial to stand back for a bit in order to gain an objective perspective on where the currents are taking you. Remember, you could always modify your direction if you become dissatisfied with your present course. However, you can continue on your merry way if you are happy with your progress."
gemini,2013-07-01,"You may yearn for the good old days, a simpler time that seems to have slipped through your fingers. But don't worry because there are areas of your life that are still in major transition now. The fun times aren't over just because a current situation demands intense focus. Concentrate on your feelings today, even if they aren't as whimsical as you prefer. A new round of rewards will arrive sooner than you think."
cancer,2013-07-01,"Someone close to you or a member of your immediate family may be the source of resistance today. Unfortunately, it's tricky to put your finger on the origin of any bad vibes. Be careful; your investigation might put others on the defensive, which can add to the subtle negativity in the air. Instead of attempting to figure everything out all at once, it's better to wait and see how the situation unfolds. You'll have a much better idea of what you can do in just a few days after the dust settles."
leo,2013-07-01,"You would like to speak your mind, but you may prefer to withhold your thoughts for just a while longer. You aren't afraid of stirring up powerful feelings in your co-workers now, although you might not be able to see what good it will do to dredge up old wounds and hidden anger. Nevertheless, finding a way to productively channel your own negative emotions today lessens the pressure during this critical point."
virgo,2013-07-01,"Reexamining your assumptions about romance could shed new light on an important relationship today. Or, if you have become more involved in a social group, it may be time to balance your personal needs with everyone else's goals. There's no need to fear talking about anything now. Discussing what you learn in this process with your friends could actually bring you closer together. Opening your heart inspires others to do the same."
libra,2013-07-01,Everything seems more complicated today if someone places demands on you in such a way that it's hard to say no. It's difficult to think about letting anyone down because you want your friends to come through for you whenever you might need them. But it doesn't matter what your reasons are for saying yes; take this opportunity to face your own uncertainties. Make decisions based on your current feelings and not on the expectations of anyone else. Lead by example and follow your heart.
scorpio,2013-07-01,"Your key planet, Pluto, may be called the Lord of the Underworld, yet it isn't nearly as dark and scary as some people believe. Today, as shadowy Pluto receives the illuminating light of the Sun ... meaning you have a chance to see things that are usually buried far out of sight. Instead of resisting what's hidden, you can integrate what you discover now. Your personal power increases as long as you let your newfound knowledge transform your current perspective."
sagittarius,2013-07-01,"A sentimental journey today puts you back in touch with some of the intense changes you encountered over the past several years. Your personal evolutionary process has transformed you from a lowly caterpillar into a magnificent butterfly. But no matter how much you have already changed, the transition is still not yet complete. Use your memories to fuel the ongoing metamorphosis, but keep bringing your thoughts back to the present moment because there's still important work to be done."
capricorn,2013-07-01,"You realize that you can't escape the pressure of change now, even if you must face it indirectly through your relationship with someone else. You aren't necessarily exempt from the intensity of the day, but others appear to be even more overwhelmed by the prospects of relentless transformation. Nevertheless, don't get complacent just because you have some extra time to integrate your lessons. Count your blessings and offer support where it's needed most."
aquarius,2013-07-01,"You don't want to defend your illogical feelings against attack because it's stressful enough just to understand them yourself. As a general rule, being irrational is not the most comfortable position to place yourself in. Nevertheless, you know that something big is at stake today and you're willing to do whatever it takes. Remember, cool logic might not help you now as much as simply recognizing what's in your heart."
pisces,2013-07-01,"Even on these longest summer days in the Northern Hemisphere, you still might have to go through a dark night of the soul and question the purpose of your life. Luckily, this spiritual dilemma shouldn't last long, so you can return to more practical issues soon. If you are doubting yourself or your goals, exercise patience before you make any major decisions. Have faith ... you will see the direction you want to take more clearly in a few days."
aries,2013-07-02,"You may feel so overwhelmed by your commitments that you're ready to walk away out of frustration. Unfortunately, this kind of impulsive behavior isn't helpful. However, you might experience an irrepressible wave of zest for your life today that suddenly encourages you to finish whatever you already started. Even if you don't usually make to-do lists, itemizing what's next enables you to establish useful priorities and maximize your potential."
taurus,2013-07-02,"The Moon's return to your pleasure-seeking sign has you on the hunt for some plain old rest and relaxation. Even if you want to take some time off, it's more important to be practical now and work toward a specific goal. Unfortunately, your determination to follow the course of least resistance might make you lazy today. However, you'll ultimately feel better about yourself if you reach a little farther than is required; if nothing else, it will be good for your soul."
gemini,2013-07-02,"If you have been frustrated at work due to a lack of recognition, a simple change of attitude can make a big difference in your day. Accepting the current situation along with its shortcomings is liberating and allows you to be content in the present moment. However, you won't be satisfied for long. Once you're done counting your blessings, you'll feel revitalized and ready to work for the positive transformation you want to happen in your life."
cancer,2013-07-02,"You might think that you can hold your breath today and be so quiet that no one will even notice you. Although you may want to be invisible, you still have to pay close attention to everything that occurs in your environment. Even if you wish you could fly under the radar now, it makes more sense to do something outrageous in the next few days just to shake up the energy. It's an exhilarating feeling to know that others can't put you in a box."
leo,2013-07-02,"Your current nostalgia triggers familiar desires and you would be wise to act on them while there's still time. Go ahead and wander through your memories, but don't spend too much time dwelling on the past. Old failures might have nothing to do with your current situation. Instead of letting fear motivate your actions, make a commitment to improve things now. Once you have a plan in place, establishing a slow and steady pace offers the most reliable path to satisfaction."
virgo,2013-07-02,"Although you might have expressed powerful emotions over the past few weeks, you probably haven't shared the full story of your process with anyone yet. You could feel some pressure today to tell your version of what's happening, but don't cave in to the demands of your peers. Say as much or as little as you wish. The real discussion will take place when the time is right so there's no need to force any issues now. Relax and enjoy a break from your regular routine."
libra,2013-07-02,"Others see you as a positive force now with confident Jupiter hanging out in your 10th House of Status. Your goals are within your grasp and you can't help spilling your upbeat attitude everywhere you go. But if you're annoyed about someone's lack of ethics today, you could work yourself into a tizzy before finding a way to change your attitude and chill out. Your self-awareness is your most important tool because it can help you to use negative emotions to nudge your life in a more positive direction."
scorpio,2013-07-02,"Your schedule may be very hectic these days, but it's still smart to take time off to enjoy the company of friends. Whether you head out for a leisurely lunch with coworkers or a casual get together with a few friends after work, the social atmosphere can't distract you from more serious concerns. Nevertheless, be careful about what you share because even your well-intended words can miss the mark if your thoughts are somewhere else. Trust your instincts to know the appropriate time and place to bare your soul."
sagittarius,2013-07-02,"Although it's hard to ignore the political tension at work today, you have the sense to sidestep potentially difficult power struggles. Nevertheless, you're concerned about finding long-term solutions to the current problems. Considering a new job is fine, but this might not be the best time for such a big change unless it's been in the works for a while. The idea of taking radical action may sounds seductive now, but a more conservative approach makes the most sense."
capricorn,2013-07-02,"It's easier to get comfortable with your feelings now that the Moon is moving through practical Taurus, a fellow earth sign. Luckily, the Moon harmonizes with transformational Pluto in your sign, enabling you to embrace change without necessarily feeling the stress. Calculated actions should lead to success, but if you need more time, waiting a while won't damage your chances. Establishing your own rhythm is healthier than attempting to conform to someone else's expectations."
aquarius,2013-07-02,"You have an important agenda today, and luckily, you can steer reality to your advantage. However, take a deep breath before charging ahead, since it may require an extra dose of patience on your part. Fortunately, you are able to come out on top, but victory comes with a cost. Instead of aiming to win, establish common ground so that others can share in the success. Finding a way for everyone to have fun is a key ingredient in creating a special day to remember."
pisces,2013-07-02,"Although you may feel quite confident about reaching your goals today, you'll do even better if you have your friends at your side. Interacting with others should give you the boost of energy that you need now that several planets are traveling through your 5th House of Love and Play. Nevertheless, pick your partners carefully ... an alliance could fall apart pretty quickly unless everyone is in full agreement about the destination and the best way to get there. However, don't waste the day discussing plans, create a colorful map of your own and go."
aries,2013-07-03,"It's tricky to keep everything running smoothly today. Ironically, it's smarter to wonder what would happen if you let go of control for a change. Balancing your desire for independence with the logistics of fulfilling your promises is an ongoing process that reaches a crescendo now. You might have to sacrifice a bit of comfort, but your newfound freedom could help you recapture lost enthusiasm."
taurus,2013-07-03,"A surprising series of disruptions makes it nearly impossible to stay on track now. While the sensual Taurus Moon reminds you how much you miss more peaceful times, you're also eager to enjoy the current excitement. It's healthy to express your feelings, even if they're in flux. Observe your ever-shifting moods with an objective eye today. Your life may not be as stable as you wish, but you're probably making more progress than you currently realize."
gemini,2013-07-03,"You're reluctant to share your concerns with others today because you assume they'll be met with resistance. Ironically, your friends believe that you're the one who always enjoys change. However, you may be so unsure of your ideas now that you think it's best to keep your insecurities hidden. Remember, it's not your responsibility to live up to anyone else's expectations. Be yourself and speak from your heart."
cancer,2013-07-03,"Your nerves may be on edge today from an intense power struggle playing out at work. Unfortunately, you could become painfully aware that your initial plans must undergo a substantial revision to adapt to the unfolding circumstances. However, it might be easier to just throw out your old ideas and start over from scratch. Paradoxically, a radical strategy is the most reliable way to reach your goals now."
leo,2013-07-03,"Even if you are absolutely certain about your new direction, you might discover today that your heart is not leading you where you thought. It's overwhelming to be caught off guard by an emotional curve ball, especially if it reveals that you're not in control of your feelings. Your irrational desires are taking you on a wild ride that can be very exhilarating now if you don't make any sudden moves. Go with the flow; you might be very surprised at where you end up."
virgo,2013-07-03,"Inevitable changes increasingly infringe on your reality and you may secretly dream of a resting place to catch your breath. You might let down your guard today only to be surprised when someone does something totally unexpected, prompting you to question your assumptions and doubt your conclusions. Be smart and don't let yourself become too attached to your expectations. Your best strategy now is to roll with the waves until they settle back down."
libra,2013-07-03,"You may be particularly eager to help someone today because you have a special skill that could be of immediate assistance. Unfortunately, others might not be as excited with your meddling in their projects. Don't waste your energy trying to comprehend what makes anyone else tick now. Instead of taking rejection personally, get busy with your own agenda; you have a lot to do and it makes sense to start right away."
scorpio,2013-07-03,"Keep your heart and mind open to the chaotic changes that are unfolding now, even if they aren't following your previous expectations. Today might feel like a test, especially if you've lost control of something that you struggled to master. Step back from the situation to gain a new perspective. Lessening the pressure could be the key that helps everyone breathe easier while you continue to strategize your next move."
sagittarius,2013-07-03,"Life is full of unexpected twists of fate when the self-protective Cancer Sun squares wild and crazy Uranus. Although sparks fly as differing points of view clash, you can't help but feel more excited than worried. You may be known for your unabashed honesty, but it's critical to keep all communication as transparent as possible now. You cannot get away with any deviation from the facts today, so commit to speaking the truth and then acting on it."
capricorn,2013-07-03,"It's tempting to ask for too much today because it seems like you will have no trouble getting your way. Unfortunately, exercising too much control attracts disruption from external sources to teach you the value of flexibility. The more you resist, the more shocking an unexpected event is now. Thankfully, you can minimize your surprise by proactively shaking up your routine. Instead of waiting for something big to happen, be the change you seek."
aquarius,2013-07-03,"Your planetary ruler, Uranus, crosses swords with the willful Sun today, increasing the instability factor in your personal life and at work. Your relationships are likely to be rattled, especially if you don't want to go along with other people's plans. Whatever differences of opinion there are now, it's best to bring them out in the open. Thankfully, there's more time than you think to find a resolution, so don't try to force a final decision yet. Brainstorming in a collaborative way multiplies the chances for inspiration to strike."
pisces,2013-07-03,"Your understanding of your place in your community of friends may be shifting now, even if you believe that everything is stable. Obstinately holding on to your current position only makes the process harder for everyone involved. Reclaiming your individuality is wise, even if it means letting go of old expectations. There is no logical reason to resist the current changes because they'll ultimately bring you closer to your dreams."
aries,2013-07-04,"Your reckless behavior might upset someone close to you today because you're willing to gamble your emotional security for the possibility of an amazing experience. Although you are eager to stretch the envelope of your reality, caution is advised because you won't likely get what you want without making a plan first. Remember, what you do before you swing into motion is as important as what you do after."
taurus,2013-07-04,"Unpredictable Uranus may take you for a wild ride today, temporarily leading you out of your comfort zone. You're tempted to rock the boat and shake up your routine without considering the consequences. However, fulfilling your fantasies isn't the best use of your energy now. It's more constructive to free up your imagination so you can visualize the endless possibilities that exist outside of the box."
gemini,2013-07-04,"You may scatter your energy today as you try to express yourself in innovative ways. Fortunately, you're able to get away with bending the rules now or even making up new ones as you go along. It feels exhilarating when everything falls perfectly into place and goes according to your plans. Enjoy the fun while you can, but don't expect it to last forever. At some point, you'll need to return to the real world and take care of your unfulfilled obligations."
cancer,2013-07-04,"Irrepressible Uranus squares the radiant Sun in your sign today, provoking you to come out of your shell. You aren't overly concerned about other people's reactions now because you believe you can be yourself without being judged. Although expressing yourself spontaneously is refreshing, you still could do something foolish if you don't consider how you might feel later. It's great to show your true colors, but think before you act."
leo,2013-07-04,"Your adventurous dreams are larger than life, but it's not that simple to turn your fantasies into reality now. Nevertheless, you're motivated to give it your best shot, anyhow. Instead of just leaping ahead, take the time to create a concrete plan. It's a mistake to believe that anything is possible today unless you're also willing to put in the necessary work. Thankfully, you have more time than you think, so don't overreact and try to do everything at once."
virgo,2013-07-04,"You may be under a lot of stress now, but you can turn a difficult day into a memorable one by doing the right thing. Instead of worrying about how to get others to support your agenda, simply do the very best job you can, even if you must do it alone. Have faith; following your own moral compass won't lead you astray. If your actions are aligned with your heart, your performance just might exceed everyone's expectations."
libra,2013-07-04,"It's difficult to motivate yourself now because your professional goals are in the process of shifting. Ironically, you might feel unusually calm today, even if you're in the center of a storm. The unexpected chaos that's brewing around you only makes you more determined to hold on to your current position. However, your ability to resist change won't last forever. It's smarter to take preemptive action while you have the chance, rather than waiting for lightning to strike before you scramble into action."
scorpio,2013-07-04,"You must be careful today or you could become so involved with a project at work that it temporarily consumes your life. Something that begins as a minor chore grows more complicated as you mull over your options. An innovative plan might pop into awareness as a sudden flash of inspiration, tempting you to take immediate action. Unfortunately, impulsive behavior may demonstrate your recklessness rather than your intelligence. Be patient; the best ideas will continue to develop over time."
sagittarius,2013-07-04,"Your enthusiasm is irrepressible today, yet it's difficult to know how to channel your creativity. Unfortunately, ignoring your unorthodox ideas only fuels their growth and adds to your frustration. However, if you bluntly say what you want now, you could easily upset the stability of a comfortable relationship. Choose an appropriate moment and discuss your feelings casually without becoming overly attached to what happens next. You'll feel more relaxed and able to express yourself once everything is out in the open."
capricorn,2013-07-04,"It's tricky to maintain your customary role of being the responsible one in your family or group of friends now, especially if you're suddenly excited about exploring undiscovered facets of your own personality. You're even tempted to take a leap of faith and break through long-standing self-imposed limitations. But rather than shocking others with your spontaneity, simply start by revealing your thoughts. It's easier to transform your brilliant ideas into positive action if you move slowly and steadily at first."
aquarius,2013-07-04,"Your coworkers may find you difficult to deal with when you don't do what's expected of you. Unconventional Uranus squares the Sun in your 6th House of Daily Routines today, urging you to break the rules. However, you might attempt to suppress your radical behavior now because you don't want to be rejected by your peers. Nevertheless, go ahead and take a risk; others won't judge you as harshly as you think. Paradoxically, coloring outside of the lines is your safest bet."
pisces,2013-07-04,"You are on edge and even those routines that usually seem comforting can trigger anxiety today. Your emotions are being stretched and you are ready to snap at the slightest provocation. However, nothing will be gained by losing your temper. Discussing your concerns rationally is a much smarter strategy now than ignoring them because your worries won't simply disappear on their own. Thankfully, addressing the underlying issues can bring the answers you seek if you keep an open mind."
aries,2013-07-05,"You thrive on the fast pace of life today, yet it's wise to stop long enough to reassess what is happening. If you avoid spending time in unhurried contemplation, you might be able to convince yourself that someone you recently met would make a perfect partner. However, a little reflection may reveal that you dreamed up a beautiful scenario to fulfill your fantasies, so don't be too quick to trust your feelings now. Give your brain a chance to catch up."
taurus,2013-07-05,"Heightened expectations at work may set you up for a major disappointment today. However, you can make the most of your vivid imagination by using your unfulfilled dreams to spur you on to greater accomplishments. Don't be concerned about actually reaching the goals that you create in your mind; simply moving in the general direction of success will be enough to keep you happy for now."
gemini,2013-07-05,"You're in the zone, enabling you to quickly focus your mind and shift your perspective now that the Moon is back in your sign. Practice taking control of your thoughts by reframing them into more favorable scenarios. If you really believe in the power of positive thinking, it makes sense to brighten the images that affect your attitude. Let your true colors shine through."
cancer,2013-07-05,"Although you're motivated to express yourself today, you're not eager to blow your own horn. You prefer to let others discover your extraordinary talent on their own. But you might overvalue someone else's work as you see it through the filter of your inspiration. It's important to encourage those around you to have pride in their skills, but don't overlook your own. Instead of just projecting your sense of beauty onto someone else, find a creative outlet for your unique vision, too."
leo,2013-07-05,"It's tempting to get so carried away embellishing a story today that you believe it yourself. Unfortunately, your naive thinking sets the stage for you to be easily deceived now. Motivating those around you is easier when you have confidence in them, yet your gullibility can embolden someone to mislead you. Instead of blindly following others, check the facts so you don't escalate a cycle of miscommunication."
virgo,2013-07-05,"You might accidentally fall into a role of playing the victim today, yet you can also consciously choose to alter your fate. Prior to committing to any additional tasks, give serious thought to how much work it will take to deliver on your promises. Breaking down the various components of a complex assignment makes it more manageable. But it's smarter to wait a day or two for your clarity of mind to return before starting something new."
libra,2013-07-05,"Beautiful Venus forms an otherworldly aspect with illusory Neptune, making it trickier to find your creative groove. Perhaps you are overeager to express your inner child and wish you could take the day off. But even if you have to work today, set aside a bit of time to experience the joy of simply being in the present moment. If there are young people in your life, engaging in a bit of silly fun with them could be enough to satisfy your need to play. A return to innocence might be all it takes to inspire you now."
scorpio,2013-07-05,"If you trip down Memory Lane today, it's not healthy to focus on the difficulties you have experienced. Instead, think about the most pleasant times when all you could do was smile. You are usually pretty pragmatic about what's going on in your life, but a little nostalgia might actually be soothing now. Imagination and faith can take you on a sentimental journey that alters your attitude about the past and improves the present moment."
sagittarius,2013-07-05,"Your calendar seems quite elastic now and if you fall behind on your busy schedule today, it may be more bothersome to everyone around you than to you. You like the idea of living in subjective time, rather than being a slave to the clock. Fortunately, you can prevent unnecessary irritation by letting others know if you are running late for an appointment. Courtesy is the key to keeping your day from unraveling, so make sure that you respect your commitments and honor your promises."
capricorn,2013-07-05,"Delay making any major changes in your schedule today since Venus and Mercury are confused by cloudy Neptune's presence in your 3rd House of Immediate Environment. Keep in mind that you might not have all the facts at your disposal yet. Your practical judgment may be compromised by your spirituality now, but believing that everything is perfect won't substitute for responsibly taking care of the current issues that demand your attention."
aquarius,2013-07-05,"Even if you explain your intentions again and again, your most supportive friends still might not fully understand your behavior today. Rather than arguing, others will probably just nod their heads in agreement, thinking that they know exactly what you mean. Meanwhile, you can sense a widening gulf of confusion between you and everyone else. Nevertheless, there's no need to bridge the gap all at once; it will disappear naturally on its own. However, paying attention to the details of your work is the best strategy for now."
pisces,2013-07-05,"You could grow disoriented today if you have to concentrate all your thinking on mundane issues. Ironically, you're more grounded if you let your imagination wander. While there is nothing wrong with being a dreamer, it's still important to keep up your appearances on the job. Happily, you can continue exploring parallel dimensions of reality now, as long as you don't attract any undue attention."
aries,2013-07-06,"You may be concerned that you're running out of time, but it's still smarter to wait a few days before taking any drastic measures. Instead of overreacting by rushing ahead, demonstrate your competence with a calm and cool demeanor. There is nothing to be gained now by attempting to inspire others with a flashy show of courage. Honestly revealing your vulnerability to someone you trust today will earn you more respect than roaring with false bravado."
taurus,2013-07-06,"You have quite a lot to do today, but your friends and family members may not realize how busy you are. You don't want to be in the spotlight now, so working quietly behind the scenes suits your mood. You aren't necessarily trying to avoid recognition; you just don't want to waste energy seeking attention. Nevertheless, there is nothing wrong with graciously accepting acknowledgement for your contributions when it comes your way. Take the time to count your blessings when others support your efforts."
gemini,2013-07-06,"Your moods are fluctuating so rapidly today that every time you make up your mind something happens and your feelings shift again. You may be overly concerned with how others interpret your instability now, but you can't change their perceptions. Wait for your emotions to settle down before sharing your opinions. Rather than trying to fix something that's not under your control, concentrate on being true to your values, instead. Be patient, it might take some time to figure out what your heart wants."
cancer,2013-07-06,"The Moon's return to your sign today can either fill you with pride or raise fears that you would prefer to avoid. Either way, get ready to leave the safety of logic and go on a wild emotional ride. Allow your feelings to flow without trying to rationalize them or they will just get in the way during the next cycle that begins on Monday after the New Moon in your sign. Maintain an open mind and have faith in the wisdom of your heart."
leo,2013-07-06,"It's nearly impossible to hear your own inner guidance if you're busy listening to everyone else. You could benefit from some quiet time today, so keep to yourself if that's what feels right. It isn't your fault if people are asking you to jump through hoops. But rather than responding like a trained performer, do what's best for you now. Others will likely forgive your temporary need for privacy once you share your story with them."
virgo,2013-07-06,"Your scattered energy might confuse people today and inadvertently distract them from their chores. Although your intentions are good, you're not interested in setting everyone else's agendas. But before you retreat, claiming that you don't want the extra responsibility now, consider the practicalities involved in a trade-off. It may be smarter to negotiate for what you want than to just walk away from the situation. Finding a healthy compromise might be just what the doctor ordered."
libra,2013-07-06,"You may set yourself up for failure if you think you have to be accessible twenty-fours of the day to everyone you love. However, don't spread yourself too thin, even if you care about others a whole lot. Imagine an invisible protective shell around you now so you don't get pulled too far off track. You'll do fine in the long run, but self-doubt can impede your progress. Even if it feels like a stretch to change your attitude today, you certainly have the power to do it."
scorpio,2013-07-06,"Concentrate your attention on the present moment instead of trying to replay an old dream that only gets in the way of your happiness. But if someone questions your life strategy today, avoid falling into the trap of feeling like you must defend your goals. Keep in mind that clinging to your past while envisioning the future doesn't leave you with much time for what's happening now. Fortunately, your intuition will steer you right if you focus on whatever is currently on your plate and stop worrying about the rest."
sagittarius,2013-07-06,"It seems as if everyone wants to hang out with you because you know how to have fun. You might try to avoid a discussion about your feelings now by redirecting a conversation away from you and toward a friend. Your cleverness may get you through the day without incident, but it leaves your heart feeling unsatisfied. Slow down and acknowledge your emotions; others will enjoy you even more when you reveal your softer side."
capricorn,2013-07-06,"You aren't happy if a friend or partner holds out on you. You prefer others to be forthright and speak their minds; otherwise your imagination makes up a story that's worse than the simple truth. Unfortunately, your need to know someone's feelings could drive your own emotions deeper into hiding now. Relax your intense pursuit; a more subtle approach may be a smoother segue to a necessary conversation. The most direct path isn't always the best way up the mountain."
aquarius,2013-07-06,"Your desire to avoid confusion may be thwarted today as another person's irrational feelings keep cycling back into the conversation. You might try to steer the discussion toward facts and figures, but attempts to control the natural flow could anger others. Paradoxically, your rigid behavior elicits the very same emotional drama you wish to avoid. However, if you allow the dialogue to meander naturally, a relationship can grow by leaps and bounds."
pisces,2013-07-06,"Sometimes you are so forgiving that others think they can take advantage of you. However, you could react strongly today if you believe that a close friend or family member is pushing you too far. Don't be afraid of setting a power struggle into motion if you need to establish a boundary. You may be better off in the long run if you hold your ground now. Just remember at all times that compassion is your most effective weapon in waging peace."
aries,2013-07-07,"You can earn someone's affection today with your honest and innovative approach to love. Unfortunately, you could also alienate a close friend if you don't know when to call it quits. But even if there isn't anyone to talk to now, you still hear a running dialogue within your own head. It's great if you are learning an important lesson about yourself by acknowledging your feelings. But if you're not, then it could be wiser to let go of your desires and move on."
taurus,2013-07-07,"It's nearly impossible to be rational about what you like today because your key planet Venus aligns with unpredictable Uranus. You might as well set aside your responsibilities for a while and do something new and exciting. Whether you go scuba diving, bungee jumping or ballroom dancing, don't be afraid to pursue a thrilling experience. If pursuing your desires doesn't hurt anyone else and could add to your happiness, then just do it."
gemini,2013-07-07,"Your fantasies create a buzz today that you find irresistible. You crave more action and yet you probably already have so much going on that you can't figure out how to add one more thing on to your plate. Thankfully, even a meager attempt to find satisfaction could work surprisingly well now. There's no need to bury your desires; just jump into the experience and see where the currents carry you. Let the force be with you."
cancer,2013-07-07,"Although the idea of adventure sounds enticing today, it's hard to imagine yourself out there on your own when you don't even want to leave the safety of your home. You might try to have the best of both worlds by losing yourself into the vast reaches of the Internet where you can explore your heart's desires while maintaining anonymity. However, if you begin to obsess over your digital distractions, it may be time to walk away from your computer and make connections in the real world, instead"
leo,2013-07-07,"You have big ideas about doing all kinds of amazing things today, but your goals might be so unrealistic that you don't have a chance of reaching them. You may feel trapped by a previous commitment, but your fear of stagnation feeds your recklessness. You are eager to make something exciting happen. Unfortunately, your sense of urgency isn't helpful. It's more productive to adopt a slow approach and maintain a steady pace while pushing beyond old limitations."
virgo,2013-07-07,"Your friends and associates may turn your day inside out if they do something that's not very sensible now. Others just want an opportunity to be free today and, unfortunately, this can lead to irresponsible behavior. But you might react too quickly and judge them before you even stop and think about your response. Instead of acting with authority do your best to take the unexpected in stride. Ultimately, your flexibility clears the way for an amazing experience."
libra,2013-07-07,"Your key planet, Venus, is zapped awake by shocking Uranus today, attracting unusual people, places and things like a magnet collects iron. Your reluctance to doing everything the same old way enables you to test the waters by interacting with someone who is completely different from anyone else in your life. Listen to what everyone else has to say, but then go ahead and do what you want to do. Taking care of your own needs now frees you up to be more accepting of the needs of others."
scorpio,2013-07-07,"Your world is alive with social possibilities and you're ready to shake things up and do something out of the ordinary. Still, you worry about participating in an activity where you don't have complete control over your schedule. You might prefer to stay on the periphery of a group now, but the attraction to a totally new experience stimulates your curiosity, making it difficult to say no. Pushing through your resistance opens the door to an unexpectedly wonderful day."
sagittarius,2013-07-07,"You may have relationship issues to handle that could get in the way of more adventurous plans today. Perhaps you assumed that it would be difficult to find encouragement for your current dreams. Thankfully, you might be pleasantly surprised when those closest to you are more supportive than you ever expected. Take a chance and express what's in your heart now because it's more than likely to work out for the best."
capricorn,2013-07-07,"You can be unusually freewheeling in your approach to relationships today, but your temporary sense of detachment may conflict with your more serious nature. Ironically, other people like the new you even if you are struggling with your current sense of freedom. Fortunately, there's no reason to hide what's in your heart now as long as you remember that you can talk about your feelings without having to act them out."
aquarius,2013-07-07,"You can make an exciting conceptual breakthrough today that turns your life around and forces you to come up with a whole new set of plans. The idea of a sudden shift may be quite exhilarating now, but keep in mind that you cannot just forget about the needs of other people in your life. Playtime is yours for the asking, but you will have a lot more fun if you keep the communication channels open between you and those you love."
pisces,2013-07-07,"A surprising solution to a long-standing money problem might catch you off guard today, but don't push it away before giving it a try. You may need to shift your core beliefs to put your new plan into action, but it's worth the effort. Additionally, someone close to you could shock you with an emotional disclosure. Thankfully, remaining open to change empowers you to make the most of the current instability. The strength of a willow tree stems from its ability to bend."
aries,2013-07-08,"Today's Cancer New Moon highlights your 4th House of Home and Family, raising conflicts between your need to go back to work and your desire to focus on projects around the house. Being patient isn't your forte, but you might have to wait until you finish your obligations on the job before allowing yourself to indulge in domestic activities. Establishing a healthy balance between your professional and personal worlds now makes it easier to juggle your responsibilities during the next few weeks."
taurus,2013-07-08,"The emotional Cancer New Moon rattles your 3rd House of Information, encouraging you to take someone into your confidence. But caution is advised; although personal disclosure might be a good idea, it also increases your sense of vulnerability. Be certain that the other person is worthy of your trust before placing yourself in a precarious position. Nevertheless, sharing your most personal feelings with a friend today is the best way to show how special she or he is to you."
gemini,2013-07-08,"Today's Cancer New Moon falls in your 2nd House of Self-Esteem, inspiring you to do something that will lift your spirits. But the New Moon is conjunct retrograde Mercury, challenging you to be extra clear when you share what's on your mind. Since it may be impossible to make others understand you by describing your feelings, say less about them now. The good news is that your positive actions should get your message across loud and clear."
cancer,2013-07-08,"You're highly attuned to the regular emotional tidal cycles because your watery sign of Cancer is naturally connected with the Moon. Today's New Moon in your sign is like your own personal lunar birthday, so start making your wishes now. Formalize your intentions by creating a list of what you want to bring to fruition at the next Full Moon in a couple of weeks. Be wise; plant the seeds of action in your imagination, then nurture them and watch them take root and grow."
leo,2013-07-08,"You can't seem to verbalize all your emotions today, amplifying the spiritual aspects of the reflective Cancer New Moon. This is a day for inner journeying, rather than seeking fulfillment from activities in the outer world, now that the New Moon falls in your 12th House of Privacy. Keeping your feelings to yourself intensifies your dreams. Allow your imagination to illuminate your story, even if you don't yet know what it means. There's no need to rush the interpretation; it will make more sense as time goes by."
virgo,2013-07-08,"Today's Cancer New Moon emphasizes your 11th House of Networking, turning the days ahead into a flurry of social activity. Although you want to play a valuable role in a larger group, you worry about being distracted from your real work. Fortunately, the sense of belonging that you gain should help you feel more emotionally secure, so don't stress too much about being productive now. Just give yourself permission to temporarily engage in a cause that's bigger than you and enjoy the camaraderie along the way."
libra,2013-07-08,"Your patience is required now, so don't react too fast even when you think you know the answer. Although others may see you as an authority figure with the Cancer New Moon's presence in your 10th House of Status, you might not want to take the lead. Regardless, your objective approach enables you to achieve optimum results now. Observe the circumstances as they change over the next few days before assuming that everything is as you see it. The passage of time casts a different light on the situation."
scorpio,2013-07-08,"You may be more hopeful everything will turn out in your favor now that your plans for the summer are becoming more concrete. It feels as if your dreams are finally beginning to take shape. However, problems arise if you act too soon, since the hesitant Cancer New Moon falls in your 9th House of Adventure. Paradoxically, a short delay could work to your advantage; playing it cool today allows you to reach your goals sooner than you expect."
sagittarius,2013-07-08,"Today's Cancer New Moon occurs in your 8th House of Deep Feelings, prompting you to explore your emotional world. Although you are as eager as ever for a new experience, you don't necessarily want to share your thoughts with anyone else now. Your curiosity is unquenchable, but it's frustrating if you don't have words to explain what you discover. Fortunately, your current satisfaction is derived by increasing your self-awareness rather than involving others in your process."
capricorn,2013-07-08,"Today's Cancer New Moon lands in your 7th House of Relationships, offering you new ways to handle emotional conflict. If a close friend or lover clams up now and refuses to answer your difficult questions, don't try to change his or her mind. Although you're tempted to support someone in order to get what you want, it's healthier to live by the Golden Rule and do unto others as you would have them do unto you. Accepting your partner's need for space now ultimately brings you closer together."
aquarius,2013-07-08,"You really don't want anyone questioning your ability to do your job now that the Cancer New Moon highlights your 6th House of Skills. However, if someone does challenge your competence, you might just withdraw from the situation. But your retreat isn't because you're timid. Instead, you just don't want to waste time defending yourself when you could be finishing your work. Avoiding emotional dramas for a few days may be the smartest way to manage the current bumpy atmosphere."
pisces,2013-07-08,"Today's Cancer New Moon falls in your 5th House of Creativity, encouraging you to set aside a block of time for artistic self-expression. But its conjunction with retrograde Mercury requires you to spend more time planning for your project than actually doing it. It makes the most sense to balance your preparation with execution. Don't waste the whole day dreaming about what you're going to do. Put your ducks in order and then get to work."
aries,2013-07-09,"You are so highly motivated to impress others with your competence today that you might miss your chance to be creative. You can improve relationship dynamics by simply accepting the fact that you are appreciated because you are good at what you do. But you may still feel unfulfilled even if praise comes your way. Nevertheless, looking beyond appearances allows you to discover what's really important to your heart."
taurus,2013-07-09,"Tell your closest friends and family exactly what you are feeling now, since your day will unfold with less stress if you simply share what's on your mind. The Moon's presence in your private 4th House of Roots enables you to feel safe and happy while you are at home, as long as you remember that home is where the heart is. There's no need to conquer the world today; just be aware of how your vulnerability can be a special invitation to love."
gemini,2013-07-09,"There's a lot happening at work and you may feel overwhelmed and unable to keep up with it all. You might want to ask your colleagues for help, but perhaps it's been politically incorrect to do so until now. Although you don't want to talk about your problems in depth, at least broaching the subject with a few friends will help you feel better today. You could be happily surprised when others enthusiastically jump in with their support."
cancer,2013-07-09,"You are unable to hold on to your recent moodiness as the lights of your awareness grow brighter and everything appears to be on the upswing. It's nearly impossible to be anything other than happy once the Moon dances into fun-loving Leo today. But don't waste your excess energy on frivolous play while you still have important work to do. Hurrying through your chores won't help; you'll only have to redo them tomorrow. However, focusing on each task allows you to enjoy the satisfaction of a job well done."
leo,2013-07-09,"You may be the life of the party today because the Moon in your expressive sign inspires you to respond to everyone in an upbeat manner. You're eager to meet up with friends to have a good time. However, you could quickly grow impatient if they bring you down. Make sure that in your rush to play you don't say something harsh to someone who isn't in the same lighthearted mood. Stop and listen to what's being said so you don't have to apologize later for running roughshod over other people's feelings."
virgo,2013-07-09,"Managing your relationships can be a bit tricky today because everyone thinks you are being totally honest. However, you might actually be covering something up now that mischievous Mercury is retrograding over the Sun. It's not that you're telling an outright lie; it's just that keeping a secret isn't quite the same thing as telling the truth. Nevertheless, don't wait until it's too late. Take some time to prioritize what's most important and then share your thoughts with someone you love."
libra,2013-07-09,"Even if work has to be your top priority today, make sure that you also schedule some downtime with your friends or family. But don't try to get together with others just to discuss your schedule or business strategy; instead, focus on kicking back and relaxing. Share your dreams with those who will accept them for what they are, without questioning your motives or criticizing you for being unrealistic. Sometimes recharging your batteries is more important than anything else."
scorpio,2013-07-09,"Today's loyal Leo Moon lands in your 10th House of Public Responsibility, urging you to recognize your current obligations and to acknowledge that you can fulfill them. But don't just pretend to look busy because you want to impress someone. There's no time for game playing or idle dreaming now; you can return to your fantasies once your current work is done. Apply yourself diligently to achieve success instead of just wishing upon a star."
sagittarius,2013-07-09,"The proud Leo Moon moving through your 9th House of Travel vividly symbolizes the exciting times ahead. Unfortunately, you might not have as much free time today as you wish, since your life is getting busier and you cannot avoid your previous commitments. Do whatever helps you to get by on a day-to-day basis while you continue planning your big escape. Tackling your current schedule is an adventure all of its own."
capricorn,2013-07-09,"An unusual set of circumstances places a weird spin on the day, making it difficult to predict exactly what will be stirred up. You are typically result oriented, but you might prefer to meander around now with no particular goals in mind. Don't worry about the reaction of anyone else; your current task is to keep your options open and, if possible, postpone major decisions until after Mercury turns direct on July 20. In the meantime, practice flexibility while continuing on your present course."
aquarius,2013-07-09,"The showy Leo Moon in your 7th House of Relationships indicates that you could meet up with a dramatic person who expresses admiration toward you. Instead of just basking in the spotlight on center stage, turn it around by thanking him or her for bringing something special into your world. Although it may be difficult for you to accept the positive feedback, no criticism is necessary ... a simple acknowledgment is all that's needed at this time."
pisces,2013-07-09,"The extroverted Leo Moon is visiting your 6th House of Routine, encouraging you to put a few enjoyable activities on your daily schedule. The goal is not to overextend yourself, but to add some more fun into your life. You may be eager to demonstrate to others that you can hold up your part of the bargain by working hard, but there's more to life than just doing your job. Thankfully, you can have your cake and eat it too if you play your cards right."
aries,2013-07-10,"Expressing your needs in an optimistic manner now sets you on the path to your desired destination as long as you relate your feelings to those around you. It's exciting when your creativity is in play, but this isn't a license to indulge in narcissism. Of course, you can still reveal what's most important to you; just remember that it's not necessary to be the center of everyone's attention all the time. Sharing the stage makes for a more enjoyable experience for all those involved."
taurus,2013-07-10,"You may be wondering how much of your past you should divulge now, especially if current circumstances stimulate a childhood memory. Connecting your present feelings with a previous situation can be healthy, but not if you are remembering an event in a way that never actually occurred. It's not necessary to embellish the truth or you could create problems rather than solving them. Keeping it real allows people to know the real you."
gemini,2013-07-10,"There's no reason to sidestep the unexpected events that distract you from your original goals today. However, it isn't necessary to turn the interference of the day into some kind of drama just to get a bit of attention. Instead, be clever and embrace the change of plans while including others in your choices. Remember, you'll be appreciated more if you play as an integral member of the team instead of just pushing ahead on your own."
cancer,2013-07-10,"Nothing is gained by overstating your case today; saying fewer words is more effective than endless rambling. Keep in mind that your insecurities may set up situations that block intimacy by tricking you into acting more confidently than you feel. However, any attempts to avoid the truth or to inflate your ego will likely backfire. Fortunately, others will admire your authenticity now if you just act naturally and show up as yourself."
leo,2013-07-10,"Even if you can imagine yourself as royalty now with the Moon in regal Leo, it's healthier to understand that you have more in common with everyone else than you might think. Attempting to elevate your self-esteem by creating situations where others are dependent on you won't make you feel any better in the long run. Instead, cultivate objectivity by releasing your attachment to anything that separates you from the group. Cooperation breeds more success than competition today."
virgo,2013-07-10,"Delving into your fantasies might be quite fruitful today as brilliant Uranus harmonizes with the Moon in your 12th House of Dreams. Self-analysis reveals more than it does at other times, but it may be tricky putting your realizations to practical use. Instead of getting lost on your inner journey now, focus your attention on the world around you. A methodical and pragmatic approach is the most sensible way to take care of business."
libra,2013-07-10,"Concrete plans unravel as the Moon aligns with unpredictable Uranus this morning, but thankfully everything can turn out okay, anyhow. Don't try to avoid an unpleasant discussion today just because you think doing something else could bring you more pleasure. There is an important reason that you have a chance to revisit an issue you assumed was in the past. Pay careful attention to all the details that surface now or you may have to repeat the lesson again sooner than you expect."
scorpio,2013-07-10,"You may be placing too much importance on making sure that others know what you're doing on the job today. However, most of your coworkers won't question your commitment or your actual efforts, giving you time to step beyond your work. Don't be afraid to let your thoughts wander into the shadows of your subconscious, for it is there that you can discover the deeper meaning that you seek."
sagittarius,2013-07-10,"Vivid dreams of far-off lands capture your imagination today. But no matter how wonderful your fantasies are now, you must also pay attention to what's happening right in front of you. A lively conversation with a trusted friend is all you need to remind you that everything you really want could be right in your own backyard. You can find enjoyment without going anywhere at all."
capricorn,2013-07-10,"Avoiding a really tough conversation about your feelings may not be such a wise idea today, especially if you allow your fears and negativity to stand in the way of the discussion. Nothing is gained by deluding yourself. Demonstrate your wisdom by being open to whatever someone else needs to talk about at this time. You might be pleasantly surprised at where this interaction leads."
aquarius,2013-07-10,"You may feel misunderstood these days, but you can quickly turn things around by acknowledging your role in the situation. You might have inadvertently created a gulf between you and others that now gets in the way of meaningful dialogue. Don't fall into the old trap of believing that there's something to be gained by hiding your true feelings. Instead of overcompensating with dramatic acts of generosity, soften your stance and speak from your heart."
pisces,2013-07-10,"Although you can't solve all the on-the-job problems by simply working harder, there are things you can do to make the situation better. Overextending your reach is not a smart move and might even exhaust you in the process. Your real gift is how you exhibit love and compassion to your friends and associates. Offering a kind word or a shoulder to lean on requires very little effort and returns more dividends than you expect."
aries,2013-07-11,"Establishing boundaries with your friends might elicit an unexpected response if they interpret your expressed desire for formality too seriously. However, you're only setting down the rules today because you believe that this strategy can help you accomplish more work now. But too much rigidity gets in your way; ironically, letting go of a little control begins to soothe the energies and calm your nerves."
taurus,2013-07-11,"It seems as if something's happening on the home front that you don't quite understand, and you can't be certain enough to do anything specific about it. Risky behavior is tempting at first, but the more you delay the less enticing it appears; it makes more sense to wait until you have more answers. However, there is still work to do and you need to get back to it so you can finish your old tasks before you start anything new."
gemini,2013-07-11,"You often like gathering lots of information even when it isn't helpful to your cause. However, today's sensible Virgo Moon gives you the analytical tools you need to sort through all the data and keep only what you can use. Although it's easy to forget what you're doing now and get distracted by all the untried possibilities, balancing your unquenchable curiosity with your current penchant for practicality combines the best of both worlds."
cancer,2013-07-11,"It's no fun if you're reminded of an emotional wound today, but you can't afford to dwell on it. Naturally, the most crucial issues are the ones that occur in the present moment. Your obsession with a past event can actually block the flow of feelings. Gently bring your thoughts and fantasies back to where you are now. Keep in mind that you don't want to miss the good stuff that is happening right in front of your nose."
leo,2013-07-11,"It's nearly impossible to separate your current feelings from your fantasies today, especially when you try to express what's on your mind. Nevertheless, don't lean on others for support now, for they cannot tell you the whole truth even if they wish they could. If you are willing to be vulnerable and share your inner process, even without receiving feedback, you'll still feel like you made some progress in the right direction."
virgo,2013-07-11,"The evocative Moon's return to your sign today gives you the energetic boost you need. However, your emotions may be tricky to manage now, leaving you exhausted from sharing too much with a friend or lover. You might try to advance your cause by overstating your case. Nevertheless, the smartest thing you can do now is to recognize your limitations and save your best intentions for tomorrow."
libra,2013-07-11,"It's so tempting to get lost in your own dreams and schemes now that the Moon is floating through your 12th House of Escapism. Ironically, one of your fantasies might actually turn into a practical idea. However, your sense of timing may be slightly off today, so don't mess up your chances by revealing your intentions too soon. Continue to develop your strategy without involving others until the Moon returns to your sign on Sunday and you can confidently share your plans."
scorpio,2013-07-11,"You are buzzing with an overflow of energy now, yet you don't want to waste it on unimportant social interactions. Even if you have an enjoyable event on your calendar, it still might seem more like an unpleasant chore than a party. Nevertheless, it's a smart idea to attend because you could make an important connection with someone you meet today. You never can tell where a new friendship will lead."
sagittarius,2013-07-11,"You might not know what your next move at work should be because you may be aimed in one direction while really wanting to go another. However, this isn't about geography; it's about discovering happy places within your heart. Consider what your life would feel like if you were actually working toward a new and exciting set of goals. Don't let go of your dreams now because focusing on your vision of the future for the next week can be instrumental in making it come true."
capricorn,2013-07-11,"Your hands-on approach to success could bring you rewards today, but you must stay focused on your original intentions. If you have an important decision to make, do it as early in the day as possible, because as the evening approaches, you may grow increasingly cautious. Be as objective as you can in order to balance your pessimism with optimism."
aquarius,2013-07-11,"Your complex schemes seem to fall apart today for no apparent reason. You might even believe that you can't maintain a clear perspective on what's happening now. But you are capable of doing nearly anything, as long as you concentrate on working with the resistance instead of against it. The more you fight what's in your way, the more strength you give it. Your flexibility makes you stronger and more resilient, like a tree that bends in the wind."
pisces,2013-07-11,"Don't take someone's criticism of your work too personally today. You may be extra sensitive now or others might even be unreasonably harsh in their judgment. You could exhaust yourself trying to please a picky person who won't be satisfied by anything you do. There's no need to prove yourself to anyone else. Instead, aim to meet your own high standards for a real sense of fulfillment."
aries,2013-07-12,"Responsibilities pile up at work these days but you're not ready to get too serious yet. You're not very excited about doing your chores now or even considering strategies to get a job done. It's hard to be proactive if you are afraid that your actions won't be as effective as you wish. But even if you can't take the whole day off, at least give yourself permission to relax and fall a bit behind in your production schedule. As long as you keep your priorities straight, you'll be able to catch up next week."
taurus,2013-07-12,"Cool logic is your ally now as you fight your way back from confusion. Your elaborate fantasies may come unraveled today, but they soon will be replaced by a less complicated version of reality. Avoid the temptation to weave stories, even if you are able to express yourself skillfully and entertain others. Keep things simple and stick with only what you know to be absolutely true. Avoid extra stress by choosing facts over fiction."
gemini,2013-07-12,"Everyone seems to be relying on you for your stability these days, but this is not one of your typical strengths. Fortunately, you probably can anchor a loved one now and prevent him or her from drifting away in an emotional storm. It really doesn't matter why you have become the go-to person today. Instead of wasting your energy wondering how to help, just jump in and do what you can. Others will appreciate your support."
cancer,2013-07-12,"You have strong opinions today, but expressing them might lead you into more trouble than it's worth. Paradoxically, it may be easier for you to work with the facts and figures now than to handle an emotional issue. The exacting Virgo Moon prevents you from entering the illogical land of subjectivity. Acknowledge your feelings, but act on the cool rationality of raw data for the best results."
leo,2013-07-12,"You bring an excess of energy to the table if you share your opinions, even when they aren't as clear as you wish. It can be quite difficult to separate what's good from what's not when it comes to relationships. Creating fantasies about what you want is easier than actually doing something about it. Nevertheless, it may be healthy to have a few secrets now because there are some things that are better off left unsaid until the time is right."
virgo,2013-07-12,"Your self-confidence may be slipping now as you recollect a time in your life when your best shot fell short of someone's expectations. However, nothing is to be gained by obsessing over the past or remembering disappointments. The Moon's return to your sign can make it difficult to focus your attention, but this is not the time to give up. If you cannot adjust your attitude, ask your friends for the help you need. You could be pleasantly surprised at how quickly they come through for you."
libra,2013-07-12,"If you accidentally overstepped someone's boundaries recently, it may be time for a bit of emotional cleanup today. There's no reason to be hesitant or shy if you made an error in judgment; just admit to it and move on. Act maturely and take responsibility for your words and actions, since they aren't as problematic as you think. The sooner you can look forward, instead of worrying about the past, the better it will be for everyone involved."
scorpio,2013-07-12,"You may be overly protective of your feelings today and might attempt to make it through the day without ever admitting what's actually bothering you. However, you won't be able to keep your secret forever because you are motivated to reveal the truth as you perceive it. You don't want to hurt anyone's feelings, but it's important to recognize that you can speak your piece in a kind and non-blaming manner and still be loved."
sagittarius,2013-07-12,"If you have set your sights too high today, you may become discouraged when you don't reach your goals. It's helpful to cut yourself a bit of slack and allow time for your plans to develop. But you might have a hard time learning the lesson of patience now. Remember, you cannot do everything all at once. Focus on your overall goals and try not to become obsessed with just one small part of your plan."
capricorn,2013-07-12,"It's difficult to avoid creating an awkward situation where someone becomes angry with you today. It might seem as if you don't have as many options as you want or that others are attempting to get in your way. Consider what you may have done to help set a restraining backlash in motion. Fighting against an external enemy -- real or imagined -- is likely a waste of your time now when you should be working to improve your own act, instead."
aquarius,2013-07-12,"You're searching for a significant piece of information today and might even conclude that someone is hiding something from you. Unfortunately, your attempts to bring out the truth won't likely lead to success now. However, you still could find what you're looking for, but it could require you to use reverse psychology. Relaxing your need to know will put others at ease and you may learn more than you expect."
pisces,2013-07-12,"You may be feeling somewhat let down today, just as you might on a morning after an exciting event. It's tempting to fill in the gaps with additional activities, but it's probably smarter to use this time to seek a bit of peace and quiet. Unfortunately, you won't likely get the tranquility that you want, so be flexible and do your best to accept whatever happens next. Embrace the unexpected and enjoy the ride."
aries,2013-07-13,"You may be extra considerate of other people's feelings now that your key planet Mars is visiting nurturing Cancer. Nevertheless, Mars harmonizes with mystical Neptune and ambitious Saturn over the next week, empowering you to turn your dreams into reality. Remember, your current magic comes from speaking your truth and walking your talk. Don't be shy; say what's on your mind, but find the nicest way to do it before you open your mouth."
taurus,2013-07-13,"You're tired of friends and associates who continue to mislead you with witty words and big promises. But you're not in the mood to be messed with today and you might become angry if you think that someone is avoiding a commitment. You aren't any fun to be around if you believe that anyone has deceived you in any manner. Postponing an important discussion for a few days may be enough to alleviate the stress for now. Thankfully, changing your tactics enables you to enjoy your interactions with others."
gemini,2013-07-13,"Although things settle down a bit as Mars leaves your sign today, your mind is still quite busy. However, someone might not be playing fairly now and you're worried that this dynamic could grow more complicated over the days ahead. Don't waste valuable energy by slipping into a fearful state. Instead, concentrate your thoughts on spreading love in every moment of the day. Your positive attitude helps to minimize the negativity around you."
cancer,2013-07-13,"Red-hot Mars pushes into your sign today to fire up your emotions. Unfortunately, your reactions can be strong and swift now, making you afraid to share your desires with most people because you're worried that you might scare them away. Nevertheless, total inaction leads to even more problems, so don't go quiet and just pretend that everything is fine. Share your current concerns with a trusted friend, but be careful not to blame anyone in the process. Letting off a little steam lightens the load."
leo,2013-07-13,"You may be quite attached to your desires today, yet still unable to bring them out into the open. Others expect you to be upfront with your personal disclosures and there could be trouble if they think you're hiding something. Be courageous and proudly admit your feelings. Even if you're uncertain at first, revealing suppressed emotions can clear the air better than any other strategy."
virgo,2013-07-13,"You can't decide what to do now if you feel that the energy is off balance. Fortunately, your intentions are honorable since you truly want to do the right thing. But even a simple plan grows entangled with other ones, making everything more complicated today. Your impromptu actions may even be misinterpreted by someone who should know better. Luckily, this uncertainty is a temporary condition, so cool your jets for a few days until the dust settles and your clarity returns."
libra,2013-07-13,"You may consider a personal retreat today so you can focus on taking care of your own needs. You're distracted by your fantasies now because they actually seem quite plausible. You're tempted to push beyond the limits of logic by acting out an impossible dream sequence, only to discover that it works. Nevertheless, you're treading on unstable ground because the tiniest doubt could cause your entire dream world to collapse. Remember, your unwavering belief might be the essential ingredient to make something special happen."
scorpio,2013-07-13,"Sharing your deep concerns is not a wise idea today, especially if there isn't anyone around that you sufficiently trust with your thoughts. However, you like the idea of being in safe harbor, even if you find yourself pulled toward someone else's perspective. Unfortunately, an impulsive decision made while you're excited will probably lead you away from your goals. Instead, take the necessary time to work through your uncertainty before revealing what's on your mind."
sagittarius,2013-07-13,"Someone may catch you off guard today as he or she tap dances around your probing questions. You want to trust your instincts, but others won't likely sit still long enough for you to get a read on their intentions. Wait a few days until the mysterious and unknowable circumstances play on through. In the meantime, be thorough in your analysis of the current situation. Surprisingly, you could be left with newfound clarity and purpose once the smoke clears."
capricorn,2013-07-13,"A friend or acquaintance may become a total pain in the neck now that macho Mars shifts into your 7th House of Relationships. You might feel as if others are worrying about the wrong things, but you can't say a word about it because the issue is so sensitive. Naturally, you are not eager to walk around on eggshells because you realize that you're going to break a few sooner than later. Nevertheless, it's still sensible to avoid direct confrontation for just a little while longer."
aquarius,2013-07-13,"You cannot tell if your current assessment of someone is valid or if you're basing it on assumptions that are built upon your desires. Thankfully, you can still jump-start yourself into motion. Your flexibility helps to alleviate the growing relationship tension, but don't diffuse the uncomfortable energy too quickly. Holding your position and sinking deeper into it should bring you more clarity and meaning than running off to start something new."
pisces,2013-07-13,"You want to work in the practical realms today, but you don't seem to be in complete control of your emotions. You might feel as if subtle forces are coercing you to act on your heart's inclinations, rather than doing what makes the most sense. You can understand the consequences of your actions, but logic doesn't alter your passions. Ironically, satisfying other people's expectations won't bring you happiness now. It's time to follow your bliss."
aries,2013-07-14,"It doesn't matter what you want today, since you have to weigh your desires against the needs of someone else. However, you must be careful because you cannot just bury your emotions in the process. Avoidance as a strategy does not work in your favor now, but neither does overreacting. Thankfully, you can prevent a minor disagreement from turning into a significant problem if you simply consider other people's feelings, too."
taurus,2013-07-14,"The Moon pulls you through a complete spectrum of emotions today, tempting you to go so far that you find yourself out on a limb in search of a simple solution. But resolutions are elusive and don't come easily now because your desires are all over the place. You can ease the pressure by being grateful for what you have in life, instead of believing that you should have more. Ultimately, you need less than you think in order to find true satisfaction."
gemini,2013-07-14,"It's tempting to turn every molehill into a formidable mountain because your perspective might be a bit off. However, life may not be as complicated as it seems today. Nevertheless, it's challenging to scale back your needs without suppressing your desires. Go ahead and take a risk, even if gambling with your emotions now leads to temporary frustration. Open communication is helpful if you don't assume someone else should fix your problems. Just make sure to listen as much as you talk."
cancer,2013-07-14,"You can intuitively sense that you are on the edge of change, raising uneasy feelings of anxiety. You know that something big is about to happen, but you have no idea what it is yet. Your path is not clear today, even if you know what you want. Be patient; it may take a few more days for your emotional needs to be satisfied. Instead of just wanting more, put things into perspective now by appreciating what you already have. Counting your blessings reminds you of what's most important."
leo,2013-07-14,"You want to balance work with play today, yet you have so much on your plate now that relaxation may have to be put on the back burner. Complaining about your super-busy schedule won't make things any easier. Even if you are feeling lazy, take care of your chores without any fuss. Instead of trying to escape your responsibilities, find ways to enjoy yourself in spite of them."
virgo,2013-07-14,"You may experience a hard time today because you cannot clearly state what you want. Part of the problem is that by the time you do speak up, your feelings have already shifted. Unfortunately, you can be so exacting that you set unrealistic goals. Keep in mind that you won't need to lower your standards to allow others additional flexibility in how they respond to you. Ultimately, a mutual exchange of ideas is required to establish common ground."
libra,2013-07-14,"Friends and associates may request more than you can give now. Although you have been known to perform miracles, you might over-commit with the Moon moving through your sign. Your desire to put others at ease could be so strong that your actions seem exaggerated. You can save everyone from a serious headache by promising less. Remember, it's better to disappoint someone today than to face the complex consequences of idealistic expectations. Keeping things simple is your best approach."
scorpio,2013-07-14,"Today's ambiguous Libra Moon moves through your 12th House of Secrets, reminding you that some things are private and should not be shared. Although you might agree with this idea in theory, in practice it's still best to keep everything out in the open now. Explaining your motives may be the most straightforward way to express what's significant to you. Even if others don't understand your perspective, at least they will respect your courage."
sagittarius,2013-07-14,"You may be unusually fair-minded as you approach others in your family or social group today. Although your plan of attack might be totally different from the one that everyone else agrees upon, you're smart enough to go along with the collective decision for now. Be careful not to give in too quickly or your resentment could get in the way of success. Give yourself enough time to process your feelings before explaining your position. Putting your needs into perspective makes it easier to be a part of the fun."
capricorn,2013-07-14,"You are challenged to keep your mind on the serious side of your affairs today because so many distractions pull your thoughts in different directions. Even if you have a lot to do, your desire to enjoy yourself is stronger now than your need to succeed. The Libra Moon's presence in your 10th House of Responsibility encourages you to seek a middle path between work and play. Get your chores out of the way early in the day since you won't even want to think about them once you start to unwind."
aquarius,2013-07-14,"You feel undue pressure to work out an unresolved relationship issue today. Unfortunately, tension arises from a complex mix of emotional dynamics and it won't likely dissipate, even if you try to get to the bottom of the situation. For now, it's probably wiser to set differences of perspectives aside and simply enjoy the positive aspects while you can. Sharing enjoyable experiences builds a foundation for finding future solutions."
pisces,2013-07-14,"Your ability to cut through superfluous circumstances to get to the things that are holding you back enables you to overcome the obstacles. However, spontaneously expressing yourself can inadvertently stir up a hornet's nest of practical issues and there isn't enough time in the day to sort through all the details. Although your patience is tested now, it's okay to leave a few loose ends untied so you have more flexibility later on when you need it."
aries,2013-07-15,"You often make decisions that are based on your own needs, but the Libra Moon reminds you to consider what others want, too. Nevertheless, you might be a bit aggressive once you make your choice today. You could provoke some serious consequences to your current actions if you actually believe that you can ignore everyone else. There's no reason to try to outsmart anyone now when being pleasant and doing as you're asked produces such good results."
taurus,2013-07-15,"You might not agree with a coworker on how to tackle a project today, yet seeking common ground still has its distinct advantages. Don't push to get what you want because there just isn't room for stubbornness now with the Moon traveling through accommodating Libra. The most important thing is to stop resisting the inevitable. Save your energy for when you need it most. Cooperation leads to progress."
gemini,2013-07-15,"Don't make yourself crazy by being too serious today because all work and no play could leave you watching from the sidelines. The fastest way to get in step with your world now is to loosen up and have some fun. Although you can't avoid your responsibilities, it still feels good to let your hair down and kick up your heels. Once you deal with your restless energy, you'll be better able to focus on more important tasks."
cancer,2013-07-15,"Ironically, you are more comfortable if you're stressed by too much opportunity today, rather than none at all. Maybe it's just easier to face a minor disappointment when other things are clicking so well. Nevertheless, heightened expectations set you up for a potential letdown. Scale back your ambitions now so you can feel good about all that you accomplish without becoming discouraged by falling short of your goals."
leo,2013-07-15,"Although your life seems to be improving in many ways, you sometimes still feel as if you're on a collision course with reality. Even if nothing appears out of the ordinary now, your energy may be stretched to the max. Set aside your long-term goals for a while and focus on finding peace and harmony in the present moment, instead. Cut back your activities just enough to free up a little time for relaxation and rest."
virgo,2013-07-15,"You might feel under pressure to make money or contribute your creativity to a project. However, the stress intensifies because your closest relationships are going through changes and figuring out where you fit in occupies a lot of your time. Knowing what to do can be tough since it's uncomfortable to set boundaries that may interfere with your career advancement. Remain open to the opportunities coming your way. Keeping your boss and coworkers appropriately informed about your shifting priorities makes life easier to manage."
libra,2013-07-15,"You're well into the starting phase of a significant shift in your life that will eventually impact all types of relationships; nevertheless, you aren't quite ready for all the pieces to fall into place. You might even postpone an important personal event so you can buy yourself some much-needed time to get things done. There's no need to be overly concerned about what will happen in the future because current circumstances will ultimately lead you to your desired destination."
scorpio,2013-07-15,"The Libra Moon buzzes your 12th House of Privacy and you're likely to have a few secrets that you're not going to tell anyone. However, you are tempted to reveal something very personal about yourself today and you could go overboard and share more than you should. Don't think that everything you say now will be well received. If you are considering a full confession, take a few minutes to remember your reasons for keeping quiet in the first place. You'll have a better sense of your personal boundaries after a bit of contemplation."
sagittarius,2013-07-15,"You feel the disconnect between your own needs and those of your friends and workmates. You may attempt to redefine your values and reassess your current situation, but the more you look at all your options, the better the status quo appears. If you aren't sure what your next move should be now, try checking in with your trusty allies; they can be the source of profound advice at this time."
capricorn,2013-07-15,"It's tricky to balance your professional ambitions with your personal life now, for the two may seem less compatible with each other than ever. It's hard to restrain your confidence when others are setting you up on a pedestal. Nor do you want to hear about the dangers of inflated goals and how they will only lead to disappointment. Instead, consider this as a gentle reminder that a measured approach to your career is your smartest strategy. Remember to honor those you love by spending quality time with them while you can."
aquarius,2013-07-15,"Even if you feel very close to a turning point today, the big change you're seeking might appear to be slipping away. Details are fuzzy and plans can sound like excerpts from an adventure novel now. But this isn't a smart time to become too creative with the truth because you won't be able to justify how you bend reality to your perspective. Get out of your own way and let the facts speak for you, instead."
pisces,2013-07-15,You might feel as if someone is trying to prevent you from reaching your goals today. What begins as a passing thought can grow into an obsession as you attempt to untangle all the emotions and objectives that are involved. It won't be easy to push past the resistance now unless you are patient and persistent. Your best ideas will surface quickly once you quiet your mind to hear your own thoughts.
aries,2013-07-16,"Respecting financial limits is always a smart idea, but you may be able to justify spending a little more than you planned to purchase something that you really need. Use some common sense by asking for advice from a trustworthy friend. You might have to share more personal information than you expect, which can leave you feeling vulnerable. But if you listen to what others say, the payoff could make the whole exercise worth your while."
taurus,2013-07-16,"Your steady pace works to your advantage now, but it's tempting to barge ahead when everything looks so perfect. Although your current enthusiasm might make you impatient, you'll only exhaust yourself if you push too hard. Watch carefully for signs; you'll do best when you let the cosmos tell you how fast to move. Do what you can and then get some sleep before you hit a wall. Even a superhero needs to rest once in a while."
gemini,2013-07-16,"If you recently left too many chores undone, you must focus your energy today and finish whatever you can. You might be annoyed if someone is placing unrealistic expectations on you because you don't want to apply yourself any harder than is necessary now. However, nothing is gained by avoiding your work; it's wiser to change your attitude and just do the best job possible. You'll feel so much better once everything is finished and so will everyone else."
cancer,2013-07-16,"You are eager to integrate your creativity into your regular routine. It's wonderful to be inspired and express yourself in ways that deeply touch others; however, it's an entirely different story if you have to perform on command every day. Turning your art, craft or talent into something productive requires the right mix of self-discipline and wild abandon. Fortunately, you're able to find the perfect balance between these extremes if you let your intuition be your guide."
leo,2013-07-16,"Juggling family loyalty with your desire to pursue your own spiritual path is tricky business, and domestic obligations may limit what you can do now. Going on a vision quest or heading out on a hero's journey might require more careful planning than you think. Remember, there's no need to be in a hurry. You will be more successful on all fronts if you continue putting in a small amount of time toward reaching your goals each and every day."
virgo,2013-07-16,"Naturally, you want your friends and workmates to appreciate how your efficient work style contributes to the overall project. However, previous commitments may prohibit you from getting involved as much as you would like now. But instead of feeling discouraged because you don't have a lot of control, focus your attention on the possibilities ahead. Your positive attitude helps to make you happier today while also creating opportunities for tomorrow."
libra,2013-07-16,"Financial restraints could send you into a tailspin today, but money isn't likely the only problem. Your discouragement may be tied to feelings of low self-esteem and the current lack of cash just exacerbates the issue. Thankfully, a friend might come to your aid just in the nick of time. Remember, there's a price to be paid for someone else's involvement, but accepting help can actually deepen a growing friendship."
scorpio,2013-07-16,"You're resigned to behave in a mature manner now that the Moon joins responsible Saturn in your 1st House of Self. However, harmonious trines to assertive Mars, optimistic Jupiter and imaginative Neptune inspire you to use the power of positive thinking to make your world a better place. Don't mislead yourself into believing that success is yours overnight. Nevertheless, a mix of self-discipline, unflappable faith and hard work is an unbeatable combination."
sagittarius,2013-07-16,"It's relatively easy for you to imagine your way into the future because your fantasies overflow into reality today. Your intuition leads you down the most sensible path now, enabling you to read between the lines and see beneath the surface. Trust your hunches and let your dreams be roadmaps to your happiness. Make commitments that instinctively feel good and then do whatever's necessary to deliver on your promises."
capricorn,2013-07-16,"You're inspired to show your friends and acquaintances how competent you are today. Thankfully, nearly everyone seems to be supportive of anything you do. However, plans may fall apart if others have different priorities than yours. The good times are a bit more elusive than you may realize now, so forget about trying to coordinate everyone else's schedule. Find something productive that you can do on your own."
aquarius,2013-07-16,"You may need to spend time with your coworkers now. Although you wish you could kick back and share your ideas for the future, they may not be interested in hearing what you want to do. Rather than pushing your agenda on others, meet them halfway. The goals you set today will still be there tomorrow; in the meantime, flexibility is your key to happiness."
pisces,2013-07-16,"You don't want to fly by the seat of your pants now; you prefer having a concrete plan with a workable timeline so you know where you are going and when you will arrive. Unfortunately, your agenda may be so rigid that you don't leave enough time to adapt for last minute changes. Opening up your schedule by cutting back on your appointments or just increasing the time between them will build more stability into your day."
aries,2013-07-17,"Your mental sharpness is strong today, but you may grow impatient if everything doesn't go your way. You might expect others to respond quickly to your requests, but you're probably moving too fast. Your overconfidence can land you in trouble if you don't give someone plenty of time to catch up to you. A more mature approach will pay off now, making it smarter to let the waves of anticipation settle down prior to initiating action. Another day or two of fine-tuning your plans can't hurt."
taurus,2013-07-17,"Naturally, you want to say yes rather than no with overindulgent Jupiter in the spotlight today. One scoop of ice cream isn't enough now; if something tastes good, you want more. Unfortunately, your responsibilities will come second if you're distracted by the pursuit of happiness. Remember, true joy comes from appreciating what you have and not from experiencing sensory overload. However, keeping things in perspective allows you to have your cake and eat it too."
gemini,2013-07-17,"You might talk yourself into the craziest things today because your vivid imagination is speeding around, running on overdrive. You could underestimate the complexity of a job while convincing yourself that it will be a piece of cake. However, it's better to be realistic than to commit to a deadline you won't be able to keep. Being a bit more cautious in your assessment enables you to reach your goals on schedule and keep your integrity intact."
cancer,2013-07-17,"You seem more outgoing to others today than you actually feel, but perhaps your friendliness distracts people from asking probing questions. Although you may be quite content these days, it's not easy to share the real reason for your enthusiasm because you're afraid of being misunderstood. Fortunately, it's not necessary to push yourself outside of your comfort zone now. Enjoy your daydreams and mental meandering without explaining yourself until you're good and ready."
leo,2013-07-17,"You may be certain that pleasure is just around the corner, but you could have a slightly distorted perspective of the future now. On the upside, your innate self-confidence improves your life through the power of positive thinking. Having faith in the impact of your actions can be an important key to your current happiness, assuming that you don't lose touch with reality. Visualizing your ideal outcome is more effective if you apply some common sense along the way."
virgo,2013-07-17,"You're tempted to throw all caution to the wind today, risking your current security in the hopes of creating a memorable experience. Unfortunately, your eagerness can lead to an awkward moment when you realize that the immediate fulfillment of your desires probably won't bring you long-term satisfaction. Rather than taking a chance on a fleeting taste of pleasure, concentrate on doing something special that will last."
libra,2013-07-17,"You might lose track of your responsibilities today if you get caught up in a social whirlwind. Although there are plenty of opportunities to enjoy your friends and partake in pleasurable activities, don't forget about your previous promises. If you avoid your obligations, it will certainly be more difficult to reach your goals. However, if you finish your work quickly, you can relax and enjoy floating off into a fantasy-land of fun and games."
scorpio,2013-07-17,"It's complicated to know exactly what is acceptable and what isn't when asking for something that you want today. Although your requests aren't really off the wall, your friends may not share the same intensity for your passions. Nevertheless, staying connected with your feelings is empowering, even if you think you need to keep your desires hidden. Ultimately, toning down your style just a bit gives others enough emotional distance to support you without feeling overwhelmed."
sagittarius,2013-07-17,"You may think that indulgent behavior should bring you more joy, but following this strategy now only leads to frustration down the road. Unrestrained partying and other kinds of escapist activities can be a great deal of fun in moderation for a short amount of time. Meanwhile, getting serious about seeking your own personal vision requires a real commitment to hard work with the potential rewards to follow sometime in the future. Ultimately, the choice is yours."
capricorn,2013-07-17,"You have been performing your job duties under pressure recently, so it shouldn't come as a surprise if you're anxious to escape your heavy work responsibilities. Luckily, taking a long lunch or socializing on the clock may not be a problem as long as you don't stretch the limits too far. A reasonable approach enables you to easily fit in some fun today without negatively impacting your reputation or your productivity. There's nothing wrong with enjoying yourself, even if it doesn't contribute to your progress."
aquarius,2013-07-17,"You might be more interested in encouraging your coworkers today than you are in reaching your own goals. Thankfully, your magnanimity may prove to be lots of fun for you, even if you don't get much done. Instead of putting all your eggs in someone else's basket, reserve a few for yourself. Fortunately, balancing your dreams with other people's agendas creates a situation where everyone can be a winner."
pisces,2013-07-17,"You have the gift of being able to touch others profoundly today, healing past hurts and mending old wounds. Paradoxically, your current magic cannot be bottled or saved, however hard you try. Although acting with compassion is your specialty, you still may end up feeling like a victim if you go to extreme measures. Luckily, you don't need to make major sacrifices to do your best work. Instead of holding back, open your heart and let your love light shine."
aries,2013-07-18,"You need to know that someone close to you supports you no matter what you do. Your current desires aren't your typical lighthearted attractions to a possible romance. Instead, you're on an intense search for meaning in your life. Don't sell yourself short by accepting less than what you deserve. Creating amazing relationships is possible, and it begins with self-acceptance. Leading by example encourages others to be true to themselves, too."
taurus,2013-07-18,"Set your long-term goals as high as possible today because the more you stretch, the farther you'll go. Even if you tend to over-inflate your dreams now, indulging your fantasies is a beneficial activity because it allows you to explore your desires without making a commitment in the real world yet. Nevertheless, there's no need to keep your feelings entirely to yourself. Sharing your inner process with an objective observer helps you clarify which visions are actually worth pursuing and which should be left behind."
gemini,2013-07-18,"Rewards at work may come from out of the blue today, as if the universe picked you out of the pack for special recognition. Don't worry about why the acknowledgment is happening at this time; just enjoy it. The only danger is your current inclination to rest on your laurels too long. You still need to do the work required of you so you don't let down your coworkers. In the meantime, graciously accept the support and use it to fuel your momentum until you finish the job."
cancer,2013-07-18,"Romance may be heading your direction, even if it seems to be running late like a rush-hour train. However, your current dilemma is about discerning the difference between reality and fantasy. You cannot easily tell where the hard edges of the world fuzz out to become the ideal created by your imagination. Positive vibrations are all around you now, but you might need to get clarification from others to know what is real."
leo,2013-07-18,"Even if you are normally an expressive Lion, you might want to keep your feelings under wraps today so you don't have to justify them to others. You may have idealistic goals about relationships, but reality doesn't match up with your fantasies. Set aside any urges to force the issue. Rest assured that what you imagine now can manifest in your life if you keep your heart open to a wider spectrum of possibilities."
virgo,2013-07-18,"You may feel waterlogged now, as if you have been deluged by emotions that can keep you from your real work. Ironically, it might be a mistake to rush back to dry land quite yet. Although you won't likely produce any tangible results from today's irrational excursions, the benefits you receive are potentially long-lasting if your overall intentions are honorable. Soaking in all the good feelings revitalizes you for the work ahead."
libra,2013-07-18,"Your self-esteem soars today as you begin to feel better about all the alternatives spread before you. However, it's time to loosen up your grip on your day-to-day activities. You don't have to worry about the little details as much as you normally do. Your current success is related to your ability to just let the days unfold without micromanaging every moment. Exploring the options now empowers you to choose the best path later on."
scorpio,2013-07-18,"There might never be perfect conditions for creativity, but the energy these days feels pretty darned close. Your ability to visualize is heightened and your imagination is running strong. Use your sixth sense to feel your way through the landscape and then manifest the beauty you perceive. Even if you don't feel artistically inclined, sharing your vision with someone else can foster a special emotional bond."
sagittarius,2013-07-18,"You are standing at the edge of a dream, and have more cosmic magic working on your behalf than usual. Whether your imagination manifests positively or negatively is up to you, for your fantasies have the potential to become tomorrow's reality. If you believe in the power of the mind, make time to create a meditative space where you can envision your highest aspirations. Make yourself comfortable, listen to your favorite music and let your intuition be your guide."
capricorn,2013-07-18,"There could be some confusion regarding your social life now, and it may grow into more stress than you want to handle. Maybe you're uncertain about an invitation or, perhaps, you haven't figured out how to juggle your calendar. However this temporary indecision affects you, don't get too worked up. The answers will come to you just in time, but possibly not until you throw your hands up in the air and surrender. Trusting the process eventually works in your favor if you can release your need to control the outcome."
aquarius,2013-07-18,"Career issues are emphasized these days, but it's possible that you need to retreat and regroup before making one more push toward your goals. You might not realize how much you've overextended your resources. Nevertheless, it's important to stabilize your position now, for the current expansion is not going to let up for a while. Standing on a firm foundation enables you to reap the rewards of your work in due time."
pisces,2013-07-18,"Obsessive thoughts of exotic travel may consume your free time today, even if you cannot go anywhere yet. However, it's important to remember that you can journey in your mind via your imagination anytime you want. You are hearing the call of the wild and it's your time to answer. Don't hold back. Anything is possible, but you must first go through the process of visualizing your adventure before it can happen."
aries,2013-07-19,"No matter what you face on the road ahead you don't need to do anything out of the ordinary today except believe in yourself. Naturally, your faith isn't a guarantee of success; it's merely your entry ticket. Your upcoming journey could teach you how to be more practical than ever. Exhibiting healthy self-confidence is a good start, but you'll still have to apply yourself to succeed."
taurus,2013-07-19,"You're ready to harness your creativity and make it work to your advantage. However, this is not just a one-day project; it could be your main focus for months to come. Even if you are waiting for a more opportune time to put your lofty plans into motion, at least solidify your dreams today. Any idea that receives your current approval is likely worth pursuing to see where it leads."
gemini,2013-07-19,"You are usually on the move, yet paradoxically, it seems as if you make more progress today by staying in one place. The irony is you must sink deeper into your emotions to gain the knowledge that you seek. Possibilities may open up later in the month if you are willing to fulfill your current obligations now. However, it's crucial to take time and explore the emotional origins of your restlessness so you don't needlessly waste your valuable energy."
cancer,2013-07-19,"Be ready for someone to enter your life promising you fame, fortune or simply an opportunity to get ahead. Thankfully, you have the mental acuity now to ascertain if this is the real deal or just a passing pipe dream. Listen carefully to what's being said and then give yourself plenty of time to roll the potential around in your mind. Don't second guess your intuition today; just do what feels right."
leo,2013-07-19,"Although you may think that waiting is a smart idea now, don't turn down an offer just because it doesn't seem good enough. Even the most amazing opportunities won't shock and awe you with their potential today; nevertheless, they still could be very promising. Make no mistake; you will have to work harder than you think to get the results you want. Luckily, the outcome should be well worth your effort if your heart is in the right place."
virgo,2013-07-19,"Although you long for a more relaxing schedule today, your efforts may be rewarded beyond your expectations. You might not be able to recognize the upside of a current opportunity because Mercury Retrograde -- which ends tomorrow -- limits your ability to see what's around the corner. However, putting your shoulder to the wheel is still your smartest strategy. Thankfully, you can also have some fun in the process. Remember, the more you enjoy yourself along the way, the better your chances for success."
libra,2013-07-19,"You may feel a distinct contrast between doing what you know needs to be done today and your desire to pass the time lost in pleasant daydreams. Being aware of this dilemma is the first step, but you must remind yourself more than once that this is no time for escapist behavior. You have important foundational work that's best started now and procrastinating could make for tougher going later on."
scorpio,2013-07-19,"You are all about keeping to yourself today, unless you're required to interact with others to fulfill a previous commitment. It's not that you are a loner; it's just that you have important things to do now that can positively impact your future and you don't want to be distracted by unnecessary noise. Spend time prioritizing old goals or creating new ones. Following your dreams feeds your soul and rejuvenates your entire being."
sagittarius,2013-07-19,"Honoring your goals in life is a smart idea today, whether or not they are part of your practical career plan. It's best to widen your visions of the future because a singular focus on getting ahead can have a negative impact on your personal life. Public recognition is something that you want, but it's not enough to just fulfill your dreams. Make time to cherish the friendships and intimate relationships that enrich your journey along the road to success."
capricorn,2013-07-19,"Opportunities may fall out of the sky today, yet you could easily miss them unless you are looking up. If you are absolutely certain about your current long-term goals, you might not recognize other possibilities that drop into your lap. However, this doesn't suggest you should be any less focused on the work at hand. It only means that widening your horizons can be an act of courage that pays off down the road."
aquarius,2013-07-19,"It might appear as if you've lost interest in your goals today, but this is certainly not the case. It's just that you're in the process of redefining what's most important in your life and it may differ from other people's fixed assumptions. For example, instead of climbing the ladder at work, you might be more concerned with pursuing your personal or spiritual growth. Luckily, extracurricular explorations at this time can ultimately increase your earning power in the future to give you the best of both worlds."
pisces,2013-07-19,"You could be ready to surrender if you are in a standoff with someone at work. However, backing down is not advisable today; it's smarter to persistently express what's in your heart. While it's true that compromise usually works best, others will likely come around to your point of view if your intentions are sincere. Don't settle for receiving the short end of the stick. Hang on to your dreams; cultivating patience makes more sense now than giving up too soon."
aries,2013-07-20,"No matter how many projects you're considering, it's now time to stop thinking and to start doing something about one of them. Your energy is at peak efficiency and it would be to your benefit if you make the most of your day. Just remember that you still can overdo it by taking on too much. Create a manageable plan and stick to it. Establishing a steady pace today is wiser than trying to do everything at once."
taurus,2013-07-20,"This is a great time to enjoy yourself, so let the good times roll. Just remember that if they are rolling downhill, circumstances will continue to gather speed and you may not be able to stop things as easily as you wish. The problem is that it's tricky to determine your limits now. Thankfully, you can rely on someone you trust to be your adviser since others could provide the objectivity that you currently lack."
gemini,2013-07-20,"You may become so enthused now that you are ready to say yes to nearly anything. Fortunately, Mercury's direct turn today increases your ability to deliver on a promise. However, you might inadvertently deceive yourself if you don't take enough time to consciously separate the facts from the fantasies. This doesn't mean that you should say no. Just leave yourself an escape route so you can bail if necessary. And whatever you do, don't wait until it's too late to call it quits."
cancer,2013-07-20,"Although your progress has been impeded by obstacles that get in your way, it's time to face the lingering issues and overcome the internal resistance. You're serious about reaching your goals, but you're also dreaming about the good times ahead. However, it's not your style to go off and enjoy yourself while you are still concerned about something else. Thankfully, handling your responsibilities in the present moment allows you to relax later on."
leo,2013-07-20,"There are two conflicting voices in your head, giving very different advice today. One is telling you that all is well. Good times are yours and you should seize the opportunity to indulge your fantasies. However, the other voice is warning you that pursuing pleasure is not an intelligent option now. You have work to do and there's no time like the present. Your best strategy is to create a middle path; balancing your need to be responsible with your current desire to escape is your unique formula for success."
virgo,2013-07-20,"Opportunities are promising today as your ruling planet Mercury turns direct, but reaching a goal still requires a high level of concentration and follow-through. Even if you envision problems ahead, you'll probably take your chances and go for it anyhow. Just make sure you aren't missing any important details. You can inflate the potential if you don't keep your feet on the ground. A little practicality now contributes toward your future success."
libra,2013-07-20,"Your expectations are inflated, but the day might not unfold according to your plan. Thankfully, your disappointment won't last for long if a close friend or partner lets you down today. Having a flexible attitude allows you to accommodate changes in your schedule by modifying your agenda accordingly. Although you are in an agreeable mood, it may be hard to get motivated now. Luckily, your easygoing approach can rub off on those around you, creating a supportive atmosphere for all involved."
scorpio,2013-07-20,"You initially set out to apply your energy toward the big ideas you have for the day, but everything seems to move at a slower pace than you planned. If you can't accept a few delays with a sense of humor, your frustration could get in the way of your pleasure. Fortunately, simply acknowledging that you might not get everything finished today can be enough to ease the pressure and put a positive spin on all that you do."
sagittarius,2013-07-20,"It's difficult to constrain your excitement today, especially as the events of the day begin to unfold. You may have excellent intentions, but still grow restless until you finally allow yourself to partake in some indulgences you normally might avoid. Don't waste time with self-criticism if you cannot live up to your ideals. Navigate away from the shadows the best you can now, and stay on the sunny side of the street."
capricorn,2013-07-20,"Hard work pays off today, especially if your common sense guides you along the most efficient path. Think about where you want to be and make a concrete plan to reach your destination. Just remember there's no hurry, so start off slowly to set a sustainable pace. You'll gain steam and speed as you move along, so you'll be well on your way by the end of the day."
aquarius,2013-07-20,"Finding the physical energy that's necessary to complete your chores will be the least of your problems today, since chances are that you'll have more stamina in reserve to do whatever you set your mind on. Although you are about as sensible and stable as ever, your attention can still wander off into fantasy-land if you let it. Apply yourself in the real world and real rewards will follow."
pisces,2013-07-20,"You are building a bridge to your dreams step by step. Although the floor beneath your feet isn't as stable as you wish, the foundation is probably strong enough to support you. You are inflating your vision of today's potential like a child blows up a balloon. Unfortunately, it's nearly impossible to know where the limits are now. You might not be able to find satisfaction if you always believe the solution is right around the next corner. Sometimes happiness can be found in the present moment."
aries,2013-07-21,"It's time to fulfill your domestic obligations or professional responsibilities and, if you do your job well, significant rewards are yours. The point is that you must earn them the good old-fashioned way with determination and hard work. It may be tempting to take a shortcut now, but this tactic will only delay your success. However, if you do what is required, good news could be waiting just around the next corner. In the meantime, honoring your commitments leaves you with a lasting feeling of personal satisfaction."
taurus,2013-07-21,"Even if you're deeply involved with family issues now, you might have to adopt a more cautious approach to what's going on at home. At first, it seems like you're choosing the easy way out but this strategy only buys you time, not answers. Eventually you have to take a stand for your beliefs. Nevertheless, it's still useful to remember that petty conflicts are not worth feeding with negativity. Rather than acting on your fears, visualize the best possible outcome for all involved and then strive to make it happen."
gemini,2013-07-21,"You may wake up on the wrong side of the bed today, thinking about all the responsibilities being piled upon you. There's no need to be silent; speak up if you don't think you should be doing what's being asked of you now. But don't do the work begrudgingly and then whine about it later. Instead, find a project that makes your heart sing. Doing something you love elevates your self-esteem and is ultimately good for those around you, too."
cancer,2013-07-21,"Feeling stress from a relationship has you questioning your own motives today, along with everything else. You don't know what to say in order to delay an emotionally disruptive interaction but nearly any action is likely better than doing nothing at all. Don't waste energy dancing with self-doubt; it's simply not productive. Instead, use your time to isolate what matters to you before stating your position and then doing what it takes to defend it."
leo,2013-07-21,"You're slightly annoyed today because you feel as if you should be working on something even if you don't know exactly what it is. Thankfully, your dilemma might not even be noticeable to others, but it still can add frustration to your day. An obvious solution is to just jump in and get busy; start by crossing some of the lingering items off your to-do list one at a time. Once your adrenaline kicks in, you'll quickly develop a better idea of how you want to spend your time."
virgo,2013-07-21,"You are quite aware of your social obligations now and you are resigned to fulfill them, no matter what it takes. This determination may bring up familiar issues about your need to meet the expectations of others and how this can get in the way of your own personal satisfaction. But the good news is that you are on a sensible track to take care of unfinished business. Fortunately, staying focused early in the day leaves you time to pursue your own interests later on."
libra,2013-07-21,"Applying your energy toward projects around the house is nurturing for your soul today. However, frustration might set in if the good times seem to be a step or two away. Nevertheless, a pragmatic approach makes the most sense now; there are things to be done and you're the one to do them. Acknowledging the feelings that surface while fulfilling your responsibilities is empowering. Ultimately, you can enjoy yourself if you remain conscious about the choices you make throughout the entire day."
scorpio,2013-07-21,"You have places to go and people to see now that the ambitious Capricorn Moon is moving through your 3rd House of Distractions. Unfortunately, your calendar may be so full that you don't get to do what you want. Instead of keeping your desires to yourself, share them with those around you. It's difficult to go out on a limb and talk about you own needs when others are relying on you. However, being honest about your wishes is a healthier strategy now than denying your feelings to meet everyone else's expectations."
sagittarius,2013-07-21,"You are so smooth at justifying your decisions today that others might think your actions are based upon your strong personal values. You're adept at keeping your feelings hidden now, making it nearly impossible for anyone to see your real motives. However, your current choices are probably determined by your emotional needs rather than core beliefs or ethical judgments. There's no need to waste energy covering up what's in your heart. Fortunately, telling the truth can actually set you free."
capricorn,2013-07-21,"It's a mixed blessing when the Moon activates your sign for a couple of days. Normally, the evocative Moon draws you toward your emotions. However, you may be keeping your feelings to yourself now. Try to hold steady in the practical world instead of letting your fluctuating moods get the upper hand. If you must express what's in your heart, take your time. A thoughtful disclosure can positively impact your most significant relationships."
aquarius,2013-07-21,"Almost anything that isn't out in the open now can be the source of great stress. For example, someone may be creating trouble behind your back to block your forward movement. The smartest move is to expose whatever is hidden so everyone can see what's actually going on. However, it's not wise to force an issue yet because you might not have all the facts at your disposal. It's best to play the waiting game until others come to the same realization; in the meantime, prepare to swing into action on a moment's notice."
pisces,2013-07-21,"You may be quite creative today, but it's challenging to locate an outlet for your bursts of spontaneous expression. Fortunately, you can reveal your current enthusiasm by sharing what's in your heart. However, you might feel external resistance to what you're trying to express. Cool your heels if you must, but don't blame your inhibitions on anyone else. Taking full responsibility for your self-restraint places you in the driver's seat where you belong."
aries,2013-07-22,"The energy may feel somewhat out of control for you today as your creative juices rise to the surface. Your excitement is irrepressible, and with the Aquarius Full Moon tugging on your 5th House of Love, you're right on the edge of falling into the passion pit. Now, if this good news was the only news, you would be all set. But it's not. There is more going on now than meets the heart. Watch your step -- exercising caution is more than just a good idea -- it's a necessity."
taurus,2013-07-22,"If you stubbornly believe that your strategy at work is set in stone, old concerns may come back today with a twist. Someone didn't tell you everything and now that the Aquarius Full Moon is in your 10th House of Public Life, it's time to spill the beans. Full disclosure might be upsetting at first, but everyone will feel better once it's all out in the open. Sharing your truth inspires others to do the same."
gemini,2013-07-22,"The Aquarius Full Moon falls in your 9th House of Big Ideas, breaking your communication channels wide open. Unfortunately, this expansive energy can be a mixed blessing, for you pick up all kinds of static along with the important data you need in order to make your decisions. There may be some confusing signals from others along the way, so use whatever navigation methods work best to keep tabs on reality. Exploring all your options gives you more choices down the road."
cancer,2013-07-22,"You Crabs are more connected to the lunar rhythms than others, and as such can really feel the power of today's Aquarius Full Moon as it floods your 8th House of Intimacy. Let the emotional tides surge with swells of unexpected intensity, but remember that you don't have to react to every passing mood. If you must express something, do it and then let go of it right away. Too much attachment to your desires now brings complexity to an otherwise beautifully simple relationship."
leo,2013-07-22,"The Aquarius Full Moon is especially significant since it stimulates your 7th House of Relationships. This alignment pulls your sense of personal and romantic love right out of your heart and into the world around you. The radiant Sun shifts into your proud sign today, intensifying your reactions to the drama of someone close to you. As difficult as it may be now, stay close while allowing him or her enough room to grow. Although your first instinct might be to run, keep in mind that your feelings will quiet down in just a few days."
virgo,2013-07-22,"You are in touch with a deep urge to seek out new meaning to your life, but your outer world may seem shallow and uninspired when compared to what surges forth from your subconscious. Don't be afraid of what comes to the surface during routine conversations now that the Aquarius Full Moon lands in your 6th House of Work. You are not required to say out loud what you observe on the inside. But it's best to listen to your heart while sweet Venus is visiting your sign."
libra,2013-07-22,"You may be able to make some real progress on accomplishing your career goals these days. In fact, recognition might be coming your way on both the professional and personal front now that the Aquarius Full Moon shines in your 5th House of Love and Creativity. You're attracting positive vibrations as even the most conventional experiences light up your emotional sky with fireworks. Bask in the limelight and enjoy these next few days without necessarily making any long-term plans."
scorpio,2013-07-22,"It's essential to express your concerns now as this Aquarius Full Moon illuminates your 4th House of Emotional Security. You may be upset by something that just isn't very important in the long run. However, don't suppress your fears; it's crucial to pay attention to all your mood changes now. If you slip into denial, there might be negative fallout on your performance in the workplace. Don't take your anger out on someone nearby. Examine what is motivating your feelings and deal with the source rather than the symptoms."
sagittarius,2013-07-22,"The Aquarius Full Moon emphasizes your 3rd House of Communication, inspiring you to write that email or make the phone call you have been putting off. Your reaching out has a better chance of having the impact you desire today. You can shine now, but your intensity could overwhelm others -- and they might not be able to absorb all that you have to say. Take it slowly; allow everyone enough time to process your words and to respond to them before going on to what's next."
capricorn,2013-07-22,You're able to accomplish quite a bit once you set your mind to it. You continue riding high on the surges of energy and yet your feet are planted squarely on the ground. Be careful that you don't exhaust your resources now that the Aquarius Full Moon activates your 2nd House of Net Worth. Take the necessary time to attend to the basics of your health and be sure to get enough sleep. You can make the most of this time by conserving your available resources while using them as efficiently as possible.
aquarius,2013-07-22,"Today's Full Moon lights up your sign, flooding into every aspect of your waking life. It's as if your subconscious mind is at high tide. The Moon works primarily in the dream realms, but now its influence overflows into the real world. Welcome the emotional storms that can clear the air. Let the waters wash the beaches as you ride upon larger-than-life waves while they last. Thankfully, you'll have time to assimilate your experience when the intensity begins to dissipate tomorrow."
pisces,2013-07-22,"You may believe that today is your last chance to finish an old project as the Aquarius Full Moon rattles your 12th House of Endings. However, you might just be experiencing another illusion; time is not coming to an end. Nevertheless, it feels overwhelming as you see how much there is for you to do with so little time to get it all completed. Close your eyes and take a few long and slow deep breaths. Then, open them and return to work. Do this frequently during the day and you'll be surprised at how much you can accomplish."
aries,2013-07-23,"You might be quite distracted from the emotional issues that have been building over the last few weeks. There is much to say, but you can't bring yourself to say it. Lately, you are more concerned about what others think of you, so you often change the subject to something less threatening. Get together with trusted friends and share what's weighing on your heart. Receiving their support will be well worth the risk of revealing your feelings. Nothing ventured; nothing gained."
taurus,2013-07-23,"You want to be acknowledged for your unflappable behavior, but even if people say wonderful things about you now, you might not be open to what you are hearing. It's important to be actively engaged with those around you; if praise comes your way, smile and say thank you. Don't deflect the positive support because of your temporary insecurity or low self-esteem. On the other hand, don't go fishing for compliments; they mean a lot more when they're unsolicited. Be the friend you want to have and focus your attention on the happiness of others."
gemini,2013-07-23,"New opportunities create alternatives today as you think about all the future possibilities waiting for you. Even if you're still feeling stressed out, the potential for change is improving day by day. But don't expect circumstances to suddenly transform. Rather, the dreams you hold on to now will begin to take shape gradually. Think big, but try not to be too disappointed if everything takes some time yet to manifest. Remember, Rome wasn't built in a day."
cancer,2013-07-23,"You may go through a weird phase this week as you attempt to distance yourself from your feelings in order to cope with what's happening. Although this sounds difficult, gaining perspective can be quite helpful. Relationships might be easier than they have been for a while, since your current emotional detachment enables you to enjoy yourself without being overwhelmed. Be aware of your desires, but don't spread them out on the table for others to see. Give yourself time to sort things out before you share them with anyone else."
leo,2013-07-23,"You roar with all the intent of the Lion or Lioness, but others may react to you now in ways you don't expect. The high tension between your will and the emotional response that you elicit today might anger you if you can't have your way. But don't follow your temptation to turn this into a full-blown argument. If you do, there won't be a winner. Call on your inner patience today because you'll most likely achieve your goals if you can wait long enough for others to come around to your point of view."
virgo,2013-07-23,"Your ideas may be worth more than anyone perceives, but it's difficult to get your concepts across at this time. If you are misinterpreted, your tendency now is to inflate your cleverness in an attempt to convince others of your intellectual merit. But the more you say, the less they understand. Loosening the reins of control prevents problems from developing later on. Your best tactic is to communicate as little as possible and let the day take its own course, without feeling the need to control where it leads."
libra,2013-07-23,"You have lots of energy today to put toward creating enjoyment for you and those around you. You could choose to have a party since that would fulfill your need for spending time with your friends in a spontaneous manner. Also, your creative juices are flowing, so if there's a project you've been putting off, today is the day to get it off the ground. He who hesitates is lost."
scorpio,2013-07-23,"Processing your emotions may be tricky if it seems that you have nowhere to go with your feelings. If you express them honestly, you won't improve your current situation. However, if you try to bury them, you'll only make matters even worse. Thankfully, there's an easy solution; simply steer clear of blame. Acknowledge what you're feeling, but don't attempt to describe the cause. If you stay in the present moment and remember to be kind, then a difficult situation can magically transform into a beautiful encounter."
sagittarius,2013-07-23,"Today has all the earmarks of a highly busy day, complete with unusual social encounters. Although you may be looking for meaning as much as you are seeking a good time, the emphasis is on turning your day into an adventure. Of course, you're nearly always up for a good adventure. However, problems arise if you make too much out of a minor event. If you're going to the beach for a swim, don't try to turn it into a Caribbean pleasure cruise."
capricorn,2013-07-23,"Even if the emotional turmoil has started to calm down, you still might be embroiled in a bit of a power struggle that upsets you. Unfortunately, you can easily express your frustration at the wrong target, which doesn't necessarily help you to regain your sense of balance. Instead of focusing on a current situation, look ahead to next week and do whatever you need in order to carry out your long-term commitments. Keeping your eyes on the future gives you the confidence motivation to successfully handle the current situation."
aquarius,2013-07-23,"A close family member or a good friend may be the source of temporary trouble for you now. You feel like you haven't done anything wrong, but someone still could get angry with you for no apparent reason. You might even see the black cloud coming and try to stop the oncoming storm, but to no avail. Don't take it all too seriously, for the drama seems so much more important than it really is. Let the emotional barrage roll off you like water off a duck's back. No worries; the sun will come out tomorrow."
pisces,2013-07-23,"You can drift off into your own fantasy-land these days, but escape might not be such a bad thing now. Others get on your case and try to make you see the folly of your ways but you know there's treasure to be discovered. Thankfully, there is no harm from taking your little mental holiday as long as you remember the difference between reality and your imagination. Embark on your journey, but make certain you're back in time to do your chores."
aries,2013-07-24,"You want to keep your thoughts in order today, but it becomes more challenging to stick to the facts as the day proceeds. Ironically, you're quite capable of starting with unformed complex concepts and transforming them into concrete ideas. However, you must make an effort to write your thoughts down or they will vanish into the past. Thankfully, you can easily increase your chances of success now by focusing a little extra attention on the details."
taurus,2013-07-24,"You might believe that you know what's going on in a relationship now, but nothing is exactly as it seems. Perhaps you have gone out of your way to express deep feelings over the past few days. Although you may be upbeat about your disclosure, you could be purposely ignoring a significant piece of the puzzle. Make time today to regroup, check your facts and then start reconstructing from the ground up. Even if sorting everything out takes a little longer, getting it right is worth the effort."
gemini,2013-07-24,"When your phone rings today you might find a conundrum on the line. Even if it seems impossible, it's your future calling you for a little chat. Don't be afraid of having a serious conversation with an as yet unrealized version of yourself that may take months to manifest. Imagine what you could accomplish by checking in with an older and wiser you. Whatever you dream about now can become real over time with the proper commitment and hard work."
cancer,2013-07-24,"Your words today are more important than usual because they accurately reflect what's in your heart. Even your quietest voice brings an important perspective to the table that others will appreciate learning about now, even if they don't completely agree with you. Consider what kind of impact you want to have and then craft your message carefully. It's time to be heard and acknowledged for the amazing person you are."
leo,2013-07-24,"Your mental clarity returns just in the nick of time for you to take decisive action today. Even if you are still slightly confused, you have sense enough to either accept what you are being told or to reject it outright. Trust your own gut while the planets are working on your behalf. But don't forget to nurture the seeds of your current thoughts over the days ahead as they mature into your unfolding future."
virgo,2013-07-24,"Your mind is busy with important work now as you integrate developing values with the fundamental structures of your life. You are in a phase of re-analyzing your emotions, yet you might not be able to find the right words to describe exactly what you are experiencing. Moving ahead in small realistic increments is better today than acting on unbridled enthusiasm. Take it step by step and others will get enough of the picture to matter."
libra,2013-07-24,"Although you're on the edge of an expansive period in your life, today is best devoted to taking care of practical details in the present moment. Your mission is to figure out the best ways to communicate your creative ideas. You don't want anyone to bail just because they think you've gone too far, too fast. You'll have to be realistic enough in your thinking now to bring others along for the ride or else your efforts could go to waste. Demonstrate your competence by bringing your vision down to earth first before saying a word."
scorpio,2013-07-24,"Your strength today comes from carefully thinking through all the details surrounding an important issue that may be affecting more people than just you. Although you're naturally intrigued by the complexity, you're only searching for the simplest solution now. A complicated situation draws out a premature answer to your current question. Nevertheless, speak your mind carefully and remain flexible in your attitude. Stick with the facts as you know them while remaining open to new information as it comes along."
sagittarius,2013-07-24,"Serious and meaningful conversations are on your agenda today, but even if you're ready to talk, your partner may not be so inclined. Or perhaps your friends don't agree with your opinions and you are reticent to express all that you feel. It's really not necessary to push any one specific issue, even if it seems urgent. Stay in logical realms and stick to practical applications. You can always come back and talk about what's on your mind in a day or two when people are more receptive and willing to listen."
capricorn,2013-07-24,"You may feel as if the same set of issues returns again and again. But this time you're ready to share what you have been withholding for too long. However, you aren't interested in just rambling on and on to hear yourself talk. You believe it's your job to keep things on the straight and narrow. Remain focused on your internal process, no matter what you choose to reveal. Just remember to be kind as you tell it like it is. Your delivery is almost as important as your message."
aquarius,2013-07-24,"You might be very excited about a project or a relationship now, but it's time to slow down the growth process so you can sustain the experience. Naturally, you want to share your enthusiasm, but it's important that you don't oversell anyone on your ideas. Others may not be as jazzed about your plans at first. If they are grounded in reality, people will come around in time. However, if the whole thing turns out to be less significant than you expected, you'll be glad that you didn't push too hard."
pisces,2013-07-24,"You want everyone to listen to your ideas and to accept what you say now as the truth. However, you might feel like the ""Little Boy Who Cried Wolf."" Nevertheless, this time you're quite certain that your point of view is valid enough to defend. Be brave and consider partnership issues from an enlightened perspective. Your radical approach could give your confidence an extra boost. Stay present with your feelings without dramatizing them today and you just may receive the respect and recognition you desire."
aries,2013-07-25,"You're riding on a high horse today and you might not be willing to heed the advice of anyone else. Unfortunately, you could be your own worst enemy if you also forget to listen to your heart. If you are absolutely certain about your recent choices, it may be difficult to even consider someone's negative feelings simmering beneath the surface now. Slow down just enough to hear your inner voice since it's healthier to integrate emotions as they arise. Once you're in sync with yourself it's easier to be more mindful of others."
taurus,2013-07-25,"You have something important to get off your chest today. Fortunately, a little compassion will go a long way when it comes to sharing your thoughts. It's not that you are being particularly insensitive, but your feelings are inflated and you may be so emphatic in your expression that others can't understand what you are trying to say. Step back and take a few breaths before flying off the handle. The good news is that speaking your truth will work out for the best if you remember that everyone is ultimately on the same team."
gemini,2013-07-25,"Pay close attention to your pocketbook, for your inclination now is toward extravagance. The problem is that you may feel so confident that everything appears to be coming up roses. But be careful ... you can tend toward overspending what you have or over-committing what you do not have. If you remember to respect your limits and apply your enthusiasm to the details, you will end up in a much better financial position. A penny saved is a penny earned."
cancer,2013-07-25,"There still is a heavy emphasis on your home and family no matter how hard you try to balance your current professional commitments with your personal life. You may actually feel more optimistic and buoyant than usual, which empowers you to take a risk in an intimate relationship. On the other hand, if the dynamics are not going your way, you might become passive and brood about your situation. Nevertheless, demonstrating your willingness to initiate action helps move the energy in a positive direction."
leo,2013-07-25,"Other people may encourage you today while still secretly plotting against you. Perhaps a coworker or acquaintance is being extra nice to you now in an effort to cover his or her own tracks. Luckily, you're capable of doing magic regardless of anyone else's actions. Instead of wondering what is going on behind the scenes, just give your best performance. Luckily, your enthusiasm and talent, combined with a relentless determination, empowers you to breeze right past an ill-conceived roadblock, impressing your audience along the way."
virgo,2013-07-25,"The greatest thoughts are of little value unless they are brought out into the open for everyone to see. Share your creative ideas now, for they are more worthwhile than you realize. Recognizing your own power enables you to motivate an entire group by what you choose to say. Even if your innovation becomes unrecognizable as it evolves, you can still feel happy about contributing to the process. Sometimes being a catalyst is the most important role you can play."
libra,2013-07-25,"Turning up the volume on your own intuitive voice today prevents you from responding too quickly to the actions of others. You will be better off by acting on what you actually need, but you must quiet down enough to figure out how you really feel. Timing is everything ... swing into action once you truly know what your heart wants. Your exuberance is contagious and you could end up leading the pack. Even if your idea is a bit of a gamble, it still can work out as long as it's grounded in reality."
scorpio,2013-07-25,"It may feel like you've been treading water recently, without making much progress. Now, however, the tide is shifting, the clouds are lifting, and you can see blue sky and many possibilities on the horizon. Still, you have a big choice in front of you that may determine which way you should go. It's challenging to make this kind of life-changing decision, but not because you lack confidence or conviction. Instead, it's simply because you cannot do everything all at once. Fortunately, the process of elimination helps you narrow your options."
sagittarius,2013-07-25,"You are drawing your personal power from a deep well today, and others can't help but stand up and take notice. You may find yourself embroiled in a conflict with someone close to you because of your current intensity. Thankfully, an unpleasant situation can be resolved to everyone's benefit if you choose to travel the high road of integrity. A lively debate or even sexual fireworks with an intimate partner could open a path to a happy resolution."
capricorn,2013-07-25,"It's not easy to relinquish control, yet you should come out ahead if you moderate the expectations you place on yourself. Nevertheless, it's so tempting to get swept up in someone's grandiose scheme today that you can promise the sky before you realize what happened. Set your goals high enough to motivate yourself, but not so high that you end up discouraged. It's better to build a strong foundation than a hastily constructed tower."
aquarius,2013-07-25,"You are on a personal mission and have specific tasks to complete today. Woe to anyone who gets in your way as you try to complete your appointed rounds. It's a special gift to have the inner drive needed to do the work, even though there may be little recognition now for a job well done. It's okay ... you really don't need any peer acknowledgment to feel good about yourself. Nevertheless, continue on your path without worrying about everyone else. Ultimately, your work will speak for itself."
pisces,2013-07-25,"Quite a lot of change is being packed into a short amount of time these days. Yesterday, you weren't sure about a relationship. Today, you are raring to go and there is no holding you back. If you are already involved with someone special, you can enjoy the day as you combine your romantic optimism with a practical approach to make things last. Or if there's a new person catching your eye, you could be ready to make your move. In any event, your spontaneity might set you on a new and exciting course."
aries,2013-07-26,"Your most elusive dreams have a chance now to come true. The current cosmic connection presents an interesting opportunity, although it may not be quite as wonderful as it sounds. Sure, the realization of your fantasies can be exhilarating, but sometimes our visions aren't the same once they've fallen from the blurry clouds of illusion into the real world. Be careful what you want; you might have to live with it."
taurus,2013-07-26,"You could fall head-over-heels in love with your own shadow today and not even realize that it's attached to you. Your temporary dreamy state prevents you from seeing the truth as it exists separate from your own desires. The fuzziness between fact and fiction may muck up your love life if you build a relationship on the shifting sands of your own illusions. Fortunately, your current visions can also be put to creative use, inspiring those you work with to reach their goals too."
gemini,2013-07-26,"It may seem as if all is well on the home front. However, there could be a problem now stemming from confusion over relationship dynamics. Keep your eyes and ears open because even the simplest misunderstanding can take you on a wild goose chase today. Nevertheless, you have tools at your disposal to help you navigate through the interpersonal complexities. Use your imagination to explore the various strategies available to you, and then rely on logic to pick the right one."
cancer,2013-07-26,"You must choose your words very carefully today because people filter your ideas through their own hopes and dreams. Ironically, you might be misled by your own overactive imagination. Fortunately, your creative juices are flowing and your next great adventure seems to be right around the corner. However, there's still a potential for miscommunication so think about your message before you speak. Then say exactly what you mean and nothing more."
leo,2013-07-26,"Although you might be sure of yourself much of the time, you're not feeling so confident now. It's challenging to remain clear about your intentions when the world seems enchanted. Colors seem brighter than usual, making it difficult to trust your senses. Even if everything is appears awesome, you're uncomfortable in this all-too-perfect world. However, retreating into your own dream world will only bring temporary reprieve. Let go of your fears and come out to play; you'll never know what you can create unless you try."
virgo,2013-07-26,"No matter how sharp your senses are tuned and how precise your analytical skills may be, reality isn't what you think. You are living in a bubble of fantasies today and your perceptions are shaded by your own internal processes making it nearly impossible to separate the objective from the subjective. When fact and fiction become intertwined, life can get complicated. Nevertheless, minimizing any drama allows you to have enough time to explore your dreams and choose one of them to pursue."
libra,2013-07-26,"Your current optimism keeps slipping out of your grasp like a greased watermelon. One moment, you're absolutely sure your goals are within reach. The next moment they disappear, as if reality was simply a trick of light reflecting your ideal fantasies. However, you quickly tire of feeling like you are in a fun house where reality is mirrored in ways to fool you into wrong conclusions. Thankfully, everything may fall into place at the very last minute as long as you don't assume you know what is real."
scorpio,2013-07-26,"You may sink into a funk if a romantic bubble suddenly fizzles. Or, fairy tales can come true if you spontaneously fall in love with someone. Whichever reaction you have to this surreal planetary transit, you need to be vigilant. Things aren't as bad as they may seem. But then again, they're probably not as good, either. What you see now is not what you get. Thankfully, replacing your premature conclusions with a dose of flexibility offers you the chance to create a social life that leads to emotional contentment."
sagittarius,2013-07-26,"You may be tied up in a dilemma between your innermost needs and the demands of the outer world. Home and family dynamics pull one way while your career goals pull the other. The professional aspects of your life seem to be at odds now with the personal ones. Even when you try to explain yourself, the words just don't express your intentions clearly. Happily, you don't need to find an answer today. Instead, use this time to dream about what you really want; your wish can come true."
capricorn,2013-07-26,"Your life can seem pretty intense today as you feel the rug pulled out from under you. But you are in a fight-back mood and you're not going to idly stand by as reality slips from your grip. The problem is that you can't win this one by using calculated logic. It's going to take imagination and finesse. Step back from any entanglements and pretend that you are a spiritual master. Once you have visualized a higher path, you'll know exact what to do next."
aquarius,2013-07-26,"Your romantic attraction to someone special may stir up a bit of trouble today. You can still get lost in your own fantasies even if you don't act on them. This isn't a bad thing, unless you try to resist the temptation to escape into the mists of your own dreamland. Granted, you like it better when you can see the ground beneath your feet. However, being inspired now is more useful than feeling secure, so make the most of this little vacation from the pressures of the real world."
pisces,2013-07-26,"You may think you know what you want and how you are going to get it, but this certainty isn't what you are projecting now. Others are currently experiencing a softer and gentler side of you. Perhaps they are even seeing some of your own hidden insecurity coming through the cracks in the walls of your personality. Vulnerability can be the source of power and not a weakness. Sharing your unfulfilled dreams sets the stage for an intimate discussion that deepens a relationship with someone you love."
aries,2013-07-27,"Irrepressible emotions are popping up all over the place now. If things seem overly intense and blown out of proportion, it is crucial to create healthy expressions for your excess energy. You crave the adrenaline rush today -- even more than usual. However, it's smarter to focus on your long-term strategies rather than immediate gratification. You must stay in the game to win, so concentrate on endurance rather than succumbing to the excitement of the moment."
taurus,2013-07-27,"You may be struggling to meet your responsibilities at home, but fortunately there are rewards for your hard work just around the corner. You might become more compulsive in your behavior because you know what you want and are prepared to go out and get it. Before you rush off, make certain that your desires are in line with what you actually need. Everything will fall into place on its own if you conserve your energy by cutting back on your expectations before you run into trouble."
gemini,2013-07-27,"You're ready to swing into action today since you think you can take on whatever or whoever is in your way, no matter what the cost. Keep in mind that the obstacles you face are actually a reality check to test your emotional strength. It's admirable to fight for your beliefs, but choose your battles very carefully. Save a little extra energy for when you need it, since you are inclined to confrontation now. However, a heart-to-heart conversation might be all that's required to clear the air."
cancer,2013-07-27,"Unexpressed hurt may be transformed into anger, which in turn could grow into resentment. You might not want to agitate the feelings of someone close to you, but you need to express exactly what's bothering you today. If you avoid the awkward issues now, you will only have to face bigger ones in the future. Be kind and gentle in your disclosure, but also be sincere when sharing your heart."
leo,2013-07-27,"Your fears can stand in the way of your current success if you don't bring them out into the open. You're driving hard these days for the recognition you deserve, but you may not be acknowledged if your efforts get lost in the larger picture. Try not to unnecessarily stir the pot just to attract attention. If you do, your actions might just have the opposite effect of what you actually want. Ultimately, being a team player allows others to love you even more."
virgo,2013-07-27,"You may fly so high now that you annoy someone who feels the need to bring you down a notch. Be careful because there are deep psychological energies at work. The most critical consideration is to remain ethical at all times. If you consistently choose the high road, things should eventually work out in your favor. You cannot control how others will respond to you so there's no reason to waste time worrying about it."
libra,2013-07-27,"There's a part of you that dislikes confrontation so much that you might do nearly anything to avoid it, and this is why you can be so effective in negotiation. Now, however, you could be engaged in a struggle that requires unleashing your emotions -- and it may not be all that pretty. Don't stress too much about a power play unfolding around you today. Bringing hidden feelings out into the open offers everyone the opportunity for a fresh start."
scorpio,2013-07-27,"Intensity is your friend today -- whether you want it in your life or not. You may wish that you could lighten up and take things less seriously, but your emotions are what they are. Whatever drama is developing now, you will only be adding energy to the chaos if you respond out of fear, Luckily, you don't have to feed the negativity; take care of protecting your interests without needlessly spreading any ill will. The power of love is stronger than anything else."
sagittarius,2013-07-27,"There may be unpleasant tension as your motives clash with someone else's plans today. It feels as if there's no immediate solution at hand and you might believe that your only option is to solve the situation in a boxing ring. But succumbing to aggressive behavior is not a viable course of action. Even if you cannot come to terms with what's currently happening, avoid all temptations to escalate the antagonism. It's your choice; find a way to honor the current diversity or just walk away."
capricorn,2013-07-27,"You're obsessed with getting things accomplished today and anyone who stands in your way is courting trouble. The problem is that the Sun's square to obstinate Saturn means there may be people in your path who are not easily moved. Instead of responding with brute force, take time to uncover the source of the resistance. Make a commitment to handle the underlying issues after the weekend once the intensity dissipates."
aquarius,2013-07-27,"You have been channeling energy into personal issues, but now new waves of problems may surface if you haven't taken the feelings of others into your consideration. Passions are running stronger than you might prefer. You wish that you could diffuse the emotions, but you really need to face them directly. Sticking to your convictions isn't optional today; it's required. Thankfully, remaining true to your core values allows your confidence to return in full force."
pisces,2013-07-27,"It's time to uncover the source of the stress that is currently fueling your outbursts, especially if you have been more feisty than usual. It may seem as if you are being blocked from expressing yourself creatively now. But instead of withholding your emotions until you suddenly lose your temper, share your concerns with someone you trust. Stating your truth without blaming anyone else helps to alleviate the pressure and gives everyone more options in the present moment."
aries,2013-07-28,"You may feel pretty good about what you are doing today, but something still bothers you, as if there was a lump in your throat. It's not that you are in denial; it's just that you have intriguing opportunities now that override your sense of insecurity or lack of fulfillment. Your heart's desires are valid, but maybe not today. Give the current circumstances a chance to grow so you can integrate the positive developments into your life and discover what you really want."
taurus,2013-07-28,"Recharge your spiritual batteries today while you still have the chance. You could benefit by escaping the crowds and finding a secluded spot in the outside world or a safe place in the caverns of your mind. Ultimately, the location doesn't matter as long as you can just hang out by yourself. There is serenity waiting for you, but not until you've eliminated the current noise and have found peace and quiet."
gemini,2013-07-28,"Expressing your desires boosts your self-esteem today, but it won't help you feel better if you expect someone else to bail you out. Writing in a journal is a healthy way to explore the various paths leading to your future. Feel the gentle winds of change blowing through your life now. However, it's not about upheaval; it's about making a long-term plan and taking responsibility for improving your life."
cancer,2013-07-28,"You may have recently hit a rough patch, but it won't slow you down for long. A serious reassessment of your current direction may be overwhelming, but questioning your assumptions is useful if you don't beat yourself up for things you could have done. Self-analysis is healthy; wallowing in doubt, however, is a complete waste of your energy. The opportunity for personal growth is knocking at your door."
leo,2013-07-28,"You feel as if the world is responding to your big heart in a big way today and you are excited about the prospects. Naturally, you want to be brutally honest and share exactly what you're feeling. However, you can overdo it and come on stronger than you should. Your misplaced enthusiasm doesn't necessarily make your life easier now, but thankfully, your good intentions seem to overpower most problems before they even happen."
virgo,2013-07-28,"There's likely a power struggle going on close to home, even if you're eager to work around it. However, you can minimize the stress by simply being sensitive to everyone's feelings. Your best strategy is to concentrate on the small things, but not at the expense of the principles at stake. Ultimately, your compassion enables you to avoid a major battle and still end up on top."
libra,2013-07-28,"You are drawn in by a deep sense of spirituality today, whether or not you attend a formal religious gathering. Even if you choose to avoid crowds now, you can benefit from spending quality time with friends and family. In fact, you could gain a healthy perspective from someone you trust. Your current openness to personal growth might just pay off in ways you don't expect."
scorpio,2013-07-28,"Power is a double-edged sword and you must be careful how you wield it. Unfortunately, you could accidentally hurt someone -- even yourself. You're familiar with playing for keeps, but circumstances can cast a soft and easy glow over the day that distracts you from the real nitty-gritty of what's happening. Significant issues are continuing to bubble into awareness; consider all new information at your disposal before you act."
sagittarius,2013-07-28,"Today may really be your lucky day and you don't have to do much in order to have things go your way. Sweet Venus is harmonizing with your key planet Jupiter, making a difficult situation easier to handle or a good situation even better. But don't get greedy or the balance of pleasure will tilt away from you. Graciously accept the gifts that are now being offered to you without hesitation so you can pass along the good vibes. Demonstrate your gratitude through conscious acts of appreciation."
capricorn,2013-07-28,"You want to take the day seriously -- and perhaps you do -- but lots of intriguing diversions are pulling at you from every direction. Instead of exhausting yourself by trying to resist the distractions, relax and enjoy yourself for a while. Thankfully, even a hard-working Capricorn is entitled to take some time off. You don't have to justify anything by showing anyone how productive you can be. Today is your chance to follow your whims wherever they lead.."
aquarius,2013-07-28,"Go out to lunch with your coworkers or have some friends over later in the evening to relax. You'll derive great pleasure now from interacting with others, especially if it involves pleasing the senses and stretching the intellect. Fortunately, you can do both as long as you don't overdo either. Moderation is your key to satisfaction."
pisces,2013-07-28,"The mists begin to lift today and you can actually see the distant horizon again. Try to contain your excitement, even if you currently feel lucky and believe that your heart is about to soar. You truly are a reflection of the sky. You're clear about who you are and what you cherish. Enjoy this moment of spiritual illumination because it's times like this that make life worthwhile."
aries,2013-07-29,"Let your love light shine since your current strength is not your ability to overpower an adversary, but rather your willingness to respect him or her in spite of your differences. Even if you feel combative, it makes no sense to fight fire with fire. Meet your opposition with sincere appreciation and charm, not angry words or threatening actions. Love more; fear less."
taurus,2013-07-29,"It's no fun to encounter obstacles in your path, but the Moon's return to your determined sign gives you an extra dose of courage today. Recognizing that you're the source of the resistance you now face empowers you to improve your fortune. Instead of worrying about why you can't find satisfaction, take a chance by showing others how much you care. A small heartfelt gesture may be all that's needed to tilt someone's affections your way."
gemini,2013-07-29,"You might have overbooked your day with too many things to do. It sounded like a great idea when you first committed to such a busy schedule, but you may feel like slowing down as the day progresses. Ultimately, the amount of items you cross off your checklist today won't impact your life in the long run. Instead of worrying about what you didn't do, concentrate on being present in the here and now. Others will understand if you need to shuffle your priorities as long as you keep them informed of the changes."
cancer,2013-07-29,"Sometimes it's difficult to stand in the spotlight and be seen for what you bring to the party. Since you don't often toot your own horn, it may feel extremely empowering to do it now. Don't be afraid of letting everyone know about your skillful expertise. However, the best way to inform them is not with words; it's through direct action. It's time to proudly walk your talk and receive the recognition you deserve."
leo,2013-07-29,"You may want to take the day off even if you didn't exert yourself that much over the weekend. You might feel like you've overextended your limits, leading you to think you have to clean up an interpersonal mess that you inadvertently created. Just remember that your intentions are most powerful when you aren't in denial. There's no need to create a convoluted story to justify your recent behavior. Being honest with others starts with first acknowledging the facts."
virgo,2013-07-29,"There's magic in the air, filling your day with spiritual creativity. However, you may run into a wall today that requires you to stop and reassess your direction. Reaching your destination isn't as simple as it might seem. You must be a co-creator in your own magic. Block out some time to meditate, listen to music or take a walk. But keep in mind that your mental process is what's most important while you are doing these activities. Luckily, if you can visualize it now, then you can make it happen."
libra,2013-07-29,"You are feeling more practical now that the Moon is back in pragmatic Capricorn. You've had your fling -- real or imagined; now it's time to get back to work and move your career objectives ahead again. But this isn't about giving up your heart's desire because your needs are too strong to deny. You could end up being self-indulgent if you only feed your senses. However, converting your passions into acts of artistic and romantic creation is a better way to use the energy. Don't be satisfied with anything less than awesome today."
scorpio,2013-07-29,"It's all about relationships now, but your interests aren't limited to romantic involvements. There is a desire on your part to spend time with a companion who is willing to  help untangle the threads of your sometimes all-too-complex life. Your current need for simplification reveals how far away you are from living the uncomplicated life you desire. Nevertheless, with a little help from a loyal friend you can create a workable plan to get back to basics. Confiding in someone you trust makes all the difference in the world."
sagittarius,2013-07-29,"It may seem like the party's over today, but you're not done having your blast of summertime fun. It's just that your previous path has come to an end as the energy is playing itself out. Everything feels as if it's winding down now. But maybe this is more of a necessary intermission than the end of the show. Catch up on your responsibilities so you're ready for the next act when it begins."
capricorn,2013-07-29,"Very real steps can be taken toward relaxation and romance today, but you must keep your wits about you if you want to be successful. Don't worry; you're not about to be swept off your feet by love. There's very little chance that you will forget your earthly commitments even if you go chasing rainbows now. Consider what you need to be happy and then move with determination toward making your dreams come true."
aquarius,2013-07-29,"You may attempt to dance your way around an important issue today, but, ultimately, you must face the question of timing, sooner or later. Sooner is better. Even though you prefer relying on cool logic over irrational emotions, trust your gut instincts instead. Don't waste valuable energy justifying what you want to do. You know what you need. Turn off the words and open up your heart."
pisces,2013-07-29,"Keep the entire forest within your vision now, even if you're overly attached to one particular tree. Try not to make a fuss over the circumstances that are attracting you to the most special thing in your world. The woods are full of all kinds, shapes and sizes of trees, shrubs and grasses. Naturally, you can't touch every one of them, but you can employ your imagination to explore the incredible variety. Your life is a spectrum of possibilities waiting to be discovered."
aries,2013-07-30,"You are willing to do whatever is necessary to move on to your next phase at work, but you might prefer to stay with one experience a little while longer. Nevertheless, an entirely new path is cleared before you, even if you like the idea of settling somewhere without the bright lights and noisy distractions. Although you may be uncharacteristically hesitant now, pushing through your fears and into the shadowy unknown can bring you job satisfaction and maybe even an unexpected romantic surprise."
taurus,2013-07-30,"You have a yearning for something more in your life and your unflappable persistence might just be your secret weapon that ultimately brings you the goodies you seek. However, you must remember there is a fine line between patience and stubbornness. If you put too much pressure on someone today, you may inadvertently stir up a hornets' nest instead of building the love nest you desire. Fortunately, putting your attention on the practical details of a relationship could lead to deep satisfaction."
gemini,2013-07-30,"Your smoothest path to manifesting a love interest is blazed by using your innate wit and charm. But don't attempt to evade your feelings now; instead, put others at ease so they are more comfortable with the profound emotions that you want to express. This strategy might turn into a tricky balancing act because you can lose the potential impact of the moment if your approach is too casual. Start out playfully but be serious enough to be heard when you speak from your heart."
cancer,2013-07-30,"You're able to successfully pull off a power play at work today that earns you new respect in the process. Just be careful that you don't push your luck too far, or you might arouse resentment from others. If you threaten someone's security, they may resist your plans, requiring you to waste valuable resources to hold your ground. Try sharing control early in the game to enlist loyal allies instead of setting them up as potential enemies. Cooperation achieves better results now than competition."
leo,2013-07-30,"A little caution goes a long way today, since innocent flirting might be mistaken for serious commitment. Don't send out the love vibe now unless you're willing to put your heart into your romantic overtures. Thankfully, revitalizing a long-term relationship is just as easy as starting a new one. Just remember, you may not be able to back out once the feelings get hot; it can be all fun and games until someone gets hurt."
virgo,2013-07-30,"Although unspoken words generate emotional intensity in ways you might rather avoid, the outcome could be much more fruitful than you expect. Control issues may surface as power struggles today, especially if an unpleasant memory is activated by current circumstances. Keep in mind that your innate fears could be more problematic now than the actual events at hand. Be authentic and express what's in your heart, and hopefully your example will have a positive ripple effect."
libra,2013-07-30,"Relationships take top priority today, and thankfully, they can bring emotional rewards beyond your wildest expectations. Even an interaction with a coworker may lead to surprising fulfillment. Still, desire is not enough; the good times won't arrive on their own. You have some serious ground to cover now, so be courageous and share your feelings to start the ball rolling in the right direction."
scorpio,2013-07-30,"Your key planet, Pluto, receives a sweet gift from sensual Venus today, offering you a full spectrum of pleasurable sensations. You are more likely to take a risk in love now without trying to control the outcome. Expressing the feelings in your heart can be scary, but well worth the risk if you're willing to go for an emotional ride. Nothing ventured; nothing gained."
sagittarius,2013-07-30,"You may experience wonderful blessings showering upon you now. Thankfully, you have the ability to channel your affections into a more meaningful place without coming on too strong. Nevertheless, these are serious times and you would be wise to take your intuitive hunches to heart. Rest assured that taking decisive action today can begin to resolve the emotional tensions of the past weeks. Love is all around you if you're willing to take a leap of faith."
capricorn,2013-07-30,"Your current dilemma stems from your strong desires now, yet you may be rather reluctant to share them at this time. Unfortunately, your stubborn resistance to expressing your needs could make you appear less interested in connecting with others. But if you simply approach all interactions with an open heart and an open mind, you can be available to someone special without having to risk destabilizing your comfortable situation."
aquarius,2013-07-30,"You may be quite happy with a friendship just the way it is, but the current opportunity to take your feelings to a deeper place is intriguing, nonetheless. Even if you are clear about your emotional limits, letting others know what's going on for you now doesn't have to be a showstopper. Bringing honesty to the table creates the potential for mutual respect, which ultimately can strengthen the bond between you and someone special."
pisces,2013-07-30,"Your desire to get to know someone better today could turn into an awkward obsession, whether or not you actually express your feelings. Oddly, your current attraction may be triggered by a particular mannerism, characteristic or expression. Be careful; it's challenging to distinguish the present situation from a pleasant memory. Give yourself a few days to see if your emotions develop before going out on a limb and setting a whole array of events into motion."
aries,2013-07-31,"You are walking on eggshells today, hoping to avoid provocation. Your key planet Mars is stressing unpredictable Uranus, so be prepared for sudden breakage. Paradoxically, you may try to anticipate the unexpected, but it's impossible to know exactly when and where the tension might suddenly be released. No matter how restless you feel, there's no reason to change everything all at once. Nevertheless, creating a proactive strategy is better than doing nothing at all."
taurus,2013-07-31,"You Bulls can be the champions of maintaining the status quo. The last thing on your mind is change, especially when something is working. You don't want to fix anything until it breaks, and when you do take action, you like to start slowly. However, the heavens are rattling your cage today to see how aware you are of any improvements that are overdue. Listen to constructive criticism but don't let others bring you down. Be smart and take personal responsibility to break free of habits that no longer serve a purpose."
gemini,2013-07-31,"You may think you're in a rut and might want to create some fireworks just for the sake of a little excitement. However, more is happening than meets the eye; something is percolating deep within your own subconscious. Or, perhaps, someone is hiding their personal agenda from you. Either way, the buried tension is now ready to surface and the quicker you acknowledge the problem, the easier you can deal with it. Ultimately, this is an opportunity to be more independent, so strike while the iron is hot."
cancer,2013-07-31,"Obviously, it's wise to listen to your own feelings, but you are currently driving under the influence of wild and crazy Uranus. Your emotions aren't as containable as usual. It may be fun to get close to a weird situation that isn't even yours -- until you are entangled and can't break lose. It might even feel like a monkey wrench is suddenly being thrown into the works. Regroup and quickly shift gears to respond to the new conditions so you can reach your goals in record time."
leo,2013-07-31,"Your life may be smoothly coasting along, but unexpected challenges today can test your resolve. It's crucial to remain open to the feedback that you receive from the current circumstances. Be ready to quickly change direction if your plans begin to unravel. But it could be too soon to head off toward your new destination. Even if you think you're ready to go, don't hit your gas pedal until you have looked back just one more time to appreciate where you have been."
virgo,2013-07-31,"Your current restlessness pushes you right to the edge of change. The big picture has captured your imagination for a while now, regardless of how much you usually like to stick with the details. However, you must make smaller adjustments today, especially wherever you feel stifled or held back. But you may have to step outside of the logical realms, for it's possible to be analytically correct while still missing what's really important. Don't settle on the status quo if you can visualize something more closely aligned with your dreams."
libra,2013-07-31,"Just when everything seems to be falling into place, someone at work might throw you a curve ball. You may be challenged by their unpredictable actions today, but you still need to deal with the consequences the best you can. Nevertheless, avoid getting hooked into complex situations that go beyond your immediate concern. Don't take responsibility for other people's behavior. Calmly address what is within your control in the present moment; once you have reestablished your balance, you can confidently move on."
scorpio,2013-07-31,"It's nearly impossible to predict how the events of the day will play out today, even if you have your own agenda set in stone. Nevertheless, keep your eye focused on the ball at all times so you can participate in the game to the best of your ability. Don't be distracted by the lightning on the horizon if it's not your storm to chase. On the other hand, being flexible is wise when change is in the air. Trust your instincts to tell you when to stay and when to go."
sagittarius,2013-07-31,"An interesting situation is developing in your life now and you don't know where the current circumstances might take you. Oddly, you may feel more grounded than many of your friends and associates these days, but there's a nervous feeling growing in the back of your mind. It's time to examine your unexpressed emotions and move some of them out into the open. Breathe deeply and reestablish your center. Your pent-up energy can actually propel you toward your goals once you channel it correctly."
capricorn,2013-07-31,"You have reached the end of your rope today and are no longer willing to put up with someone's broken promises or erratic energy. However, the metaphysical lightning is striking, and all of a sudden you can see the whole picture in an entirely different light. You realize that you're not going to change anyone's behavior but your own. Modify your priorities as necessary; if you don't take care of your needs now, you won't have anything left to give to someone else down the line."
aquarius,2013-07-31,"Warrior Mars provokes your high-strung planet Uranus today, turning your life inside out. Activities at work demand more of your attention now, yet also bring you more pleasure. However, your eclectic ways are more rigid than others realize. A sudden change to your daily schedule may be a major distraction as your desire for freedom clashes with the forces of your own private homeland security. Think fast and act accordingly so you can have your cake and eat it safely."
pisces,2013-07-31,"It's time to let go of a desire that you're still holding close, and you'll feel an amazing rush of independence once you do. However, you might have to logically defend your plan against an unexpected attack today. This confrontation is exacerbated because you think symbolically yet must communicate rationally. Intellectual analysis won't get you through this dilemma. Aim with your heart, instead."
aries,2013-08-01,"You may be so concerned with your shortcomings today that your self-doubt negatively impacts your ability to have fun. Surprisingly, you might not even be all that interested in joining the party now. Don't waste time worrying about anyone else's judgments. Just be as clear as possible about your boundaries when you tell your friends that you would rather stay home, catch up on your rest and recharge your batteries. Nurturing yourself first will enable you to feel more generous to others later on."
taurus,2013-08-01,"You have some important personal business to handle today, but you don't necessarily want everyone to know about it. Unfortunately, it's difficult to make enough time for yourself because you're probably busier than you prefer now, and you cannot change your schedule until you meet your obligations. Do the best to deliver what you promise, but don't be a casualty of your own blind optimism. Be realistic when discussing what you can and can't do, but remember to allocate resources for your needs, too."
gemini,2013-08-01,"It may feel like it's past time for things to settle down; nevertheless, it's too soon to breathe a sigh of relief because there are still rough waters to navigate today. Reshuffle your priorities to match your heart's wishes, and clearly communicate your needs to those around you now. If you don't at first succeed, make a few adjustments and try again. You might not receive the support you want right away, but your gentle persistence and consistent effort should pay off by next week."
cancer,2013-08-01,"It may seem that others know something about you that you thought was a secret, which might make you feel very vulnerable. Nevertheless, it's impossible to hide within your shell once you have already been seen. Come clean and share your truth with someone you trust. Thankfully, those who respect you won't be surprised by your story, even if you're a bit embarrassed. Ultimately, being honest will draw the ones you love even closer to you."
leo,2013-08-01,"A personal relationship may require a bit of repair work now, but unfortunately, knowing what went wrong is not the same as being able to fix it. Thankfully, your good intentions can go a long way today toward healing a rift. But don't be hard on yourself if you can't live up to your own grandiose expectations. You are a human, not a god. Focus on radiating love, without needing to know where it will take you."
virgo,2013-08-01,"You may spend a lot of time today modifying your goals and trying to figure out a way to create the life of your dreams. Even if you're growing tired of mentally living in the future, nostalgia isn't a healthy practice, either. Stop worrying about yesterday and planning for tomorrow; bring your attention back to the here-and-now. Your current happiness is dependent on staying in the present moment and appreciating all the wonder around you."
libra,2013-08-01,"Maintaining your objectivity can be challenging today while other people pull on your heartstrings and push your emotional buttons. Ironically, you think it's wise to avoid intimate interactions that could reveal your emotional vulnerability now. However, your feelings are not ruled by reason, so allow yourself to experience the pleasure and pain of irrational passion. Your extreme reactions will eventually moderate, leaving behind a memorable experience."
scorpio,2013-08-01,"The distant horizons are calling you now that several planets are visiting your 9th House of Faraway Places. However, your view of the future is quite different from what you expected because everything is so much clearer today. Nevertheless, this can be tricky territory to navigate, since it's not ultimately about anything tangible in your external world. You are the sole creator of your fantasies, and it's still up to you to figure out how to make them come true."
sagittarius,2013-08-01,"You may not be very comfortable these days with several planets in Cancer lingering in your emotionally complex 8th House of Intimacy. You might choose to escape by engaging in competitive sports, participating in exciting outdoor activities or simply heading out on an adventure to parts unknown. Nevertheless, you have a different kind of excitement waiting for you now if you choose to share your feelings with someone special. Don't let your fears prevent you from discovering the treasures of love."
capricorn,2013-08-01,"A friend may need your assistance today or, at least, that's how it appears on the surface. But you're hesitant to rescue an underdog unless you can clearly rationalize your actions. Although you are far from cold-hearted, your practicality might stand in the way of a kinder and gentler expression of love. Sometimes there are intangible rewards for helping others that are well worth your altruistic efforts. The person giving is often the one who ends up receiving the most."
aquarius,2013-08-01,It's challenging to feel at ease today because it seems as if someone with a big ego is blocking your desire to just be your authentic self. Your current wariness has nothing to do with paranoia; you simply prefer to avoid the unnecessary disappointment that you might experience if you lower your protective walls too fast. Don't do anything that increases your level of stress. Just follow wherever your heart leads you now without worrying about anyone else.
pisces,2013-08-01,"You might be able to temporarily set aside your responsibilities today, even if they continue to pile up in your absence. You know what others want without a word being said; your psychic powers are quite strong now and could get in the way of your attempts to fit in. Put your extraordinary abilities to work by helping someone who can benefit from your compassionate assistance. Paradoxically, you will get the best possible results if you're not overly attached to the outcome or the need to be correct."
aries,2013-08-02,"Sparks are flying today as romantic Venus harmonizes with sexy Mars. However, you might not have much time for pleasure because you can become so distracted by one little thing after another that you run around all day without accomplishing a lot. Be vigilant of your boundaries now. And remember that there's no need to get involved in every situation you encounter unless it really does concern you. Narrowing your focus creates extra time for some lighthearted fun and games."
taurus,2013-08-02,"You may be mentally hyperactive today without any way to organize your thoughts. However, you could actually enjoy the buzz as excitable Mars supports your key planet Venus. Communicating and connecting are on the top of your agenda. If you have writing to do or telephone calls to make, get busy while the cosmic energy is working in your favor. You might not feel as rested as you wish, but all your interactions can leave you with a satisfying feeling of accomplishment."
gemini,2013-08-02,"It's challenging to know what you want to do today now that the reflective Moon is back in your sign. You are riding waves of feelings that keep shifting; just as you begin to relax into a new flow, your mood changes again. Resist any temptations to justify your fleeting emotions. Consciously moving beyond words enables you to find comfort in the irrational realms of your heart."
cancer,2013-08-02,"It may be impossible to know what's really happening in a relationship now. You might believe you have all the facts, but you're probably still missing a piece of critical information. Meanwhile, your unsettled feelings and fluctuating needs distract you from enjoying what you already have. Making time for meditation and contemplation could be your most sensible short-term strategy until you figure out what your heart truly wants."
leo,2013-08-02,"There are important choices to be made today. You could make excellent progress in your personal life; however, you might blow it and get nowhere at all. How this current relationship dynamic plays out is dependent upon the amount of attention you give to the needs of others. You have the ability now to roll with the incoming emotional waves. Loosen control on those things that won't matter in the long run. Flexibility on your part is the key to maximizing your potential."
virgo,2013-08-02,"Your sharp thinking is now the source of recognition at work. Impetuous Mars enhances your current charm but you may lose efficiency today by acting before you think. Nevertheless, everyone wants to be on your side, even if you don't know which side you're actually on. Instead of depending on your analytical powers to set a course of action, just go with what's in your gut. Your current ability to be spontaneous is your secret ace in the hole."
libra,2013-08-02,"You are lifted on the wings of thought today and can soar into the upper reaches of the sky in your imagination. You may feel freer than you have felt in a long time. Fortunately, action-hero Mars is supporting your key planet Venus, empowering you to reach for your goals. Nevertheless, it pays to be careful. You can fly so high you lose perspective and forget your destination. Relying on your strength to create balance increases your chances for success."
scorpio,2013-08-02,"You have important things to do today, but too many social engagements can be so distracting that you don't get to sink into the juicier realms of hidden emotions. The emphasis is on the real world now, even though your preference is often for the inner realms. Although there is some dissatisfaction with this outer orientation, you're willing to put up with it in order to make connections that are advantageous to your long-term aspirations."
sagittarius,2013-08-02,"Relationship issues take center stage now that the flirty Gemini Moon occupies your 7th House of Companions. Luckily, interactions with others are running pretty smoothly, since you have an extra dose of charm working in your favor. Just don't overdo it or you'll pay the price later. It won't be the end of the world if you say too much or overstay your welcome, but you might embarrass yourself enough to make you think twice next time."
capricorn,2013-08-02,"A number of little irritating events might happen at work today but thankfully, none of them is likely to be significant. It's like having mosquitos follow you around so you can't lower your defenses all the way. You must pay attention to the annoying hums or you'll have to deal with the larger irritation of itchy bites. Your best strategy now is to focus your attention on circumstances as they unfold without trying to solve the larger issues."
aquarius,2013-08-02,"You're in a joyful mood today, even if you cannot explain why. However, your interactions are not without conflict, especially if you let irrational feelings interfere with a clearly defined relationship at work. Sparks can fly, but they may quickly shift the energy by relieving the tension. Even if you feel trapped, find a way to release your pent-up energy through some sort of physical activity. You'll feel even better if you let your inner child out to play."
pisces,2013-08-02,"You're a bit on edge today, but whatever discomfort you are experiencing isn't enough to push you into making a life-changing decision. You might get into an emotional tussle with a friend or lover who is overly critical of you. Or a memory of an old wound could provoke you to start an unnecessary conflict with someone else. Either way, it's helpful to blow off some steam prior to dealing with whatever is really bothering you. Being kind to others starts with being kind to yourself."
aries,2013-08-03,"Your inner warrior rises to the occasion now if you believe you must step in and defend a close friend or family member. Ironically, you may restrain yourself until the right moment comes along for you to express your feelings. Still, your response is rather tentative at first, but a slow start is fine as long as you increase the intensity without doing anything overly dramatic. Although you might not relax much today, avoiding extremes conserves your energy and maximizes your power."
taurus,2013-08-03,"You are determined to say what's on your mind now, but you may still be hesitant to speak up. You don't want to rush into any conversation where you could end up being on the wrong side of the debate. Wasting words is not your style and in fact, you might not be very verbose at all today. Nevertheless, communication will make or break your day, so choose the right words to have the desired impact. Ultimately, others will appreciate you  caring enough to make the first overture."
gemini,2013-08-03,"Naturally, you don't like falling short of your dreams, but it's all too easy now to use that as an excuse to lower your expectations. Ironically, your biggest problem is your current tendency to judge your work too harshly. Give yourself a break by suspending self-criticism for a day or two. Thankfully, it will be easier to make progress toward your goals once your confidence begins to return. In the meantime, make a list of your assets rather than focusing on your liabilities."
cancer,2013-08-03,"You would like to be taken more seriously now that the Moon is back in your contemplative sign. You know exactly what you are feeling today and you want others to know, too. Naturally, this means that you will have to tell them, for contrary to your belief they are not able to read your mind. Go ahead and speak your piece while remaining true to your heart. Even if it's challenging to get the conversational ball rolling, once started it will naturally gain momentum on its own."
leo,2013-08-03,"There's quite a lot you're not saying, but your silence may stem more from what you don't know now than anything you consciously withhold. This dynamic is unusual, for you are more often the type of person who makes it your business to know everything. But it's not your fault if something important is being hidden from you. Leave no stone un-turned as you search for the missing key to understanding the whole picture. But even if all the puzzle pieces don't fit yet, you can benefit from what you learn along the way."
virgo,2013-08-03,"Rest assured that current opportunities might lead you toward satisfaction if you're willing to take a chance. But nothing will happen overnight, even if your hopes are soaring. Instead of setting yourself up for potential disappointment by getting swept up in the excitement of the moment, make plans to reach your dreams at a more sensible pace. Slow and steady wins the race."
libra,2013-08-03,"You take your social obligations quite seriously now; however, you also want to make certain that you are doing the right thing. A current project might not be going as smoothly as you wish, requiring more time than you originally planned. Nevertheless, don't overreact by canceling all your other activities today. Finding the proper balance between indulging in fun and concentrating on unfinished business is tricky. Just remember, there's no need to go to extreme measures; moderation is key to your success."
scorpio,2013-08-03,"Trust your intuition, even if it runs counter to expectations today. The signals you are receiving from your body now can churn buried emotions until they float up into consciousness. It's important to acknowledge these feelings and treat them with the respect they deserve. Don't, however, make life-altering decisions based solely on them; instead, wait a few days until you have a better perspective on current events. Keep your mind open; time is on your side."
sagittarius,2013-08-03,"There may be no way to escape your deep and powerful feelings today. Intense passions seem to get in the way of the good times that you had imagined. Exploring the emotional issues can be fruitful, since you can't avoid them by entertaining yourself with temporary distractions. Thankfully, facing your fears could be the catalyst to help clear the deck of unnecessary negativity."
capricorn,2013-08-03,"You could run into a stone wall today that stops you in your tracks. You might attempt to climb over the obstacle, relying on the Mountain Goat's firm footing. Fortunately, this setback is not a life-changing event. Don't exhaust yourself trying to make something happen right now. Temporarily accepting the current limitations doesn't mean defeat. You will overcome these challenges, but possibly not for another few days. Readjust your game plan and get ready to try again."
aquarius,2013-08-03,"You're facing a dilemma that seems to be temporarily irresolvable, so don't judge yourself negatively if you can't find an answer yet. Beating yourself up is a waste of precious energy. For now, it may be wise to just walk away from the problem to give yourself a little more time to think. Wait until after Tuesday's New Moon before trying to come up with a viable solution."
pisces,2013-08-03,"Although the weekend is already in progress, you're still wondering when the fun will begin. Unfortunately, you may have responsibilities that still need your attention before you slip into a more relaxing groove. Of course, you must meet your obligations today, but remember that good times are not just about distractions. Reassess your priorities and set aside those chores that can wait. For now, a happier you is also a more productive you."
aries,2013-08-04,"Controlling your feelings sounds like a sensible idea today, but it won't likely be a successful strategy. Naturally, it isn't wise to express everything because some of your emotions are better kept to yourself. You could land in a pile of trouble if you broadcast your wants and needs to everyone before considering the ramifications of your actions. However, you may be able to stretch the envelope a little further than usual as long as you don't go too far."
taurus,2013-08-04,"Although you may have an opportunity to do something exciting today, you're still likely to be responsible and show some self-restraint. Thankfully, you should have enough information to make your move as long as it doesn't upset family dynamics at home. You are smarter because of your recent experiences, but the window of opportunity is closing. If you don't put your newly gathered intelligence to work quickly, you could lose the chance forever."
gemini,2013-08-04,"An unexpected twist to today's events can add to your concerns about your future, but there isn't much to worry about if you are flexible about your current plans. Even if it feels like you are at an impasse, the changes you have been dreaming about could occur now without much resistance. Don't waste time analyzing all your options; just take a leap of faith. Your life is on the upswing, even it isn't unfolding exactly as you imagined. Embrace the unknown."
cancer,2013-08-04,"You are feeling your oats now and are more courageous than usual because you're fascinated by the idea of being different. You aren't all that worried about what everyone else says these days so unsolicited advice won't have as much impact on your current choices. This is the chance you've been waiting for; go ahead and be the non-conformist that you secretly want to be, even if it's just for a day."
leo,2013-08-04,"Separating yourself from the pack is quite important today since the willful Sun in your sign harmonizes with eccentric Uranus. The same old routine is no longer appealing, prompting you to become more radical in your dreams. Be insistent about your new direction if you want to shake things up. Fortunately, if you share your plans with those you trust, you might be pleasantly surprised by their support. It's always good to have allies in your corner, even if you choose to travel this particular path alone."
virgo,2013-08-04,"You don't want to be overly reliant on anyone else because when things get serious, the other person might do a disappearing act. Ultimately, someone else's instability may be an acute reflection of your unwillingness to partake in an unhealthy relationship. Nevertheless, you really don't have to convince others to do your bidding now. Be the lightning instead of waiting to be struck by it."
libra,2013-08-04,"It's tough to stick to your schedule now, for unexpected changes make it nearly impossible to carry through with your original plans. Nevertheless, avoid getting agitated by the things you cannot control. Let a few of your less important regular routines slip for a day or two. Once the cycle is broken, you should be able to put the pieces back together in a more constructive manner."
scorpio,2013-08-04,"Change is in the air today, so stop trying to manage your life according to old rules and by following a preset agenda. It's possible that your plans may even fall apart because of your own whimsical moods. Nevertheless, putting together a playbook for the day is a wise strategy. Instead of only focusing on what you want, figure out a way to do what's best for all. Your innovative action now can improve the current circumstances more than you think."
sagittarius,2013-08-04,"Life is complicated now because there's a wide gulf between your need for emotional security and your desire for a new adventure. Your plans are being intensified by an anything-goes trine from irreverent Uranus to the Sun in your 9th House of Big Ideas. But don't be so overconfident that you take a foolish chance on something that's not important. Being creative is great, but not when you jeopardize the positive gains you recently made. Reach for the stars but keep your feet on the ground."
capricorn,2013-08-04,"You may receive a cosmic wake-up call today that reminds you to include others in your latest scheme as shocking Uranus jolts the security-oriented Cancer Moon in your 7th House of Partners. Thankfully, swinging into action is easy because you don't have as many restraints operating in your life now. Go ahead and share your ideas, even if they aren't yet ready for prime time. Someone who respects you will see the potential in your plan and will likely jump in to support your endeavors."
aquarius,2013-08-04,"You are adept at taking an innovative concept further than ever -- and, somehow you can get away with the craziest of ideas. Although friends and family might urge you to put your thoughts into action, they may want you to modify some of the details. However, accommodating someone else's concerns could actually weaken your plan. Ironically, the harder you work, the more distant your goals seem. But giving up would be a big mistake. Retreat just enough to alleviate the tension, take a few deep breaths and try again."
pisces,2013-08-04,"Today's energetic buzz may feel extremely exciting; your life is alive with surprises, yet you might not be so amused with all the uncertainty. You have had your share of unexpected twists and turns, and you're not looking for any more at this time. Fortunately, your natural resiliency should enable you to make the best of nearly any difficult situation. Be bold in your thinking and cautious in your execution."
aries,2013-08-05,"You may feel panicky this morning if it seems like you missed your chance to express your feelings. You could even be singing the hesitation blues since you can't move forward now, yet you're not satisfied with any retreat scenario. However, your impulses might just be on a time delay today. Don't worry if you can't get enough traction to start something new; heading off in a different direction will likely have to wait until later when the Moon enters lively Leo. In the meantime, practice patience; your ultimate satisfaction will be worth the wait."
taurus,2013-08-05,"You have quite a bit to say about what's happening in your immediate environment, but you can't just blurt out your thoughts because of your hypersensitivity to those around you. However, you're not willing to compromise your ideas by sacrificing your position through negotiation. Although you prefer sticking to your plan and wearing down the opposition with your determination, a stubborn approach could backfire on you today. Ironically, you can come out ahead by adopting a flexible attitude."
gemini,2013-08-05,"Your key planet Mercury is in the spotlight today, creating mischief through a bait-and-switch trick. You think you're agreeing to one thing only to discover that you promised something else. Pay extra careful attention to all interactions now or you could end up in trouble. Rash decisions are certainly not a good idea. Contemplation helps you process your feelings so they don't get in the way of making healthy choices."
cancer,2013-08-05,"Your mind is abuzz with thoughtful Mercury traveling through your sign until August 8. Although your emotions are quite strong, you won't necessarily be very talkative. In fact, you may find it harder today to express yourself in words as you your feelings get lost in the translation. Don't worry about explaining your internal process. Instead, observe your reactions but keep them to yourself for now."
leo,2013-08-05,"You're roaring with anticipation this morning, as if you were on the edge of something wonderful. However, you intuitively recognize that you can't just push your way into whatever is next. Instead, prepare yourself by putting your house in order. Fastidious mental housekeeping now helps to ensure your success over the days following tomorrow's Leo New Moon. Channel your enthusiasm into tying up as many loose ends as possible so you're ready to go."
virgo,2013-08-05,"Your imagination might get the best of you today, especially if you don't take the time to check out the validity of your feelings. Asking for feedback from your friends is a good place to start, but they may not be forthcoming with their responses. Be patient and give them the room to tell you what's on their minds. You can learn as much from what they don't say now as from what they do. Nevertheless, there's no need to worry about things that will never happen."
libra,2013-08-05,"Your key planet Venus is entangled in a bit of strangeness today, drawing you close to the edges of reality. Fortunately, you have support from helpful colleagues and powerful business allies. You are appreciated by others now more than you may realize. Even if your friends rush to your rescue, they might forget to take the time to tell you how much they care about you. Don't fish for compliments or validation, or you could push away the very thing you are seeking."
scorpio,2013-08-05,"Your mental antennae are fully extended now and you can pick up signals that originate from a parallel universe. A special evening allows you to see into your future, even if you aren't sure how you'll get there. Meticulous planning comes naturally to you these days. Singularly focus on what's important to you, for this can assure your success in most anything you initiate."
sagittarius,2013-08-05,"An uncharacteristic hesitancy may come over you today, preventing you from sharing what's in your heart. This is especially true if you are also feeling insecure about your most intimate relationships. You aren't as willing to risk rejection now, so you might quickly swallow your words before they leave your mouth. Don't judge yourself harshly for holding back. Trust your instincts; you'll know when it's time to say what needs to be said."
capricorn,2013-08-05,"It feels as if someone in your life is holding out on you. There are significant things to be discussed, but you can't seem to get others to open up. Even if you can sense the frustration of your friends and associates, you might not have a lot of sympathy for them today. You want more facts; you need to know the truth and you don't want to guess any longer. There's no point in hitting your head against the wall. Allowing a few more days before you push for what you want improves your chances for success."
aquarius,2013-08-05,"The Sun and the Moon activate your 7th House of Relationships now, but it's still challenging to clearly see what's going on. You might feel a bit disjointed emotionally, for it's tricky to know the best way to proceed when you cannot decide upon your destination. The truth is there's no reason to be in a hurry at all. Take your time and let the situation unfold before you commit yourself to any one direction. In the meantime, gather more information and listen to the constructive advice you receive from others."
pisces,2013-08-05,"You might feel a bit confused today from all the mixed planetary messages. On one hand, it seems as if your window of opportunity is rapidly closing. A domestic cycle is reaching its conclusion whether you are ready for this transformation or not. On the other hand, your anticipation of the potential creativity and love in your future tickles your imagination now. Stay with the paradox. Forcing a premature solution will only stop the magic in it tracks."
aries,2013-08-06,"Your spontaneity is on the loose and your love life may be on the upswing with today's affectionate Leo New Moon falling in your 5th House of Romance. Things are cooking and all you have to do is stir the stew. But beware, for there are fears brewing in your own subconscious that can prevent you from enjoying the goodies that seem so close. Focus on the positive while rationally considering the alternatives."
taurus,2013-08-06,"It may be time to plan a party at home or head out on the town with close friends or family. Today's Leo New Moon lands in your 4th House of Domestic Conditions, but it isn't all about taking care of chores or responsibilities. This lunation is simply about experiencing pleasure with those you love the most. Although the fun and games don't have to happen today, at least start planning now so you can fully enjoy yourself during the days ahead."
gemini,2013-08-06,"It's a magical day when you believe that you can talk anyone into seeing things your way now that the demonstrative Leo New Moon activates your 3rd House of Communication. You're quite optimistic that you can get your message across, but your interactions may be clouded with confusion anyway. Don't be overly concerned with other people's reactions to your point of view. Decide what's most important for you, but there's no need to push too hard to bring an idea to fruition today. Go with the flow and trust the process."
cancer,2013-08-06,"Sometimes your peers don't appreciate your competence because you're so adept at supporting others. Thankfully, you can proudly strut your stuff without being too dramatic today. It feels natural to be in the spotlight now while the Leo New Moon resides in your 2nd House of Self-Worth. Don't shy away from the recognition you deserve when others appreciate the special magic you bring to the party."
leo,2013-08-06,"Although you may be starting a new and exciting project now, building momentum still could take some time. This New Moon in your expressive sign inspires you to share your plans, which is the first step on your new journey. But don't pretend to have all the angles covered; there are still plenty of details to be ironed out. Maintaining your enthusiasm is the key to your success, so explore ways to sustain your energy without cooling down the heat of your passion."
virgo,2013-08-06,"Although many people take a break for the summer, this may be a very busy time of year for you. Today's Leo New Moon in your 12th House of Privacy suggests there's lots happening that's invisible to others -- so much that it makes you a bit anxious now. Avoid getting into conflicts with anyone for petty reasons. You can't afford to waste energy if you want to finish everything you start. Choose your battles carefully; save your fire for the things that really matter."
libra,2013-08-06,"Your social calendar seems to be more important than anything else now that the outgoing Leo New Moon highlights your 11th House of Friends and Wishes, but your signals might be getting crossed. It's challenging to tell if your desires are grounded in reality or if they are just a product of your own fantasies. Nevertheless, it's not a good idea to isolate yourself. Even if you are unsure of your motives, let loose and have an enjoyable time."
scorpio,2013-08-06,"You are receiving an energetic boost to your career today from the lively Leo New Moon in your 10th House of Public Life. Nevertheless, your job -- what you do to put bread on your table -- may remain unaltered. This New Moon impacts your place in the outer world. Although you might wish that you had more privacy, your responsibilities draw the spotlight toward you now. However, there's no need to make any immediate changes as long as you spend some time reassessing your long-term goals."
sagittarius,2013-08-06,"You are suddenly riding wild waves of optimism now as you look to your future. But even as you're feeling your Sagittarian oats with today's Leo New Moon in your 9th House of Big Ideas, you may also be hiding something that you don't want others to know. A seed of self-doubt could sour your plans, especially if others catch wind of it. Be discreet; keep your concerns to yourself for a while longer. Stay cool; it might take a couple of weeks to see how your ideas actually develop in the real world."
capricorn,2013-08-06,"You like being in complete control of your life and the director of your destiny, but there are people who may hold some of the keys to your success. The Leo New Moon points to your 8th House of Shared Resources, indicating that you're better off working with someone else now. What makes the current situation tricky is that others might needlessly flaunt their power. Don't waste any energy fighting a display of insecurity. Instead, spend your time negotiating solid agreements to ensure success down the road."
aquarius,2013-08-06,"The Leo New Moon in your 7th House of Companions suggests you might be feeling pressure to perform in a certain way today. A lover, spouse or partner is acting exceptionally nice, but you are certain that there is more going on than meets your eye. However, it's unlikely that anyone is scheming against you. It's just that you may be afraid to fully trust the good feelings that are floating around. There's no rush; respond only when your heart is ready."
pisces,2013-08-06,"You could feel like you're talking to the wall today when others don't seem interested in what you are doing. However, the Leo New Moon occupies your 6th House of Details, making it difficult for you to see the whole picture. Unconsciously blasting ahead with your grandiose plans can raise the ire of your coworkers. Taking smaller steps now allows you to make steady progress out of the spotlight. Ultimately, narrowing your vision and concentrating on one thing at a time is the simplest strategy to reach your goals."
aries,2013-08-07,"There aren't many shades of gray in your life today. If there is someone or something that you want, your feelings may grow so intense that you act in a foolish manner. Fortunately, you can avoid causing problems now if you are able to recognize your compulsive ways. But suppressing your emotions won't help your cause; your best bet is to be aware of your own feelings before moderating them. Nothing is as black or white as it appears."
taurus,2013-08-07,"You may have to rethink your strategy today even if you initially knew what you wanted to say. Paradoxically, the stronger your desires become, the easier it is to rationalize inaction. Take whatever time you need to reach a conclusion. But once you decide, push forward to make something happen. Sharing what's in your heart paves the way to success. Fear of the unknown is not a valid reason to delay."
gemini,2013-08-07,"You may run into trouble today with someone who tries to exert control over your feelings. Fortunately, you're clever enough to transform a complicated situation into a memorable time for all involved. Be the hero of the melodrama now, and escape from other people's manipulative behavior. Remember, this is your show; you aren't responsible to play a supporting role in anyone else's movie."
cancer,2013-08-07,"You can bring an incredibly rich perspective to the table today, but it's difficult to open the channels of communication that are necessary to get your project off the ground. One sensible place to start is to weigh all your strengths and weaknesses, so you know exactly how much you have to offer. Unfortunately, if you're not appreciated at work, a current annoyance could turn into a growing resentment. Nevertheless, it's not wise to express negativity now, unless it leads you to creating positive change."
leo,2013-08-07,"Nearly anyone you encounter today could be the catalyst that gets you back on track. It isn't likely that you're eager to show your vulnerability because you feel that this gives too much of your power away. Your self-esteem depends on being in control of your own boundaries now, so don't allow others to cross the line and talk you into saying more than you want. Nevertheless, being too defensive could close a window of opportunity before it even opens."
virgo,2013-08-07,"You could be feeling more judgmental now than you prefer, but you might attempt to maintain a positive attitude with everything that's happening, anyhow. You're riding large emotional waves and might not be able to suppress your intense feelings. At first, you aren't interested in retelling old stories from your past just so you can dramatize a current situation. Thankfully, there are simpler alternatives than creating a scene. Taking a slower and steadier approach is better than upsetting the proverbial apple cart."
libra,2013-08-07,"You're not be in the mood to play host to someone you aren't emotionally connected to now. Nevertheless, it still may be your job to make others feel comfortable, no matter how you feel. If you just bury your needs, suppressed anger could rise to the surface before you know it. Unfortunately, no one benefits if you lose your temper. Acknowledge your desires, shake your current negativity and make a plan to enjoy yourself no matter what."
scorpio,2013-08-07,"You must complete your current round of assignments before moving on to the next project, but you might believe that you're already finished. However, there's still a lot more to accomplish and your resistance only prolongs the stress. Swing into action even if you're not feeling very motivated. Instead of procrastinating now, use opportunistic Jupiter's connection to your key planet Pluto in order to get the ball rolling."
sagittarius,2013-08-07,"You might not find the rest and relaxation you seek now because you currently carry your workload with you wherever you go. Face your obligations rather than attempting to escape them. Look beyond the present moment; you don't have to do everything right now. Although you might blame others for your predicament, they are not the problem. Before starting an unnecessary conflict, remember that the tension will likely disperse on its own as you complete your job."
capricorn,2013-08-07,"It feels as if your efforts are coming to fruition now, and there's no time to lose; you must pick the produce while it's still fresh. You might even consider your overall professional role as you weigh all your options. Thankfully, other people in your life can be surprisingly supportive of where your current path is leading. Just remember that there's no need to make anyone uncomfortable with an uncharacteristic emotional display. Keep your intentions clear and follow your bliss."
aquarius,2013-08-07,"The emphasis on relationships continues today, but it's difficult to stay focused on the practical details right in front of you. A current conversation could quickly turn to more serious topics. Although a discussion about metaphysics or life-after-death might be fascinating, don't use these subjects just to avoid a challenging issue that needs resolution now. Managing the pressing affairs first will leave you time to explore the outer limits until your heart is content."
pisces,2013-08-07,"You are growing tired of fighting those who resist you at every turn. The pressure continues to build as your boss -- or someone else who claims to be in charge -- places stop signs in your path. Instead of just acting out in a rebellious manner today, handle each blockage separately without making the mistake of lumping them into one major obstacle. Remember to choose your battles carefully now, for your perceptions could be further bent out of shape than you realize."
aries,2013-08-08,"You are ready to shout your story from the top of any mountain once mischievous Mercury fires into dramatic Leo, inspiring you to take center stage. A more playful side of your nature begins to emerge today, but your erratic behavior is part of the package. Others won't quite know what to make of your actions now, so it's best to explain yourself as clearly as possible while continuing to cultivate all facets of your personality."
taurus,2013-08-08,"It's difficult to make decisions now when your reactions are so extreme, and your alternating swings between emotion and logic can become exhausting. Mercury in expressive Leo is at odds with your stoic Taurus demeanor, so you may find yourself in situations that motivate you to stand up for your beliefs. However, first make certain that your ideas are valid enough to defend. If you're fighting for something that really matters, don't back down until you get your message across."
gemini,2013-08-08,"The pace of your daily life picks up speed and you can almost feel the excitement in your world as clever Mercury moves through your 3rd House of Communication for the next couple of weeks. You should expect the ambient noise of your daily routines to increase as additional information finds its way into your life in the form of telephone calls, emails and visits from friends. This is life as you like it, so enjoy the ride as long as it lasts."
cancer,2013-08-08,"Your thoughts turn to your finances now, which are of increasing concern over the next two weeks. This is your chance to get back on track if you have lost focus and need to regroup in the money department. Your life is temporarily shifting away from emotional overwhelm and into the practical realm of action. Stabilizing your fiscal situation proactively enables you to build a more solid foundation for the future."
leo,2013-08-08,"Your proud lion-like roar is heard all across the land as the winged messenger Mercury flies into your sign today. Your convincing style packs a punch these days and you would be wise to keep turning your volume down as quickly as reality turns it up. Even if you think you are whispering, you may still be quite loud. Use this time to effectively communicate what's in your heart in a way that others can hear. But make sure you listen just as much as you talk if you really want to establish a solid connection."
virgo,2013-08-08,"You derive your logical and analytical powers from the discriminating faculties of interactive Mercury. As your key planet enters Leo today, you must make up for lost time if needed by finishing  business from the previous round so you can start the next cycle. Take charge of your dreams through the use of guided meditation or active daydreaming. Use this time to discover what inspires you and, if necessary, to change the way you think in order to create the future you imagine."
libra,2013-08-08,"You're increasingly aware that you're standing at a crossroad, even if the stress around you continues to ease. You must choose what is next in your life and circumstances continue to pressure you to take a stand. However, you don't need to actively pick your path by trying one alternative after another. Instead, your current thought patterns will create your new reality over the next few months, so practice guiding your mental meanderings in the direction you desire the most."
scorpio,2013-08-08,"Your emotional intensity is high as your rational mind charges into new territory today. You are striving to create a positive impact in your outer world, but may feel somewhat lost as to which way to turn. Thankfully, the confusion will pass in just a few days. Authentic communication takes on a greater role over the weeks ahead as you reevaluate the lessons you have learned and execute your plans with confidence. You are what you think."
sagittarius,2013-08-08,"Mercury prances into proud Leo today, encouraging you to talk about your most exciting dreams. You are very optimistic about your future now, even if there are obstacles that still need to be sorted out. Although you are impatient to reach your destination, you're on a journey that cannot be rushed. Nevertheless, you can see an opening at the end of the tunnel and it's wise to continue aiming at the light with all your might."
capricorn,2013-08-08,"You can still feel the instability of your internal emotional weather and it affects your closest relationships today. However, you are considering more practical solutions now, rather than just idle philosophies. Your best bet is to adapt to the circumstances, even if they continue to change. If you are tempted to push for your way, save your energy for when it can have greater impact. Ironically, you will maintain more control over your destiny by being flexible in your approach."
aquarius,2013-08-08,"You are highly observant of those you love and may often accurately guess the needs of your friends and acquaintances. Something unusual is happening today, since people around you are sharing the very same things that were being kept secret only a few days ago. Others may come to you with their stories now that Mercury is occupying your 7th House of Partnerships, giving you reason to leap into action. Happily, you are at your best when your passions are aroused and you engage others with heartfelt enthusiasm."
pisces,2013-08-08,"You may realize that you need additional focus to follow through with the daily routines of your job today. However, the best way to improve your concentration now might be through engaging in strenuous exercise rather than just working harder. Cerebral Mercury is traveling through your 6th House of Work and Health for the next couple of weeks, linking your physical and mental performance. Remember, it's the little things which will add up to create the desired positive impact on your overall health and happiness."
aries,2013-08-09,"Your drive for independence often prompts you to take extreme action. However, you may be gathering more information now in order to balance other people's needs with your own. Fortunately, acknowledging everyone's boundaries will allow you to express yourself more freely. Respecting the wishes of your friends and acquaintances today is the wisest way to build a strong foundation in a new relationship."
taurus,2013-08-09,"A roller coaster romance doesn't sound so exciting today; neither does a get-rich-quick scheme that might turn out to be an expensive distraction. Although you like being entertained by your fantasies, you're more interested in creating stability now than having fun. Thankfully, keeping your dreams separate from reality allows you to enjoy the best of both worlds."
gemini,2013-08-09,"Decisions concerning your home and family won't come easily today, yet your choices are not as critical as they may seem. Part of the current problem stems from being caught in the middle of an unsolvable dilemma. However, once you accept the notion that resolution is not on the horizon now, you are freed from having to take any action at all. Wait and see what happens before you make your next move."
cancer,2013-08-09,"You can accomplish more than you expect today by micromanaging your calendar. The trick is you must execute your plan exactly as imagined. Unfortunately, if you stuff too many commitments into your tight schedule, it will only take one late appointment to mess up your whole day. It's best to give yourself some wiggle room in advance to allow for circumstances that are beyond your control. Exercising self-restraint works to your advantage now."
leo,2013-08-09,"It's a perfect day to sit down and make a list of everything you do well. Consider this little exercise as a way of taking a personal inventory. But be completely honest and include those things about yourself you would like to improve as well. However, there is no reason to be extreme in your judgment about your shortcomings. You don't need to make major changes now; instead play up your strengths rather than focusing on your liabilities."
virgo,2013-08-09,"Your moods change dramatically throughout the day as you alternate between feeling positive about your goals and also struggling with your self-esteem. Since you're often self-critical, it may seem awkward to go easy on yourself now. Even if you believe you're doing fine, you still might bump into your inadequacies as if they belong to someone else. No matter who you are judging, continue to aspire toward greater acceptance. A compassionate heart creates the necessary space for positive change."
libra,2013-08-09,"You may be captivated by your imagination today and there's little you can do to escape the spell. But don't worry if you get lost in your dreams since they can be a very powerful source of inspiration. However, the more you attempt to cling to reality, the more annoyed you become with yourself now. Watching your fantasies unfold as if you are an unattached observer empowers you to learn how to use them to your benefit."
scorpio,2013-08-09,"It may feel as if your friends are being overly critical of you today, but your extreme reactions are probably connected to your current sensitivity. You might believe that growing thicker skin would help, but there is a dangerous price to pay for wearing a tough exterior. It's better to receive kind feedback from a supportive ally now than it is to get a much harsher assessment from someone else later on. Listen with an open mind and graciously accept the message as a gesture of genuine concern."
sagittarius,2013-08-09,"You might want to escape to a secluded tropical island now because there are too many details demanding your attention at work. You would rather leave this kind of micromanaging to someone else, but this is one of those times when you really need to knuckle down and do whatever is expected of you. Don't waste energy complaining about your fate; whistle while you work and see who joins in."
capricorn,2013-08-09,"Steady reassurance from others lifts your spirits through a difficult time. Although you would love to offer your support in return, chances are that your involvement won't come without a cost. However, you must receive the bad news along with the good. Taking a bitter pill might be just the medicine you need to see things from a fresh perspective. A change in your attitude can greatly improve the relationship dynamics."
aquarius,2013-08-09,"Sometimes you choose to avoid intense emotional interactions because you are not as comfortable navigating the illogical realms as the rational ones. However, you're intrigued now by digging into repressed feelings with someone you trust, for there is useful information just beneath the threshold of your perceptions. Go slowly as you explore the shadows of your life since there are crucial lessons to learn on this spiritual journey."
pisces,2013-08-09,"It's no laughing matter when someone criticizes you in a way that hurts your feelings. However, the current feedback may not be as intentionally mean as it seems. It isn't always easy to hear the truth, especially when it's stated so matter-of-factly. Instead of focusing only on the negative, reframe it in a way that gives you somewhere positive to go. There are almost always silver linings in the dark clouds if you look hard enough to find them."
aries,2013-08-10,"Cinderella was able to transform challenging circumstances to her advantage, and so can you. It's not that your life is full of drudgery, but if you are running into trouble in a relationship, you're likely to turn everything into a fairy tale in your fantasies. It's wonderful to inspire others with your dreams, but just make sure you differentiate between fact and fancy."
taurus,2013-08-10,"A nurturing person in your life may now be the source of unexpected confusion. However, the current uncertainty might stem from a simple misunderstanding rather than a real difference of opinion. Trying to clarify an issue could lead to frustration, for the more that is said, the more complicated it becomes. It feels as if the truth is elusive no matter what you do, so let it sit for a day or two. In the meantime, focusing on practical matters still brings a sense of accomplishment."
gemini,2013-08-10,"You have plenty to say about everything and others enjoy listening to you now because you are speaking in such a poetic manner. Your stories fly off your tongue with ease today; however, your colorful words can convince someone that you are telling the absolute truth. Don't stretch reality too far in your favor. It may not feel great when it snaps back."
cancer,2013-08-10,"It's tricky to be clear about your desires now, but your confusion won't likely stop you from voicing them anyway. Your sense of what's important is changing along with your values. Try not to make too big of a deal about your current needs because they're still in flux. Give your thoughts more time to develop before you share them as if they are your final answer."
leo,2013-08-10,"You could talk your way out of a high-security prison today -- or, at least you think you can. However, as charming and convincing as you may be now, you might also be deluding yourself. But don't rely on anyone else for your reality check, since they will only feed into your fantasies. Instead, take your current ideas with a couple of grains of salt. If your notions are worthwhile, they'll be even more valid in a few days."
virgo,2013-08-10,"A real intellectual connection with a spiritual truth can reveal a fascinating new path now. You have an open channel to your own subconscious today which sends you powerful images of the way your life could be if nothing stood in your way. Nevertheless, don't confuse the fantasy with your reality. Just take your dreams as they are and work toward making them come true."
libra,2013-08-10,"Your moods come and go like the breeze today as the Libra Moon fuels you with her changing whims. Your optimism can overcome most obstacles, but you must remember to honor the limits of reality instead of just affirming your way to success. Your dreams are meaningful, but not necessarily able to fix everything in your path. Reinforce the power of positive thought with meticulous work habits for the best results."
scorpio,2013-08-10,"There's not much beyond your grasp now, as long as you keep in contact with the source of your power. You cannot simply work your way to success unless you also integrate your metaphysical beliefs into everything you do. Rewards will come and go, but ultimately you will be left with your recollections of these times. Making your choices from a spiritual rather than a material perspective creates the best enduring memories."
sagittarius,2013-08-10,It may be extremely difficult to focus on your current work today because your thoughts are traversing the far reaches of the cosmos. You don't even need a rocket ship to visit other galaxies; you have all the tools you require within your mind. Open up some time on your busy schedule to do some traveling now -- in your imagination or outside in the real world -- but don't forget to meet your obligations before you slip away on your amazing journey.
capricorn,2013-08-10,"A disagreement about money today may create a temporary rift between you and a close friend. However, it's crucial to address issues that go beyond the apparent problem. Financial miscommunications can be a symptom of a deeper power struggle now. Go directly to the heart of the matter, even if it's uncomfortable. The potential for healing is great if you act with a sense of urgency."
aquarius,2013-08-10,"It's no fun to be the source of discomfort for someone else today. If something you say upsets a close friend or partner, carefully examine your own inconsistencies because you may have inadvertently sent mixed messages without even knowing it. Go out of your way to make certain that others understand your intentions. Clear communication now prevents messy problems later on."
pisces,2013-08-10,"You may be quite certain that your approach to a particular problem is the smartest one, and you're eager to proceed accordingly. Nevertheless, it's not helpful to get defensive if someone shows you a better way to accomplish your goals. There are many paths to the same destination, and your openness to alternatives will make your life easier now. Taking the time to listen could make all the difference."
aries,2013-08-11,"Your current optimistic attitude may have you believing that you can accomplish anything you want. However, frustration arises as your best ideas collide with the stone cold reality of unchangeable circumstances. Instead of trying to stick to your original plan, keep an open mind. But being flexible in your attitude is only half the solution. The other half is being willing to modify your goals and maybe even alter your destination if necessary."
taurus,2013-08-11,"You have your own set idea of how you want to spend your day today. But someone close to you might have very different plans in mind for you. Difficulties quickly arise from a minor power struggle now, especially if it escalates into a disagreement about how you should express your feelings in a delicate situation. Stubbornness, however, brings additional problems; you may not find a quick resolution, but gentle persistence pays off."
gemini,2013-08-11,"Your life takes a turn for the better today, but not until you solve a pesky problem that temporarily brings you down. You prefer being upbeat even in response to a challenging situation. Nevertheless, it may be difficult to be happy now until you work through the resistance that you have placed in your own path. Stick to the facts without assuming the worst. Ultimately, your current determination is your strongest ally."
cancer,2013-08-11,"It's tempting to go along with the wishes of close friends or family members today, but denying your own goals will likely backfire on you. You might be able to convince yourself that your needs aren't as important as everyone else's. Or you may want to nurture others out of the kindness of your own heart. However, burying your desires has a cost and could leave you feeling blue. Let others know what you want before everything becomes too complicated. The sooner you speak your piece, the easier it will be to find happiness."
leo,2013-08-11,"You may feel as if your message is critical today and everyone should stop and listen to what you have to say. Unfortunately, you might seem more overbearing than you realize, prompting others to close down to your words before they even hear them. Lighten up and let your imagination speak for you; taking yourself less seriously now softens your approach and enables you to communicate more effectively."
virgo,2013-08-11,"Voices within your own head are judging everything you think today as taskmaster Saturn squares your ruling planet Mercury. Solutions to current dilemmas are just beyond the self-imposed limitations of your logic, but it's difficult to just let your mind roam freely now. You may feel stuck, even when you try to head off the beaten bath. However, you'll go further when you finally stop fighting with yourself. Accepting your own contradictions releases you to follow your dreams."
libra,2013-08-11,"Steer clear of friends who tell you what to do today because they may end up costing you more money than you expect. Even without receiving a reality check from anyone else, you still might have to reconsider your spending habits. Think twice before overextending yourself financially. Watch your purse strings and you should be able to resist the temptation to splurge."
scorpio,2013-08-11,"Although your words may be somewhat restrained today, you can still weigh in without saying much at all. Others embellish their tales with flowery sentences and poetic verbs; you are too direct now for any unnecessary flourishes. Save your dreams of being creative for another day. In the meantime, stick to the facts. Being practical is your current ticket to success."
sagittarius,2013-08-11,"You might not have much choice about how your day begins, so don't waste energy trying to control it. Instead of worrying about how to make everything fit into your agenda, just flow with the circumstances as they unfold. You may still end up in a conflict, especially if it feels like someone is blocking your direct route to pleasure. Fortunately, there are many roads to happiness, so just pick a different one and continue on your way."
capricorn,2013-08-11,"You won't need to spend the day playing catch-up if you have kept current with your responsibilities. Instead, you are able to move through today's chores pretty quickly and then get on to something new and exciting. But you still might not be allowed to do exactly what you want. If an emotional issue with a close friend or family member surfaces now, take the time to resolve it before moving on to something else. Sometimes being compassionate is just as important as being successful."
aquarius,2013-08-11,"You don't always take kindly to other people's demands. In fact, an act of rebellion may be your first response if you think you're being pushed too far. After all, you prefer to do things in your own unique way. However, you may not have much choice today. Naturally, you can choose to fight against your current obligations when it's easier to just do what you must and then be free later to do as you wish."
pisces,2013-08-11,"Be courageous and take whatever you have been doing for fun to the next level now. However, you cannot just push your way ahead; you must prove your worthiness at each step along the way. Encountering a challenging problem is not a viable reason to give up; it's merely a sign that you must make fundamental changes to your current approach before proceeding onward to follow your bliss."
aries,2013-08-12,"Your emotions sink into the deep waters of your subconscious, making the next few days a bit uncomfortable. Nevertheless, a wise inner voice reminds you that your fiery nature gains strength when it is supported by your dreams. Don't be overly concerned if you're feeling a bit disconnected from your current circumstances. Have faith in your inner journey and trust the process of expressing what is in your heart."
taurus,2013-08-12,"Although you may not yet understand what is happening in a partnership, you must continue to flow with the energy to make the most of the process. The relationship axis is activated in your chart now as the evocative Moon moves through your 7th House of Partnerships. Even if you would prefer to be more grounded, you might have to be satisfied today with temporary instability. Listening to what others say helps you gain a fresh perspective on the situation until your clarity returns."
gemini,2013-08-12,"You might feel as if you are smoothly gliding along and skating right over a rather bumpy situation. However, you must stay in motion because problems don't seem to affect your pace as long as you have enough momentum. It's like your feet are just skimming over the surface, but as soon as you slow down, you fall into the intensity of an emotional drama. Listen to your common sense and keep moving as fast as you can."
cancer,2013-08-12,"Emotional desires wash over your life in waves once the Moon shifts back into sister water sign Scorpio this afternoon. A relationship that may have started as a practical arrangement now begins to heat up. You don't mind the intensity, for it puts you in touch with feelings that make you think you're young all over again, no matter how old you actually are. Don't try to intellectualize what's going on. Just enjoy your reactions to the current circumstances while they last."
leo,2013-08-12,"A little drama on the home front may require your attention today, and you won't be allowed to simply watch from a distance. You must jump right in with all your heart. Your first instinct might be to try to fix everything, but being a superhero isn't necessary. It's not about your competence; it's about the power of change that manifests when you are connected with your emotions and have the courage to honestly reveal them to those you love."
virgo,2013-08-12,"Your detached approach won't be enough to get you through the day. You need to experience the uncertainty that goes with expressing the raw emotions that evade logic and rational thought. Any attempts to sidestep your truth will only cause more trouble down the road. Your mind is active, but you must avoid the temptation of reducing complex emotional networks into overly simplistic statements of fact. Feel your way today, instead."
libra,2013-08-12,"The decisions you are trying to finalize today may have taken a lot out of you emotionally over these past weeks. Thankfully, it's time to make your choices now so you can begin to reap the rewards. Don't focus on your lack of certainty because you will feel better as soon as you move past this blockage, no matter what you choose. A little progress is better than none at all."
scorpio,2013-08-12,"You are sometimes quite guarded about your life, but you might be inclined to reveal more than you intend now. Discussing philosophies and teachings that are important to you enables you to talk about your feelings more freely. You can easily open up in order to make your point if your disclosure helps you clarify your perspective. There's no need to panic; showing vulnerability fosters closer relationships if you're willing to share your heart."
sagittarius,2013-08-12,"Truth isn't something that you normally like to obscure, but there may be secrets that create a subtle tension in your interactions with others today. Someone might even be covertly working behind your back in an effort to undermine what you're doing. He or she isn't necessarily an enemy, but could simply disagree with your perspective or strategy. The more information you can bring out into the open, the better it will ultimately be for everyone involved."
capricorn,2013-08-12,"You're dissatisfied with your responsibilities today because you would rather put your efforts toward something more useful than what you are now required to do. You might have duties that scatter your energy all over the place. Even if you do what others expect, you still may feel as if you haven't finished what's really on your plate. Ironically, simple communication, coupled with taking small steps, is what will pay off in the long run."
aquarius,2013-08-12,"Your thoughts are spinning in circles today because you can't quite grasp the issues at hand. You know enough to see how deep a subject goes, which means that a quickly applied bandage will not solve the problem. Save your unexpressed anger for another day; it won't help anyone now. Instead, cool logic mixed with non-judgmental compassion can bring you closer to the truth -- and the truth sets you free."
pisces,2013-08-12,"You may claim that you don't understand the full ramifications of what's happening now, but your feelings are probably clearer than you profess. You might just be avoiding an unpleasant argument, for as soon as you open your mouth the discussion can get heated. As long as you don't become overly self-righteous, you'll do fine in convincing others that you have something significant to say. Speak from your heart; the rest will follow."
aries,2013-08-13,"You prefer to be in total control of your life; however, you need others to participate now, because they bring additional resources to your plans. Thankfully, you still can manifest your own destiny; you just have to use a bit of teamwork to reach your destination. Although it may be necessary to make changes to your original agenda, compromise works in your favor in the long run."
taurus,2013-08-13,"It feels as if you are moving in and out of a dream today as you attempt to establish a connection point in the reality of your life. You are in an intense mode of operation and lost in your own thoughts. However, people in your immediate environment cannot be ignored, yet it also seems as if they don't want to make your life any easier. Push past your discomfort and communicate; it's better to know what you're up against than to have your head in the clouds."
gemini,2013-08-13,"There is a tricky situation developing and you need to separate out the big ideas floating around so you can dig into the specific problems. Unfortunately, you're not going to be able to skate your way through this predicament. Ironically, if you set your feelings aside in order to deal with the volatility of the situation, things will work out better than you could imagine."
cancer,2013-08-13,"Your passions need a creative outlet now as the tumultuous Scorpio Moon moves through your 5th House of Romance. You want to have fun without necessarily sacrificing depth of feeling on an energetic level. This means that your personal expressions have intensity, yet they won't be overwhelming to others today. Your ability to gently uncover the motives of a close friend or partner allows you to share your emotions without risking too much vulnerability."
leo,2013-08-13,"Today's annoyances may blossom into tomorrow's full-blown frustration unless you take care of managing your feelings in the present moment. But staying in tune with your emotions requires more attention than you want to give. Nevertheless, you can ease the pressure by facing whatever is sitting just beneath the surface and bringing it out into the open. It might not seem like a good idea at first, but your disclosure will relieve some of the tension and allow you to enjoy your day."
virgo,2013-08-13,"It's all about your unexpressed thoughts today as your key planet Mercury forms a tense aspect to controlling Pluto. Your biggest concern isn't deciding what to share; instead, you must choose what you won't mention. You might believe that it's smarter to say nothing at all and just bury your whole story. Unfortunately, keeping quiet won't work now because the truth will just slip out anyhow. Open the door to communication before it is too late."
libra,2013-08-13,"The waters are growing choppier and the winds are picking up now. The keel on your boat has kept you fairly level, but you may end up on the rocks unless you're extra vigilant. It's challenging to tell if your ship is riding deeper in the water or if the water has become shallow. Either way, you must get to the bottom of the issue in order to reestablish your equilibrium. As you realize the value of what you bring to the situation, your vessel will surprisingly regain its proper attitude."
scorpio,2013-08-13,"You are normally ready to dive headfirst into the emotional underworld and into your hidden dreams to visit your fears and insecurities when the Moon returns to your sign. But now, even your own inner guides may give you the silent treatment. It's difficult for you to know what is real and what is illusion. It feels as if everyone around you is in a conspiracy to hide something -- and they are all in on the secret except for you. However, don't dig too deeply today. What you need to know will be revealed in due time."
sagittarius,2013-08-13,"You may want to withdraw into your own little world by running away from your responsibilities; unfortunately, this is not a viable option at this time in your life. There are simply too many demands being made on you now. You're responsible to think things through clearly -- not only for your own benefit, but also for everyone else. Ultimately, you can do whatever is required in record time, but in your mind, you're already enjoying your personal retreat."
capricorn,2013-08-13,"You may be expected to do something for the group that you feel isn't in your own best interest; understandably, this creates an awkward dilemma. You know what your long-term goals are, but have to set them aside for a bit as you fulfill previous commitments. Nevertheless, others continue to distract you with intense emotional needs and you cannot ignore them completely. The more you're able to keep your mind on the practical side of things, the easier it is to perform your duties."
aquarius,2013-08-13,"You don't mind complexity; in fact, you're often drawn to tricky mental puzzles and complicated concepts. However, you don't like unresolved emotional issues as much. Unfortunately, there are weird power struggles now arising in your life, but you cannot yet tell where the tension is coming from. Secrecy only heightens the problem. The best thing you can do is keep as much as possible out in the open. The truth is the best defense against confusion. Initiating a friendly dialogue disarms even the toughest enemies."
pisces,2013-08-13,"Your acute hypersensitivity might put you on edge today. You feel every wave in the sea of consciousness, and it may be a difficult task to know what to do with all these perceptions. Ironically, the emotional intensity can be so overwhelming that you choose to do nothing at all. Your key to making it through the day smiling is to concentrate on the small things and do them well. Leave the big picture for another day when you're feeling more like yourself."
aries,2013-08-14,"You may have trouble focusing on work today as ingenious Uranus trines mental Mercury in your 5th House of Fun and Games. Thankfully, you are a bit of a magician now, appearing busy and productive even if you're goofing off. But it's smarter to be straightforward instead of placing so much emphasis on outsmarting the system. Work first and then play later for maximum respect."
taurus,2013-08-14,"You tend to shy away from the spotlight today, yet you still want others to acknowledge your special contribution. You feel more secure flying beneath the radar with communicator Mercury's current influence on your 4th House of Home and Family. Being invisible does have its advantages now because you can accomplish a lot when you aren't concerned about everyone else watching you. The only one you truly need to impress is you."
gemini,2013-08-14,"You are in an upbeat mood today and want everyone to know how good you feel now that independent Uranus is harmonizing with your key planet Mercury in your 3rd House of Communication. Even if you feel great, it's possible to surprise someone by taking a conversation too far. You might not even try to hide your erratic thinking as unpredictable Uranus enters the scene. Think before you speak so you don't shock others with what you say. Find an audience that will truly appreciate your off-the-wall ideas in the spirit they are meant."
cancer,2013-08-14,"Measured progress usually makes sense to you because it encourages slow and steady gains. However, you're more interested in making a noticeable splash today than in achieving your goals. Luckily, you have an excellent chance of succeeding at both now, so taking a risk is an excellent idea as long as you are honest about your intentions. Others will admire your courage as you stretch to reach for the stars."
leo,2013-08-14,"Ingenious ideas pop into awareness so fast today that you can't help but share them with those around you. But others may grow tired if all you do is talk about yourself. Instead of trying to convince everyone that your plan is the best, find the good in someone else's approach. You'll be surprised at how much respect you gain when you set your thoughts aside long enough to open your heart and engage in real give and take."
virgo,2013-08-14,"Your mind is moving so fast today that it's hard for you to keep up with your own thoughts. But don't worry if you make a brilliant breakthrough that isn't noticed right away by anyone else. Remember, you are running ahead of the curve now and it will take time for others to catch up. In the meantime, it won't hurt to rein in your thinking a tiny bit, for jumping to premature conclusions could ultimately cause more problems than it's worth."
libra,2013-08-14,"You may be overwhelmed with an abundance of social activity now that interactive Mercury is buzzing around in your 11th House of Friends. Fortunately, you should be able to make it appear as if you are working even when your mind is preoccupied with your personal life. Remember, you don't need to tell everyone everything; some things are better kept to yourself. Lighten up and have fun making memories that will last for a long time to come."
scorpio,2013-08-14,"While some people are off enjoying their summer vacations now, you may be busy putting your life and your career back on track. You might be feeling as if it's time to live up to your obligations, but don't concentrate all your efforts today on getting ahead. Even if you have a full plate of promises to fulfill, you can still benefit from a quick escape to do something irresponsible and fun. A short recess replenishes your energy for the next round of work."
sagittarius,2013-08-14,"You're able to get in touch with your feelings because you approach them logically today, instead of having to sink into the deep waters of irrationality. This means having the best of both worlds now. Ironically, you can demonstrate your openness to powerful emotions by maintaining enough detachment to talk about them in a philosophical way. A conceptual discussion gives you the freedom to explore your passions without being overwhelmed by them."
capricorn,2013-08-14,"You can build a lasting alliance that defies common sense while avoiding the established rules today and pushing yourself outside of the box. Your strength of purpose to create something totally new and different motivates you to discuss difficult relationship issues with your partner, even if resolution seems unlikely. The more you get your thoughts out into the open, the greater the possibilities for all involved."
aquarius,2013-08-14,"Your wonderful quirky self shows up in spades today. You need your independence while simultaneously wanting to be in a relationship when mischievous Mercury trines rebellious Uranus from your 7th House of Significant Others. But you may think that it's necessary to sacrifice important freedoms in trade for the closeness you crave. Don't try to solve this dilemma now; instead, just keep your options open and be ready to make your move as soon as the energy changes."
pisces,2013-08-14,"You don't feel particularly easygoing today because cerebral Mercury aligns with electric Uranus, shocking your sensitive nervous system with outlandish ideas. Some of your current thoughts may be absolutely brilliant but they can't take form until you have a chance to nurture them. Get your required tasks out of the way so you have plenty of time to further develop your most unconventional inspirations. There are no limits to what you can do now in your imagination if you give yourself permission to try."
aries,2013-08-15,"Although you may entertain big dreams of amazing adventures, the routine drudgery of work calls today and you must answer. However, planning your getaway is not a very smart strategy. Forget about all your lofty ideas and focus on exactly what is expected of you now, leaving the great escape for some other day. You will have something tangible to celebrate once your work is done."
taurus,2013-08-15,"An ambitious plan won't necessarily lead to success because you may not have the patience required to pull it off today. Of course, you want to be seen as reliable, yet you're still willing to attempt something new, even if it means putting your reputation at risk. Taking a calculated chance is probably a good idea now as long as you don't gamble with more than you're willing to lose."
gemini,2013-08-15,"People may tell you tall tales and you might actually believe them, so make sure to verify everything you hear today. Take the time to discover how reality differs from what others are saying now. Listen in between the spoken words so you don't miss what's being left out. It's best to know the shortcomings of a plan before you endorse it. Remember, even when something sounds really good, there is still more to the story than meets the ear."
cancer,2013-08-15,"Doing your job the same way you do it every other day is not a viable option today. You're eager to try something radically different, but it's hard to know the best method unless you test a few of them out. Ask your co-workers for their input since someone else can evaluate your work from a different perspective. Even a small procedural change could be enough to increase your efficiency and bring you more satisfaction."
leo,2013-08-15,"Emotional obstacles may appear in your immediate surroundings today, even when you're doing everything just right. However, don't admit defeat too soon, for your current problems can be easily overcome if you face them with confidence. There's no need to bury unresolved issues from your past; embrace your shortcomings by accepting who you and where you came from. You cannot change the current situation by reinventing your history. Instead, create your future by cultivating your dreams."
virgo,2013-08-15,"Your life seems to be moving too fast these days, yet you really do have the power to slow it down. However, modifying your calendar is tougher than you think. Canceling activities that are already on your schedule enables you to decrease the noise in your life by reducing the internal stress. A firm commitment to meditate or practice yoga for a few minutes every day might be all that's needed to see for yourself what is possible."
libra,2013-08-15,"You may mislead yourself today by acting on your hopes instead of paying attention to the current situation. You can further mix up fantasy with reality by trying to convince others to believe in everything that seems real to you. A relationship that is based on blind optimism or unproven assumptions might lead you astray. However, initiating conversations with your friends helps you ascertain the truth. Set your dreams aside now and stick strictly to the facts."
scorpio,2013-08-15,"You know what's expected of you today, but you may have other things that you would rather do. Meeting your obligations can be draining because you don't want to waste your time on anything that's not important to you. Conserve your energy to connect with a special someone or just to enjoy some downtime by yourself. Paradoxically, maintaining sensible boundaries now widens your horizons in the long run."
sagittarius,2013-08-15,"Sharing your feelings today may be rather exhausting, but it also can create moments of intimacy as you expand your social sphere of influence. You might prefer being less emotional, talking philosophically about ideas and events instead of discussing your changing moods. Remember, it's healthier to express what's in your heart now, even if you aren't exactly sure yet why you're doing it. A spontaneous connection could end up being the highlight of your day."
capricorn,2013-08-15,"Keeping your emotions to yourself can seem like a sensible thing to do, especially if they are standing in your way of being effective. However, you are happier and even more productive at work today if you don't suppress your feelings. Although it isn't wise to overwhelm your associates with your inner process, don't be afraid to share the truth. There won't be any regrets later if your disclosures are on a need-to-know basis. Others will appreciate the opportunity to open up about their feelings, too."
aquarius,2013-08-15,"Inviting a few friends over for a social gathering sounds like a great idea today. However, it might not be prudent to call everyone you know, for they all could show up all at once, transforming your idea for a casual little get-together into a major event. If you choose to go forward with your party, remember to give yourself enough time before for planning and after for recovery."
pisces,2013-08-15,"You're eager to take care of nearly everyone at work now that the Moon is visiting your 10th House of Public Responsibility. You have a high level of dedication and are willing to be an integral part of a team. Unfortunately, there's also so much going on in your private life today that relationships may be quite demanding. Luckily, you don't need to choose between the personal and business dimensions of your life. You can sustain both worlds if you simply devote your mind and heart to it."
aries,2013-08-16,"You feel as if you can make progress on projects that are stalled now, but there's still a complicated cocktail of cosmic disturbance to manage. You might not be able to actually put your plans into action yet, but you're in a forward-thinking mode, nonetheless. Watch the signs carefully today; paying attention to your relationship dynamics ultimately helps you get to where you want to go."
taurus,2013-08-16,"It may seem out of character if you overreact, but everything feels extremely important today. You want to be sure that you aren't missing anything that could negatively impact your progress. But it's possible to overcompensate in your attempt to achieve perfection. If you find your emotions growing intense, taking a few steps back enables you to maintain a healthy perspective on your life."
gemini,2013-08-16,"Relationships are emphasized now, but the energy between you and others probably won't be all that warm and fuzzy today. The connections can, however, be exciting and even adventurous, but the emotional aspects of your interactions might be temporarily relegated to the back burner. What's more important now are the activities that you undertake together. Being a good companion allows you to have your fair share of fun at work or at play."
cancer,2013-08-16,"You might bring a rather unrealistic idea into your workplace today and your solutions could be more grandiose than the problems they seek to remedy. The good news is that, although you may be stressing over finding the right amount of passion to bring to the job, you still have a solid chance to strike the balance you need. Don't give up; small steps in the right direction are better than none at all."
leo,2013-08-16,"You're feeling as if you're on the top of the world today and it seems as if accomplishing anything should be as easy as just visualizing it and making a wish. Unfortunately, all your problems are not magically solved by simply thinking about them. Nevertheless, you can make progress on many fronts as long as you take a creative approach and apply your energy in a balanced manner."
virgo,2013-08-16,"It's nearly impossible for you to gauge how much is enough today. You are pretty sure that your best strategy is to narrow your focus of vision, yet a loud inner voice tells you to widen your scope to get the largest possible view. It's as if you are experiencing reality simultaneously through two different camera lenses. Instead of attempting to favor one perspective over the other, keep your options open for a while longer."
libra,2013-08-16,"You may stress about what to say and what to keep secret now. Although your fantasies are more vivid than usual, it's been easier to keep them to yourself. However, your key planet Venus makes her yearly return to your sign today, encouraging you to relax and share more of your inner world with those you trust. There are still some things that should be left unsaid, but don't waste too much energy worrying about it. If it feels right, smile and say what's in your heart."
scorpio,2013-08-16,"Unfortunately, others might not understand the depth of your feelings now, so it's better to keep them private. You may be cleansing the wounds of an emotional battle scar, whether it is quite recent or from your childhood. Thankfully, establishing boundaries and creating safe space gives you the room you need to honor your process. Heal quietly on your own or in the company of a trusted friend."
sagittarius,2013-08-16,"Your words pack more of an emotional punch now that the evocative Moon is back in your sign. But you might also notice that your feelings are in a state of flux. It's as if your heart is attached to a kite, getting tossed around by the changing breezes. Controlling the sky is out of the question; you cannot harness the wind. Thankfully, going with the flow allows you to gain power and take charge when the turbulence settles down."
capricorn,2013-08-16,"Although you're unlikely to show all your cards today, you're more motivated than anyone realizes. It's not that you are specifically attempting to be secretive; it's just that you know more than others think you do. Your knowledge is your secret weapon and you'll be better off if you hold onto this advantage for a little while longer. The future will arrive sooner than you think."
aquarius,2013-08-16,"The call of far-away places and great adventures beckons, but you may need more time to make your great escape happen. On one hand, this is a magical and dreamy phase when you can put your creative nature to good use. On the other hand, you need to monitor your daydreams or they could lure you down the wrong track. Ultimately, acknowledging your long-term desires is healthy as long as you remember to also be appreciative of your current set of circumstances."
pisces,2013-08-16,"You're expected to do something at work that draws your energy away from what you prefer to be doing for yourself. Although it might be frustrating if you cannot find the time to attend to your personal needs, don't panic. It's all a matter of perspective. A change of attitude is all that's required to make your present moment more enjoyable. Instead of putting your energy into unrealized dreams, find the magic in the here and now."
aries,2013-08-17,"If you feel blocked in your creative expression now, it's time to check in with your feelings. Fortunately, there is much potential for movement as long as you're willing to step into the unknown. Instead of attempting to protect your heart from the vagaries of change, embrace the uncertainties of the future. Even if you don't yet have a plan, give voice to your intentions. And don't write off the potential for positive results before you even give it a fair chance."
taurus,2013-08-17,"Your strength of purpose empowers you to overcome minor setbacks today, but establishing goals is only a start. You must light a fire under yourself to create momentum; if you don't take action now, you'll regret it down the road. Be careful not to get involved in an emotional power struggle as you try to advance your own position. Be resolute but kind in your drive for success."
gemini,2013-08-17,"Your feelings play a more important role in your life now, but they may be difficult to express. You tend to emphasize mind over heart, yet today your emotions are stirred up from the subconscious, like the stuff that gets scraped up from the bottom of a pot of soup. Don't resist the movement. You can learn valuable lessons from your suppressed fears and desires, even if they make you uncomfortable at first."
cancer,2013-08-17,"Your feelings are weighing heavy on your mind today. However, you may have created emotional distance between you and your loved ones in order to prevent disappointment or even possible heartbreak. Luckily, there is a solid opportunity for you to do something brilliant now if you're willing to move through your own self-created restrictions. Serious reevaluation is fine but be ready to take that chance to make a splash and show someone that you care."
leo,2013-08-17,"Reality throws a few obstacles in your path today in the form of additional chores or someone trying to hijack your weekend routine. Look within to learn how these external blockages may actually be symbolic of your own feelings. Awareness is the key; if you take the time to understand your role in what's happening, you can break on through to the other side."
virgo,2013-08-17,"It appears as if the spotlight is on someone else and that you can get away with a bit of anonymity today. Paradoxically, your current invisibility doesn't prevent people from making more demands of your time. Even if responsibilities are heaped upon you, you somehow rise to the challenge and beyond. But if you have control issues and try to do it all by yourself, the best-made plans may collapse. Involve others equally and you will appear to be brilliant."
libra,2013-08-17,"Others appreciate you as the consummate host, but it's tricky because they might not be able to see you for who you really are. Instead, you are perceived as a public figure without much regards to your personal needs. Emotions are difficult to control, but you may think that it's important not to show all your feelings, especially the negative ones. Don't try to bury them or your life will just get crazier. Living cautiously is one thing, but everything is easier if you don't hide your head in the sand."
scorpio,2013-08-17,"Your emotions are complicated by friends and family today, and there may not be an easy way to navigate through the complexities. One inner voice tells you to hold your breath and remain motionless until the current stress passes. The other voice tells you to run away as fast as possible. However, neither of these strategies makes real sense. You are better off listening to the music and dancing to it the best you can, instead of sitting on the sidelines waiting for destiny to strike."
sagittarius,2013-08-17,"Learning new ways to increase your financial stability is usually a smart move, but it can now be a source of difficulty as the intensity of your desire to know more increases. You're less likely to take someone else's feelings into consideration if you stumble onto a brilliant idea. You must expand your knowledge base in order to fulfill your commitments. Pick a course of action and follow it instead of jumping around from one plan to another. For now, bite off less than you can chew."
capricorn,2013-08-17,"The challenges in front of you should be taken very seriously now. It may be best to give yourself the luxury of more time, so lighten your load by finishing up old business and putting away completed projects. You might feel as if you're taking your whole life through an eye of a needle today. There is too much to fit through such a small space so you need to let something go before you can create the future of your dreams."
aquarius,2013-08-17,"Place all systems on high alert today so you can minimize any tension that has cropped up in your life. Part of the problem is that you may have already taken on too much responsibility. You have plenty of work to do now, yet you might not feel like working very hard. Even if you finish everything you promised, others might judge you harshly anyhow. The best bet is to satisfy yourself first before anyone else at this time."
pisces,2013-08-17,"You're able to manage an extremely unusual mixture of energies today. On one hand, a high-strung emotional buzz sets you right at the edge. On the other hand, you feel grounded in reality and you know exactly what is going on. If you can control your emotions, you'll be a force to be reckoned with no matter what cause you choose to defend. Knowing when to share your passion makes the difference between frustration and success."
aries,2013-08-18,"Finding your comfort zone is tricky today because the more you adapt to meet the needs of others, the more you want to break free from the demands being placed upon you now. However, withdrawing emotionally tends to make you resentful. Your smartest strategy is to prevent your energy from stagnating. If you consciously breathe deeply throughout the day, you won't be as likely to suppress your feelings. Expressing your desires without being tied to the outcome relieves the pressure for everyone around you."
taurus,2013-08-18,"You might have a difficult time acknowledging the wishes of your friends and family today. Although the Moon is still in earthy Capricorn, your stubborn streak may surface in little ways that prevent you from just walking away from a volatile situation. Explore strategies that include someone who was previously the subject of your criticism or ire. Instead of being a perfectionist now, make the most of your heightened senses by responding in a more practical and enlightened manner."
gemini,2013-08-18,"You may be feeling a bit out of sorts today, especially if someone is counting on you for something you don't want to do. You might have other plans, but chances are that not much is going to change yet. Your values are brought into sharp focus as you compare your desires to your current opportunities. But satisfaction is elusive; although having patience can be tough, you need it now more than ever. Waiting may be the hardest part, but it also brings the greatest rewards."
cancer,2013-08-18,"You are at the beginning of a three-week phase where your needs may be in stark contrast with what is offered to you in the real world. The key is to seek balance between experiencing new pleasures and getting your most basic needs met so you can feel secure. This is not a time to go overboard with indulgences. Nevertheless, you will be surprised how happy you can be if you just take care of the bare minimums and leave the rest up to the universe."
leo,2013-08-18,"You are eager to discuss your attractions and desires in an objective manner now. Thankfully, you have an even-handed approach to relationships and the more you talk about them, the better your chances are to find the love you're seeking. However, chores or previous commitments could get in the way of your pursuit of happiness if you put too much emphasis on them. Meet your obligations, but leave time to explore your personal needs, too."
virgo,2013-08-18,"Reevaluating your priorities inspires you to set new relationship goals. Thankfully, it's easier to express your needs in a more spontaneous manner now that the earthy Capricorn Moon is visiting your 5th House of Love and Play. But you might also feel a bit wistful if you think you missed your chance to have fun today. Don't worry if sharing your desires with a good friend is currently easier than actually fulfilling them. You'll have another opportunity to act like a kid in just a few days."
libra,2013-08-18,"You may be preoccupied with relationship issues as the love planet Venus travels through your sign for the next three weeks. Luckily, you're more likely to experience sensual pleasure now since your charm factor is soaring. However, you also can get lazy as you soak in the good times that await you. Instead of concentrating all your energy on fleeting moments of physical enjoyment, explore ways to let your creativity take root and flower. Remain open to being surprised because romance is in the air and magic is afoot."
scorpio,2013-08-18,"Someone may ask you to play the role of a compassionate caretaker now, and the more love you have for this person, the easier the job will be. You can feel a high level of altruism in relationships these days, but your tendency toward self-denial could become a problem if you are being pressured or coerced. If you're not feeling it then inaction is better than faking good intentions; do what's in your heart and you can't go wrong."
sagittarius,2013-08-18,"Your mind is working overtime envisioning reliable ways to make money, but your follow-through might not support your big ideas now. Your social needs lure you away from your more practical responsibilities; you may prefer to have a memorable time with friends than to put extra hours in on a project. Fortunately, love can be combined with friendship in a way that makes adventures more possible today, especially when you are participating in group activities. Get out and have some fun while the getting is good."
capricorn,2013-08-18,"It may seem easier to make more money these days, but don't get sidetracked by any kind of get-rich-quick schemes. Love isn't full of surprises now; instead, you get what you deserve. This is a great time to reach for your goals because people in power are more inclined to support your ambitions now that attractive Venus is visiting your 10th House of Public Status. Happily, you can count on what you receive as being the real thing in matters of the heart or concerns about the bottom line."
aquarius,2013-08-18,"Companionship arrives in unusual forms today and broadens your horizons in ways that you never imagined. These next three weeks may offer you intriguing opportunities to take a trip with someone special, but even if this doesn't happen, keep in mind that you can still travel within the realms of your imagination. Lighten your approach to love; it's too important of a journey to take seriously."
pisces,2013-08-18,"You might attempt to maintain your balance in the realm of relationships now, but your sexual appetite could pull you into deeper emotional waters. Nearly any intimate encounter takes on unexpected intensity since you're more likely to express your passions without restraint today. Your current challenge is to create an emotionally safe space where feelings can flow naturally."
aries,2013-08-19,"You might feel as if you're a character in a science fiction story today since it's tough to tell what is real and what is illusion. You might make a grand gesture now, even if you would be better off staying low key. Nevertheless, you aren't interested in safety; you prefer to deal with the unknown as it appears. After all, you are in your element when you are exploring new territory, often by rushing into it without a concrete plan. Dream big; the future is yours to create."
taurus,2013-08-19,"Your instincts suggest that you should try something different today, but you may not be able to explain why. You are resistant because you typically don't like change unless there's a darn good reason. Something isn't making sense now; the facts just don't add up. Try not to make any major decisions at this time while you remain open to the possibilities. See how you feel in a few days and then make up your mind. In the meantime, exploring the alternatives brings its own form of satisfaction."
gemini,2013-08-19,"Your current existential dilemma isn't going away. One voice is telling you to be realistic and keep your feet on the ground. However, another voice is advising you to follow your instincts, even if you don't understand where they are taking you. These two diverging paths lead to such different destinations that you don't even know where to begin as you sort out your options. Keep it simple; start from the most practical perspective and slowly work your way through the list of possibilities."
cancer,2013-08-19,"It may seem as if someone is thwarting your efforts today, but there's no reason to let this negative energy impact your day. Although you might want to take other people's actions into consideration, it's healthier now to just concentrate on the exciting opportunities that are ahead. Even if you aren't making as much progress as you wish, remain attentive to your goals and tighten your plans accordingly. Your positive attitude can be powerful enough to quickly overcome any temporary disappointment."
leo,2013-08-19,"You enjoy connecting with others who open your mind to new ideas now that the progressive Aquarius Moon is visiting your 7th House of Relationships. But don't let anyone distract you from your feelings. Instead, invite them to join you in a mutually agreeable activity, so you can benefit from the richness of a collaborative experience. The universe is offering you a spiritual elixir, but whether or not you choose to share the journey is your choice."
virgo,2013-08-19,"It's challenging to know where to draw the line between reality and fantasy today. Your daydreams may feel as though your flights of fancy are quite real. Your best strategy is to continue carrying out your regular routines as if everything is perfectly normal. If you can stay grounded now, you could have something very special to show for your efforts by the end of the day."
libra,2013-08-19,"You might think that you're perfectly clear in your communication today, since you know what you are feeling and you're sure about what you want to say. Unfortunately, there may be a metaphysical black hole lurking between your mind and your tongue, warping the words that make it to the surface. If you're writing poetry or telling a story, this can add colorful imagery to your work. But otherwise, you need to remain on point with your message so that you don't needlessly confuse others."
scorpio,2013-08-19,"The cosmic mysteries seem close enough to touch today as you explore your imagination and bring back treasures from other dimensions. Your dreams are so vivid that you're able to pluck a magical flower from a heavenly garden and when you wake, you still have that impossible flower in your hand. Don't try to rationalize anything that happens now. Maximize the current potential by remaining open to unusual experiences and surprising synchronicities."
sagittarius,2013-08-19,"Fate is working on your behalf today and lady luck is on your side. Imagine a helpful angel sitting on your shoulder, whispering guidance in your ear all day. You don't even need to believe in angels for this magic to work. Don't get in the way of what they do, even if they are in another dimension of space and time. No matter how you need to frame it, you have invisible helpers at your service."
capricorn,2013-08-19,"Although you may have a core of strong spiritual beliefs, you don't take kindly to being pushed into non-physical realms. You are more comfortable when you can perceive exactly what is happening, which is one of the reasons why you accomplish so much. Today, however, a strange wind blows up weird debris from your own imagination. Pay close attention to your premonitions, whether or not they make any sense. Spending time in the dream world now is more productive than you think."
aquarius,2013-08-19,"You are receiving signals from outer space today, but they may be indecipherable. Don't struggle trying to translate anything into English, for you can get the gist of the message by just using your imagination. In your heart, you understand what's being communicated even if you can't grasp it intellectually. But that is the point; it isn't about the words. For now, it's all about suspending belief and trusting your intuition."
pisces,2013-08-19,"Your frustration increases if you think you have it all together within your own mind because your assessment just doesn't jive with what's happening. Instead of trying to rationally work your way through this dilemma, make time to delve beneath the surface noise. Fortunately, once you sink into your own imagination, you will be able to create a bit of magic. But don't try to force anything; just ride the waves of spiritual inspiration and see where they take you."
aries,2013-08-20,"You reserve the right to retreat today as you manage the unexpected consequences of your overly ambitious commitments. But it's not useful to worry about where you have fallen short now that the Aquarius Full Moon highlights your 11th House of Long-Term Goals. Instead, replenish your creative juices by doing something that enriches your soul. The big issues aren't going away; you'll still need to deal with them when you return -- hopefully, with a renewed sense of vitality and purpose."
taurus,2013-08-20,"You may want to consider a professional move or somehow change your role in the community now that the Aquarius Full Moon activates your 10th House of Career. No matter what you do today, it will have a strong impact on your family dynamics. The good news is you don't have to make decisions by yourself; it's smarter to involve others in the process. You can make a more informed choice once you know how everyone else feels."
gemini,2013-08-20,"You could learn something important today that has a long-term effect on your spiritual beliefs or political opinions. Your recent research may have already opened the door to more possibilities, which, in turn, attracts you to new ideas now that the Aquarius Full Moon lights up your 9th House of Higher Education. Curiosity lures you further into your own explorations while more altruistic interests can add a deeper meaning to your life."
cancer,2013-08-20,"You're feeling particularly connected to those close to you as today's Aquarius Full Moon illuminates your 8th House of Deep Sharing. Emotional rumblings arise from within your psyche. Waves of self-doubt enter the picture, which might, in turn, negatively impact your financial condition. Ultimately, if you are willing to be bold and dig beneath the surface, the current metamorphosis could be a very positive one. Your attitude makes all the difference in the world."
leo,2013-08-20,You are ready to break out of an entrenched pattern in a current relationship as the futuristic Aquarius Full Moon shines its awareness into your 7th House of Partners. Keep in mind that a change to the dynamics of a partnership might lead to an improvement in your overall attitude. Others can't help but notice your sparkle and come forward to support you.
virgo,2013-08-20,"You might not be very clear about your role in relationships today, especially if others aren't being precise about what they want. However, the effects of the Full Moon in unusual Aquarius may not be immediately apparent as it falls in your 6th House of Daily Routine. Stop going through endless mental loops and simply settle in to enjoy the day. Paradoxically, the benefits of pampering yourself are greater now than any specific work you might do."
libra,2013-08-20,"Love is in the air as today's Aquarius Full Moon illuminates your 5th House of Romance and Creativity. Unfortunately, your anticipation can also bring a few surprises along with it. Although it's a gift to see the highest potential in anyone you meet, you may not assess others realistically now. Be careful not to judge things by their appearance alone, for the truth might not be as pretty as the attractive veneer. Don't judge a book by its cover or you could end up getting the wrong idea."
scorpio,2013-08-20,"Revisiting an old fantasy can be cathartic today if you are then willing to let it go and move on. The Aquarius Full Moon energizes your 4th House of Roots, stirring up old memories and leaving you feeling a bit lost. Fortunately, you can have the resilience to process an emotional wound quickly, along with any residual negativity. Concentrating on a magical moment in the present allows you to detach from the past to enjoy the love that's around you now."
sagittarius,2013-08-20,"It might seem as if you don't have a moment to yourself today because the brilliant Aquarius Full Moon is buzzing in your 3rd House of Communication. However, it's wise to focus on your own projects for a while, even if everyone else wants to talk to you about their crazy ideas. Make time for more pleasurable activities that add something special to your life, such as redecorating your home or working in your garden. Choose something that will make you feel good and just relax."
capricorn,2013-08-20,"Your overconfidence can lead to trouble today unless you pay close attention to the details. You may be feeling pretty good about your prospects, but the Aquarius Full Moon brightens your 2nd House of Money, tempting you to spend more than you should on something you don't really need. Be smart and wait a few more days before reevaluating your options. A penny saved is a penny earned."
aquarius,2013-08-20,"You may think that you know what you need, yet your moods fluctuate and your desires change throughout the day. Today's Full Moon in your intelligent sign stretches your emotions to the extreme. Your inconsistency can be particularly confusing to a partner or close friend who isn't accustomed to you expressing your whims. Nevertheless, it's better to deal with someone else's uncertainty about you than it is to deny your feelings. Speak from your heart and the rest will fall into place."
pisces,2013-08-20,"You are less likely to let others in on your emotional process now that today's Aquarius Full Moon shines in your 12th House of Secrets. However, avoidance isn't a practical long-term strategy on which to build a relationship. Don't put off an important discussion just because the thought of it makes you uncomfortable. It's not necessary to fill in all the details, but the sooner you share your concerns, the more you will feel connected to those you love."
aries,2013-08-21,"You are often the one who races ahead to achieve an early advantage. Now, however, it's wise to practice patience on every level. Don't let your imagination run away with a practical idea. Impulsive action can lessen your chances for success, even if everything looks good at first. Slowing down to a pace that you can sustain ultimately improves your odds of cashing in on the current opportunities."
taurus,2013-08-21,"There may be such a high level of uncertainty in your life now that you overcompensate by clinging to the status quo. Paradoxically, it's not that you want to hold onto the past; you really do crave change, but might be apprehensive about losing control of the process. Fortunately, you can remain open to the potential growth without jumping off a cliff. Don't let fear stand in the way of the amazing possibilities that could be waiting just around the next corner if you have the courage to go there."
gemini,2013-08-21,"You like to keep your options open, especially when the choices look so promising. Happily, your future is not set in stone; there are a variety of alternatives to explore now. However, dreaming about each one could get in the way of actually choosing your path. Don't be overly concerned that you might pick the wrong way; anything that allows you to continue your journey is better than staying in one place."
cancer,2013-08-21,"Your career may take an unexpected turn now, leading you in an exciting new direction. But the changes could be significant enough that they take several months to play on through. Nevertheless, your upbeat attitude can motivate others at work today. Ironically, it's your current optimism that might inspire someone to offer you an exciting opportunity that ultimately gives you more freedom while bringing the recognition you deserve."
leo,2013-08-21,"Lately you can't stop dreaming about an amazing vacation to an exotic destination. Unfortunately, you might not be able to drop everything in your life and hop a plane for your great escape. But happiness is not as far away as you think. Seek satisfaction where you are, rather than where you wish you were heading. Luckily, you are fully capable of enjoying the present moment even with the unrealized wonders of the future still in front of you."
virgo,2013-08-21,"Although you prefer relationships to be clearly defined, sometimes it's best to leave things more open-ended. However, someone's behavior may be exceptionally difficult to decipher today, even if you ask for clarification. But there's no need to push too hard; ultimately, you have a better chance of getting what you want if you remain attentive to the signals that others are giving you. If you can't figure out what's going on, avoid the temptation to withdraw. An honest dialogue enables you to create something that works for both of you."
libra,2013-08-21,"You are envisioning your rise to success now, but may be rather impractical about what to do next. Although you might have moments of doubt throughout the day, you can't help but see the brighter side of every situation now. A positive outlook is healthy, but not if you ignore the facts. Aim high when setting your goals, but be realistic when making choices."
scorpio,2013-08-21,"You're not interested in becoming entangled in other people's emotional dramas these days because you are more intrigued with the idea of exploring your own imagination. The complexities of interpersonal relationships may distract you from your current creative efforts. Even if you love someone enough to offer the help they need, you still must face the limitations of your time. Take care of yourself first or you won't have much to give to anyone else."
sagittarius,2013-08-21,"You may not be in complete control of your feelings, yet you're willing to let go and follow the emotional flow wherever it leads. You want to take things seriously, but it might be more important now to pursue the fun things in life. Even if you attempt to adopt a more somber attitude, you could end up frustrated if you try too hard. Fortunately, going along with your imagination today is the best way to realize your creative potential."
capricorn,2013-08-21,"Your world is full of surprises today, but you might be resistant to them. You want to feel as if you can control the circumstances, but other people's optimism pulls you out of your safety zone and encourages you to think about possibilities beyond your normal scope. However, there are treasures waiting to be discovered if you have the courage to take a step into the unknown."
aquarius,2013-08-21,Entertaining daydreams about material wealth might motivate you to apply yourself diligently on the job. But unrealistic fantasies about get-rich schemes could distract you from more important work today. Giving yourself permission to think about the potential is healthy if you follow through with concrete actions. Don't bite off more than you can chew. Taking small steps toward a lofty goal is better than taking giant steps toward a more modest one.
pisces,2013-08-21,"You may feel affectionate today and willing to express what's in your heart, even if it means being vulnerable. However, it's not a good idea to pretend that everything is okay if it really isn't or you'll end up wasting energy making up for lost time. Explore all your options but don't slip into denial. You can manifest your dreams if you focus on the right ones."
aries,2013-08-22,"Your fantasy world is expanding now as you run each possibility through your imagination. However, no one realizes what you are experiencing because your appearance may remain calm and collected. These little daydreams are yours and yours alone. Stay aware of your feelings while you continue to communicate in a restrained and logical manner. Keep up your normal routine, and you should be able to get away with your inner journeying without anyone getting on your case."
taurus,2013-08-22,"Although important people may enter your life now and energize you, they might also bring a bit of disruption. Stay present when responding to others, for your common sense could actually save the day. Don't be afraid to say no; trust your instincts even if you have to stir up some muddy waters in the process. Going against the flow today can prevent a relationship from becoming stagnant."
gemini,2013-08-22,"It's challenging to get your head and your heart working in sync toward the same goals today. Somehow, it seemed simpler in the past to align with your higher self. However, you can benefit by going back and reassessing your priorities because your careful analysis falls apart in light of strong emotions now coming to the surface. Don't be so afraid of letting others see who you really are -- even with your current eccentricities. Following your dreams allows others to do the same."
cancer,2013-08-22,"You might be overwhelmed by an odd situation today when brainy Mercury aligns with crazy Uranus. You're tempted to sink into your feelings and nurture someone with all your heart while another voice in your head just wants to break free from all emotional attachments. Although making your escape sounds enticing now, your practical sense of loyalty will likely win out. Find ways to express your wild side without turning your relationships upside down."
leo,2013-08-22,"You have something on your mind and need to get it out into the open; however, you may not be ready to deal with the consequences of your message today. Nevertheless, it could feel as if you're running out of time to speak your peace. Starting the conversation isn't easy, but it will only grow more difficult as the day progresses. Don't wait for a better moment to initiate the discussion. Believe it or not, the time is now."
virgo,2013-08-22,"Your key planet Mercury is being rattled by unstable Uranus and opinionated Jupiter now, aggravating a difficult situation in a relationship. Your partner or friend may grow a bit irritable today, which in turn makes your life more complicated. Your best strategy is to allow the people in your life enough room so they can find out what works best for them without worrying about your expectations. Supporting the dreams of others ultimately works in your favor."
libra,2013-08-22,"A little extra concentration prevents your week from deviating too far off track. Fortunately, you can see how over-committed you are as long as you logically think about your activities. But as soon as you step away from your detached approach, you could fall into the deep well of feelings. Stand back a little bit to get a fresh perspective while reconsidering a new direction."
scorpio,2013-08-22,"It seems as if everything at work is about to change and you aren't sure how to prioritize your goals today. It may feel as if you're on a roller coaster ride; you're exhilarated one moment and craving stability the next. But attempts to end the uncertainty will only lead to higher anxiety. Stop resisting that which you cannot control. Thankfully, your path straightens out over the next few days, bringing more structure to your life and paving the way to your future."
sagittarius,2013-08-22,"Your current emotional dilemma is pulling you between home and career. On one hand, you really want to put in the required time to sustain a loving relationship. But, on the other hand, there's a part of you that only wants to focus on getting ahead at work. Although you might think that you must choose one direction now, an extreme reaction won't serve you well. There's no need to panic; thankfully, balancing your personal and professional goals is possible if you budget your time wisely."
capricorn,2013-08-22,"It's time for you Mountain Goats to take a calculated risk. Normally, you exhibit conservative behavior as your sure-footedness prevents you from making too many mistakes. Paradoxically, a small misjudgment today may actually help you reach your goal. You're unlikely to request assistance if you think that you have all the answers. However, you're more likely to ask for what you need if you run into a problem. Listen to the advice you receive; it could make the difference between failure and success."
aquarius,2013-08-22,"Last week may have been filled with sudden unplanned changes. Fortunately, you secretly enjoy it when the lightning strikes and things get turned upside down. As if you haven't been through enough recently, today is a crash course in your learning process. Engage others in intelligent discussions, even if your opinions differ. Encountering new ideas can validate what's most important to you."
pisces,2013-08-22,"Your life seems to be more hectic today because your moods are changing so quickly. The biggest challenges now may come from your personal relationships. Even if your partner seems to be sensible and rational, you might be ready to toss the whole thing out and start over. Don't move so fast; there's good stuff to be found beneath the surface. It will just take a while to sort through the noise that is the loudest so you can tune into the sweet music that's singing your song."
aries,2013-08-23,"You might be too nervous to feel the emotions behind your own words today, even though the Moon's return to Aries usually put you more in touch with your moods. Your current uneasiness arises from your inability to express yourself as clearly as you wish. Every time you say something, it seems that you are misunderstood. Don't struggle to explain your motives now; wait a few days and try again. In the meantime, let your actions tell your story for the most positive impact."
taurus,2013-08-23,"Knowing that you may be reading the signals wrong today tempts you to fill in the missing information with what you think to be true. Unfortunately, your uncertainty can raise fear, prompting you to doubt yourself even more. Instead of trying to categorize everything as either black or white, remember how much of your world is actually various shades of gray. Allowing for many possible interpretations increases your chances of finding happiness."
gemini,2013-08-23,"You might be more interested in your connections with coworkers and acquaintances today than you are in accomplishing much on your own. It isn't that you are lazy; it's just that you prefer to put your energy toward enjoying your interactions with others and creating new relationships instead of doing what's expected of you. Although you may have a lot of fun with your friends now, don't forget to round out your day by leaving some time for quiet self-reflection, too."
cancer,2013-08-23,"Dreaming up new ways to approach your work can help you alleviate any boredom that has crept into your life. Although you could distract yourself for a while, following your curiosity doesn't necessarily resolve your basic questions about life. Today, however, it's more important to meet your obligations as they arise. Thankfully, you will have ample opportunity throughout the year to explore new territory and redefine your long-term goals."
leo,2013-08-23,"A relentless string of responsibilities continues to remind you of the seriousness of life, and you can already tell that there's significant change in the air. It may take a while for the current transformation to occur, so don't panic if you feel like there is still too much work to do now and not enough time. Focus all your attention on tying up loose ends today. Clearing the energy allows you to take advantage of the upcoming opportunities."
virgo,2013-08-23,"Although you may try to maintain clarity in communication, you might as well acknowledge that the muse has come to visit you today. Even if you don't normally write poetry, your thoughts are more in sync with your imagination now than they are with reality. However, blurting things out creates problems because your symbol-rich language paints pictures instead of telling stories. Don't force your communications into overly formal presentations. Just describe what you see in your mind's eye and let the magic unfold."
libra,2013-08-23,"Today's assertive Aries Moon encourages you to express your desires, instead of trying to accommodate the needs of another person. Of course, a successful relationship benefits from your willingness to balance your partner's energies with your own. Naturally, you err by leaning toward what others want. Now it's time to go out on a limb and share your thoughts with someone you trust. Nevertheless, it's wise to remain detached from the outcome as much as possible. Honest communication is the key to satisfaction."
scorpio,2013-08-23,"Although you want to plow ahead with an ambitious plan, you may have to stop to make an adjustment or two so you can get others to help you along the way. Even if you're tempted to undertake the project by yourself, you can accomplish much more by working as part of a team. Your current dependency is not a weakness; it's only temporary, so make the most of the support you receive while it's available. The energy of the whole is greater than the sum of its parts."
sagittarius,2013-08-23,"It seems as if your life is all about your career now, but surface appearances only tell part of the story. You're yearning for some good old-fashioned fun while the Moon is hanging out in your 5th House of Spontaneity. Luckily, you're able to have a fine time, but there could be a high price to pay unless you meet your obligations first. Although it may be hard to restrain your adventurous nature, wait a few more days before unilaterally freeing yourself from the shackles of responsibility. Work hard; play harder later."
capricorn,2013-08-23,"You probably have a great deal of social responsibilities this weekend, and a supportive anchor on the home front can give you the ability to deepen your roots without necessarily feeling trapped by them. Creating a fertile ground in your personal life adds to your emotional security. This, in turn, affords you the stability you need to accomplish great things at work or out in the community."
aquarius,2013-08-23,"The more you try to get things under control today, the crazier they become, turning this day inside out. You might be running around in circles trying to keep up, but paradoxically, your anxiety diminishes once you loosen your grip on the reins. You won't be able to complete everything you start in a timely fashion, yet your need to do so may be less urgent than it seems. Maintaining your sense of humor allows you to adapt to the changing circumstances with admirable grace."
pisces,2013-08-23,"Your emotions may be directly linked to your material possessions today. If you are doubting your own abilities, you could be tempted to engage in retail therapy to make yourself feel better. Unfortunately, this self-indulgence is not a viable solution; it's merely a distraction from the real issues. Instead of spending any money, search for the underlying cause of your dissatisfaction. Once you get to the bottom of your angst, you can do something positive about it."
aries,2013-08-24,"Be clear about why you want to do battle before allowing your temper to get the best of you. It's too easy now to start an argument because you thought you heard something that wasn't even said. If you need to vent some steam, you would be better off putting your energy into something practical like physical labor or exercise. Stepping away from a conflict gives you time to check your sources before jumping to any conclusions."
taurus,2013-08-24,"There's something special about the buzz you feel this morning. Perhaps you wake with the anticipation that a fantastic dream will actually overflow into your day. But your hopes fade along with the remnants of your nocturnal visions. Maintaining a positive attitude throughout the day may not be easy. Don't just dig in your heels and resist the pressure to adapt to the changing situation. However, if you must make a stand, be sure that it's for a good reason and not out of habit."
gemini,2013-08-24,"Your friends can keep you extremely busy now that the excitable Moon is moving through your 11th House of Social Networking. You might not have a lot of time for yourself if there are lots of people coming and going today. Fortunately, you like the ideas and energy that others bring to the table. Let the conversation flow and rely on your clever sense of humor to help resolve a tense situation if one develops. Your quick wit can save the day."
cancer,2013-08-24,"A recent promise could lead to disappointment unless you are conscientious about what you say. A new project at work may require your care and cultivation, but don't fret if you miss an intriguing opportunity. You can learn from your mistakes now, ensuring that you will get what you desire in the future. Don't become rigid in your thinking; if you keep your mind moving toward the future, rather than clinging to the past, all things become possible."
leo,2013-08-24,"Your competitive juices start to flow today if an aggressive person questions your skills. If you choose to accept the challenge, it's smarter to just do the best you can rather than concentrating on winning at all costs. Your best shot at achieving success is by continuing to respond to the current circumstances with an open mind. Focusing only on the end result could distract you from the beauty of the present moment."
virgo,2013-08-24,"Although you might attempt to gloss over a few details today, it's the littlest things that make or break a relationship. Discussing even the smallest differences of opinion can have a positive impact. This means stating your position without blame. Most things are possible if both parties are willing to equally give and take. You may be surprised with the results now if you approach a partnership with an open heart."
libra,2013-08-24,"Fast reactions help you to find brilliant solutions now, while inspiration motivates you to try a new strategy. If others seem like they are out to get you, your instincts can quickly take you to a place of safety. Knowing what you want motivates you to focus and achieve your goals. Stick to your position even if you meet opposition. Be bold; it's your day to take a chance and reach for the stars."
scorpio,2013-08-24,"Your unwavering commitment on the job might not bring the results you currently desire. Still, it's great that you have the drive and intensity to push so hard. But you could rub someone the wrong way today if you're not careful, so consciously acknowledge the opinions of others in all your interactions. Trying a new approach may be a great idea as long as everyone is on the same page. Happily, your positive attitude and honorable intentions can inspire your allies to follow your lead."
sagittarius,2013-08-24,"Gambling with your own feelings might be exhilarating today, but your current penchant for risk-taking may also create trouble. You don't have to push the envelope too far to enjoy yourself. However, if there's romance in the air, share your heart with someone who is ready for love. Being honest about your desires breaks down barriers and could lead to a lasting connection."
capricorn,2013-08-24,"You have a tremendous amount of energy today and the best way to channel it is to catch up on work at home. Begin a major cleaning project or redecorate a room that needs an overdue upgrade. Letting go of old belongings can make way for something wonderful and new. Be courageous, even if you feel like you're climbing out on a limb. But don't do anything halfway; jumping in with both feet enables you to accomplish more than you expect."
aquarius,2013-08-24,"Various streams of information flow together and make perfect sense to you as the reflective Moon visits your 3rd House of Communication. Interesting ideas that have been floating around in your imagination now begin to form coherent patterns. Your astute comprehension allows you to convert facts into an executable plan. But choose your words carefully, since they can effectively light a fuse of inspiration under someone close to you. It would be really nice to have a partner in success."
pisces,2013-08-24,"Sometimes you can drift off into your imagination and forget about your physical self. Now, however, your energy is drawn into your body and you are ready to make your move. But it's not just about improving your health; you also have an opportunity to look better and increase your self-confidence. Establishing realistic priorities allows you to feel good about the tangible results you achieve."
aries,2013-08-25,"You are eager to finish up old business today, even if only in preparation for the coming week. You may be confident that you can accomplish all the tasks that are on your current list. Nevertheless, concentrating on your work is a struggle now; you want to spend your time daydreaming about more creative pursuits. Don't get sidetracked; stick to your agenda and you will be rewarded for what you do rather than for what you think."
taurus,2013-08-25,"Even if you choose your words carefully today, there's still plenty of room for your friends to misinterpret what you say. You may believe you are being specific, but others still miss your point. Perhaps you require additional time to fully develop your ideas, even though you might not realize it yet. There's no need to judge yourself harshly; it's okay to unfold your perspective slowly. You really don't need to be in such a hurry to share your story."
gemini,2013-08-25,"You may be unclear as to what you should be doing today, even if your responsibilities have been spelled out in great detail. Nevertheless, you want to know how your part integrates with the big picture before you carry out your job. Although it isn't easy to stop asking questions, it's smarter now to simply do exactly as instructed without attempting to understand how all the pieces of the puzzle fit together. Let go and watch everything magically fall into place."
cancer,2013-08-25,"Although you're in a contemplative mood today, your thoughts are slightly out of focus. It's as if you are under a spell that intensifies the magic while preventing you from seeing things as they truly are now. Luckily, you have the ability to conjure up an ideal situation in your mind and then step into it by using your powers of active imagination. This meditative trick may not be useful for making a practical decision, but it's quite helpful for exploring creative pursuits."
leo,2013-08-25,"Something unusual is unfolding today yet you can't seem to put your finger on it. Nevertheless, you are lured toward investigating beyond the obvious in the hope of finding magic hiding in the shadows. Unfortunately, too much searching might actually distract you from the amazing beauty that is right under your nose. For now, the devil may really be in the details."
virgo,2013-08-25,"It's quite a feat to cleverly embellish your story so much today that others actually believe you're telling the truth. Uncharacteristically, you aren't as worried about the facts now as you are in keeping people interested in your message. There's nothing wrong with letting your imagination run wild as long as you practice full disclosure, so everyone knows that you're just sharing a dream."
libra,2013-08-25,"It's easier to be a follower today rather than a leader, even if you have a very specific goal in mind. You can certainly turn on the charm in order to attract someone's attention, but it may be harder to demonstrate the authority that it takes to be in charge. There's no shame in letting someone else be the boss now while you relinquish control and recharge your batteries. Being a team player improves your chances for success."
scorpio,2013-08-25,"You may express your feelings and present your ideas in a very seductive way today. Although others might not be interested at first, you are adept at drawing them into your story by conjuring up mythical images and fantastic characters. Once you have a captive audience, you can cleverly pull them in even further. However, subtle manipulation of the facts leads to trouble, especially if you're motivated by fear or greed. There's nothing wrong with painting a beautiful picture but it's still safer to simply stick with the facts."
sagittarius,2013-08-25,"You inspire others today with your grand visions and your carefully orchestrated words. Your gift of gab allows you to string together one idea after another as if each is a pearl on a necklace. However, weaving too many threads of thought into an enchanting tapestry of concepts grows overly complicated, leaving your friends confused, rather than motivated. You may be tempted to play the role of a muse, but it's wise to balance your creative side by also being practical. Leading by example is your most effective approach."
capricorn,2013-08-25,"If furthering your education is on your mind, start nailing down some of the details right away. Thankfully, you have the patience to focus on the specifics, without losing sight of the big picture now. However, you must be careful not to concentrate too much effort in the wrong direction. Making preliminary decisions today is an excellent idea as long as you leave some options on the table for another few weeks. No matter what your current plans are, expand your vision of the future."
aquarius,2013-08-25,"Unrealistic expectations about a recent investment or a large purchase involving others could get you into trouble now. Although you might be able to make money or acquire something of value, you need to take plenty of extra time to separate your hopes from reality. Avoid getting swept up in someone's idealism today; it's not wise to believe everything you are told. Diligently check the facts if you want to ensure success."
pisces,2013-08-25,"You're exceptionally receptive to other people's ideas today, making you also susceptible to deception. Thankfully, this magical aspect can also awaken your spirituality, inspire your creativity and increase your fascination with music and art. It's challenging to distinguish between your fantasies and reality now; mischievous Mercury's opposition to seductive Neptune suggests that you should ask a few questions before you wander down a garden path. Follow your bliss, not someone else's."
aries,2013-08-26,"Although you have responsibilities to fulfill today, it's difficult to resist creating a bit of mischief, instead. You want to take a risk and break out of your normal routine, even if you realize self-indulgence isn't the smartest course of action now. You may attempt to justify your behavior, yet your current judgment might not be very clear. Ask a trusted friend for a different perspective before doing something you will later regret. Following your whims is fine as long as no harm comes to others."
taurus,2013-08-26,"You feel as if you're wired for pleasure today since your ruling planet Venus opposes electric Uranus. Nevertheless, your intense desires might create an emotional short circuit if you think that satisfaction is out of reach. Your fantasies may be quite unrealistic, but it really doesn't matter if you believe in your daydreams or not. You don't need to follow through with every wish. What's important now is to give yourself permission to imagine what would bring you happiness if anything was possible."
gemini,2013-08-26,"You may hope to float through the day on a cloud of romantic illusions, but an unexpected event can shock you out of your reverie. Even if you quickly adapt to a change of plans, you still might overlook the significance of what is happening. Although you could be surprised by what you learn, it's still wise to contemplate what the cosmos is attempting to tell you. Taking time to interpret your dreams reveals secrets you could otherwise miss."
cancer,2013-08-26,"Someone's reaction to your request at work today might not be what you expect; however, you can take nearly anything in stride with the right attitude. At first, you may be anxious because you don't want to confront the unknown, but you're relieved to learn the truth now, even if it catches you off guard. Don't let your subconscious motivations mislead you into pushing the information away; integrate the new data and alter your plans as needed before moving on."
leo,2013-08-26,"You are super excited about someone or something new in your life now, but you're afraid that your current enthusiasm won't last. You may be overly cautious about letting completely go and enjoying yourself because you believe that your sense of freedom will quickly be restrained by limiting circumstances. Change is inevitable, but worrying about the future doesn't have to interfere with today's pleasures. Enjoy the present moment while it lasts."
virgo,2013-08-26,You might be surprised by someone's selfish behavior today and you could even be offended by people's lack of compassion. Rational analysis won't help you to understand their actions because logic is not the motivating factor now. Unexplainable changes are to be expected if tension is stressing a relationship. But don't over-analyze anyone's motives; simply respond with kindness and honesty. The storm will pass quickly if you keep your heart open and remain flexible in your thinking.
libra,2013-08-26,"Previously hidden desires may float to the surface today. Your key planet Venus is visiting your 1st House of Self and her opposition to unorthodox Uranus in your 7th House of Relationships can uncover something about your partner that you didn't previously know. But rather than waiting for anyone to surprise you with an unexpected revelation, take the initiative and be an agent of change, yourself. Embrace the shift proactively instead of resisting it."
scorpio,2013-08-26,"You would like to let go of old expectations once and for all and express your current feelings spontaneously today as creative Venus opposes progressive Uranus in your 5th House of Romance. Unfortunately, you might not know exactly what you want. Your emotions are slippery now, making it difficult to choose any one course of action. Nevertheless, you have an amazing opportunity to learn something important about love if you're willing to relinquish control and go with the flow."
sagittarius,2013-08-26,"You wish a friend or partner would make a straightforward decision today, but the clarity you seek may continue to be elusive. Instead of receiving a yes or no answer now, you're required to live with someone's uncertainty. However, it's likely that other people's ambivalence might simply be a reflection of your own, even if you believe that you already made your choice. Don't push for resolution since it will take time for all the facts to fully emerge. A little patience gives inspiration a chance to strike."
capricorn,2013-08-26,"You want to gather as much useful information as you can today, since you might mistakenly believe that the solution to your current dilemma is in having all the facts. Unfortunately, you may be in a hurry now, allowing you to make a wrong assumption and jump to an incorrect conclusion that's based on your desires. Acknowledge what you want, but be smart and postpone any major decision until your energy settles down. Your path should begin to clear in just a few days, bringing success within your reach."
aquarius,2013-08-26,"Your craving for connection pushes you one way today, while your need for independence pulls you another. You may long for more intimacy in your everyday life, yet still keep others at an arm's length if you're afraid of losing your autonomy. Thankfully, a sudden breakthrough in your awareness can zap your heart open and instantaneously intensify the dynamics of a relationship. If lightning strikes, set aside practicalities and be flexible enough to fully engage the magic of the moment."
pisces,2013-08-26,"Your perspective on a close relationship could be challenged today, making you weary of the familiar tensions you feel. You don't want to argue with your partner over another misunderstanding; nor do you want to waste energy justifying your desires. Your needs are simple now; you just want your heartfelt disclosure to be heard and acknowledged. Avoid ultimatums; just share what you need in a gentle manner and then be patient. The dynamics are shifting quickly and you just may receive what you want."
aries,2013-08-27,"It's tempting to look only at the positive aspects of a relationship today. Although it may be satisfying to pursue pleasure, avoiding the facts for the sake of convenience won't serve you in the long run. You might even need to overcompensate and act quickly to set the energy right again. It's better to have an experience that you know is real, rather than one that's based on illusions. You'll be happier in the long run if you don't go to extremes."
taurus,2013-08-27,"Your energy is irrepressible today, especially if you sweet talk your way into someone's heart. Your charm is undeniable but be careful; if you lay it on too thickly, your plan could backfire. Luckily, you can enjoy yourself now by taking a more moderate approach. Improving your daily routine by concentrating on sustaining small pleasures is your key to true satisfaction."
gemini,2013-08-27,"Even if you fully intend to respect authority today, you may inadvertently slip into a disagreement with your boss or someone in control. The funny thing is that you can get away with nearly anything now, so there might not be a price to pay for your feisty attitude. However, it's no fun to discover there are limits the hard way by taking things too far. Changing your attitude allows you to use your positive energy to save the day."
cancer,2013-08-27,"Your protective shell breaks open today as you express ideas that you've been keeping secret. There's no reason to worry about what others think; your message will be well received if you are sincere. But if you start out in a defensive posture, they might respond with the attack you were fearing. Be gentle and don't overstate your cause. Ultimately, balancing your confidence with humility puts everyone at ease."
leo,2013-08-27,"Your moods swing wildly today in the shifting breezes of conversations. Although you might believe you're sure of your position, you can change your mind now as fast as a swallow turns in a circle. In fact, others may think you're less stable because you are flying all over the map, but don't worry too much about anyone else's expectations. As long as you refrain from acting like you know it all, people will be highly tolerant of your meanderings. Let your creativity soar and see where it takes you."
virgo,2013-08-27,"You may be feeling a bit anxious because you don't know how others will react to your desires today. Your thoughts keep running into resistance and instead of performing your methodical analysis, you're ready to cause a scene. Your response might be to grow more extreme in your thinking now, as if that will overcome the opposition. Don't waste your time, you won't likely power your way through this one. Keep your eyes open for an opportunity to turn your day around."
libra,2013-08-27,"You are unusually optimistic about love now, and might believe that you can flip nearly any situation into a positive one. Embrace the positive energy; just keep in mind that Jupiter's influence can convince you that everything is wonderful and that all will end well. Thankfully, a current relationship dynamic is likely to improve, but your optimism may have little or nothing to do with reality at this time. Don't deceive yourself into believing that all is okay if it's not. A realistic attitude today prevents disappointment and heartache tomorrow."
scorpio,2013-08-27,"Your need to be honest is being challenged today by your desire to be nice -- not that these feelings are completely mutually exclusive. But there is a gradient and it may be nearly impossible to be truthful without upsetting someone you like. Nevertheless, you must make a choice and live with it. Saying what's on your mind now could stir up trouble in the present moment, but it will improve the emotional flow over the days ahead. Starting from a place of compassion sets a good example for everyone involved."
sagittarius,2013-08-27,"Your desires might be so exaggerated that you can't find satisfaction now that sweet Venus is activating your key planet, Jupiter. The result of this dilemma is a tendency to overeat, over-drink or overindulge your senses. It may feel good for a while, but be forewarned that you're sliding down a slippery slope. Maintaining a high level of awareness today can prevent the morning-after syndrome tomorrow. You can still have fun without reaching a saturation point."
capricorn,2013-08-27,"It may seem as if other people's feelings are at odds with yours today. Or, perhaps the data you receive just doesn't support your previous point of view. Nevertheless, your friends or coworkers might try to gloss over the differences. You, on the other hand, want to keep things real. However, expressing your anger won't bring you any closer to success or happiness. Take a deep breath and gratefully accept the lessons that life is handing you now."
aquarius,2013-08-27,"There's someone out there who has a very special message for you, but you need to open your heart in order to hear it. The blind optimism of Jupiter is pushing sensual Venus, motivating you to take care of your needs, but your energy is poised right at the edge of a cliff. Take a few steps back rather than jumping into the abyss. Your attraction is only going to get stronger over the days ahead. There's no reason to leap before you are ready. Trust your instincts and follow your feelings."
pisces,2013-08-27,"If you don't express your needs now, the chance may not come again for a long time. This moment may soon be lost because a situation in your life has just about reached the end of its road. Take action today, but only if you have the support of others. This isn't the best time to start something on your own. However, working as part of a group can amplify the potential rewards beyond your expectations."
aries,2013-08-28,"You want to say what's on your mind but you need to pick your topics of discussion carefully now because your words might stir up more controversy than you wish. You won't be satisfied following the party line today, yet you still appear to have ideas that are intelligent and sensible. Be clear and stick to the point; others will listen to you even if they don't agree with your opinion. Keeping communication channels open cultivates positive growth."
taurus,2013-08-28,"Although you may be accused of avoiding the tough questions sometimes, no such possibility exists today. You're the one who is pushing for more meaning now and you want others to follow your lead. But even if they can see what brings you closer to your truth, it could lure them further away from theirs. Don't expect people to endorse your thinking by joining your cause; just make certain that it's valid for you before you act on your beliefs. Seek the answers from within."
gemini,2013-08-28,You don't want to make a decision today and yet you know what your preference would be if you were forced to share it with others. Don't let anyone coerce you into talking before you are fully ready or you might end up resenting whoever tries to control you. How much to reveal and when to reveal it is solely your choice alone. A kind word and a smile are enough to keep the peace for now.
cancer,2013-08-28,"You might not feel as lighthearted as you appear today, but others won't realize it unless they overstep their bounds and try to get you to say something you don't actually believe. Fortunately, your endorsement is not up for grabs to the highest bidder. In fact, you might not be driven to engage with someone else's drama right now; you just want to continue doing the best job you can without making any further promises about the future."
leo,2013-08-28,"An apparently casual conversation may lead you into the shadows today, where you can see previously hidden areas of your consciousness. As new ideas continue to rise into awareness, you want to do something about them -- yet it still might be wiser to simply observe while waiting to act on your plans at a later time. Keep in mind that your decision to remain silent adds to your current air of mystery, which is not a bad thing at all. Exploring your dreams now is more productive on your own."
virgo,2013-08-28,"Although you sound quite passionate about many subjects today, you might not be all that interested in sharing your feelings. It's not that you are detached from what you are saying; it's just that this is more of an intellectual exercise now than something of integral importance to you. But you still could get caught up in wanting to be right since Mercury is occupying your logical sign. Backing down from an indefensible position now is a true sign of wisdom."
libra,2013-08-28,"You have a sharper-than-normal edge to your tongue today as clever Mercury forms a smooth connection with incisive Pluto. Your words can cut to the bone and your message could inadvertently do damage before you even realize what has happened. It's one thing to take a swipe at an opponent intentionally; however, it doesn't feel good if you accidentally hurt a friend. Thankfully, taking a compassionate approach right from the start enables you to spread love and light rather than fear."
scorpio,2013-08-28,"You long for some quality downtime today because you've been running at a sustained level of heightened intensity for a while now. Although the pace has begun to wear on your nerves, you are able to rejuvenate your energy by keeping your emotions private. There's no need to tell all your secrets, even if you are feeling more open than usual. Don't give away too much of your time; you gain more power now by taking care of yourself. Clear your schedule to recharge your batteries and regenerate your vitality."
sagittarius,2013-08-28,"It's time to undertake a project at work that requires a serious amount of mental fortitude now since you have the skills to concentrate until the job is done. Luckily, your ability to muster support from friends makes everything run smoother. Although the potential to have fun is always looming near the horizon, don't be distracted until you accomplish something tangible. Dig in your heels today and complete the business at hand."
capricorn,2013-08-28,"You feel as if you have been on an emotional roller coaster and it may finally be time to end the ride today. But you must be creative in your approach when you stand up to those who have made your life more complicated. Don't blame anyone else for your extreme emotions now; if you do, you'll just go around again and again in the same conversation. Instead, accept responsibility for your part in the recent drama and be ready to move on once and for all."
aquarius,2013-08-28,"You may be surprised by the intensity of your own feelings now that relentless Pluto trines Mercury in your 8th House of Intimacy. You assume that you understand the current situation only to discover that everything is not as you perceived. Fortunately, you can think on your feet and are quite capable of quickly regaining your balance. But don't dwell on the past; once things are stable again, let go of any residual negativity you might be holding onto for no reason. Creativity abounds when you stay in the present moment."
pisces,2013-08-28,"There's a part of you that won't be satisfied until you've turned your support network inside out today. Rather than looking for comfort from your friends, you're more interested in having them infuse more meaning into your life. But they might not be proactive enough for you now until you do something radical that catches them off balance. Fortunately, once you shine your light, others will be more likely to follow."
aries,2013-08-29,"Your spontaneous nature is irrepressible now because your thoughts are moving quickly, inspiring you to show off your intelligence and wit. Unfortunately, someone could resent your success if you draw too much attention. There isn't anything wrong with wanting to be noticed, but there's no need to hog the spotlight. Don't waste time trying to impress others; redirect your mental energy to concentrate on doing the best job you can. Let your brilliance shine through your work."
taurus,2013-08-29,"You might become so caught up in wanting to be creative today that you lose track of your real priorities. Fortunately, you don't have to be quite as productive as you think now. Replenish your energy by doing what feels good to your spirit. In fact, temporarily letting your efficiency slip could give you a chance to recharge your batteries, fueling your next great adventure."
gemini,2013-08-29,"Relationship dynamics are tricky because you don't have the patience now to follow through with an intense discussion, even if that's what your partner wants. Although your current avoidance mechanisms are working well with the Moon in your clever sign, sidestepping a difficult conversation only charges the issue with more passion. Thankfully, showing up with a willingness to dig into a tough topic can ultimately lead to the increased intimacy you really crave."
cancer,2013-08-29,"Someone close to you may be blocking your progress, but direct confrontation only increases the resistance today. You are tempted to withdraw and proceed in secret on your own, but there are distinct advantages to working out in the open. Whatever you do now, don't delay your decision. Make up your mind and live with whatever path you choose. Be kind when you let others know your plans, but don't waste time giving endless justifications for your choice. You command admiration simply by remaining true to your beliefs."
leo,2013-08-29,"Making a sensible financial decision today ultimately solidifies your position. You may believe that purchasing beautiful things for those you love is a simple expression of your affection, but others might not care as much as you think they should. Putting on a show with a gift can be a source of temporary enjoyment, but it's more personal to demonstrate your abundant generosity in non-materialistic ways. A sincere gesture from the heart means more than anything you can buy."
virgo,2013-08-29,"Your changing needs add complexity to a current emotional situation, especially if recent experiences get jumbled up with what's happening now. You may be so entangled in your own thoughts that it's challenging to be receptive to someone else's feelings. But letting go of your fear of losing control gives you a chance to share a magical moment with a close friend. Shifting your focus outward increases your compassion and improves your interactions with others."
libra,2013-08-29,"Although you seem quite talkative today, your chattiness might be part of your strategy to keep something hidden from others. However, your secrets could suddenly be brought out in the open. Rather than protecting yourself or someone else by remaining silent, examine the choices that brought you to the current situation and reassess your motives for being so careful about what you say. In the meantime, relying on your instincts allows you to land gracefully on your feet."
scorpio,2013-08-29,"Your anger may explode if you think that someone is trying to take something that's yours. Your hostility might be directed toward a friend who doesn't appear to have your best interests at heart. Unfortunately, the Moon is traveling through some bumpy territory today, increasing the volatility of your emotions. Before you just blurt out your reactions, take a deep breath and think carefully about what you're going to say. Overreacting feels cathartic in the moment but could create a situation that's complicated to untangle. Your message will have more impact if you remain calm, cool and collected."
sagittarius,2013-08-29,"Other people may seem slightly scattered now that the fickle Gemini Moon is visiting your 7th House of Companions. An inconsistent partner can inadvertently motivate you to concentrate your energy even more. You don't want to be perceived as a lightweight, so you might overcompensate and act annoyed in order to get your way. Be careful not to fabricate a problem where there is none, for once you stir up trouble, it won't be so easy to make it go away. Nevertheless, success is more likely if you stay focused on your goals."
capricorn,2013-08-29,"You have a feeling now that something significant in your life is about to change, prompting you to plot further ahead in order to hold on to what you have. Keep in mind that you will need your physical energy as the shift gets underway, so don't fritter away your resources on unimportant activities. Ultimately, exercising self-discipline goes a long way toward establishing healthier routines that prepare you for the amazing future ahead."
aquarius,2013-08-29,"You might be inclined to set off on your own, but you still can benefit from the assistance of a partner now. There may be crucial skills that you lack or, perhaps, you require financial support. Start looking for someone who can provide you with exactly what you need to get your project off the ground. However, caution is advised; don't let others add more input than is necessary or you could be less than happy with the end results. Setting clear boundaries allows you to collaborate without a loss of independence."
pisces,2013-08-29,"One of your friends may be trying to hand you responsibilities that shouldn't really be yours. Unfortunately, there isn't much you can do about it today without creating more problems. Even if you think you are being treated unfairly, you're better off to let it go for now. Move through the day with minimum resistance; you'll have plenty of time later on to settle the score. Taking the high road demonstrates your best self."
aries,2013-08-30,"You may try to emotionally withdraw today, but your friends or co-workers won't let you retreat without good reason. They might seem overly aggressive today, which is an interesting turn since you are often the assertive one. Instead of retreating all the way, find a comfortable halfway point where you still can interact with others so everyone feels satisfied."
taurus,2013-08-30,"Refusing to adapt to someone else's schedule today may be your way of exerting control over an inequality that's actually outside your sphere of influence. Others might think you are being childish, yet you are very serious about leaving yourself a little room now to exercise your flexibility. Normally, it's your desire for stability that people honor, but now it currently works the other way around. Being adaptable allows you to have the most fun."
gemini,2013-08-30,"If you're unsure about your feelings today, you might attempt to overcompensate in order to prevent others from sensing your doubts. You may state your case clearly and then defend it eloquently, convincing everyone that you are passionate about your cause. Meanwhile, your angst could become a problem if your ambivalence remains stronger than your need to choose. Assume the best possible outcome and then take appropriate action; the power of positive thinking can't be overemphasized."
cancer,2013-08-30,"You don't have to say a word for others to understand how you are feeling today. It's as if you're wearing your heart on your sleeve now that the moody Cancer Moon is moving through your 1st House of Personality. Nevertheless, you're likely to talk up a storm once you overcome your inertia and initiate a conversation about a controversial subject. Luckily, you may receive more support than you expect if you're willing to take a risk and share what's on your mind."
leo,2013-08-30,You can accumulate power today by keeping your deepest needs to yourself. The reflective Moon shifts into your 12th House of Secrets early this morning to remind you of the momentum you can build by not telling anyone about your deepest needs. But even your temporary fear of rejection may not be enough to keep you completely isolated. Consider all the valid reasons to hide your agenda. Then stretch beyond your comfort level and lay your cards on the table for all to see. Revealing your vulnerabilities is hard work that will be rewarded sooner than you think.
virgo,2013-08-30,"Your tendency to approach your friends and colleagues with unnecessary caution now is supported by your methodical assessment. Fortunately, your precise perceptions and incisive logic sharpen your intuitive instincts, building your confidence level high enough, prompting you to explain your thought process to others. Don't be afraid to share your gifts -- especially now when your message is so vital."
libra,2013-08-30,"You need to balance your ambitious nature with a softer and more sensitive side of your personality today. On one hand, you're enthusiastic to get ahead now that the Moon shifts into your 10th House of Public Status. On the other hand, your commitment to your family may be even more important than your desire for success. Don't waste time wondering which way to go. Fortunately, your inner voice offers the best advice if you just take time to tune into your imagination and listen."
scorpio,2013-08-30,"You might not be telling anyone about your new plans for the next stage of your life. Maybe it's because you aren't ready for any realistic feedback; however, a fresh perspective can help you fine-tune your ideas. But you aren't so interested in the little details since the wistful Cancer Moon in your 9th House of Big Ideas encourages you to dream about your connection to the universe. Thankfully, you don't have to take an all-or-nothing position. Sharing a few thoughts is a good start and can get the ball rolling in the right direction."
sagittarius,2013-08-30,"You don't have as much time as you think now, so it's unwise to promise the sky unless you're sure you can deliver the goods. Mischievous Mercury supports auspicious Jupiter in your 8th House of Shared Resources, enabling you to profit from a joint enterprise if you are realistic in your assessment. Unfortunately, you could be quick to gloss over an important detail if it stands in your way. Exhibiting confidence is healthy, but only if your optimism is supported by the facts."
capricorn,2013-08-30,"You have your own agenda today and may grow irritable if people make emotional demands on your time. Naturally, you're eager to help a friend, but it may be difficult to let go of your attachment to your previous schedule. Forget about your own agenda for a while and take your cues from others now. Changing your attitude by temporarily shifting your attention away from your personal goals is easier once you realize that it's also for your own good."
aquarius,2013-08-30,"You may be a bit anxious today because the moody Cancer Moon highlights your discomfort with your emotions. Fortunately, your feelings can be a source of strength if you don't attempt to avoid or deny them. Instead of closing down your sensitive perceptions, consciously widen your perspective by concentrating on your long-term goals. Opening your heart deepens your connection with the entire universe."
pisces,2013-08-30,"You can be quite playful now that the Moon is dancing through your 5th House of Fun and Games. However, you still must exercise a bit of discipline because others can make an activity seem so good that you're tempted to drop everything and head off to follow them. Don't wait for your boss to get on your case about something you didn't complete. Finishing your work before you escape will only sweeten your search for pleasure."
aries,2013-08-31,"Thoughts may weigh heavily on your mind now. You have an intuitive sense about what is real and you're motivated to talk your walk, even if you're traveling on a rocky path. You might not know how to proceed, but your uncertainty isn't a valid justification for inaction. Speak the truth that previously existed only within your imagination. Others are more likely to connect with you honestly and lovingly if you can push through your fears and express what's in your heart."
taurus,2013-08-31,"You are tempted to do too much today, but finishing everything you start is nearly impossible. You're familiar with the rules of the road and you're prepared to follow them, even if you want to step out of line and say what's on your mind anyway. Ultimately, you might as well share what you're thinking since others probably already know -- and it's better if they hear it directly from you. Nevertheless, don't transfer blame to anyone else; deliver your messages with compassion and brevity so you can do whatever is next on your list."
gemini,2013-08-31,"You are very contemplative today, but it may be challenging to keep your thoughts on the positive side of the spectrum. Your key planet Mercury aspects karmic Saturn, making you a force with which to be reckoned. Use your formidable communication skills to your advantage, but don't try to be too clever. Keep your message sincere and be your authentic self."
cancer,2013-08-31,"Perhaps you have slipped into a bit of an emotional funk recently and see no quick and easy way out of your dilemma. Thankfully, you don't have to pretend that everything is peachy keen if it's not. Rather than hiding what's important from those who want to love you, take a risk and share what's on your mind. The simple act of confiding in a friend could be enough to shift the energy and lighten your heart."
leo,2013-08-31,"A firestorm of self-awareness is burning through your gray matter, but the results may be uncharacteristically serious. It's not that you have lost confidence; it's just that your optimism comes and goes now. Your tendency is to suppress any negativity, but avoiding the truth just makes things worse. A more radical solution might be in order today. Sharing your feelings without censoring them allows others to get to know the real you."
virgo,2013-08-31,"Your friends come through for you in unexpected ways today. However, making a big deal of their actions might be the wrong strategy because it draws unnecessary attention to issues best left out of the spotlight. Avoiding emotional extremes improves nearly any interaction now. Express your appreciation without going over the top. A simple gesture can be more heart touching than a parade down Main Street."
libra,2013-08-31,"Make a decision and stick with it today, even if you doubt yourself later on. After all, you know what the truth is and you know what should be done about it. Don't be afraid to speak your mind, for you have the authority now to tell it exactly like it is. Granted, you may upset someone with your uncharacteristic obstinacy, but don't let this be your primary concern. You need to voice your opinion and then deal with the consequences as they play out."
scorpio,2013-08-31,"You know that you have the power to manifest the changes that are currently needed. Although somber Saturn is leaning on you, your self-criticism and self-judgment is not productive or necessary. Remember that you are only restrained by the limitations of your own thought processes -- and this comes from within, not from external circumstances or anyone else. Have the courage to envision your wishes coming true and then strive to make it happen."
sagittarius,2013-08-31,"You may be struggling against the lessons that Saturn is attempting to teach you, but the hardest work is probably already completed. The time to put your strategy into action is near and whatever you do today sets the stage for what follows. You might think that you have to demonstrate your progress toward a specific goal, but this isn't part of the current curriculum. Hold true to what's most important to you, but don't be overbearing. Practice compassion while accepting the current restrictions being placed on your plans."
capricorn,2013-08-31,"You're ready to tear down any walls that may be in your way today. However, you are tired of being the one who bears the ultimate responsibility for everything that happens, and you might even consider walking away from your goals. Thankfully, you can rest assured that common sense will come to your rescue now. Move with determination instead of aggression for the best results."
aquarius,2013-08-31,"Try not to take others by surprise with your unusual behavior today, for acting rashly won't bring you what you want. You might not get away with being too eccentric now, so you're better off adapting to the current situation than attempting to change it. Nevertheless, don't dim your light more than necessary or you will lose your edge of brilliance. Find that magical balance between being true to yourself and fulfilling other people's expectations."
pisces,2013-08-31,"Even if you feel like you're carrying an emotional burden today, you have an opportunity to carefully process and release what's been bothering you. There's no reason to hold on to your fears. Doubting yourself is not productive and only prevents you from embracing the love that may be waiting on your doorstep. All you have to do is open the door and let it in."
aries,2013-09-01,"You are driven to get a lot done today, but you're not likely to scatter your energy by running off in too many directions. Make something dramatic happen by setting a goal and concentrating on your intentions, especially in the areas of romance and recreation. Don't obsess about producing too many tangible results or you could miss out on a chance to have fun in the present moment."
taurus,2013-09-01,"You might be feeling as if you have something to say that isn't easily expressed verbally, yet you must use language to communicate. Unfortunately, actions won't necessarily speak louder than words today, because you may not be able to demonstrate what's in your heart. Your behavior can grow quite intense but circumstances could require you to move slower than you wish. Rely on your persistence and not your speed to make sure you deliver your message clearly."
gemini,2013-09-01,"The power of your mind might be your secret weapon today, enabling you to make money from a visionary idea. It's best to act while your confidence is high; overcoming self-doubt isn't easy when the tentative Cancer Moon visits your 2nd House of Self-Esteem. Take advantage of your current fixed purpose -- a trait you sometimes lack. Don't resist your new-found determination; instead, use it to accomplish great things while you are feeling so highly motivated."
cancer,2013-09-01,"Emotional waves wash over you with memories today, bringing up long-forgotten details from your past. There are nuggets of wisdom in what you can remember, but you have to bring these feelings into the present moment. Try connecting your recollections to something that is happening now with the goal of changing your reactions. You don't have to repeat an old mistake; letting go of unrealistic expectations frees you to move into new territory with a clean slate."
leo,2013-09-01,"Hidden currents can quickly pull you into deep waters today, but you may exhaust yourself trying to fight against the relentlessness of these tides. Your best strategy is to flow along with the powerful circumstances unfolding in your life. Don't try to control what is beyond your capability. Instead, make an alternative plan and then wait for the right time to act. Your progress will meet little resistance once the timing is right."
virgo,2013-09-01,"You are stretching your wings today because you believe that pretty much anything is possible. The previous limitations you placed on yourself enabled you to keep your feet on the ground, but now you are ready to fly. Whatever you want to do begins in your mind. Dream about it first, and then do whatever it takes to make your vision real."
libra,2013-09-01,"Although your logic tells you one thing and your feelings say something else, there is a viable solution to your dilemma within reach. Unfortunately, your infamous Libra indecisiveness won't buy you much time today. You have to make up your mind and stick with your decision. You might be pleasantly surprised as others show up now to support you and help you make the changes that you most desire."
scorpio,2013-09-01,"Spending time with your friends today sounds like a great idea, but your personal needs could get lost in all the noise. Instead of just going along with the crowd, honor your heart's desires first. Unfortunately, you may have to wander off on your own to find peace and quiet. Once you have reconnected with your center, partaking in social activities will be much more pleasurable for everyone involved."
sagittarius,2013-09-01,"You have the strength of purpose to finish whatever you start today. You might even be so driven now that you're planning everything you want to accomplish next week. However, there's still a part of you that might not want to do anything at all. You wish you could just kick back and have a good time, but you cannot ignore your responsibilities. Take the high road and save the fun for another time. It's more important to make progress toward your goals than to rest on your laurels. Carpe diem!"
capricorn,2013-09-01,"You're not interested in playing the role of the peacemaker today because you have your own agenda to follow. Nevertheless, someone may continue to bug you to act as a go-between until you acquiesce. Unfortunately, you're uncomfortable if you're pushed into an emotionally charged situation since you know that you don't have a practical solution in mind. However, there's no reason to avoid all entanglements; you stand to win more than anyone else from honestly engaging with others."
aquarius,2013-09-01,"Everything might feel a little out of whack today, especially if you get sucked into someone's emotional drama that's not directly related to you. Establish clear boundaries and don't be afraid to go back over ground that you've already covered, if necessary. You have a much better chance of getting what you want if you come right out and state your needs now. The squeaky wheel gets the grease."
pisces,2013-09-01,"Relationship dynamics grow quite intense today, but you gain strength from emotional interactions with others. At first, expanding your perspective sounds like a great idea, but you might not be ready to give up your point of view. Too much resistance to change could force you to repeat an old cycle one more time. Learning a karmic lesson now frees you from the past so you can fully connect with others in the present moment."
aries,2013-09-02,"You are enthusiastic about your future prospects, yet as soon as you make your move, the energy begins to disperse. The problem is that you must figure out where you want to go before your new path is revealed. Nevertheless, this doesn't lessen the likelihood of a significant shift. Something's going to change; you just need to decide what. Adopting a proactive approach enables you to be in charge of the direction you take."
taurus,2013-09-02,"You may have to respond to an unexpected twist of fate, testing your confidence. But this unscheduled hiccup isn't necessarily negative, for you can turn an upsetting situation into one that is quite enjoyable. Still, you probably won't know where the day will take you, even if you have a well-developed plan in place. Don't worry if things fall apart; they will reorganize into something better in the next few days. Embrace the chaos as a vehicle for creating positive change."
gemini,2013-09-02,"Your concern over losing independence is triggered now that new responsibilities are weighing heavily on you. Unfortunately, you are probably more scattered than usual, so find somewhere to sit alone in a quiet place to reclaim your center. This little exercise to eliminate some of the extraneous noise in your life can turn your day around. Thankfully, you may be pleasantly surprised how easy it is once you remove the unnecessary distractions."
cancer,2013-09-02,"Facing an unusual set of circumstances is not your idea of a fun-filled day. Others, it seems, are not playing the current game according to your rules. Although confusion might not seem like a source of happiness, an unplanned detour could bring additional freedom that enables you to respond in new ways. Trusting your intuition can help you stabilize the imbalanced situation and save the day."
leo,2013-09-02,"A bit of confusion now isn't as worrisome as it seems at first. You are on a creative roll, so keep your eyes wide open so you can recognize the truth when you see it. It doesn't matter whether or not information is coming from totally unexpected quarters. You are being shown an extreme solution to a problem that doesn't have a normal way out. Take a leap of faith and fly."
virgo,2013-09-02,"Your dilemma is that logic and practicality won't fix anything now, which doesn't make you happy one bit. After all, you are itching for a dramatic transformation. Tread carefully because there is irrepressible movement stimulating tension within a relationship. If you attempt to withhold your energy, it could be awkwardly expressed by someone else. It's better, of course, when change originates from your heart."
libra,2013-09-02,"You are considered to be a champion of harmony and grace, but you might not feel so accommodating today. Expect sudden shifts of energy, even if you have trouble putting your finger on the source. If someone suggests an idea that you can't immediately wrap your mind around, don't judge it too quickly. Let the thought unfold completely before you dismiss it as crazy. It's crucial to remain open to radical change and a new perspective offers you a chance to build something real and lasting."
scorpio,2013-09-02,"Your friends might seem rather rigid in their thinking today, possibly pushing you to lose your temper and yell loudly as you try to wake them up to the truth. Even if you are thinking about the sacrifices you made and the freedom you gave up, don't try to force others to see things your way. Concentrate on the dynamics of what's happening and don't focus on any one particular outcome. Keeping your options open helps others to do the same."
sagittarius,2013-09-02,"You may be chasing a rainbow today, only to see it reappear over the next hill again and again. You have grown weary of the disappointments and frustrations and are reaching another fork in the road. You want to make something happen right away and you're eager to go where you've never gone. Change is in the air; initiating bold action greatly improves your chances of finding the pot of gold."
capricorn,2013-09-02,"Escaping the stress is nearly impossible if you insist on your world being neat and tidy with everything under control. However, seeking the safety of stable structures isn't an option today. Whatever you have relied on in the past is now shifting. Fortunately, once you move beyond your fear of the unknown, you may find your journey quite exhilarating. Free your mind and enjoy the ride."
aquarius,2013-09-02,"Your life feels unsettled today, yet something may happen that helps to facilitate the changes you want. A close friend or partner might demand your assistance, even if you can't deliver what's needed. Instead of stressing about an impossible situation, explain your limited availability as objectively as you can. Although you could have to manage someone else's disappointment, a compassionate approach should smooth over any ruffled feathers along the way."
pisces,2013-09-02,"You are usually willing to go along with the changing tides, even if permanent shifts don't always come easily to you. However, you have a wonderful opportunity now to alter your direction if you can remain adaptable to the current situation. You inspire others with your faith, especially if you aren't afraid of taking radical action at the right time. Remember, it's the dramatic gestures that will have the most impact today."
aries,2013-09-03,"Watch your step today, instead of behaving recklessly. Your good intentions could backfire if you respond so quickly that you do something that offends a coworker or acquaintance. Save your sarcastic repartee and practical jokes for another day when the tensions aren't so tightly wired. Your rapid-fire reactions have the potential of acting like a lit match on a pile of dried hay. Avoid a difficult situation by taking a deep breath and thinking about the possible consequences before doing anything drastic."
taurus,2013-09-03,"Your friends might be worried that you will lose your temper today, but you have more than enough self-control to maintain your cool. It's not a good idea to become unhinged because reacting spontaneously isn't as effective now as sticking to your original plan. Nevertheless, there's no need to slip into denial about your feelings. Simply add a little time between the flash of awareness and when you actually jump in and do something about it. Look before you leap."
gemini,2013-09-03,"Share your ideas with your colleagues today, but don't take your disclosures too far. You might be tempted to put everything out on the table and then push for a positive response, but it's smarter to unveil your new plan slowly. Revealing too much information too fast overwhelms others and may cause them to withhold support. It's to your advantage to build up interest gradually, even if you must delay the big show until after Thursday's New Moon. In the meantime, fine tune your presentation for the greatest impact."
cancer,2013-09-03,"You must be very careful on the job today because you might inadvertently stir up resistance to your plans. You're traveling through some tricky territory and could feel the pressure to relieve your anxiety by setting everything right in one clean swoop. However, overreacting won't solve anything now. Adopting a positive attitude will ultimately help you accomplish more work than a panicky one; keep calm by breathing through the stress."
leo,2013-09-03,"It's challenging to get anything done today because you might enjoy the attention you receive too much. It's hard to step out of the spotlight now that irrepressible Mars and the responsive Moon are moving through your dramatic sign. Others can't help but notice when you swing into motion. Remember, it really doesn't matter if you are seen or not, so don't purposefully seek recognition if you really want to finish all your work. Make the most of your current influence to shine your light on something that really matters."
virgo,2013-09-03,"Your analytical approach works well for you these days with the Sun and Mercury visiting your intelligent sign. However, a stressful aspect to unpredictable Uranus generates mental static now, making it impossible to think clearly. Unfortunately, you might not be able to delay an important decision today; just make sure that you separate your personal preferences from the facts so you can remain as objective as possible. Trust your innate ability to cut through the noise and solve the problem at hand."
libra,2013-09-03,"You don't always enjoy being the one that everyone relies on to arbitrate a dispute. In fact, you might want to relinquish some of your relationship responsibilities today if you don't feel up to the job. However, it may take a while for your wish to be granted. Even if you are frustrated and tempted to walk away from something important now, don't do it yet. Let the dynamics unfold naturally because a surprising change of circumstances later in the day could dramatically shift your thinking in an exciting new direction."
scorpio,2013-09-03,"Talking about your feelings today might not bring the exact results you seek. People may be open to hearing your story, but that doesn't mean they will agree with your conclusions or join in your cause. It's probably not the most opportune time to gather support for your plan because you don't know how others will react. Let go of your personal agenda for now and return to it after Thursday's New Moon when your chances of success improve. In the meantime, continue developing your best ideas because one of them could lead to a significant breakthrough."
sagittarius,2013-09-03,"Anticipation about a new project may drive you to the edge of a cliff today, but there's little chance of slipping and falling as long as you watch the ground directly in front of you. However, your excitement might be sufficient to distract you, and danger could sneak in if the adrenaline rush is too strong. Don't become so enamored with the potential adventure that your judgment becomes sloppy. You won't likely make any tactical errors if you pay careful attention to every step you take."
capricorn,2013-09-03,"Your relationships may seem quite intense today, requiring you to become more emotionally involved than you prefer. You don't want someone else's needs to get in the way of your plans now, yet it's complicated to extricate yourself from the melodrama that appears at your doorstep. Consider if your intended retreat is based on practical matters or if you simply want to avoid your own discomfort with the situation. Don't withdraw from intimacy because you are scared; show your courage by facing your fears instead."
aquarius,2013-09-03,"If you're feeling a bit off center today, you might respond inappropriately to a friend or partner unless you take the time to think first. The Sun zaps your key planet Uranus, overloading you with so many ingenious ideas that they may not be of any use in the real world. Nevertheless, brilliant thoughts can open your mind to new horizons. Your smartest strategy is to sit with your altered perspective for a bit instead of reacting so quickly that you turn your world upside down. Fools rush in where angels fear to tread."
pisces,2013-09-03,"You're acutely tuned into your psychic powers now and may even believe that you know exactly what to do at every unexpected twist in the road. Overall, your instincts should serve you well today. However, you could miss an important fact if you become overconfident, only to discover later that you're heading down a dead-end street. Fortunately, it's simple to restore balance by adding a bit of common sense to your intuitive approach. However, it never hurts to bring a map along just in case."
aries,2013-09-04,"You could blow your top if you are uncertain how to handle today's intense energy, but it's crucial to move past your personal needs and think about everyone involved. Your key planet Mars connects with subtle yet powerful forces as it pushes you to take a risk by stepping outside of your usual modes of expression. Fortunately, you have the power to impact others in a positive way now if you choose to take the high road and lead by example."
taurus,2013-09-04,"You may not be in the mood to socialize today because you would rather finish your work. Luckily, you can enjoy expressing your creativity while also being practical in your approach. In fact, nearly anything you do now could be turned into a good time. Just don't become so preoccupied that you miss a chance to partake in a bit of fun with your friends. All work and no play isn't the healthiest way to live your life."
gemini,2013-09-04,"Sometimes you give the impression you are scattered, but you probably know what you are doing now and why you are doing it. Others observe you starting so many projects today that they assume you could not possibly finish them all. Nevertheless, you might ultimately have the last laugh when all your separate tasks magically fall into place. However, this won't happen on its own, so persistently work toward your goals throughout the entire day to get the results you want."
cancer,2013-09-04,"You have a lot on your mind now, but might find it more efficient to keep all the loose ends to yourself because they are easier to manage if you don't tell others what's going on. Don't be surprised if something slips out or if people catch wind of the drama you're trying to hide in the closet. Regardless of your fears, it will probably feel better for all involved once the truth is out."
leo,2013-09-04,"You might be feeling financial pressures that are challenging to ignore today. Nevertheless, you can relieve the tension by addressing the issues head on instead of pretending they don't exist. Fortunately, there may be a magical solution to your problem, even if you aren't exactly sure what it is yet. A mystery friend could come to the rescue with exactly the right advice, or a bluebird could fly into your life with just what you need. Remain approachable -- and keep your windows open."
virgo,2013-09-04,"Although prioritizing your feelings makes sense, denying the inconvenient ones eventually causes trouble. The Moon's return to your sign today reawakens your need to discriminate which of your desires are most important. But you can take this analytical process to an extreme. Repressed emotions have a way of resurfacing with increased power. Let your mind wander as your moods change, but don't express every single thought as if it is your final answer. Remain open to change as your perspective continues to shift."
libra,2013-09-04,"You might feel as if someone is sneaking around  behind your back today, but your desire to uncover a secret conspirator could create more problems than it solves. Rather than seeking the source of the current tension in your environment, it may be wiser to simply change your attitude about your reality. You are capable of performing social wizardry now. Demonstrate your competence through positive action and watch the external resistance fade away."
scorpio,2013-09-04,"Your natural attraction to intensity is muted by the emotionally cool Virgo Moon today, but even an unpleasant situation won't necessarily stop you from talking. Ardent Mars is pushing you to express your heart's desire now, even if your delivery is constrained by the limitations of the current circumstances. At first, you might not be satisfied with the direction of a conversation, but a passionate exchange with someone you respect can open a door to deeper intimacy."
sagittarius,2013-09-04,"You should be able to retain your composure today even if someone's unexpected outburst seems out of place. If you don't know what to make of the surprising disclosure, there's a good chance you won't say anything at all. Unfortunately, your silence could cause you to miss a significant opportunity to further develop a friendship. Take a risk now and share your heartfelt reaction. Nothing ventured, nothing gained."
capricorn,2013-09-04,"It's tempting to go through the entire day without revealing your emotions. However, keeping cool isn't a license to be dishonest; just consider what's important to share and what should be kept to yourself for now. Still, you may approach others in a manner that seems aggressive to them. Fortunately, putting extra effort into vigorous exercise or a long walk today can bring relief by taking the edge off your feelings. You don't have to be the Rock of Gibraltar all the time."
aquarius,2013-09-04,"You might not be ready to engage the passion that someone else seems to want from you today. But withdrawing emotionally just increases the drama. Instead of closing down, tell others exactly how you feel, even if you know it's not what they want to hear. Your carefully worded disclosure can establish safe boundaries while also setting the stage for a deeper connection, leaving everyone feeling better in the long run."
pisces,2013-09-04,"It seems like someone is raining on your parade today, but others could just be trying to help in their own way. Rather than over-personalizing constructive criticism, remain open to the advice you receive. Even if the tone of the message isn't as loving as you wish, push past your insecurities and figure out how you can improve yourself. There's an important lesson waiting to be discovered, but it will take courage for you to learn it."
aries,2013-09-05,"Be careful about taking on too many new projects at work as today's New Moon in your 6th House of Employment highlights your daily routine. Consider the pros and cons in great depth before making a final decision. But it's not just about reassessing choices on the job. Relationships need attention too now, and intimacy doesn't come easily if you have fallen into a rut. Thankfully, you can still reach satisfaction if you are willing to go out on a limb and say what's on your mind."
taurus,2013-09-05,"You're drawn toward creative endeavors that have some kind of practical application today. The Virgo New Moon rattles your 5th House of Romance, adding the possibility of sweet love into the mix. Nevertheless, you must be serious and meet all your obligations before you go off to have fun. Luckily, once you establish a sustainable rhythm, you might become so involved with your work that it seems like play, anyway."
gemini,2013-09-05,"You aren't all that eager to share your feelings with others today. In fact, you could be quite reclusive as the shy Virgo New Moon hides in your 4th House of Family. You are more likely to stick close to home because you may not want to be around crowds. Don't fall into the trap of believing there is anything wrong just because you aren't particularly sociable now. Even the most interactive Gemini still needs an occasional break to recharge his or her batteries. Enjoy the peace and quiet while you can."
cancer,2013-09-05,"Eliminating extraneous tasks helps you cope with your busy schedule today, because otherwise you won't be able to finish everything on your plate. You could work yourself up into an anxious state by trying to carry out an overly ambitious plan. Save yourself from a headache and take time to indulge in a bit of rest and relaxation. With the New Moon's emphasis on your 3rd House of Immediate Environment, it's smarter to concentrate your energy than to scatter it."
leo,2013-09-05,"You can't spend as much money as you might wish today, for the Virgo New Moon's presence in your 2nd House of Material Resources requires you to avoid unnecessary purchases. Although you may not have as much funds in your bank account as you thought, the real reason to postpone buying something is because you don't need it. Make your life more efficient by streamlining your finances and practicing self-restraint."
virgo,2013-09-05,"You're more likely to share your emotions now that the New Moon is in your earthy sign. Unfortunately, no matter what you plan, everything seems to take more work than you expect. It's true that life isn't always easy, but don't slip into negativity or you could end up wasting the insightful wisdom that is at your disposal. Just make sure the decisions you make today are fiscally sound; a practical approach makes your heart happy in the long run."
libra,2013-09-05,"You don't want everyone to know how picky you are feeling today. You might choose to hide your fussiness by presenting a more acceptable side of your personality. The New Moon falls in your 12th House of Secrets so don't be afraid of keeping some thoughts private. Although the New Moon forms a supportive aspect with confident Jupiter, it won't likely be enough to offset your solitary mood. Don't allow others to assume the worst; it's smarter to explain your concerns instead of pretending that everything is okay."
scorpio,2013-09-05,"You take your friendships quite seriously and the New Moon's presence in your 11th House of Social Networking reaffirms your need for meaningful relationships. Unfortunately, you can become overly anxious today about something that isn't very significant. Don't let your high standards turn into unrealistic demands since your drive for perfection could push others away. Instead, be more accepting now; your flexibility will ultimately strengthen the connections that matter the most."
sagittarius,2013-09-05,"You are highly motivated to get ahead at work as today's hardworking Virgo New Moon lands in your 10th House of Public Responsibility. Make plans for the not-too-distant future, but remember that Mercury's lingering contact with resistant Saturn may slow you down until next week. Set your plan in motion now and continue to build momentum until you reach optimum speed. There's no reason to wait for a better time to start."
capricorn,2013-09-05,"You are the designated answer-person because you just seem to know what comes next with today's Virgo New Moon falling in your 9th House Big Ideas. Your calm demeanor and common sense appear to do the trick in nearly any situation now. Luckily, your organizational skills are also in great shape, so you should be able to execute your plan smoothly. Don't hesitate; get busy and use your current planetary advantage wisely."
aquarius,2013-09-05,"Exploring relationship dynamics may be awkward because talking about your emotions isn't always your highest priority. However, there are treasures hidden beneath the surface and you stand to learn an important lesson now if you don't go racing off to solve the next intellectual problem. Fortunately, today's Virgo New Moon occurs in your 8th House of Deep Sharing, inspiring you to ask tough questions about delicate issues. Be courageous; expressing your vulnerability can bring you closer to someone you love."
pisces,2013-09-05,"The beginning of a relationship cycle holds many promises for the future because the dedicated Virgo New Moon activates your 7th House of Partners. But inflated hopes might have to be brought back down to Earth because your confidence is magnified by buoyant Jupiter today. Fortunately, you can avoid later disappointment if you scale back your expectations sooner than later. Establishing realistic goals now allows you to bask in the light of recognition once you manifest your dreams."
aries,2013-09-06,"You're tempted to take job-related stress home today, but if you do others could become annoyed with your bad mood. You might feel as if you're on a collision course with reality, yet you can avoid an unpleasant scene by being more compassionate and listening to those you love. Remember, your attitude has more impact than you realize, so don't spread negativity by focusing on your problems. Stop talking about what could go wrong and concentrate on the highest potential instead."
taurus,2013-09-06,"You prefer to have an easygoing attitude about your current obligations, but there doesn't seem to be enough hours in the day to find time to relax. You want to finish your work today, but you cannot get away with performing as you have in the past. Don't fall into a rut; step outside of the box and make something exciting happen. Trying a new approach could lead to the breakthrough you need to increase your productivity."
gemini,2013-09-06,"There's no reason to bring up a subject today that has already been discussed one too many times. Nagging won't help you get what you want. Even though you might be uncharacteristically clinging to a past memory, others are eager to move on. Thankfully, if you pause and think about how your words could cause hurt feelings now, you may prevent an uncomfortable situation from occurring. Switching your focus to a creative activity enables you to focus on the present moment."
cancer,2013-09-06,"Although you want to be fair-minded today, it's easy to go overboard and ignore the action behind the scenes. You might perceive others as more optimistic now than they actually are, tricking you into thinking that everything is all right. But the real meaning of your current interactions may be connected to an intent that's so subtle you miss the point. Do your best to listen to what's being said in the silence between the spoken words to tune into the underlying truth."
leo,2013-09-06,An old issue may resurface today if a close friend or coworker says something hurtful that on any other day would have been harmless. But insensitive words could stimulate a difficult memory. One strategy to regain your composure is to distinguish between what happened in the past and what's occurring in the present. Keep in mind that you are not in the same place as you were before. Simply acknowledge the feeling and move on.
virgo,2013-09-06,"Sticking to the truth is absolutely crucial today because your current tendency to turn an event into something bigger than it actually is can be problematic. Be clear and direct when communicating your dissatisfaction if you're not happy, but stop once you've stated the facts or your message may be diluted. Above all, aim to keep all interactions grounded in reality. There will be plenty of time to dream later on."
libra,2013-09-06,"You may be feeling very vulnerable after the evocative Moon returns to your sign today. You might even overcompensate by keeping your interactions as detached and rational as possible. However, withdrawing isn't a wise strategy now because the Moon tends to amplify your mood swings. Fortunately, focusing on your goals at work, rather than more personal issues, can temporarily alleviate your angst. It will be more productive to address your emotions once the storm has passed."
scorpio,2013-09-06,"Burying your most intense emotions isn't new to you, yet you can rationalize your secrecy today once the Moon sneaks into your 12th House of Privacy. You might even put up a smokescreen by encouraging others to share their vulnerabilities so you don't have to disclose your own. It's easier to listen than to talk now, unless you're in the company of a trusted friend. However, even if you feel safe and are willing to open up, be careful about revealing too much. It may be more appropriate to process your strongest reactions on your own."
sagittarius,2013-09-06,"Your restlessness grows today, prompting you to take on more than you can handle. Although you might be able to talk your way through a tricky situation of your own creation, the conversation still could leave you feeling dissatisfied and on edge. Doing more won't solve your dilemma now; instead, graciously accept what's on your plate without looking for something else to distract you. Count your blessings; happiness is a frame of mind and is not solely based upon your accomplishments."
capricorn,2013-09-06,"You might feel anxious if your current responsibilities seem overwhelming, but you can't just walk away from them. Although promising to do even more tomorrow can buy you some time today, this strategy isn't wise since you won't likely be able to fulfill your obligations then, either. Instead, start early and work hard to get as much as possible out of the way before any additional tasks are placed on your shoulders. Put your ambition to work and let your competence shine."
aquarius,2013-09-06,"You're determined to reach your goals but a series of distractions may pull you off course now. Unfortunately, your desire to be different makes it trickier to cooperate with others. You could get so caught up with demonstrating your unorthodox approach today that you lose touch with what can be gained through compromise. Worry less about rebelling against the status quo and more about reaching your desired destination."
pisces,2013-09-06,"You might want to escape to fantasyland today, but you won't likely be able to afford this luxury. Your penchant for daydreaming could be overwhelmed by a series of twists and turns that put you on a new course. It isn't easy to avoid your real world responsibilities now, but it also may be tough to maintain a consistent level of productivity. Your smartest strategy is to temporarily set aside your personal agenda and do whatever you must to meet your current obligations."
aries,2013-09-07,"You can easily see both sides of nearly any issue today, making it challenging to know exactly what to do. You might even wonder if you're up for the conversation because you're unclear as to where it could lead. Although you're trying to keep your feet on the ground, the real world may seem more distant than your dreams. Remember, you have the ability to tap in to a deeper sense of power if you can just cut through the fog and get out of your own way."
taurus,2013-09-07,"You may find yourself more interested in how things feel now than the truth of what's behind the mask. You need to be careful today, for you can make incorrect assumptions about something or someone based upon their presentation without even considering what's beneath the surface. A little makeup goes a long way, so if you have an important choice in front of you, remember not to judge the book by its cover. Taking the time to dig deeper improves your chances of making the best decision."
gemini,2013-09-07,"There are unintelligible mysteries lurking within your dreams today and you must fight them head on or embrace them; otherwise, they may get the best of you. If you choose combat, utilize your mental agility and your clever repartee; brute force won't conquer any dragons now. Your safest course of action is to engage any adversaries as equals. Working with them as allies, instead of treating them as enemies, is much more beneficial for everyone in the long run."
cancer,2013-09-07,"You are eager to share the magic of bold fantasies in the midst of difficult times, and today can be uplifting as long as you don't completely buy into your own illusions or the illusions of others. You are wrestling these days with complex circumstances and you may feel the need to make major decisions. Keep your mind on the big picture so you don't get confused about which thoughts are your own and which are coming from someone else."
leo,2013-09-07,"You're quite confident that you know what the best course of action is -- not only for yourself, but also for those you love. However, you could become too sure of yourself today. Your pride can get in the way of allowing others the chance to figure it out for themselves. Acting more flexible than you feel now helps you enjoy the day and keeps your friends happier, too."
virgo,2013-09-07,"You actually feel more centered than might be expected of you today, but it's still somewhat difficult to interpret all the mixed signals. If situations seem to be larger than life, remind yourself that there is a bit of illusory magnification going on now. However, it's time to be realistic by letting go of your inflated dreams and simplifying your life. Putting things in perspective enables you to accomplish more than you imagine."
libra,2013-09-07,"Your fantasy world temporarily takes over the real world today, so pay particular attention to how you are reacting to the changing circumstances. Keep reminding yourself how you would respond on a typical day, but remember that these aren't typical times. It might prove too noisy to collect your thoughts now. Nevertheless, if you can find a place to meditate or relax, your perspective will improve, allowing you to be practical while still honoring your imagination."
scorpio,2013-09-07,"There's something about the craziness of your life now that is mildly amusing to you, even though you may long for the return to the days of less scattered energy. It's tough to focus today because you're being pulled all over the map by other people's needs. Give serious thought to reshuffling your priorities. Seeking inspiration from someone you admire inspires you to create positive change."
sagittarius,2013-09-07,"You're traveling through impractical realms today, and you might even feel a pleasant buzz in spite of the chaos around you. Be careful of what you wish for because you may want something or someone that is totally out of reach. Knowing your limitations may not stop you from trying, but reality could step in and wake you from your daydream. Practicing self-restraint makes more sense than going too far and running into trouble."
capricorn,2013-09-07,"There is a delicate balance between your optimism and pessimism now, but for some reason you can't hold on to the positive energy for long. Enthusiastic Mars is moving toward an alignment with your key planet, somber Saturn, and your big ideas must face a real test in just a few days. Try to uncover all the facts behind the zealous sales pitch. Even if you don't have certainty about your current direction, you will gain clarity soon enough if you believe in yourself."
aquarius,2013-09-07,"Resolving your feelings in personal relationships is complicated business, even though you have a rather practical perspective now. However, your desires may actually work against your fantasies today. Nevertheless, you still yearn to do something totally outrageous. Reach into your future with a little more gusto than usual. Your chances for success look better these days than ever before."
pisces,2013-09-07,"For every confusing feeling you have of self-doubt today, there is a corresponding one of unbridled optimism. The vitality of the Sun is supporting Jupiter now, giving rise to thoughts that push you beyond the boundaries of your current circumstances. Live with the paradox of knowing that everything is okay and not okay at the very same time. Have faith and focus on the positive potential."
aries,2013-09-08,"Breaking free from the restraints that hold you back is complicated if you keep running into more obstacles. It could feel like a losing battle, because each problem you solve today quickly turns into two more. The harder you push to tie up the loose ends, the more things seem to tangle up. Fortunately, it's not nearly as hopeless as it might appear at first. Back off a bit and don't try so hard; some of the resistance may be of your own creation."
taurus,2013-09-08,"There is a strong emphasis on your work today, but an unaddressed emotional issue might prevent you from accomplishing your goals. You are bumping up against an awkward energy that isn't easy to engage because it's not aimed directly at you. Nevertheless, don't participate in petty disagreements, because they won't improve your current situation. Fly under the radar now and do what you must, without attracting too much attention to yourself. Your low-key approach won't go unappreciated by those who matter."
gemini,2013-09-08,"Your life may be noisy today as tensions become obvious and there seems to be no way around an unpleasant situation. But, of course there is a viable path, especially because circumstances continue to change throughout the day. You still might be sorting out your feelings by the evening, but the problem itself could very well be in the past. Your discomfort will pass if you let your emotions run their course without interference from your analytical mind."
cancer,2013-09-08,"You might feel like a real life Crab that has been left high and dry by unpredictable changes in the tide. Then, just in the nick of time, the emotional waters unexpectedly wash back into your life. Don't push your feelings away -- even if you're afraid that they are overwhelming. Avoid labels, since good and bad are just intellectual judgments. Acknowledging your shifting moods is all that's necessary at this time."
leo,2013-09-08,"You may be on a slow-motion collision course today with a lover, partner or friend. Although you might attempt to avoid a confrontation, it's healthier to face the music and just get it over with. There could be very real disagreements over fundamental issues, and the more you talk about them, the more complicated they become. Nevertheless, stick with it. It's always darkest right before the dawn; a breakthrough can happen when you least expect it."
virgo,2013-09-08,"You want to share your crazy plans now that trickster Mercury is playing a major role in the picture. However, the mental agitation is annoying, preventing you from enjoying an exchange that might normally be quite pleasant. Although you're yearning to break free from your routine, the pressure of responsibility will likely restrain you for a while. You must follow through on your previous commitments. Don't worry; you will get your chance for change soon enough."
libra,2013-09-08,"A fantastic idea may become problematic as you bog down in the execution, especially if it involves home or family issues. If you don't think through the consequences of an off-the-cuff remark, you might need to deal with the aftermath sooner than you think. Although this is not ultimately a difficult day, you still probably have to work harder than usual just to keep things moving in a healthy direction. Remember, your positive attitude makes all the difference in the world."
scorpio,2013-09-08,"You're in your power now and you might even be surprised by the current intensity, but you are equipped to handle nearly any brewing storm. The next few days may seem like the kind of exam that you can't study for; nevertheless, paying attention to the signs can tilt the scales in your favor. Don't try to hold on to the status quo. Let the uncertainties lead you through the transformation ahead without dwelling on any irrational fears. Follow your intuition with confidence and everything will be alright."
sagittarius,2013-09-08,"Sometimes you sound like you know everything because you often do understand more than others. However, it's most helpful to admit what you don't know before you find yourself in over your head. There may be many loose ends to tie up, so it could be useful to have assistance. Don't pretend that you have it all together now unless you actually do. You have less to prove than you might think and more to gain if you're willing to ask for help."
capricorn,2013-09-08,"It seems as if you already did all the steps  possible to further your career; unfortunately, something still isn't quite right. Perhaps you overlooked a tiny detail that grows bigger as the day progresses. Maybe someone throws a wrench into the gears of time and you're not prepared for what happens next. You're able to take it all in stride if you have done your homework. But, if you haven't prepared wisely, your plan can fall apart and you will need to make it right before moving on."
aquarius,2013-09-08,"You might be judged for what you say or what you write, even if your ideas are sound. Your concepts could even be brilliant now, but as you act on your thoughts, something may not work as imagined. Revise your thinking based upon your experience. If you assume you know it all, you don't. However, you have what it takes if you are open to change -- and others can't help but notice your positive attitude."
pisces,2013-09-08,"Someone at work may give you a hard time today, but having an external reason to practice self-discipline is exactly what you need at this time. However, the resistance you face could be troublesome if you are the methodical type; a disturbed routine might make you less efficient for a while. But once you adapt to your new pace, you will feel re-energized and more enthusiastic about your future."
aries,2013-09-09,"Although you usually have enough stamina to concentrate on whatever needs your attention, your energy may not last throughout the day. Your key planet Mars is encouraging you to speed up, yet you must restrain your impulses now because authoritative Saturn is saying slow down. Frustration can turn into depression if you don't find something exciting to motivate you into action. Tackling even the smallest endeavor today will give you the confidence boost you need."
taurus,2013-09-09,"Others may encourage you to start a project today, but you might not be interested in doing much at all. Your resistance to work now isn't about laziness; it's strictly business. You wonder whether or not your extra effort will really make a difference. External coercion only makes you more stubborn. Trust your judgment, for you probably won't accomplish anything unless you are willing to exert yourself beyond the call of duty."
gemini,2013-09-09,"Your apprehension about how much you have on your plate today may feel overwhelming, but you can't avoid your duties. Even if you prefer to take the day off, something happens that shifts your energy into high gear. Face your chores with a generous sense of humor. You are being tested for a reason, yet it might take a few days to realize what it's all about."
cancer,2013-09-09,"Take a risk by acting spontaneously, but don't do anything unless you know that your behavior is helpful. However tempted you may be to express yourself, initiating action might seem like an uphill battle unless you have a concrete plan. If you're not sure about your goals, you could respond to the overwhelming choices of the day by withdrawing from reality. However, waiting until the noise subsides doesn't make the underlying issues go away. Be brave and step up to the plate. Living authentically will get easier once you are in motion."
leo,2013-09-09,"A variety of circumstances may stir up anxiety, pushing you close to the boiling point now. But just before the meltdown temperature is reached, your feelings cool down just enough to prevent a scene from happening. Although you don't want your emotions to spill over, withholding them will just make matters worse. Keeping your eyes on the big picture can circumvent any unneeded frustration."
virgo,2013-09-09,"Managing your current problems can be tricky business now. However, going through the motions may offer you some relief from the discomfort. Be realistic about your expectations because it's quite likely that nothing will be solved right away. Fortunately, you have an excellent chance for success in the future as long as you remain practical today."
libra,2013-09-09,"You are being pushed and pulled all over the map now; you might even be close to snapping like an over-stretched rubber band. Expressing your anger toward a loved one won't help matters. No matter how much a situation is bothering you, today's solution requires you to change your attitude first. And while you're doing your inner work, indulge in some healthy outer distractions, too, like a spectator sport, a movie or a good book."
scorpio,2013-09-09,"It may seem like everyone is being stubborn today, yet you wish they could be more flexible. Unfortunately, someone else's adaptability won't solve your problems since you might have become too rigid in your thinking. Your issues are reflected by the circumstances in your life, yet it's easier to project the blame onto another person else. Thankfully, your frustrations will begin to diminish over the next few days. In the meantime, a little self-examination could reveal an important truth."
sagittarius,2013-09-09,"You may feel stuck today because your idealistic plans don't seem to be working out. You would rather be outside taking a long hike or embarking on some other kind of fun adventure, but duty calls and you must delay your favorite activities until another day. Show the world and yourself that you really do have a responsible side. Oddly enough, happiness comes from the satisfaction of a job well done."
capricorn,2013-09-09,"Although you have many responsibilities on your plate, it temporarily becomes difficult for you to initiate action. You are torn between doing what's expected of you and doing nothing at all. You really don't want to let anyone down, but there's a stubborn streak that is fueling your resistance now. However, don't avoid your obligations. If you just walk away, you will face the music pretty quickly. Instead, find a course of action that takes both sides into consideration."
aquarius,2013-09-09,"You are determined to reach your goals now, yet you may still broadcast mixed messages because you are conflicted about your next career move. You think that you know where you are going, but can't get rid of a nagging feeling that won't be quieted until you reach your destination. Although you might try to relieve the pressure mentally today, it could require some physical exertion to touch the real source of your frustration. Attacking the stress at all levels has the most profound positive impact."
pisces,2013-09-09,"Your enthusiasm cools off a bit today if a workmate criticizes you for something you did wrong. You might not see the problem and believe that you are being misunderstood. This dynamic can also impact your personal relationships. If you are involved with someone special, it still may feel as if you're being blocked from reaching satisfaction. Try to go with the flow while demonstrating just a touch of self-restraint. You could be happily surprised by how quickly things turn around with a simple apology on your part."
aries,2013-09-10,"Finding a perfect balance between being your own person and being what others want can be a real challenge. Although your diplomatic skills may be well honed, turning on the charm today isn't quite as effective as you wish. Your romantic inclinations are also running on the hot side and if you don't cool yourself down, you might stir up some uneasy feelings on the way to obtaining what your heart desires. Channel your passion into a creative pursuit, instead."
taurus,2013-09-10,"Although you might take a cautious approach to relationships now, your concerns won't be sufficient to prevent your inner radiance from shining. You often warm to others slowly, but after you befriend someone your loyalty is legendary. However, you're ready to jump into the fray and make a new friend today without going through your regular song and dance. Just express yourself naturally and you'll surely find a groove that works."
gemini,2013-09-10,"You're feeling extra lucky today, but others don't seem to take notice -- even if you bend the rules a bit to tilt the odds in your favor. If anyone looks closely enough, they might better appreciate that your success stems from your extra effort, not just happenstance. Don't get too cocky, for circumstances can change quickly when you become overly pleased with your own cleverness. Remember that humility is more appealing than hubris."
cancer,2013-09-10,"You might be very pleased with the richness of your life today, yet you may feel vulnerable because of strong emotional undercurrents which are out of your control. Others won't likely notice what you are hiding because you're very skilled at playing the shell game. However, clamming up is not your best strategy now. Sharing your fears with a loved one can keep your thoughts from stagnating as the waters continue to swirl around you."
leo,2013-09-10,"It may appear to others that you are dissatisfied with your current situation. It's true; you could be a bit irritable today, but it's probably not because of anything specific that's occurring in your life. In fact, you might actually like what's happening now, even if you're having a hard time keeping your feelings in line. You get edgy when your emotions and your actions are not in harmony with each other. Don't make any sudden changes; simply being more aware of your internal conflict will help it resolve over time."
virgo,2013-09-10,"Even if you're in touch with both your positive and negative feelings today, others may see you as mostly personable and easygoing. Your charm is flowing easily now, rather than the contracted fear you might experience when you're confused. Your natural tendency is to move into the practical realms to gain control, but you are better off just mentally wandering for a while until your mind plays through all the possibilities."
libra,2013-09-10,"You are so busy these days that you're motivated to seek ways to bring your life into a healthier balance. However, the current danger is that you can gloss over awkward details in your rush to get everything done. There are mixed signals coming your way, yet you still may strive to be sweet, even if your feelings are more intense. Don't spend too much time attempting to hide the darker feelings. Others will appreciate your honesty more than you think."
scorpio,2013-09-10,"There is a wonderful potential to indulge your senses today, even if fantasy plays a strong part in a pleasurable experience. You may feel like you're on top of the world, getting a chance to express your passionate side without experiencing the negativity that sometimes follows. The only price you might pay for feeling safe is the regret over a desire not expressed. Don't miss this opportunity to open your heart and widen your horizons."
sagittarius,2013-09-10,"Your dreams have an excellent chance to manifest now if you incorporate the widest spectrum of life into your overall perspective. Although you are often ready to consider new possibilities when planning your future, you might be pleasantly surprised with the amazing experiences you can have now if you keep your options open. Take a risk and expand your mind to include what you previously excluded. You'll be richer in spirit for your efforts."
capricorn,2013-09-10,"You are feeling somewhat constrained today, but working within a solid framework gives you a comforting sense of security. Rules are welcome news from the cosmos, since you like it when your structures are strong enough that you can build upon them. Don't hold back; you have powerful tools at your disposal now. Fortunately, using your energy for the good of all is also beneficial to you in the long run."
aquarius,2013-09-10,"The pace of your life is settling down enough for you to temporarily take charge of your career. You have been riding the tides of change, but now the stress created by the incoming waves is clearing the way for new and better goals. Keep your eyes on the future, even if your nerves are rattling with uncertainty. Ironically, practicing patience helps you reach your desired destination in record time."
pisces,2013-09-10,"It's easy to grow discouraged today if everything doesn't go your way. You might even blame your frustration on something that happened yesterday. Fortunately, you could receive an energetic boost out of the blue that sets you off in a new direction. However, resisting change leads to stagnation. Don't hold on to previous expectations. Your chances for success are enhanced if you gracefully roll with the incoming waves and adapt to the shifting currents."
aries,2013-09-11,"You're eager to apply what you recently learned to a complex situation at work, but you might not realize the consequences of your current actions. There are dynamic changes on your horizon now that sweet Venus has taken up residence in your 8th House of Deep Sharing. It's time to ask yourself what you want from others while you can still see the potential of what's ahead. Keep in mind that everything feels very intense today, so move forward slowly with kindness and compassion."
taurus,2013-09-11,"Collaborating with others continues to be your main focus when your key planet Venus enters your 7th House of Partners today. Thankfully, now you can see beyond the doubts that have previously limited your actions. But instead of wondering how you will complete everything on your plate, think about what motivates the people in your life. Ask questions and actively listen to what is said because you could learn something valuable about yourself as you discover more about someone else's experiences."
gemini,2013-09-11,"Strangely enough, you may not be able to tell if your life is growing simpler or more complex. Your goal was to create a schedule that allows you enough time for yourself, but now everything seems to be changing again. Go ahead and grab an opportunity to play while you still can, for your work might not afford you so much free time during the next few weeks. If it appears like others are having more fun than you, don't complain; temporarily set aside your current concerns and join the party."
cancer,2013-09-11,"You want to be enthusiastic about your job today, although you may have to work on recapturing your earlier vision. You might start your day feeling resentful toward someone who won't cooperate with you. But there's no reason to hold onto negative feelings. As others grow more supportive in return, make a choice to graciously accept what they offer while still pushing your agenda forward."
leo,2013-09-11,"Resolving an interpersonal conflict in the morning gives you the maximum amount of time to make the most of the rest of your day. Someone at work might bring you an opportunity that looks promising, but you would be wise to do your due diligence before just saying yes. Ultimately, your new direction may turn out great, but you could easily mislead yourself if you don't check out the facts thoroughly. Fools rush in where angels fear to tread."
virgo,2013-09-11,"Your current sense of nostalgia might lure you back into your past, but, paradoxically, this sentimentality can put you in touch with someone who shares your search for meaning. Fortunately, your memories also activate feelings in the present moment. However, don't fall into the trap of believing that a current situation is the same as a past one. Ultimately, your future success comes from looking forward, not backward."
libra,2013-09-11,"Today may seem busier than recent days, partly because you are enthusiastic about getting a lot done. The cheery Sagittarius Moon wires your 3rd House of Immediate Environment, but you could end up spinning your wheels throughout the day and still not have anything tangible to show for your efforts. Avoid the temptation to scatter your energy. Slowing down and checking one thing off your list at a time leads to higher productivity and more satisfying results."
scorpio,2013-09-11,"You're on the threshold of an exciting opportunity and may be entranced by sweet Venus' entry into your powerful sign, provoking both desire and fear. You're aware of the changes in the air and understand that you can't rely on your old ways of doing things. It's time to let unfulfilled dreams fade away so you can create new ones that are more relevant and realistic. Ultimately, you'll feel better once you step away from the past and move into the future."
sagittarius,2013-09-11,"You may have recently experienced a challenging emotional situation when you had to relinquish control for a while. Now, with the evocative Moon back in your sign, you are reawakening to your own desires. You're motivated to go out and get whatever you want. However, your enthusiasm could be too much if you ride roughshod over someone's feelings. Remember to balance your goals with the needs of others. You are not alone; your happiness is intertwined with the well-being of the people you love."
capricorn,2013-09-11,"If you are reconsidering your long-term trajectory, it may be time to think about setting new goals and aiming your life in an entirely different direction. Whether or not you actually make any changes now, put away your fantasies and consider only what's real. However, this is not about giving up on your dreams; it's more about putting them in proper perspective. Letting go of old expectations frees you to create a more relevant strategy. Once you have a plan in place, you might be pleasantly surprised with the speed of change."
aquarius,2013-09-11,"It may feel like a split-personality day, yet holding both perspectives can test your metal. You have a lot to gain by stepping into your power and entertaining visions of the future now that the expansive Sagittarius Moon is visiting your 11th House of Future Dreams. However, you must also be practical when considering what to do because valuable Venus enters your career-minded 10th House today. Personal satisfaction comes from balancing possibilities with practicalities."
pisces,2013-09-11,"Wake up and snap out of your dreams, especially if you've been lost in fantasies about exotic adventures and far-off lands. There's nothing wrong with letting your thoughts wander, but the Moon's shift into your 10th House of Public Responsibility reflects the work you have to do now. You can't afford the luxury of drifting in the impractical realms of your imagination today. However, don't lose touch with your hopes; just express them in the real world, for this is where your vision must ultimately manifest."
aries,2013-09-12,"It's surprising how quickly and easily a complex situation can resolve into a much simpler one. You might think that you're out of the woods, but don't fool yourself into believing you're home free. Your current relief may largely result from the improving circumstances, but some denial could also contribute to your positive state of mind. Remember, avoiding an awkward issue feels good for a while, but it's not the same thing as really fixing a problem."
taurus,2013-09-12,"Normally, you assume that you understand what's going on because you instinctively trust your senses. But it's difficult to settle down today because somehow you know more than you actually perceive. Logically, you can convince yourself not to take a leap of faith, but in your heart you still believe your intuition. Ultimately, you will feel more empowered once you open your mind and give yourself permission to dream."
gemini,2013-09-12,"You may be uncomfortable with your feelings and might attempt to hide them from someone close to you, but this doesn't mean that you are antisocial today. Paradoxically, your easygoing banter could encourage others to believe that you are being more revealing now than you actually are. Even if you are clever enough to fool everyone else, be careful about going so far that you also fool yourself. What you share is up to you; just make sure you know where to draw the line."
cancer,2013-09-12,Your sweeping vision is easily communicated to others today. Your associates at work are eager to place their trust in you because it seems as if your feet are placed solidly on the ground. But you may not be as sensible now as you appear. It's best to be honest and let others know that there are still a lot of details missing from your plan. It's more important to be real than to sound as if you have all the answers. Collaborating with others enhances your chances for success.
leo,2013-09-12,"Although you're likely to take the high road today, you're still itching to make a statement about something that bothers you. Fortunately, you can ward off negativity by concentrating on your spiritual beliefs instead of being sabotaged by your own emotions. But the power of positive thinking alone isn't enough to permanently put things back in order. You will have to follow up with decisive actions or your good intentions will be for naught."
virgo,2013-09-12,"Even if you're stressing over significant issues, ultimately they won't matter all that much in the long run. You want to resolve a conflict, but the specifics of the situation are not as important as you may be led to believe. Too much information could make you anxious because you want to focus on the bigger picture. Unfortunately, it's always a challenge for you to let go of the details. Taking the time to relax or meditate allows you to put your worries into proper perspective."
libra,2013-09-12,"You have high hopes about accomplishing many things today, but you may be unrealistic in your expectations. Your current ability to complete your list of ambitious chores is complicated by a louder-than-usual creative buzz that you don't want to waste. Naturally, you would rather be artsy and crafty, but now you might just have to fulfill your responsibilities before you follow your muse."
scorpio,2013-09-12,"Maintaining a high level of integrity is essential to you, yet it's challenging to convince everyone else to go along with your priorities today. Each person that is involved with you and your work has a different idea about what is necessary. Unfortunately, others may be unwilling to listen to what you have to say now, complicating your efforts. Nevertheless, staying focused on your final goal allows them to join in with their support when they are ready."
sagittarius,2013-09-12,"Your flexible attitude is an asset today, yet your ability to adapt doesn't mean that you're wishy-washy. In fact, if someone at work pushes you too hard, you may become quite stubborn in your defense of your job performance. But don't allow your ego to convince you that it's okay to tell others what to do. Instead, encourage each person to find his or her own unique way. Give everyone else the same freedom that you want in return."
capricorn,2013-09-12,"Getting over your fears is hard work, but reality is offering you a special opportunity to learn how to deepen your trust now in all things that are beyond your five senses. The veil between worlds has grown thinner and you may see visions now, even when your eyes are closed. Usually you do well when you rely strictly on the facts; today, you'll perform even better if you put your imagination to work, too."
aquarius,2013-09-12,"Messages may pop into awareness in symbolic form today and you might have to step out of your comfort zone to receive them. Pay careful attention to your friends and associates for clues. They will be guiding you now, even if they seem to have nothing to say. However, you have to listen with your heart to hear what's going on beneath the surface. Recognizing the limitations of language empowers you to see the potential everywhere you look."
pisces,2013-09-12,You are traveling on automatic pilot today as you express your desire to take care of others. But this isn't about any sort of verbal disclosure on your part; rather it's more about what you actually do. You're not interested in discussing your life intentions now. Stop thinking and initiate direct action before you talk yourself out of a perfectly fine strategy. He who hesitates is lost.
aries,2013-09-13,"Pay close attention to interpersonal dynamics today, since you can be so entranced by someone that your powers of discrimination are weakened. Everything you perceive might not be quite as wonderful as it seems. Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder and you are highly susceptible now because you are in touch with the magic of your own inner world. Just remember that you are being seduced by your desire for pleasure, and not by whatever is on the outside."
taurus,2013-09-13,"An interaction with a friend or lover might not be what you think, for you can easily gloss over an annoying problem now. You don't want to see things in their true light, and although this could be a dangerous tactic in theory, it works for you today. Your temporary denial allows you to get through the day without serious confrontation -- and conflict won't produce the results you desire, anyway. Seek ways to maximize your own pleasure. You'll have plenty of opportunities tomorrow to dig deeper into any unresolved issues."
gemini,2013-09-13,"You may be unwittingly lured into discussions about your idea of perfect love. Your eloquence can entrance others, even if what you say today isn't grounded in reality. Normally, you might try to hide your real feelings by displaying your quick thinking and clever wit. Instead, slow down and let your dreams come to the forefront. The key to your future fulfillment may be hiding within your imagination."
cancer,2013-09-13,"Your heightened emotional sensitivity doesn't get in your way at all today. Everything seems to come together now, but you might not be able to explain the process to anyone else. Not only do you have the ability to magically juggle many balls at once, keeping them in the air seems to require very little effort on your part. Enjoy the illusion of reality moving in slow motion, for it gives you plenty of time to respond to each situation without having to panic. Make the most of the cosmic luck coming your way."
leo,2013-09-13,"You might feel as if you have tapped into a primal energy source today. Aside from your current physical stamina, you also have a strong desire to communicate in a direct manner. But don't leave your imagination out of the loop; shine your heart's desire through a creative endeavor. You are being visited by your muse. Open the door and let her in."
virgo,2013-09-13,"It doesn't matter how perfect something looks today; don't be misled by outward appearances. Nothing is quite as it seems. Struggle as you might, it's still challenging to see what's behind the curtains. Part of the problem is that you may uncharacteristically overlook the details now. Don't put your reputation on the line unless you are certain about what you are doing. Any good decision made today will be even better tomorrow."
libra,2013-09-13,"Visions of perfect beauty and absolute truth color your imagination now while fantasies sweep you off your feet. Your ruling planet Venus is harmonizing with visionary Neptune today, creating a fountain of love's magical illusions. As wonderful as this may sound, your unbridled dreams could also set you up for disappointment once reality kicks back in the days ahead. Use your creative energy to make something special happen while you have the chance."
scorpio,2013-09-13,"You stand to make real gains in your life now if you keep your spiritual world alive and vital. Allow yourself to wander off the path to explore your dreams today because your fantasies are temporarily the main event. A simple interaction with someone special deepens your self-understanding and brings you pleasure, but you must leave the world of rational thought behind and trust your imagination. If you can visualize it, you can make it come true."
sagittarius,2013-09-13,"You're surfing emotional waves today, but your ability to contain the energy removes any sense of danger you might otherwise feel. Thankfully, you are open to sensory pleasures that you would normally avoid because you believe you're in control of the situation. Although this could be an illusion, it really doesn't matter who is in charge. You may be pleasantly surprised by what happens if you're willing to share what's in your heart."
capricorn,2013-09-13,"Setting reality aside and taking a trip into your own private land of fantasy may seem counterproductive. Nevertheless, this is what the cosmos has in store for you now as you are instinctively more in touch with your spiritual dimensions. The most surprising part of this whole experience is that as you let go of the outer structures, you will find that you gain additional authority -- even if this is quite the opposite of what you expect. Sometimes you need to take a risk to get in touch with the magic of the moment."
aquarius,2013-09-13,"You can charm your way out of a tricky situation with the help of the cosmic support you are now receiving. At least, this is what you believe, but your difficulty in separating facts from fiction could turn into a sticky problem later on. At best, your desires lead to great fun, for the real world doesn't necessarily hold you back. However, you might work yourself into a corner if you misinterpret the signals. Rethinking your actions from an objective perspective enables you to have your cake and eat it, too."
pisces,2013-09-13,"In a perfect world, there wouldn't be so many tasks to finish today, leaving you enough time to explore your dreams. However, acknowledging both reality and fantasy allows you to come out a winner in this clash between the outer and the inner worlds. Bite the bullet and get to work on time. Keep your thoughts away from all forms of escape until you've earned it by completing your chores. The faster you finish the sooner you can play."
aries,2013-09-14,"You may have trouble containing yourself because you're so eager for action. Macho Mars combines forces with shocking Uranus today, zapping you with lightning bolts of awareness and jolting your system awake. Thankfully, you're also connected to your inner spirituality in a profound way now, so your passionate nature can be very inspiring to others. Concentrate on projecting the positive potential without trying to prove that your way is the only path to success."
taurus,2013-09-14,"Everything seems to make sense in your fantasies today as long as you don't try to explain them to someone else. The earthy Capricorn Moon soothes your emotions and prompts you to pick a conservative path to achieving your goals. However, a friend may encourage you to break a rule or a family member might inspire you to take an even greater risk. Obviously you respect the opinions of those you love, but it's wiser to accept the challenge of being independent in your thoughts and actions now. Only your heart knows what's best for you."
gemini,2013-09-14,"Your current interests may be part of a grand scheme today; nevertheless, you could run into a tough opponent if you are overly controlling in your approach to working with others. Don't waste your limited time and energy trying to convince someone to support your plan. Instead, channel all your mind's power into your most immediate goal and don't stop until you've made real progress. Knowing what to do is easier when you have your priorities in order."
cancer,2013-09-14,"You may be dreaming about doing something outrageous that scares you as much as it excites you. Although risk-taking could provoke anxiety, you should be able to get away with unorthodox behavior since you're receiving cosmic assistance from the radically expressive Mars-Uranus trine. However, you still must come out and tell others what you want. You're more likely to get what you need if you initiate bold action rather than just waiting for lightning to strike."
leo,2013-09-14,"You want to be acknowledged at work today and you're ready to take additional risks to be noticed. Paradoxically, you may feel more secure in your position now, even if you're already living close to the edge. Although you may be confident about your current direction, pressuring others with your ideas could cause your plan to backfire. Explain your strategy, but then wait to see how everyone reacts before taking your next step. The feedback you receive could make all the difference in the world."
virgo,2013-09-14,"You don't want to keep your fears quiet now, even if you're worried that giving them voice will just make you more vulnerable. Thankfully, there is nothing wrong with admitting to feeling scared. After a while, your apprehension may begin to disperse without encountering the problem that you previously thought was inevitable. Sharing your concerns with a trustworthy friend should calm your nerves. Sometimes a supportive shoulder is all you need."
libra,2013-09-14,"You prefer to be busy today, yet you also might grow weary of jumping through one hoop after another. If you don't burn up all of your energy in the morning, you will still have some creative juice left over for later in the day. Instead of panicking because you think that time is running out, slow down, engage reality and take control of your day. You are the master of your own destiny."
scorpio,2013-09-14,"You feel a thrill when flirting with the edge today, whether bungee jumping, ending a relationship or moving to a new location. It's impossible to ignore your impulses as your ruling planet Mars urges you to try something you've never done before. Unfortunately, once you step beyond the proverbial point of no return, you may not be able to change your mind. Find ways to shake things up without necessarily turning your entire life upside down."
sagittarius,2013-09-14,"It's easy to rationalize what you are doing now, as long as it's part of a familiar pattern. The Moon is visiting your 6th House of Daily Routine today, reflecting light on all of your habits. Nevertheless, you have important choices to make that can be based totally on intuition and inner guidance. Don't engage in endless analysis and conversations that go nowhere. Pay attention to the sensations in your gut and do what feels best."
capricorn,2013-09-14,Your friends may encourage you to step back from your responsibilities today and do something that is quite out of character. But the point is not to avoid your current obligations; a happy medium can be found by being adaptable enough to pursue unscheduled fun along the way. You can always finish your chores later in the evening or even first thing tomorrow morning if necessary. Taking time for a bit of enjoyment might be exactly what you need to recharge your batteries.
aquarius,2013-09-14,You have a number of projects you want to complete this weekend before you return to work. But your day isn't likely to play out the same way as the one you envisioned. There are just too many unknown variables still up in the air and you must go along with the uncertainty or you'll have a rough time getting along with others. Remaining open to any last minute changes can turn a frustrating day into one filled with excitement and love.
pisces,2013-09-14,"You might believe you already know what others want before they even ask for it. Nevertheless, it's wise to wait until someone articulates his or her needs today, instead of jumping to a faulty conclusion. It's disheartening if an ally says no to your great ideas, even if it's apparent to you that he or she lacks vision. Nevertheless, fretting about the situation is simply a waste of your time. Let the energy sit and see how everyone feels next week. You know your heart is in the right place."
aries,2013-09-15,"Managing your day-to-day affairs can be tricky now, especially when your life contains so much uncertainty. You're typically confident about what you are doing, but questions arise today that increase your doubt over the general direction of your life. You may be tempted to focus on your long-term goals in order to escape from your more immediate obligations. However, your smartest strategy is doing what you Aries do best and live fully in the present moment."
taurus,2013-09-15,"You may be involved in an ongoing conflict between your professional responsibilities and personal activities that more accurately reflect what's in your heart. But it's challenging to follow a path that's closer to your passion when you're monetarily rewarded for the work you do. Instead of choosing one or the other, find ways to breathe new life into your creative endeavors through self-discipline. Utilizing your time wisely enables you to juggle your calendar and do everything you want."
gemini,2013-09-15,"Thinking about going back to school or beginning a new course of study is on your mind now that the Moon occupies in your 9th House of Higher Education. However, you might have to delay your decision for a little while since pressing obligations can't be ignored and must be handled before returning to your long-term plans. Instead of worrying about what you can't do today, take your life one day at a time until you're free enough to imagine what's ahead."
cancer,2013-09-15,"If someone presents you with a sensible plan today, remain open to it instead of just assuming that your idea is better. It's presumptuous to believe that you can make an accurate assessment unless you actually take time to consider what's being said. Don't let your fear of being wrong stand in the way of choosing your best course of action. It's more important to reach your goals than to be right."
leo,2013-09-15,"Focusing on productive projects at home helps to take your mind off a recent conflict on the job. However, it's critical to temporarily shift your thinking away from your career objectives today and onto your personal life. Backing away from a complex set of circumstances won't solve any of the underlying issues at work, but it gives you a chance to settle down so you can approach the unresolved predicament anew next week. Spending time with those you love puts everything in proper perspective."
virgo,2013-09-15,"You are tempted to overcompensate for your current uncertainty by acting as if you know exactly what's going on today and what should be done next. You want to be appreciated as someone who is competent, but an authoritative manner may not help your cause. Don't dwell on previous failures now, since your memories could stand between you and future success. Remember, the past is over and isn't as relevant in the present moment as you might believe."
libra,2013-09-15,"You may not feel like doing the responsible thing today, and are more willing to take a risk and try something just for the fun of it. Unfortunately, simply declaring yourself free from prior obligations isn't as satisfying as living up to your promises. Take the time early in the day to work hard. If you make progress on your chores now you'll feel justified when cutting loose later on."
scorpio,2013-09-15,"Keeping a secret may have been appropriate for a while, but your desire to bury your feelings could become an issue in a relationship now. You might suddenly realize that you would have been better off being fully honest and sharing whatever doubts you were hiding. Unfortunately, you cannot turn back the hands of time and redo what's been done. Your most effective strategy is to start fresh by clearing the air before moving on."
sagittarius,2013-09-15,"Of course you don't like it when your peers pressure you to do something you're not willing to do. In fact, you like it even less when people attempt to take advantage of you, asking you to help them with chores they should have already completed. Remember, in both cases the decision is entirely yours. Either jump in fully without complaining, or say exactly what you're thinking and prepare to deal with the consequences. Those who matter most will appreciate your authenticity."
capricorn,2013-09-15,"You may underestimate the amount of time and energy it will take to finish a project today. Unfortunately, this miscalculation can have a negative impact on your schedule. Simply working harder might be the best strategy to avoid looking like a fool on the job; however, putting in additional hours won't necessarily solve the problem. Don't exhaust yourself in a hopeless attempt to impress others. Instead, rethink your tactics and adopt a smarter strategy."
aquarius,2013-09-15,"You are driven to understand your personal world today, but the Moon's return to your sign can make you so emotional that your normal rational approach doesn't work. Your answers might appear straightforward, but your moods are running all over the place now, making it nearly impossible to follow through on any one idea. Instead of trying to sort it out on your own, ask for assistance to minimize the noise. You can get by -- and even excel -- with a little help from your friends."
pisces,2013-09-15,"You may be weary of isolating yourself from someone you love and are finally ready to do something about it today. However, you might not know where to start to heal a rift between you and a friend. Rather than pretending like you have all the answers, simply admit that you have no clue as to how to proceed. Revealing your vulnerability could be the fastest way to bridge the gap. Making the first move is the hardest part."
aries,2013-09-16,"Although your world is buzzing with activity today, you could still find time for a quick escape as clever Mercury in your 7th House of Others helps you balance your serious work with a bit of fun. Thankfully, you can accomplish a lot in short bursts of energy throughout the day. Nevertheless, your key to success stems from your ability to concentrate and extend each little creative moment. The longer you focus on each individual task, the more productive you will be in the long run."
taurus,2013-09-16,"A series of unexpected twists of fate at work today could lead you to reconnect with an old friend or make the acquaintance of a new one. You can try to remain cool and detached, yet you will probably be quite surprised anyhow if intense feelings suddenly catch you off guard. Don't resist the energetic flow now; enjoy the excitement while it lasts."
gemini,2013-09-16,"You don't need another cup of coffee or tea today because you're already soaring -- even without the extra caffeine. Although your intentions may be good, you're still somewhat scattered in your actions. A tug-of-war between electric Uranus and quicksilver Mercury is enough to give you a case of the jitters. Fortunately, you can work off some of the nervous energy with a bit of strenuous physical activity, enabling you to regain some semblance of control over your day."
cancer,2013-09-16,"Life is full of little emergencies today that keep you hopping from one minor crisis to the next. Even if you're not courting mischief, you're quick to feed into it now. However, your lightning-like response can be a mixed blessing if you keep coming up with solutions before you have all the facts. Act wisely and make sure that you have sufficient information prior to taking charge."
leo,2013-09-16,"Someone could throw you a curve ball today when his or her plans suddenly change. Your reaction might be to step back while you determine how this unexpected shift will impact your life. Although the interaction may be intellectual rather than emotional, it still gives you a chance to improve an important relationship. Instead of withdrawing, acknowledge your feelings. Fortunately, you could end up growing closer to each other now if you take the time to sit down and connect."
virgo,2013-09-16,"You're emotionally on edge today, yet you can still project enough confidence so no one realizes what you're experiencing. Ironically, your anxiety could leak out through your behavior anyhow, even if you are trying your best to play it cool. However, it's really not worth the extra effort to hide your feelings, for others will be more understanding if they see that you're being real and authentic."
libra,2013-09-16,"You might feel like you stepped onto a wild ride and you're no longer in control as trickster Mercury in your sign opposes outrageous Uranus in your 7th House of Others. Even if no one is adhering to your agenda today, everything can be more exciting than frustrating as you figure out what will happen next. Don't try to exert your authority; it will only confirm that you're not in charge now. Instead, enjoy the uncertainty and the thrills while you can."
scorpio,2013-09-16,"Your attempt to go about your regular daily routine wouldn't normally run into trouble, but things run amok today even if you do your best to keep them on track. You may believe that you can put your schedule back together if you just try hard enough, but your day grows more unmanageable the more you try to rein it in. It seems counterintuitive, but relinquishing control magically helps you regain authority and move forward with confidence."
sagittarius,2013-09-16,"Your willingness to act in a shocking manner today could lead to a wonderful experience. You might even be so excited that you do something totally outrageous without giving it much forethought. Luckily, you're happily surprised by the approval you receive from your friends or co-workers. Just don't push your luck by going too far out on a limb or you'll be paying for your irresponsibility sooner than you think. It's still wise to know your limits before you cross the line."
capricorn,2013-09-16,"You have responsibilities at work to manage, yet a personal situation might add an unexpected turn to your day. You can't just walk away from your previous obligations, but don't try to use this as an excuse to avoid your feelings. Instead of overcompensating and playing the role of a superhero, see where your emotions lead you before taking any drastic action. Take time to listen to your heart and you will know what to do next."
aquarius,2013-09-16,"You may already be thinking ahead toward the holiday season, even if it still seems far away. In the meantime, you could have an opportunity to squeeze in a quick weekend getaway. Or, maybe you're considering a new course of study with mental Mercury traveling through your 9th House of Education. Don't let anyone else tell you that your advanced planning is a waste of energy. The truth is that dreaming about the future makes you happy and causes no harm to anyone else. Just don't miss the joy available in the present moment in the process."
pisces,2013-09-16,"If a financial issue unexpectedly surfaces today, it's wise to jump in and take care of it immediately. Handling a problem right away prevents it from developing into a more serious one. Even if it's just an insignificant mistake, ignoring it is like asking for a major headache later on. Save the pain and frustration by being responsible with your money now while it's still a simple matter."
aries,2013-09-17,"It feels as if someone is keeping a secret from you today, yet the more you try to figure it out, the farther away the truth seems to get. Instead of worrying about what you might be missing, concentrate your attention on what you do know and act accordingly. Save your detective work for another day when others are more willing to communicate. Take the high road and see who follows."
taurus,2013-09-17,"Your current dilemma requires balancing your personal desires with the needs of others at work. Fortunately, you can rely on your ability to logically analyze the differences and then make decisions based upon what will work best for a larger group. Being selfish now will only create additional problems. There's no need to panic since you'll probably get what you want soon enough. In the meantime, show others that you can be a valuable team player by jumping in to help."
gemini,2013-09-17,"You may not have the freedom to express your feelings at work today. There could be unexpected consequences if you go ahead and say what's on your mind, but you might choose to speak your peace anyhow. Although you aren't responsible for the reactions of anyone else, you still need to get your job done on time. If you want other people's cooperation, take a deep breath and consider their feelings first."
cancer,2013-09-17,"Making travel plans for the future is tricky business today since you are likely to aspire toward more extravagance than you can actually afford. Unrealistic dreams could come crashing down to earth if you try to cover too much ground or spend too much money. Instead of running into an insurmountable obstacle, it's smarter now to rein in your vision of an idealistic getaway. Keep it real in order to make it possible."
leo,2013-09-17,Your need for intimacy might create situations that ultimately make you feel uncomfortable today. It's not that you want to avoid getting closer to someone you truly admire; it's just that you don't like limiting your options. Focus your attention on what you are experiencing in the present moment instead of dreaming about indefinite possibilities that may or may not happen sometime in the future. Be here now.
virgo,2013-09-17,"Although you logically know what's best for you, you're still confused when people tell you what they want today. But listening to someone else doesn't have to change what you already know about yourself, even if you are more sensitive to the needs of your partner now than to your own desires. Remember, you can be available to others while still taking care of yourself."
libra,2013-09-17,"It's complicated to figure out what is expected of you at work today, but that might not prevent you from trying to do what's right. Don't worry about the reactions of your associates, since they probably won't tell you what they're really thinking anyhow. Accept the fact that others may hide their true feelings because they don't want to stir up the waters any more than necessary. You can't go wrong if you act for the greater good of everyone involved."
scorpio,2013-09-17,"A romantic attraction might make you feel a bit unstable today as the Moon slips into your 5th House of Love and Play. It's natural for your feelings to swing one way and then the other as you play out the possibilities in your mind. It's okay to acknowledge that you really don't know what's best, even if you want to arrive at a final conclusion now. Ease up on the controls for a while and just observe your changing moods. You're better off postponing a relationship decision for a couple of days and enjoying the ride."
sagittarius,2013-09-17,"Unresolved feelings about a family member may instigate a minor crisis at home today. You might try to ignore the issue by focusing on your work responsibilities, but this will probably just make matters worse. There's no need to add to the tension with your denial when you can simply discuss your concerns without taking control of the situation. Remember, you don't need to have all the answers at this time; just showing up is enough to make others happy."
capricorn,2013-09-17,"Your desire to micromanage your schedule today creates more problems than it solves. Unfortunately, others may not be willing to blindly go along with your plans and there isn't a lot that you can say or do to change their minds. Ironically, loosening your grip on the reins could actually help you to get what you want faster than you might expect."
aquarius,2013-09-17,"A financial decision that has been weighing heavily on your mind might be resolved today in a single instant. You may have a sudden flash of inspiration that enables you to clearly see the solution that you were missing. When you realize that the issue is less about money and more about what you value, the logical choice will become crystal clear. It's not the bottom line that counts now; it's the feeling you have at the bottom of your heart."
pisces,2013-09-17,"Your emotional inconsistency could be driving someone crazy today, even if you aren't aware of your erratic behavior. Others might currently see you as irresponsible; however, you think that you know what you want and are willing to follow through with your plan to accomplish your goals. Nevertheless, your feelings are unsettled now that the Moon is back in your sign, and it would be wise to wait until after the Full Moon on Thursday before you make a major commitment. In the meantime, cultivate your dreams and see what develops."
aries,2013-09-18,"Withholding support from someone isn't a good idea today even if you're trying to send a message of disapproval. Or maybe you want to separate yourself from a project that has gone astray. In either case, your actions aren't helpful if your responses are based on fear of the unknown. It's more useful to honestly talk about the cause of your concerns without blaming anyone else. But don't expect the tension to dissipate right away. Stay on your current path by working with others until you gain more clarity after tomorrow's Full Moon."
taurus,2013-09-18,"You might feel a little left out of the fun as if there's an emotional chill in the air now that your key planet Venus is restrained by the dominance of karmic Saturn. Although you may fight against the resistance at first, letting go of control is the smartest way today to quickly turn an uncomfortable situation into a very sweet one. Give up a little independence voluntarily; it's a small price to pay in the big scheme of things and can improve your chances of receiving the love that you desire."
gemini,2013-09-18,"You may be offered a tough choice today, especially if you aren't one to make a commitment easily. You could be very convincing as you explain your desire for intimacy, but you'll likely retreat if someone gets too near to your heart. However, mustering up enough courage to overcome your fears is the key to happiness. Luckily, you don't have to repeat the same old patterns just because you are scared of getting hurt. Take a leap of faith and trust the process."
cancer,2013-09-18,"It appears that you could get the support you need from a close friend or a family member if you ask for it, so you don't really have a logical reason to keep quiet now. Even if you can't easily imagine that someone will actually be there for you, taking a calculated risk should turn out fine. Instead of seeing your current situation as requiring an all-or-nothing approach, try to establish enough common ground for the basis of a solid partnership. Let others nurture you the way you would nurture them."
leo,2013-09-18,"It may be awkward to engage in a casual conversation now because your feelings might be exposed and you're afraid that you won't get what you want. Your unspoken fears could actually turn into a self-fulfilling prophesy today, especially if you withdraw from social interaction. Fortunately, you have the power to overcome the negativity of your own self-limiting thoughts. You can turn things around by changing your attitude and opening your heart."
virgo,2013-09-18,"It's time to make a crucial decision about how best to spend or save your money. But this goes much deeper than being a simple cash flow problem because the underlying issue is more likely about your self-esteem. When you realize all the skills that you have to offer, your earning power could grow quickly, so don't fall into the trap of thinking that you're worth any less than you actually are."
libra,2013-09-18,"You are not inclined to waste your energy while sharing your feelings today. You are very practical when it comes to allocating your time now that your key planet Venus runs into austere Saturn in your 2nd House of Resources. You may be very rational about cutting back on frivolous pleasures to assure that you will have what you need on a rainy day. Although caution makes sense, remember that there is an unlimited supply of love, so you can always splurge where it matters most."
scorpio,2013-09-18,"You don't need to suffer in silence today if you're willing to face an old fear with a new attitude. Your current isolation is probably more voluntary than you care to admit now that the sobering Venus-Saturn conjunction occurs in your sign. The current situation has very little to do with what happened to you in the past. It's your choice; you can respond emotionally based on old worn-out habits or you can live fully in the present. Ultimately, being realistic is a much more empowering strategy than being pessimistic."
sagittarius,2013-09-18,"Don't be so quick to assume that your friends are putting you down today when your warped perceptions may be contributing to the dynamics. You might be so sensitive now that you're imagining trouble, even where there isn't any. However, it may be too late to avoid the discomfort if negativity has already been generated by your feelings of uncertainty. Instead of projecting previous failures onto others, talk about your concerns without pointing fingers at anyone else. Honest dialogue clears the air by getting everything out into the open."
capricorn,2013-09-18,"It may be disheartening if you don't receive the professional respect you deserve now as vulnerable Venus bumps up against your key planet Saturn. You've done the hard work, yet unfortunately, your ego can get in the way by tricking you to think that you should be more highly appreciated than you are. Don't waste your time dreaming about recognition and fame. The real reward is the deep satisfaction that comes from knowing you've done your very best."
aquarius,2013-09-18,"Unfortunately, there's no room on your schedule to surrender to your desires now. Instead, you must maintain an emotionally cool and competent presence at work while sweet Venus runs into austere Saturn in your 10th House of Profession. Don't waste energy complaining about what you're missing; instead, get busy working on your long-term goals. Seeking personal satisfaction has to wait; being patient today is your best strategy to realizing your dreams tomorrow."
pisces,2013-09-18,"Too much resistance from a partner doesn't give you an excuse to go off brooding today. Don't isolate yourself from someone you love deeply just because you think that everything isn't perfect between you. It's tempting to hide your head in the sand like an ostrich, but this avoidance technique is certainly not a sensible long-term solution. Facing the shortcomings of a relationship might actually put you back in touch with your heart, which in turn, could lead to an emotional healing."
aries,2013-09-19,"You may promise a co-worker that you can keep a secret, but your intentions are better than your follow-through. Today's spiritual Pisces Full Moon occurs in your 12th House of Privacy, sending mixed messages and bringing awareness as it shines light into your subconscious mind. But you want others to hear your opinions once the Moon moves into your sign. Waiting for the right moment is wise as long as you realize that sharing what you know is smarter than anyone currently realizes."
taurus,2013-09-19,"Although you are often happy to remain exactly where you are, today you're just as eager to see where things could lead. The Full Moon's presence in your 11th House of Social Networking lures you away from your tunnel vision to assimilate a wider glimpse of the outside world. Take a chance and reach farther than you have in the past. The future is waiting for you just around the corner if you are ready to embrace it."
gemini,2013-09-19,"Problems may arise now because there are too many choices, prompting you to narrow the field of contenders. You have many options you hadn't previously noticed and today's psychic Pisces Full Moon illuminates your 10th House of Professional Life, opening exciting doors of opportunity. Several possibilities look so good that you can already see positive things happening in your imagination. Continue exploring the variety of paths before you, but don't count your chickens before they hatch."
cancer,2013-09-19,"All the flowery language in the world won't pull you too far off track today if an idea doesn't make practical sense, too. The emotional Pisces Moon, shining in your 9th House of Philosophy, reflects your eagerness to talk about your high ideals. As much as you love dreaming about the future and rationalizing your feelings now, you'll be more successful if you remember to bring your conceptual ideas back down to earth. Let your kite soar into the clouds of illusion but keep your feet on the ground."
leo,2013-09-19,"Working with others can complicate things now because there are fundamental differences between your needs and those of a partner. The slippery Pisces Full Moon floods your 8th House of Deep Sharing, tempting you to avoid an emotionally awkward discussion that touches your core beliefs. However, evasive action won't sustain you for very long; you might end up feeling like a fish out of water. Instead of running from the truth, stop for a moment and embrace it."
virgo,2013-09-19,You know better than to immediately choose one side in an argument just because you have the facts in front of you. You may prefer to do a bit of personal research before sharing your response. Today's whimsical Pisces Full Moon opposes your Sun in no-nonsense Virgo. You must be careful now because there's more to the current dynamics than simply playing by the rules. Lighten up; making a few allowances for what isn't yet apparent pays off in the long run.
libra,2013-09-19,"It's not easy to set aside your natural role as a mediator and simply participate in the current situation. However, time for analysis and logic is over; you're better off to trust your intuition today with the mystical Pisces Full Moon lighting up your 6th House of Routine. Your imagination will take you farther now than executing your plan according to the book, since the rules may need to be bent for you to succeed. Stop asking so many questions and just follow your instincts."
scorpio,2013-09-19,"If you can't justify taking a substantial amount of time away from work today, at least try to apply your creativity when you're on the job. But it's pointless to follow a previously created recipe for success. Instead, utilize the energy of the magical Pisces Full Moon as it brightens your 5th House of Play and add a bit of spontaneity back into your life. Honor the child within."
sagittarius,2013-09-19,"You could fool yourself into assuming that everyone is happy today when, in fact, someone close to you may be working diligently to cover up his or her insecurities. But the confusing Pisces Full Moon lands in your 4th House of Domestic Conditions, suggesting that you don't know as much as you think about what's happening on the home front. Although you might believe that it's best to focus on your job, you won't get away with ignoring the truth for long. Don't wait; set some time aside to check in with those you love."
capricorn,2013-09-19,"You may feel a bit unsettled now because you prefer to know exactly where you are standing and be in total command of where you are going. But today's foggy Pisces Full Moon falls in your 3rd House of Immediate Environment, challenging you to discern navigational markers in the current landscape. There's no need to struggle; give up the reins of control today. Take a deep breath and trust the forces of the universe to lead you to the right destination."
aquarius,2013-09-19,"Getting a handle on your fiscal situation is a challenging task today with the surreal Pisces Full Moon spotlighting your 2nd House of Finances. However, you can make progress if you have the right people on your team. If you can't find any answers now, don't be afraid to lean on a trustworthy friend or consult a professional adviser to set you straight. Involving someone you respect gives you the fresh perspective you need."
pisces,2013-09-19,"Today's Full Moon occupies your sign, turning up the volume on your fantasies and amplifying your strong feelings. Meanwhile, mischievous Mercury's connection to excessive Jupiter makes it difficult  to maintain a healthy perspective on your relationships. Rather than stressing about making any decisions now, just put them off for a day or two until you regain clarity. Enjoy exploring your dreams, without the pressure to do anything about them yet."
aries,2013-09-20,"Initiating action is not as simple as it sounds today. You may wisely delay your recent plans, only to exhaust yourself by running around and telling everyone what you're going to do. At some point you realize that talking requires nearly as much energy as just doing it. But changing your strategy too soon might lead to a false start. Paradoxically, the longer you can control your impulses, the more you will be able to accomplish once you decide to begin."
taurus,2013-09-20,"You might assume the role as the strong and silent one of the group because everyone else is behaving in an irresponsible manner now. However, keeping your critical feelings quiet is not wise today because your suppressed thoughts will only fester if you don't get them out into the open. Remember, you don't have to blame anyone else for the lack of progress. A more productive tactic is to express your concerns in a kind and loving manner that invites improvement rather than resistance."
gemini,2013-09-20,Your progressive thinking is an inspiration to your peers today as long as you don't push the limits too far. You might not realize that you are being aggressive as your excitement overtakes your logic. Remember that others may take a while to warm up to your unconventional ideas. They could even become enthusiastic if you let them do it at their own pace. Keep in mind Rome wasn't built in a day.
cancer,2013-09-20,"You're asked to put out a lot of energy today even if you're not sure that it's really worth it. Unfortunately, you may not have the freedom to say no because others are expecting you to come through for them. Ultimately; it's probably easier to just go ahead and hold up your end of a job by giving it your best. You could even finish early enough to still find some time to take care of yourself."
leo,2013-09-20,"You want to slow down today but there's so much on your schedule that relaxation seems out of the question. Nevertheless, you're jazzed about a variety of opportunities; however, your current enthusiasm may not last when a fun project turns into hard work. Adopting a methodical approach brings more success than spontaneously making it up as you go along. Setting goals gives you a reachable target, but you're still better off to make a plan and follow it as closely as you can."
virgo,2013-09-20,"Interacting with the right people now opens doors that were previously closed. But there's often a price to pay when you're dealing with powerful folks because they might expect something from you in return for their assistance. Nevertheless, don't be afraid to work with someone who pushes you farther than usual, even if it means facing your own insecurities at the same time. You'll never know what is possible unless you try."
libra,2013-09-20,"You may be caught between the serious work that you have to do to honor your soul today and other people's expectations of you. Naturally, there's little question about which is more important to you, but your obligations to others sufficiently complicate your life now. Honor your commitments even if your heart is somewhere else; a payoff for your sacrifice could come as early as next week."
scorpio,2013-09-20,"Staying focused on your chores is nearly impossible today because you are easily distracted by everything that sounds interesting. But it's not a sensible strategy to consciously run out on your responsibilities, even if love -- or something that looks like it -- is calling. Be smart and find a way to deliver on your promises while still leaving time for your personal explorations. Creating balance in your life brings you more happiness in the long run."
sagittarius,2013-09-20,"Reestablishing your priorities help you gain a healthy perspective today. Set your work obligations aside and do something that makes you feel wonderful. Thankfully, you won't likely face any negative repercussions from your apparently irresponsible actions. In fact, you may receive more support than you expect as others experience vicarious thrills watching your antics. Go on and add some adventure into your life; you'll regret it if you don't."
capricorn,2013-09-20,"You can see the proverbial handwriting on the wall today and might suddenly realize how incredibly busy you will be over the next couple of weeks. Instead of stressing about your calendar, take some time for yourself while you still have the chance. It's as if you've reached a breaking point and simply need to relax so you can prepare for challenges in the future. Don't waste energy doubting the wisdom of this strategy now if it feels right to rest up for tomorrow."
aquarius,2013-09-20,"You're thrilled about what you're doing today because you are actually learning a new skill as you go along. Although your current actions may fit into your master plan to move you closer to your goals, there might be an undercurrent of intensity coming from someone who is jealous of your accomplishments. Don't buy into anyone's negativity, especially if they are bringing their fears or insecurities into your life. No one can rain on your parade if you cultivate a positive attitude."
pisces,2013-09-20,"Feeling good about yourself today is more important than it is for others to acknowledge your competence. There's nothing wrong with avoiding the spotlight for a while. Thankfully, there's no need to worry about public acceptance now. Your job is to find ways to live in harmony with your core beliefs. If you can move your actions closer to your life purpose, you'll be pushed back out onto center stage soon enough."
aries,2013-09-21,"You are good to go and there isn't much that will get in your way as you reach for your goals now. However, if your confidence is overinflated, it's time to bring your ego back down to a sensible size. Although having a healthy self-esteem is admirable, it's not a great idea to burn too hot today or you won't have enough energy left to enjoy tomorrow. Savoring the journey is just as important as crossing the finish line."
taurus,2013-09-21,"Unfulfilled responsibilities may necessitate talking about a serious issue on the home front. However, you might prefer to escape by putting your efforts toward redecorating a room or simply hosting a long-overdue gathering with friends. On the other hand, activities with children could take up more of your time now. It's all too easy to fill up your day with chores that keep you busy. However, your smartest strategy is to prioritize your obligations and take care of the most important ones first."
gemini,2013-09-21,"You thrive on today's fast pace, even if your life seems so noisy that you can't relax. You may not want it any quieter; however, there are so many exciting things to do, you don't even know where to start. The good news is you're at the beginning of a major cycle of manifestation. Speak or write your intentions as clearly as you can -- and then get busy on being the change you want to happen."
cancer,2013-09-21,"Shifting gears today can stabilize whatever you established over the past few weeks. You may feel like moving slowly at first; after all, you are a tentative Crab. But you also see the wisdom in pushing your desires out into the open so others could join in your effort. There's no time now for shyness. Make a direct beeline toward your destination whether anyone else is on board or not."
leo,2013-09-21,"Your star is on the rise and you are either ready for what is about to happen next or you will miss your chance entirely. Although the butterflies in your stomach are fluttering, once you get started, the tension magically transforms into heightened clarity and concentrated energy. Let go of any residual resistance. There's no room for insecurity; get out on stage and let the show begin."
virgo,2013-09-21,"Trusting your intuition isn't always the simplest task since the most irrational thoughts tend to make you quite nervous. However, it's now time to put away your analytical thoughts and cool logic. Rely on your greatest strength: your ability to focus your mind on the issue at hand by tuning out everything else. But don't waste energy since today is the last day of the Sun in your efficient sign. Become one with your dreams and watch them bloom."
libra,2013-09-21,"Someone may confront you with a complicated fiscal issue today, but it might not seem all that important to you. Even if your lack of interest leads you to sidestep a confrontation, your stubbornness could still land you in an unpleasant argument. If you really want to avoid direct conflict, use your diplomatic skills to charm your way through the day. Engaging in a real discussion without becoming defensive can open a door to a lasting solution."
scorpio,2013-09-21,"You are in the spotlight these days and you might as well enjoy the love and appreciation that is coming your way. Instead of minimizing your accomplishments, be proud and stand tall; bask in the glow of recognition for the work that you do so well -- even if you don't think it's such a big deal. Although opening your heart to receive can be challenging, give yourself permission to feel the warmth of admiration and respect."
sagittarius,2013-09-21,"Although the summer sun is waning, you may still be waiting to escape. Fortunately, there's still time to pack up and take that special trip you have been dreaming about now that action-planet Mars is traveling through your 9th House of Journeys. Even if you can't get out of town, at least plan some fun activities over the days ahead that have nothing to do with work. A spontaneous adventure could improve your perspective more than you can imagine."
capricorn,2013-09-21,"If you feel overextended from working extra hard  over the past few days, take a break to recover. It's time to focus your energy on doing less of everything. Obviously, you still need to be productive, but it's crucial to slow down now and recharge your batteries. You really don't have to be lazy about it, for you can relax your mind while riding a bike, hiking in the woods or even playing a team sport."
aquarius,2013-09-21,"You may feel as if everyone is ganging up on you today, but their intentions are more supportive than their actions seem to you. Although you might receive an entire spectrum of messages now, it's up to you to tune out the extraneous noise so you can hear only the most relevant ones. If you are thwarted by circumstances, try taking a more serious and determined approach to reach your goals. You have more power than you think, so use it wisely."
pisces,2013-09-21,You don't like being pushed into a new situation until you are fully prepared for what happens next. Often this is as much about mental readiness as it is about practicing a specific skill set. It doesn't really matter if you resist the changes; you're being drawn into a powerful river of momentum. The time is now; focus on each task and give it your best shot. Be flexible; you may be surprised at how much fun you can have -- even while you're taking care of business.
aries,2013-09-22,"Trying to maintain your daily routine might sound like the responsible course of action, but it's no longer working the way you thought it should. Your focus shifts away from doing everything the same old way now as the Sun leaves your 6th House of Habits. You are more concerned with how others feel with the Sun stepping into your 7th House of Partners today. Listen to what your friends and co-workers have to say before assuming that you already know what they want. Cultivating mutual respect is the key to a successful relationship."
taurus,2013-09-22,"You are taking your job quite seriously these days since you know that accomplishing your goals depends on how well you perform. You may actually feel the change of seasons today as the Sun enters airy Libra, illuminating your 6th House of Employment. Someone might be judging you rather harshly now in spite of all your extra efforts. Don't argue with anyone over the quality of your work; just keep doing your very best because that's what will pay off in the long run."
gemini,2013-09-22,"Although you may still have weighty decisions on your mind, you could become a bit more lighthearted today as the Sun moves into your 5th House of Spontaneous Fun. But even your playful antics can be driven by very serious issues as you explore the extreme possibilities that stretch out before you. Continue to consider all your options, even if you believe that you have already made your choice. A fresh and creative approach might just surprise you with where it leads."
cancer,2013-09-22,"Your opinion about an important family matter may be in flux now that the Sun is settling into your 4th House of Security. You aren't as determined to stick to your previous point of view, for you want to take everyone's perspective into account. But others shouldn't mistake your ambivalence for detachment. It's healthy to remain fully engaged today, even if you aren't sure of what to do next."
leo,2013-09-22,"You might still be dealing with money issues, but you sense the winds of change blowing in a positive direction. As the cosmic weather pattern begins to shift today, you could feel as if you are a kite being buffeted around by the unsettled gusts. There's no use trying to fight it; instead use the movement to power your flight as you gain altitude. But don't assume that you can quickly reach your goals now; it's better to wait until the current squall passes and your life calms down before making your big push."
virgo,2013-09-22,"This is the beginning of a transitional phase when you must sustain the changes that have already started to unfold. But you might feel as if you are caught in the middle, for you still have old business to complete before you can move on to whatever is next. Don't let the frustration get to you; instead take the extra time you are being given to improve your strategy for the future. Today's methodical preparation will pay off tomorrow."
libra,2013-09-22,"You want to shine the light of your awareness on the mysteries of the universe now that the evocative Moon is visiting your 8th House of Regeneration. But today's Autumnal Equinox heralds the radiance of the Sun entering your 1st House of Personality, prompting you to seek ways to extend the energy of the summer. Although your attempts to prevent the onset of fall will be fruitless, your current lesson is to stay in the present moment and to cultivate peace within the larger cycles you cannot control."
scorpio,2013-09-22,You can't decide whether to luxuriate in the intensity of your passions or to replace your unfulfilled desires with an acceptance of your present circumstances. The Moon's opposition to resistant Saturn and magnetic Venus reminds you that clinging to any emotion too tightly changes it into something else. The choice remains yours; alleviate your frustration by focusing on the creative and spiritual aspects of your life.
sagittarius,2013-09-22,"Hiring a social secretary may not be necessary, but everyone wants to include you in their plans now that the Sun is entering relationship-oriented Libra and your 11th House of Friends. And if your calendar is not full enough, you might be inclined  to escape from your regular responsibilities now by joining a club or a political organization. And although you could take yourself rather seriously today, rest assured there are plenty of good times right around the corner."
capricorn,2013-09-22,Your natural proclivity to work for the success you desire is reinforced today by the conscious Sun's shift into your 10th House of Career. But your current ambitions may not fit in easily with the rest of your life now and it might even feel as if you are somehow at cross-purposes with yourself. Cherishing your dreams is fine as long as you are willing to reconsider how you can best make them come true.
aquarius,2013-09-22,"Although you are quite preoccupied with your professional development these days, you can also step back and reassess your goals as the Sun moves into your 9th House of Future Vision. However, balancing the fantasies of your ideal situation with your current responsibilities may not be as simple as it sounds. Pushing your agenda too far today will only make life more complicated. Find satisfaction with what you already have rather than what's in your dreams."
pisces,2013-09-22,"You're happy to play the role of host or hostess today as the Sun slips into gracious Libra. But oddly enough, your eager-to-please personality can stand between you and your own happiness because minimizing your desires isn't the same thing as satisfying them. Patience is a virtue as you try to decide whether to be easygoing now or to demand what you want. Taking the middle path by acknowledging the needs of others cultivates good feelings all the way around."
aries,2013-09-23,"Handling unfinished financial business makes sense with the Moon's presence in your 2nd House of Money today, but you could mistakenly put effort into an unnecessary task if you don't set clear priorities first. Establishing what is most important can turn a frustrating day into one of accomplishment. Concentrate on finishing one meaningful project instead of wasting your time on several things that won't really matter in the long run."
taurus,2013-09-23,"You are wearing your heart on your sleeve for everyone to see today, even if you don't want to share your emotions. Your reactions are more transparent to others now that the Moon is back in your 1st House of Appearances. However, your friends and associates might not fully understand your inner process, especially if things are more complicated than you wish. Although tempting, it's not wise to leave out significant details just because it's convenient in the moment."
gemini,2013-09-23,"You seem to be as steady as a rock today, but your stability may be a result of withholding something that you aren't ready to reveal. Normally, you're eager to blurt out your thoughts but you're likely to remain quiet now. Wait until you're clear about your feelings; develop your ideas for another couple of days before divulging your plans. Fine tuning your strategy improves your chances for success."
cancer,2013-09-23,"It's likely that your ideas will continue to take shape over the next couple of days until a concrete plan materializes from the clouds of your imagination. Ironically, the Moon's current visit to your 11th House of Dreams and Wishes can solidify your plans as you put the pieces of your life together in a practical way, rather than just entertaining idle fantasies. Don't be overly concerned if you can't yet figure out how to reach your goals; somehow, all the pieces will fall into place just in time."
leo,2013-09-23,"You aren't interested in carefully tip-toeing around the truth today. If you see a direct path to your desired destination, you will likely do nearly anything to get there in a speedy manner. Unfortunately, other people may not be so quick to jump on board, requiring you to slow down to explain your plan point by point. Don't automatically trust a new partnership now because it might be smarter to work by yourself for a while longer. Sometimes the only person you can really count on is yourself."
virgo,2013-09-23,You're quite comfortable sharing your thoughts now that the Moon is in your 9th House of Big Ideas because it's easier to talk about the future possibilities rather than the present moment. Stay focused on the horizon; discussing your plans in vague generalities is more productive today than trying to guess what's missing. You can always fill in the details later when you have more of the specifics at your disposal.
libra,2013-09-23,"Untangling all the mixed signals may be challenging today, especially if you want to take the course of least resistance. Although you have common sense working in your favor now, you still could be overly serious about the current situation. Your need to be practical conflicts with an irrepressible yet irrational optimism, prompting you to quickly move past your concerns so you can truly enjoy the good times ahead. Concentrate on the present moment and take one step at a time."
scorpio,2013-09-23,"You want to sink deeper into your subconscious as you explore the current possibilities in your life. But you might run into resistance if you expect a close friend to participate with you on your metaphysical journey. Others may express their willingness to join you, only to withdraw before the energy becomes too intense. Don't worry; you're better off traveling in these imaginative realms by yourself, anyway. Your friends will just have to wait to hear about your amazing adventures when you return."
sagittarius,2013-09-23,The Moon's visit to your 6th House of Routine brings opportunities to think about your physical well-being and encourages you to do something proactive to improve your health. Making small improvements to your diet or exercise program can have positive consequences now as long as you don't alter too much too fast. Small steps that lead to enduring change are more useful than grandiose gestures that only last a day or two. Taking care of your body ensures that you'll have the energy later on when you want it.
capricorn,2013-09-23,"You are riding a highly creative wave as the emotional Moon washes through your 5th House of Self-Expression. Fortunately, the dependable Taurus Moon enables you to set a sustainable pace in the morning and then stick with it until you finish your chores. Thankfully, you should have time for play, too, making this a relatively pleasant day. Nevertheless, expansive Jupiter tempts you to take on more than you can complete, so don't say yes unless you really mean it."
aquarius,2013-09-23,"You are likely to receive much-needed support from family members and close friends now that the Moon is hanging out in your 4th House of Roots. Although you appreciate their warm generosity, the assistance might not be what you need -- even if others mean well. If you feel smothered by someone meddling in your affairs, express your concerns as kindly as possible. Count your blessings; there's no reason to make your life more complicated by offending your allies. You're lucky to have people in your life who care."
pisces,2013-09-23,"You may be swept right off your feet by other people's agendas today because you think they need your help. Unfortunately, you could end up feeling like your assistance wasn't very useful at all. Additionally, your own work could remain neglected. However, if you establish clear boundaries so you can fulfill your responsibilities early in the day, you'll feel eager about jumping in to support someone else."
aries,2013-09-24,"You might not be able to recall all the details about what recently went awry, but that won't prevent you from becoming discouraged over a current relationship, anyway. Some of your disappointment may be entangled with your personal history that you could be trying to forget. However, filling in the missing gaps in your story frees you from endlessly repeating a pattern that no longer works. Facing your past liberates you to joyfully experience the future."
taurus,2013-09-24,"Avoiding the pressure of work sounds like a good idea today but, unfortunately, you cannot just slip away on a whim. Even if you try to escape into your memories, reminiscing about your childhood won't likely offer you the solace you seek. Your awareness keeps returning to the present moment and what you are currently lacking. There's no need to force a change; just let your thoughts wander back and forth between the past and present until they settle down."
gemini,2013-09-24,"Your moods shift often today with the Moon back in your changeable sign, yet the pressure may still feel like it's too much to handle. It helps to consider which feelings are worth sharing and which ones might better be kept to yourself. Ultimately, it's easier to listen compassionately to someone else's problems than to open yourself up to scrutiny by talking about your own. Choosing the safest route is not the best choice if it means closing down your heart. Let down your guard and confide in a trustworthy friend."
cancer,2013-09-24,"Your relationship to material possessions can strongly impact the decisions you make today. If you have childhood recollections of not getting what you want, you could be motivated to accumulate more than you need now. If you link the idea of happiness to possessing money or things, you might wonder what you're missing. Thankfully, you can free yourself from your past if you focus on the intangible blessings of the present moment."
leo,2013-09-24,"Although you are known for your playful nature, it's still a challenge to be true to yourself today. Of course, denying who you are or avoiding the truth about someone else is not an intelligent option. Dwelling on a previous disappointment in your life could close the door on a lovely time before it even has a chance to manifest. Sharing your story can be healing if you don't carry it like a shield to protect you. Simply letting go of your fears allows you to realize your potential."
virgo,2013-09-24,"It's frustrating when others at work don't understand your motives. You could actually believe that you told them what is most important to you, yet they still don't get it. Instead of adding to the stress by further attempting to explain yourself, try an entirely new approach today. Stop reaching for a connection that isn't there; just interact without any expectations. Your emotional detachment alleviates tension and makes room for better communication later on."
libra,2013-09-24,"Obviously, relationships are important to you, but now they seem even more significant than ever as you work through deeply rooted issues. Your expectations could come from lessons you learned in your childhood or even from memories of early family dynamics. Rediscovering your origins can clear the idealism from your current perspective that would otherwise set you up for disappointment. The best strategy is to indulge in social activities without turning them into anything other than the simple pleasures that they are."
scorpio,2013-09-24,"Your over-analytical mind might provoke you to engage in an uncomfortable exchange with an old friend now. Although your intentions may be honorable, other people's reactions could leave you frustrated, making you believe that you weren't truly heard. You bring more baggage to your conversations than you realize which can cause confusion. Being aware of your assumptions saves you from a bothersome headache later on. Think less; feel more."
sagittarius,2013-09-24,"You may believe that a lot is at stake because nearly everything appears to be a big deal today. Fortunately, you can overcome your fears and step into the current situation with a healthy attitude. Keep in mind that someone may choose to resist your enthusiasm, but don't take it too personally. The fewer expectations you have now, the better it will be for everyone involved. Be brave and take a leap of faith."
capricorn,2013-09-24,"You ethical Goats usually want to do what is right, but another person's wounded feelings might tempt you to say something you don't actually mean. Nevertheless, be up front with what you want even if your needs are different from someone else's. It's healthier to acknowledge your desires without putting any expectations on others in the process. It's not really about your message; it's more to do with how you deliver it."
aquarius,2013-09-24,"You have an opportunity now to alter your current patterns and positively impact your future destiny. You may choose to walk down the path of love in order to pursue an unsatisfied fantasy, but this doesn't necessarily mean a new relationship. It can be the beginning of a deeper kind of intimacy based upon complete honesty with yourself and others. Romance grows even sweeter when illusions no longer muddy the water."
pisces,2013-09-24,"Turning a special dream into reality isn't a simple task, yet the outcome of your efforts may be quite satisfying now. Nevertheless, forcing results is not a smart strategy today, even if you think you're clever enough to pull it off. Instead, let go of your personal needs; open your heart to more fulfilling relationships that are based on spiritual principles rather than irrational emotional desires."
aries,2013-09-25,"Although the dynamics between you and a close friend may be out of kilter, you can still talk yourself into thinking that everything's just fine. Don't lose track of your priorities if social pressures begin to unravel your plans. Focusing on what you need to do for your job is smarter than having to clean up a mess because you were distracted by personal relationship issues. Establishing clear priorities early in the day helps you avoid a crisis later on. Simply acknowledging another person's feelings may be enough alleviate the tension."
taurus,2013-09-25,"You might believe that you're simply pursuing love today, but you could still get more than you bargain for if you're too eager in your approach. Your key planet Venus is visiting your 7th House of Partners and her connection with rebellious Uranus pulls you into a complicated entanglement. You can't trust your intuition now because you're overly attached to your dreams. Thankfully, you can make a good decision by sticking to the facts when deciding your next move."
gemini,2013-09-25,"Satisfaction is elusive now because the Moon's current visit to your sign might tempt you to find other pastures that look greener than yours. Nevertheless, you are committed to meeting your obligations today so you won't likely escape on a whim. Appreciate the present moment and try to be grateful for whatever you have. Taking a mature approach to relationships could be enough to put your day back on track and calm your restless heart."
cancer,2013-09-25,"If a friend or associate pushes back against your ideas today, you may be tempted to retreat emotionally. Even if you are secure in the relationship, your fear of rejection could motivate you to avoid the discussion entirely. You believe it's easier to ignore your gut than to express whatever is in your heart -- but it's not. To the contrary, it's healthier to share your concerns openly and allow the other person a chance to respond. You might be pleasantly surprised if you're willing to take a risk."
leo,2013-09-25,"Feeling a bit insecure today can lead to tricky relationship dynamics, especially if you believe that one of your friends or associates hasn't been honest with you. In fact, people could be trying to make something appear better than it really is. Normally, you would be too clever for anyone to get away with misleading you, but now it's also possible for your fears -- rather than someone else's actions -- to amplify your anxiety. Double check the facts before jumping to any false conclusions."
virgo,2013-09-25,"You might not know how to make sense out of your feelings today because you are temporarily losing your ability to remain logical while analyzing your options. Even if you try to separate fact from fiction, you're more likely to accept whatever you are told now, setting you up for later disappointment. Keep in mind that choices colored by your subjective preferences will probably lead you astray. Paring back your options simplifies the decision-making process."
libra,2013-09-25,"Your vivid imagination is working overtime today and you're preoccupied by a fantasy instead of what's actually going on. You are being pulled in two different directions now, so you must be careful about choosing dreams over reality. Confusion about your own needs can lead to an unwise choice, so put off important decisions for a day or two until your clarity returns. In the meantime, practicing meditation helps you get in touch with your higher self."
scorpio,2013-09-25,"Trying to recall a childhood experience is perplexing today because you might not be able to remember enough of the facts to know if it truly occurred or not. Either way, you realize now that there probably is another side to the story that you haven't thought about. Take plenty of time and fill in the details. However, your desire for the truth may turn into an obsession, so it's wise to know when to bring your thoughts back to the present and stop trying to rewrite your past."
sagittarius,2013-09-25,"Taking charge at home or in your community is where you shine today, but your assumption of authority could also create an awkward situation. Although you think you know what's best for everyone else, people might disagree with your current strategy. Unfortunately, your sound logic won't help to convince anyone that you are right. You may have to just let your friends and associates go off on their own to discover what's true by themselves. Don't let others rain on your parade."
capricorn,2013-09-25,"You may be distracted now even if you're usually quite astute when dealing with financial matters. If you see something that you immediately want to buy, it's best to wait a few days before actually finalizing the purchase. Although you might believe that you deserve a reward for all of your hard work, impulsive spending isn't a smart idea. Giving yourself the gift of personal time could make the payoff even better than you expect."
aquarius,2013-09-25,"You're confident that you're being absolutely clear about your romantic intentions today, yet someone can totally misunderstand what you're saying. Complications may arise if your repressed feelings are strong enough to color how you deliver your message. Keep asking for feedback along the way to ensure that your words convey exactly what you mean. Let your heart speak for itself."
pisces,2013-09-25,"Your eagerness leads you to anticipate what someone wants from you now, but too much analysis can get in the way. Unfortunately, you're likely to jump to the wrong conclusions without checking out your assumptions. Don't stress if you have trouble meeting other people's expectations today, since they probably have unrealistic hopes, anyway. Instead of worrying about anyone else, just do the best work you can and then move on. Believe in yourself; there's no need to compromise when it comes to your integrity."
aries,2013-09-26,"Standing at the edge of a new experience is a reassuring feeling for you Rams. You might even begin an extremely exciting venture now, for you have an optimistic sense about life and you are eager to play out your part. Be as adventurous as you wish. Live outside the constraints of negativity and reach for the stars."
taurus,2013-09-26,"There is something magical about pleasure that makes you feel like all is well in the world. You may perceive loveliness wherever you go today as your key planet Venus receives an encouraging nudge from lucky Jupiter, giving you a sense of contentment. But beware; the shadow of laziness lurks nearby when times are sweet. Do whatever you can to overcome the inertia of inaction because opportunities are knocking loudly at your door."
gemini,2013-09-26,"You can't get enough of interacting with other people today because there's an easy flow of energy between you and your coworkers. If there's any social activity cooking, you want to be a part of it. If there's nothing exciting on your calendar, then invite a few friends to lunch. Start your celebration early before your mood shifts again. By nightfall, you may feel like being alone so you can lose yourself in your dreams. Honoring your changeability is essential to your happiness."
cancer,2013-09-26,"You may be rewarded for being extra sweet at work today, but your magic is meant for more than just taking care of everyone else. Be responsible to your own needs by spending time with a loved one. Going out with a close friend or sharing a romantic meal with a partner might be exactly what is needed to rekindle the intimacy in a current relationship. If nothing else, at least treat yourself to something special. Remember, others will be nicer to you if you start by being good to yourself."
leo,2013-09-26,"A lovely day is in store for you Lions as you get the opportunity to perform on center stage. Happily, your enthusiastic actions are acknowledged and even applauded by your friends and fans; chances are that you will be asked to do an encore. However, it's crucial to know when to stop. It's better if you leave your audience always wanting more."
virgo,2013-09-26,"Taking care of business sounds like a good idea today, but you may grow restless while trying to follow through with your plans. Your intentions are honorable, but distractions abound and it's tempting now to pick a path that leads to fleeting pleasure instead of a sense of accomplishment. Sharing your heart with a friend can spark a sweet encounter, but you might regret your decision if you don't also meet your obligations at work."
libra,2013-09-26,"Your star is shining brightly now that charming Venus trines propitious Jupiter in your 10th House of Career. It's time to receive acknowledgement from your peers -- and maybe even a raise. No matter what happens, keep your heart open to jovial Jupiter and let the good times roll. But don't forget about your duties and obligations as you pursue the next wonderful experience. If you handle practical matters first, you can continue to work and play with great success."
scorpio,2013-09-26,"You might not have to apply yourself very hard today for recognition, money and even romance to find their way to your door. Naturally, it helps if you are enjoying your work, for your ongoing attachment to your daily routine is what pays the bills and feeds your heart. If you don't like your current regimen, figure out a way to bring the missing pleasure back into your life. Do what you love and the rewards will follow."
sagittarius,2013-09-26,"Your charisma attracts opportunities that bring pleasure today as beautiful Venus harmonizes with buoyant Jupiter. Romance may find you now, even if you're not looking; give yourself permission to act spontaneously without worrying about the future. If your love interest doesn't play out successfully, then seek other ways to express your creativity. Just be careful not to overdo it, for excessive behavior can land you into a heap of trouble. Moderation is the secret to your success."
capricorn,2013-09-26,"Although it's a workday, your life may be more about enjoyment now than anything else. You might discover ideas that motivate you, even if they're not job related. You are genuinely more affectionate as you express your appreciation to others. It's okay to break the rules and indulge in something outrageous simply for the pleasure it brings you. You can put yourself back on the straight and narrow path tomorrow."
aquarius,2013-09-26,"During these past few weeks you might have reconsidered what's most important for your personal fulfillment at work. After thinking things over, you are ready to blast ahead again now that you are back on top of your game. Don't fake confidence if you aren't positive about where you are going; it only makes more problems for you later on. Expressing your vulnerability makes you more lovable while increasing your chances to reach your destination."
pisces,2013-09-26,"Blue skies and open horizons tempt you to believe that everything is perfect today, but your assumptions might drag you down a dangerous path. Honor your concerns instead of just glossing over them in search of the next wonderful experience. Even if something or someone appears very alluring, consider the pitfalls of pursuing pleasure over responsibility. Fortunately, an amazing experience is yours for the asking as long as you maintain your balance."
aries,2013-09-27,"Everyone seems to be concerned about you today because you aren't as outgoing as others expect. But how people react isn't really your problem. It's more important to show your vulnerability now in a way that lets others move past your usual displays of confidence and into your heart. You may feel a bit uncomfortable knowing that someone truly sees you, but ultimately this is part of your healing process. It's amazing how close you can feel to another person if you simply lower your defenses."
taurus,2013-09-27,"You might feel as if others are rubbing you the wrong way today. You can choose to remain irritated or you can turn your discomfort into a learning experience. Fortunately, you don't have to remain quiet and allow someone else to continue annoying you. Stand up for yourself and state your limits. Your relationships have the potential to grow if you are honest and keep your anger to a minimum. Setting clear boundaries makes it easier on everyone involved."
gemini,2013-09-27,"Old memories may return to haunt you today, making it difficult to finalize an important decision. If you feel pushed, unwarranted fears could make a difference now, tilting you toward caution instead of action. But even if you turn down an opportunity, you still might grow restless with your current routine and wish that you said yes. Thankfully, once you acknowledge that there's no single path, it will be easier to accept the one you have chosen. Remember, the journey is the reward."
cancer,2013-09-27,"Although your good intentions may be sincere, your current behavior doesn't necessarily demonstrate your true feelings. You might feel moodier than you let on since the hypersensitive Cancer Moon can give you a lot to worry about. However, others seem to tire quickly when you express all your concerns, so you may attempt to keep your fears to yourself. Remember, even suppressed feelings can negatively impact your day, so find a way to share your uncertainties without burdening anyone else."
leo,2013-09-27,"You may have to demonstrate your leadership skills today or have interactions with others where you must set an optimistic tone. However, it's not necessarily appropriate to share your most personal issues, even if you have a lot on your mind. For now, put your best foot forward and show your most professional side. You can handle your private matters later on when you have the time."
virgo,2013-09-27,"You might need to withdraw emotionally today because your friends and associates seem a bit too moody for your taste -- and you just don't want to deal with them. But pulling away from the group may reinforce your isolation, provoking more emotional drama. Instead, consider the possibility that it's really your own feelings that are being stirred and not those of everyone else. Taking responsibility for your projections enables you to behave in a manner that's more consistent to your needs."
libra,2013-09-27,"Although your actions can positively impact others on the job today, they might not realize the value of your contribution. However, there's no need to make a big deal out of your current behavior. You may not have a strong desire to be in charge now, yet you are still able to exert subtle control in order to steer events your way. Nevertheless, the pieces will fall into place if you work for the benefit of all."
scorpio,2013-09-27,"You are usually able to demonstrate your power by making up your mind and sticking to your decision. However, you may be more open to change now, especially if someone's new idea adds enjoyment to your day. Although you might not be willing to sacrifice efficiency for fun, you don't want to lose out on the opportunity to make a good plan even better. Listening to your heart and living your passion ultimately brings stability to your world."
sagittarius,2013-09-27,"You're more inclined today to get to the bottom of an emotional issue that has been brewing for a while. However, once a conversation is in the works, you're likely to grow restless, preferring to change the subject to a lighter topic of conversation. Nevertheless, you'll feel more satisfied in the long run if you stick with it until some sort of resolution is reached. Your persistence pays off even if it's difficult at first."
capricorn,2013-09-27,"You don't like it when others aren't open to your method of accomplishing your objectives today. You feel as if everyone else is stuck in his or her old patterns or, perhaps, just afraid to try something new. Either way, it's helpful to be patient with a friend or partner because your insistence could stir up more resistance. Ultimately, your plan will be accepted on its merits if you give your critics time to readjust their thinking."
aquarius,2013-09-27,"You're usually captivated by concepts more than being interested in any one specific method. However, you could become bogged down with seemingly unimportant minutiae today and you can't see an easy way to avoid the red tape. Fortunately, your detour into a world of laser-like focus can bring its own kind of freedom, so limit your concentration on being efficient in the present moment."
pisces,2013-09-27,"Your eagerness to take an emotional risk might not be readily apparent, but what reaches the surface isn't the most important thing today. You're in the process of making big changes in your attitude yet it may take a while before your inner work becomes obvious on the outside. For now, be content with acknowledging the plethora of possibilities you see, even if you're not ready to share your optimism with anyone else. There's no need to rush into anything; you'll intuitively know when it's time to involve others."
aries,2013-09-28,"Sweet love is on your mind as you weave your romantic fantasies today. Exploring your attractions to friends and associates is harmless, but it's wise not to act on every feeling that pops into awareness. Keep in mind that what goes on inside your head belongs to you alone. Give yourself permission to dream; just remember to come back down to earth once you open your eyes. Some things are better kept to yourself."
taurus,2013-09-28,"There is a bit of confusion in the air now as you sort out the differences between your role in the outer world with your friends and your desire to be hanging out at home. This dilemma can take a variety of different forms. Even if you have more chores on your plate today, remember that your next wave of growth -- emotional and spiritual -- will come from the close connections you have with your past and your family. Taking care of your business early in the day allows you to spend your time doing what matters most."
gemini,2013-09-28,"Your tendency is to say it out loud today, write it in an email or even blast it out on the Internet so that everyone knows your feelings. However, acting on this insistent urge to communicate is not the most appropriate thing to do now. Just sit back and let go of your expectations. You're going to need to sort out individual differences in order to make your plans work. Keep in mind this kind of negotiation may progress easier if you don't lay all your cards on the table at once. Listen first; speak later."
cancer,2013-09-28,"You might grow uneasy today when you realize that you need to take a stand. Since you tend to be more flexible in your approach, your inclination is to wait and see how things go before making your wishes known. Now, however, you are being pushed into going on the record about what you want. Ironically, if you overstate your needs, you could be left high and dry. If you don't take responsibility for your own feelings, others may never know how you felt. The choice is yours."
leo,2013-09-28,"You might find yourself in the middle of a squabble today, even if it's not your fight. Mysterious misunderstandings continue to create tension and you believe that you have a role in sorting it all out. Be careful, for your point of view isn't necessarily representative of anyone else's. Offer your perspective, but don't try to persuade others to agree with you. Keeping your tone gentle allows others to hear your message. Sometimes a quiet meow is more effective than a loud roar."
virgo,2013-09-28,"An ongoing dilemma in your love life might be based on a basic conflict of values. What are you willing to give up now to receive what you need from a relationship? What constitutes an ideal relationship? And how perfectly do your expectations need to align? Take a deep breath and relax; there aren't any quick answers now, but these are some good questions to ponder before jumping in with your solution. Initiating an open dialogue is a good place to start."
libra,2013-09-28,"If you can let yourself off the hook for a while, you may have a chance to convert your current stress into creative action. Take whatever struggles you're facing and use the energy to express yourself in ways that are uniquely and eclectically you. This emotional journey has nothing to do with pleasing a partner. It's about accessing your own heart and manifesting more meaning in your life. Be brave and follow your bliss."
scorpio,2013-09-28,"Recognition by your peers is an important factor in your life today, yet you have mixed feelings about being in the spotlight. If your career is not fulfilling your dreams, you may experience some angst as you try to create an alternative path for yourself. Of course, you want to be appreciated for what you do but you're not necessarily interested in performing just for the benefit of others. Your special brand of magic doesn't need a stage to shine."
sagittarius,2013-09-28,"A recurring theme in your life might involve the question of whether to focus on the big issues or to catch up on the little details. You're drawn toward recreating an adventure you recently set aside. Don't get sidetracked, you can narrow your field of vision by concentrating on specific chores first. Once you're certain that you're on the right path, you should be able to balance the very big and the very small with great success."
capricorn,2013-09-28,"You can tell that a large wave of change is coming and you begrudgingly accept the fact that you won't be able to outrun it. No matter how stable your life feels these days, some things will have to shift under the pressure of fluctuating circumstances. Even if you believe that you should hold onto the status quo, begin thinking now about what you will someday leave behind. Evolution will happen with or without your cooperation, but it will be a lot more enjoyable if you remain flexible and are an active participant in the process."
aquarius,2013-09-28,"You might be caught up in a larger pattern that you can't control. Remember, however, that nothing is permanent -- even those things that seem not to change. It appears futile to resist the strong currents now, but it still may be beneficial to establish your limits and make a stand against the outside pressures. Nevertheless, your flexibility is your ultimate weapon. Bending to the tides when the time is right prevents exhaustion and improves your chances of reaching your destination in one piece."
pisces,2013-09-28,"It's nearly impossible to separate your dreams and illusions from reality. Today, as the Moon activates Jupiter and Neptune --  your key planets -- your fantasy life assumes heightened proportions. But if the real world isn't matching up to your idyllic visions, pick your escape route very carefully. Ongoing battles may temporarily pull you off course. Remember, it's all about awareness and not denial. Your imagination holds the keys to your future."
aries,2013-09-29,"Your words gain power today because nearly everything you express is connected to unspoken feelings. However, your mental prowess requires you to be careful so you don't misuse your ability to influence what someone else is thinking. Selfish intentions may generate unnecessary problems which can be avoided if you consider others in your process. Speak your truth without harboring any hidden agendas."
taurus,2013-09-29,"You are ready to pursue a difficult discussion about old relationship issues now that Mercury is visiting your 7th House of Partners. The dynamics for this conversation have been brewing over the past few weeks, and you finally realize how important it is to talk about the situation. Although the energy is already moving into a new phase, don't say more than is required just yet. Taking the discussion to the next level makes sense only after you give your feelings time to settle before putting them out in the open."
gemini,2013-09-29,"Your powers of concentration continue to improve, but you need to set necessary boundaries with close friends and partners to keep on track. However, you are more open now to following others if it looks like they are having fun, but this isn't the best use of your time today. Instead of taking the course of least resistance, narrow your mental focus to establish a deeper connection. Defining your limits requires courage but can also sustain the growth of an important relationship."
cancer,2013-09-29,"You may be eager to demonstrate what you have to offer now, especially within the context of romantic or creative endeavors. However, this isn't about casual flirtation. You are playing for keeps, whether you are working on a project, producing an artistic masterpiece or looking for love. You can increase your chances for success by holding back just enough to feel safe and secure. Once you are ready to take a risk, apply your sense of purpose and go for it."
leo,2013-09-29,"It feels as if things are about to go your way now that the Moon is back in your playful sign. Although unprocessed feelings may be bugging you, you're still eager to go out and have a good time. Perhaps you are secretly concerned about a power struggle that is unfolding with a family member. Remember, it's crucial to get the issues out in the open so there will be fewer surprises in the days ahead."
virgo,2013-09-29,"Use your renowned analytical abilities to discern what are the most essential things to do today. If you don't make concrete plans, you are likely to waste a lot of energy following the wrong path, even if you have an enjoyable time doing it. Don't spread yourself too thin or you will regret it later on. Your greatest challenge now is to separate your grandiose visions from what you can actually pull off."
libra,2013-09-29,"Familiar territory gives way to unfamiliar ground as Mercury, the Winged Messenger, leaves your sign. You might have been developing an idea over these past few weeks, and although it still seems valuable, your attitude is starting to shift. Traveling this path is tricky because you become less objective as you grow more passionate about your life. However, there's no need to justify your current decisions; trust your intuition and move on."
scorpio,2013-09-29,"You're plugged in and can listen more carefully now as you separate out the most significant ideas from the fluff. Cerebral Mercury is hanging out in your sign for an extended stay due to its upcoming retrograde turn on October 21, deeply affecting all aspects of communication and making you less interested than ever in meaningless chatter. Ask nicely for the intimacy you seek and you might actually receive it."
sagittarius,2013-09-29,"The atmosphere is buzzing with waves of energy and you feel the optimistic balloons lifting you into the boundless sky of potential. Simultaneously, however, you are also aware of another layer of feelings that is more complicated. Although acknowledging these emotions could quickly bring you back to the ground, don't let your fears prevent you from taking a little risk. Just make sure to bring along a parachute to ease your fall just in case."
capricorn,2013-09-29,"Your social world is growing more complex now that Mercury is visiting your 11th House of Friends. You might even be feeling an emotional undercurrent at work and it's difficult to know exactly what's going on. However, your concerns aren't just coming from within; even your most ardent supporters are reminding you to be careful today. Pay attention; their advice may help you successfully navigate the changes ahead."
aquarius,2013-09-29,"Dynamics are shifting at work today, and it may take a while to sort out the mixed cosmic messages and choose a path that makes the most sense in the long run. Use the remainder of this weekend to consider all your options. Talk to others about the potential problems you see in the near future. A little extra planning now -- even if it makes you uncomfortable to wait -- can better prepare you for the intensity that's just around the corner."
pisces,2013-09-29,"It's tempting to lose yourself in your fantasies, yet you're quite capable of bringing yourself back down to earth when required. Your dreams are extremely powerful now and you could use them to map out your next moves. Instead of relying on your imagination as an escape, create an inner landscape that matches your goals. Your colorful visualizations can pave the road for your ambitious journey ahead."
aries,2013-09-30,"Although these are challenging times, you're empowered by the persistence of the Leo Moon as it reinforces your feelings. You are very creative in your thoughts and actions today, yet you might miss a significant fact that's being kept from you by a partner or coworker. Hiding the truth from yourself only makes matters worse. As long as your intentions are honorable, honest communication will improve the situation even if your message isn't appreciated at first."
taurus,2013-09-30,"Your own uncertainty may catch you off guard today as the gulf between your irrepressible optimism and undeniable reality widens. But this isn't to say that your enthusiasm is unfounded. It's just that if you stay balanced and rely on logic while tending to the details, you have an even better chance of achieving success. Sheer determination is admirable but it's not a replacement for good judgment."
gemini,2013-09-30,"You may feel overwhelmed today as your world is abuzz with all kinds of distractions. Although this excess noise isn't necessarily negative; it's just a lot of energy to manage. No matter what happens now, keep an upbeat tone when sharing your hopes and concerns with friends. If you can overcome your fear of dreaming out loud, you might be quite wonderfully surprised with the response that you receive."
cancer,2013-09-30,"Although your emotions won't likely be quiet today, you can still maintain a high level of detachment with respect to your feelings. Fortunately, you might be quite rational now, even if you're in the midst of unexpected turmoil. Rely on your intuition as you continue to develop a more practical life strategy. Don't toss out your dreams; instead, turn them into reality."
leo,2013-09-30,"You're being pulled in so many directions now that your ability to maintain your cool is being tested. It's very challenging to keep your day from falling apart, since your schedule could be so full that you think about sleeping less just to fit everything in. Managing your time wisely is essential. The pace of life may speed up throughout the week, so make sure you get your much-needed rest while you can. Your best performance is yet to come."
virgo,2013-09-30,"You're so idealistic about your future that your fantasies can get in the way of what you must accomplish today. Still, dreaming about all the possibilities is healthy now, as long as your feet remain firmly on the ground. Remember, making a wish or creating a vision board is not enough; you must also follow through with positive action. State your goals and then apply your energy with all the determination you can muster. Intention plus hard work equals magic."
libra,2013-09-30,"You can fall in love with love too easily today, even if there is no hot romance brewing in your life at this time. However, for now, it's not about anyone else. You are being drawn into your dreams because they are so vividly captivating. Be careful; don't confuse your illusions with reality. If you do blur the edges, you'll set yourself up for serious disappointment as the truth dawns on you. Instead of fixating on your expectations, plant the seeds of potential and cultivate them the best you can."
scorpio,2013-09-30,"You want to nurture everybody today -- family members, friends, coworkers and stray animals. It doesn't matter if you are already overcommitted; you still can figure out a way to accomplish whatever needs to be done. Thankfully, you are receiving assistance from the hidden realms of your own subconscious mind. Your previous spiritual growth and psychological work will now be very useful in the present. Happily, the possibilities are only limited by your imagination."
sagittarius,2013-09-30,"It feels as if you can see forever, yet you might gloss over data that you don't have time to integrate today. Nevertheless, ignoring the facts is rather dangerous and may cause you to miss something very important. Take heed of any  practical advice offered by friends, whether it was originally solicited or not, because it helps you gain clarity in your thinking. If no one readily offers assistance, ask for what you need. Receiving a quick reality check now from someone who can see things more objectively could make all the difference."
capricorn,2013-09-30,"You can set your intentions, make a plan and work until you achieve success today. In order to reach your goals, you may need to arrange a meeting with someone powerful who has your best interests at heart. But before you tell him or her your plans, make sure that you have all your facts in place. However, don't waste time getting lost in the details; just let your inner philosopher wander out into the open as you share your dreams. Your passion for the project is what matters most."
aquarius,2013-09-30,"Your fantasies are luring you off into the distant future or out into a galaxy far, far away. However, dreaming about foreign places and exploring different cultures may have a wonderfully practical side now. If you simply slow down your train of thought a tiny bit, you can make your best ideas real. Give others a chance to share in your amazing adventures; surprisingly, you might enjoy having some company along the way."
pisces,2013-09-30,"You can go nearly anywhere the winds of your imagination carry you now as you surf a powerful spiritual wave. Mercury disperses any resistance to your thoughts as it moves toward trining your key planet Neptune. Messengers may take the high road, but their messages might grow muddied, nonetheless. Pay close attention to every interpersonal interaction or your best ideas will only get confused and diffused. It's easy to ride the currents if you keep things simple."
aries,2013-10-01,"Your workweek may be disrupted by a sudden change of plans. You might feel put upon since you would rather stick with your regular responsibilities today. Unfortunately, the more you try to return to your typical routine, the more reality pressures you to deal with the distractions before they turn into a crisis. Maintaining a healthy perspective is your best strategy now, however difficult it is to find. Ultimately, your sense of humor can save the day."
taurus,2013-10-01,"You must answer to a higher power today -- but not an invisible one. It doesn't even matter how practical you are now as you try to stay on your predetermined path. You may feel like others are leaning on you to take action. It appears like someone in authority won't let you have your fun, even if you think your plans are completely within reason. Choose your battles carefully for you could win the war, but be too exhausted to enjoy your victory."
gemini,2013-10-01,"You witness a clash of wills today as someone close to you attempts to drag you away from a quiet day at the office and into an intense drama. You could, however, cheat yourself out of quite an experience if you don't go along with the flow, even if it pulls you into uncomfortable waters. The unfolding situation may unleash deep feelings, but you and everyone else will feel better after the emotional meltdown clears the air of buried tensions."
cancer,2013-10-01,"Expect the unexpected today no matter what's on your calendar. Even if you have a light schedule at work, the rest and relaxation you planned on might not happen. There are just too many unforeseen events that sneak their way into your day. There aren't any quick solutions to the dilemmas that prevent you from taking it easy. Nevertheless, your attitude improves if you focus on your long-term goals. Keep the destination in mind and hope in your heart."
leo,2013-10-01,"If others appear to be undermining your efforts now, it may be challenging to stay optimistic about your present circumstances. You might meet resistance from authority figures as they try to persuade you to change your mind about something very important to you. The problem is that your will is set and you are in no mood to negotiate. Stop and take a deep breath; rather than issuing ultimatums today, you are better off finding a compromise that satisfies everyone. Start at a point of mutual agreement and work from there."
virgo,2013-10-01,"You are precariously balanced on the edge between light and dark today. You may actually believe you are being up front about your agenda with everyone involved. You're probably not intentionally hiding the truth, but trouble is brewing in the hidden realms, nonetheless. It's hard to fix the problem because the source of the resistance isn't clear. If it feels like you are shadowboxing, dance with the unknown instead of trying to beat it into submission."
libra,2013-10-01,"You might not want to talk about what's bothering you today. You would rather walk the tightrope and hope everyone has sufficient grace to act kindly and enough common sense to stay out of the way. However, people may be eager to take advantage of your need to keep your cool. Unfortunately, no one wins if no one speaks the truth. Be bold and take a risk; start the conversation by sharing what's on your mind and encourage others to follow. You will never know what magic could happen if you don't give it a try."
scorpio,2013-10-01,"This intense day is filled with one emotional interaction after another now that the Sun squares your key planet Pluto. The good news is that you know what you need to do and you can make it happen today, whatever the cost. The bad news is that circumstances may change throughout the day and put you at odds with someone close to you. Even if your fears tell you differently, your friends are on your side and not against you. Put your energy toward finding common goals that bring you together rather than focusing on different approaches that could pull you apart."
sagittarius,2013-10-01,"Circumstances in your life are not as rosy now as you might believe. Don't be fooled just because the music you are creating in your mind relaxes you into a cosmic trance. It's wise to face your problems right away or you'll just have bigger ones on your plate later on. Thankfully, shining the light of your awareness into the shadows helps to make your current challenges less scary and the solutions more apparent."
capricorn,2013-10-01,"It often pays to be a stable-footed Mountain Goat, especially when the entire mountain is shaking. You can easily see how changing structures are testing people around you. If you have taken the time to build your life on solid principles, the current pressures will help you grow even stronger. However, if you are standing on unstable ground, back up and reconsider your direction before charging ahead. Remember, people may let you down, but your foundations will not."
aquarius,2013-10-01,"Storms are growing in intensity today, but the lightning hasn't brought any rain just yet. Brilliant ideas run across the silver screen of your mind, but it's too complicated to pull them together into the critical mass that creates a true brainstorm. Resign yourself to riding the mental currents without letting the stress bother you. Don't worry if you have nothing to show for all your ingenious thoughts. There will be lots of time later on for manifesting your magic."
pisces,2013-10-01,"Others may expect you to fix situations that are simply beyond your control today. The underlying issue is about how you cling to patterns of behavior based upon your primal fear of change. External circumstances are pressuring you to modify your current mode of operation. You can struggle now to hold onto what doesn't work, or you can let it go and make room for what will."
aries,2013-10-02,"Anyone who gets in your way today could be in for a big surprise when you arrive dressed for battle. The bottom line is that you're in no mood to deal with someone else's arbitrary judgments. Although your feelings are very strong now, there's little need to worry about any resistance you currently face. Be true to yourself; instead of looking for a fight, just keep pushing your best ideas ahead, one step at a time."
taurus,2013-10-02,"Feelings of sweet love may temporarily transform into an intense meltdown today as your key planet Venus creates an anxious aspect with dark Pluto. Although your desires are slightly obsessive now, you're able to avoid trouble, even if you set your common sense aside to attain the pleasure you want. There's nothing wrong with a little indulgent behavior as long as you don't lose your moral compass."
gemini,2013-10-02,"You might make a number of attempts to tell someone your story now, but it can be frustrating when others don't seem to care about the same things that are significant to you. Nevertheless, don't waste your time and energy worrying about the possibility of being hurt by rejection. There's really no place for negative thinking in your life. You're better off if you focus your positive thoughts on the journey ahead."
cancer,2013-10-02,"Making choices about your personal life is a challenge today because there seems to be a wide array of appealing possibilities until you examine them more closely. However, it isn't smart to put off any decisions that could help you realize your potential. Thankfully, you have powerful friends that are eager to support your ambitions now, so don't be afraid to ask for their assistance. Nothing ventured, nothing gained."
leo,2013-10-02,"You don't want to let go of a recent experience just yet, and you may try every trick in the book to extend your playful feelings into the workday. But don't worry about missing out on a little fun if you have more important things to do today. Instead, think about the positive impact you can have on others if you jump in now and show them the way. Your I-can-do-it attitude is contagious so spread it around."
virgo,2013-10-02,"You may not be willing to give an inch today, especially if someone is questioning your ability to handle a situation while suggesting an alternative plan. Be careful, since this current predicament isn't about right versus wrong. Everyone can be correct, for there are many ways to reach the same goal. Remember, progressing according to your strategy keeps your heart in the game while enabling you to remain passionately committed to the greater cause."
libra,2013-10-02,"Your light and easy thoughts of love are interwoven into a more complex web of attachments as dark Pluto gives your key planet Venus something mysterious to ponder today. You might prefer to remain detached from your feelings by having fun with someone else. Unfortunately, you can't outrun the work you must do to sort out your relationships. Stop focusing on dreams that are just out of reach so you can appreciate what's right in front of you."
scorpio,2013-10-02,"You must tread very carefully and watch your step now because you are more impulsive than usual. It's tough to filter out any anger if your emotions suddenly surface because you still haven't had enough time to process them. However, blocking your feelings won't help your cause in the long run. Go ahead and share what's on your mind, but try not to inflame an already sensitive situation. A little compassion goes a long way."
sagittarius,2013-10-02,"Make time for some physical activity today because keeping your energy in motion is crucial to preventing you from becoming a couch potato. However, you want to do everything just right now that the Moon is visiting perfectionist Virgo. The downside is that you might get so hung up in the details that you can't move forward with confidence. Don't worry about every little thought that enters your mind. Tackling one small task at a time is the best way to maximize your productivity."
capricorn,2013-10-02,You have lots to share now and you shouldn't let anything or anyone stand in the way of expressing your truth. Don't restrain the power of your words because persuasive Pluto harmonizes with captivating Venus in your 11th House of Goals. But it's not about what you say today; it's more how you say it. Keep in mind that you can be both ambitious and kind in your drive for success.
aquarius,2013-10-02,"Your overall situation is growing brighter day by day, but there are still a few loose ends that must be tied up before you can move on to the next chapter of your life. However, the rate of change could pick up speed over the next few weeks, so make a commitment to concentrate on the present moment and not on the future. It's wonderful to be spontaneous, but in your haste don't let any unfinished tasks slip by unattended. Sometimes you have to give up a little freedom to reach your full potential."
pisces,2013-10-02,"Love isn't always simple and today you have an opportunity to experience a more complicated kind of pleasure. Beautiful Venus usually adds sweetness and grace to your life but an uneasy aspect from shadowy Pluto offers up sensual delights from the hidden recesses of your subconscious mind. No matter what, don't let fear stand in your way of a meaningful experience. Open your heart and let love in."
aries,2013-10-03,"Your life can get a bit crazy today with everything you have to do, especially if your coworkers don't realize just how much you have on your plate. Luckily, you Aries are experts at compressing time and accomplishing more work faster than others can imagine, especially when you're under pressure. Even if you have a hard time sticking to your agenda today, set a pace for yourself that will get the job done. There's really no time to waste."
taurus,2013-10-03,"Work-related chores that are usually fun and easy become the source of a problem today, especially if you aren't willing to let go of your agenda and roll with the incoming waves of change. If you have children in your world, they can test your ability to maintain your balance. Accept distractions and disruptions as signals you must heed. Whatever goes wrong now helps you understand where you need to direct your attention most."
gemini,2013-10-03,"Interpersonal dynamics are still quite intense as you are pulled in opposing directions. As much as you want to keep focusing on the tasks at hand today, chances are that you will be rather easily distracted. It's understandable if you can't resist every temptation. Just put yourself back on track as soon as you realize that you've wandered away from your purpose. Sometimes the creative process isn't as straightforward as you expect."
cancer,2013-10-03,"You have a sixth sense which enables you to tell when the tides are changing -- and you Crabs typically do this better than any other sign. You feel what's happening in your gut and can sense if something is wrong. Although your tendency now may be to say too much, rather than too little, there are some ideas which must be shared. Just do it as kindly and lovingly as possible. Making someone else feel guilty won't make the situation better. Use your superhero powers for the good of all."
leo,2013-10-03,"These are strange days for you Leos. One phase is over and the next one hasn't yet begun. However, in this fleeting moment of betwixt and between, you have a special opportunity to respond to the metamorphosis as it unfolds, without being burdened with your own baggage. Dilemmas seem to come at you from different directions. Take your time with each individual choice, honor your priorities and make the best decisions for your long-term growth."
virgo,2013-10-03,"Your financial picture is looking rosy but you may be required to make choices about how you spend your time. Are you ready to let go of activities that no longer serve a constructive purpose in your life? Examine your willingness to change those aspects of your own personality that get in the way of your progress. Even if you don't see a direct path to success, eliminating extraneous noise allows you to focus on taking care of business."
libra,2013-10-03,"Your friends and coworkers might appear to act in an erratic manner today as the lightning of unpredictable Uranus strikes your relationships. However, sparks only fly when there is electrical tension in the air. Look to all aspects of your life that involve other people to see where stress is brewing. Be bold and take action to shake up the energy wherever it feels stuck. Lead by example and watch who follows."
scorpio,2013-10-03,"You might jump ship today as part of an attempt to break out of your daily routine. The good news is that you can sink into your feelings a bit deeper than usual, without having to worry about getting lost in them. Thankfully, your ingenious thoughts prevent you from getting stuck in an emotional cul-de-sac. Experiencing the potential energy of change is much more exciting than trying to avoid it. Let go of your fears and take a leap of faith."
sagittarius,2013-10-03,"An unexpected relationship issue may suddenly surface and have undeniable impact on other areas of your life. Anger that's been simmering beneath the surface can crash into consciousness today. Although dealing with the truth might not be pleasant at first, it certainly could lead to a positive outcome. Clearing the air opens the doors for the surprising opportunities that come knocking."
capricorn,2013-10-03,"You're attracted to new ideas now -- things that you might have snubbed your nose at during a different time in your life. You're giddy with excitement today as you open your mind to concepts that are out of the box. Allow yourself to entertain intellectual possibilities and the experiences will follow. If you are drawn to something or someone new, give yourself permission to feel the chemistry, even if you do not ultimately act on it. Pursue the connection and see where it leads."
aquarius,2013-10-03,"Sometimes when others feel tension, you just feel the buzz of the potential. You need to be open to big changes now, for the more you try to cling to the safety of old habits and structures, the more you are in for some shake, rattle and roll from the universe. It's time to let go of the things that are holding you back. This is your chance to fly without unnecessary self-restraint. Release your fears and let your spirit soar."
pisces,2013-10-03,"Long-held beliefs about love are up for radical reconsideration today. You may feel as if you're in an emotional stew that has been cooking for months -- and now it's time for change. Don't be lazy, even if you have settled into a cozy relationship or situation. Being comfortable is great, but not at the expense of fulfilling your destiny. Your need for freedom of expression is high and that means anything is possible if you're willing to take a risk and make it happen."
aries,2013-10-04,"You instinctively know what others need today and can make them feel at ease before they are even aware of your swift intervention. Your attention shifts from your personal ambitions toward those of your friends because the Libra New Moon emphasizes your 7th House of Companions. Don't be overly intrusive by assuming everyone wants your help. There may not be a valid reason to get involved unless you are asked. Sometimes good intentions aren't enough. Nevertheless, there's nothing wrong with letting people know that you care."
taurus,2013-10-04,"You can turn on the charm now, enabling you to collaborate with your coworkers as the agreeable Libra New Moon lands in your 6th House of Employment. It's easier to prioritize your tasks and negotiate which jobs could be delayed and which must be done right away. Fortunately, you're capable of keeping up with everything that happens today, even if your efforts aren't appreciated until later."
gemini,2013-10-04,"The next few weeks provide you with a chance to revitalize a current relationship or may bring you a new love interest, instead. The social Libra New Moon reignites your 5th House of Romance and Creativity, which is a propitious sign for you to express your artistic nature today. Don't hesitate; getting started quickly will free up even more time later on for pleasurable pursuits."
cancer,2013-10-04,"Strolling down Memory Lane is a familiar experience, and today your mental journey raises significant issues that you have already considered once before. Luckily, you can manage your emotions in order to avoid a difficult situation. Nevertheless, don't get lost in your nostalgic meanderings just because the Libra New Moon falls in your 4th House of Roots. Instead, strive to concentrate on the present moment, rather than slipping off into dreamland. Your future is calling and there's no time to waste."
leo,2013-10-04,"Although you want to believe that you know what's best for you now, it's still necessary to take time to consider the wishes of those around you. Even if you are striving to demonstrate your independence, it's pointless to set your schedule before you talk with the people in your group. Today's Libra New Moon activates your 3rd House of Communication, motivating you to engage everyone within hearing range. Once you know what others want, you can set your agenda for the day and determine how to meet your needs, too."
virgo,2013-10-04,"You may think you need to make a decision about money today, but your options aren't as definitive as you wish. Unfortunately, the ambivalent Libra New Moon in your 2nd House of Finances makes it difficult to find the perspective you are seeking. You might go back and forth without being able to choose, but nothing positive will stem from being too hard on yourself. Wait a few days before completely committing one way or the other. In the meantime, listing the pros and cons is the next logical step."
libra,2013-10-04,"Channeling your ideas into practical goals is exciting, but enthusiasm isn't the only thing that counts. There's no getting around that you must follow through on your plans with perseverance and good old-fashioned hard work. Today's New Moon in your sign signals a sudden break from your past if you are ready to place your new intentions into action. But first you must express your desires clearly enough so they can have the impact you wish."
scorpio,2013-10-04,"Although you can usually keep a secret at any cost, a particular issue may be the source of trouble today with the Libra New Moon falling in your 12th House of Privacy. However, you want to tell someone everything you know because you believe it will increase the intimacy between you. Unfortunately, you could go against your promise and impulsively spill the beans. Postpone your conversation until later this evening when you will have more objectivity and discretion at your disposal."
sagittarius,2013-10-04,"Your social calendar is jumping and you have the opportunity to kick the energy up another notch now since the Libra New Moon emphasizes your 11th House of Friends. Give yourself plenty of time to bask in stimulating discussions with like-minded people. But don't wait too long to gather a group together, for everyone benefits when you share your dreams and optimistic visions about the future. Your love for life is contagious; pass it on."
capricorn,2013-10-04,"Today's Libra New Moon occurs in your 10th House of Public Responsibilities, stirring your ambitions and reminding you of all the amazing things that you have accomplished. But there may be more chores for you to finish before you can start a new project. Consider the advantages and disadvantages of taking on more work prior to saying yes on a job that could leave you exhausted. Creating a healthy balance between work and play is ultimately the most effective way to reach your goals."
aquarius,2013-10-04,You have an exciting opportunity to expand your horizons now by investigating an innovative idea. Gathering information about different courses of study should help you decide about attending school or additional on-the-job training as today's Libra New Moon occupies your 9th House of Higher Education. Just don't limit the possibilities to practical subjects; go ahead and break out of your self-imposed restriction and discover a wildly different world.
pisces,2013-10-04,"Your heart-centered approach to other people's problems can open a door to the possibility of greater intimacy now that the gracious Libra New Moon falls in your 8th House of Deep Sharing. Don't let your fear of the unknown stand between you and feeling compassion for someone else. Instead, maintain a balanced approach to the mysteries of love. Exploring the uncharted shadows of a relationship isn't as scary as it might seem at first."
aries,2013-10-05,"Someone may be annoyed with you now because you aren't trying to meet his or her expectations. You're willing to go out of your way to share your feelings today, but your good intentions aren't enough to smooth over the ruffled feathers. However, others can't stay angry for long if you tell the truth with kindness. But you can't negotiate away your need for independence in the process. Being considerate while still honoring your integrity demonstrates your respect for everyone involved."
taurus,2013-10-05,"Having friends you can trust means a lot to you, especially when you disagree about something important. Ultimately, everything will be okay if everyone expresses their feelings openly and honestly. However, your tendency to gloss over an awkward emotion could create a complication down the road. Even if it's inconvenient today, check in with yourself to be certain that you really know what your heart wants. Sometimes the things that make you the most uncomfortable are the ones that offer the most growth."
gemini,2013-10-05,"You might not be able to say no to a great idea today, even if you don't have any time to add one more thing to your list of tasks. Nevertheless, your resources are finite and you could exhaust yourself now trying to deliver on what you promised. Limiting your activities increases your efficiency and improves your chances for success. Energy flows where attention goes."
cancer,2013-10-05,"Feeling as if you're stuck is never fun, but you can use the power of your frustration to fuel your ambitions today. Don't bury your emotions; let them churn until they begin to turn into something useful. Your best strategy now is to take an indirect approach to your goals. Stay busy without pushing so hard; you will make more progress than you expect."
leo,2013-10-05,"You intuitively know that something special is brewing today, but you have no idea what it is. Although you are more upbeat than anything else, you are also worried that you're not in complete control of your emotions. Thankfully, you currently have more momentum than you realize, so don't be afraid to let events flow without trying to direct every outcome. A hands-off approach enables you to reach your destination faster than you think."
virgo,2013-10-05,"It appears as if circumstances are unfolding according to your plan today, but this is no time to be overconfident. You're not invincible now, so don't fill up your life with lofty dreams based on unrealistic fantasies. There's nothing wrong with setting ambitious goals as long as you also keep your feet on the ground. Reach for the stars, but don't lose sight of your impeccable common sense."
libra,2013-10-05,"You could end up wasting valuable time and energy today if you believe that an ingenious shortcut will get you to where you're going faster than taking the tried and true path. The Moon remains in your peaceful sign all day, tempting you to skillfully skate around the hard work. But your most reliable results come from setting a sustainable pace early in the day and then sticking with it as best as you can. Success is one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration."
scorpio,2013-10-05,"You can't forget about all the pressing issues in your life today, but at least you can put them into a healthy perspective that allows you to have a good time no matter what's going on. Your smartest strategy is to live in the present moment. Ultimately, the choice is yours: you could focus on all the uncertainty and worry about what comes next. Or you could trust your instincts and concentrate on the power of now."
sagittarius,2013-10-05,"You have secrets to keep today, yet it's an ongoing struggle to remain quiet. Nevertheless, it's more important to honor your commitments, even if your key planet Jupiter encourages you to break your promise. You can envision the positive side of sharing what you know, but how much you say is not your decision to make now. Take the high road and don't stir up any unnecessary trouble. Discretion is the better part of valor."
capricorn,2013-10-05,"You really don't want to expend any energy engaging in small talk today because you need to get right to the core of the matter. Although the Moon is visiting gracious Libra, you don't have the patience to act in a diplomatic manner now -- even if you know that it could help you obtain what you want. Thankfully, your friends appreciate your direct and honest approach, so follow your instincts and deliver your message without beating around the bush."
aquarius,2013-10-05,"Your key planet Uranus keeps you on pins and needles all day today, even if you have the same old responsibilities to handle. The most mundane tasks can become fun or bothersome, depending on your perspective. Adopting a positive attitude changes everything for the better. Get your chores out of the way quickly so you have time to expand your horizons and pursue other interests that bring you even more personal satisfaction."
pisces,2013-10-05,"You appear to be very positive today, even if you have some serious doubts about your plans for the future. However, others may not be able to sense your uncertainty, especially if you believe it's in your best interest to hide your current lack of confidence. Ultimately, it's wise to summon up enough courage to share your fears with someone you trust. Believe it or not, simply talking about your concerns helps to dissipate your resistance and bolster your faith."
aries,2013-10-06,"It isn't easy to remain quiet today, even if you think that your point of view won't necessarily be embraced by anyone else. You are eager to put your thoughts out into the open now, but keep in mind that you may say more than you intended in your presentation, ultimately detracting from your message. Summarize your point concisely and then be quiet so you can carefully listen to the response. The feedback you receive might make the difference between failure and success."
taurus,2013-10-06,"Oddly enough, you want to dig into a controversial topic of discussion that you were previously avoiding. Thankfully, your apprehension quickly disappears because you're so anxious to have your words heard. You feel the intensity now and know your ideas can have a powerful impact. Don't forget to give everyone plenty of time to adjust to what you say today before moving on to the next subject. Plant your seeds and watch them grow."
gemini,2013-10-06,"Balancing your friendly style and a more direct approach helps you with an important emotional disclosure. It's crucial to understand that others can see right past your clever wit today and into your soul, so don't bother telling another funny story to lighten the conversation. Sink into the depths of your heart and just feel what's going on. Your willingness to be serious today is your ticket to personal satisfaction."
cancer,2013-10-06,"There's simply no getting around the fact that your feelings are unusually intense today. You are driven to explore uncharted emotional territory, but circumstances prevent you from getting lost in your dreams. It helps if you voluntarily come back to the more mundane side of things. Paradoxically, a straightforward approach can produce amazing results that allow you to connect with others without avoiding your personal truth."
leo,2013-10-06,"You might believe that you would be happier if there were no shadows in the world at all, but exploring the darker places of mystery is essential to experiencing the fullest spectrum of living. You may even take the first step by bringing some of your fears out into the open. Talking about your emotions puts you in a vulnerable position, but also diminishes the power of any unexpressed negativity. Just remember to share your stuff and no one else's. Treat other people's secrets with discretion; your story is all you need to demonstrate your authenticity."
virgo,2013-10-06,"Sometimes you have a hard time trusting the eternal optimists and naive new-agers who want to discuss psychological and spiritual issues that you consider to be private matters. Your position may lean toward the idea of sharing the basic principles and nothing more. Nevertheless, you are now tempted to come clean about something you've long kept to yourself. Start slowly or you may reveal more than you intend. Find a friendly audience before opening your heart."
libra,2013-10-06,"You may feel as if you're at the height of your power now as you launch into a conversation about a controversial subject. Fortunately, there isn't much off limits today as long as you share your story with someone you already trust. But be cautious of your tendency to slip into Pollyanna mode. You don't need to make anything sound better than it is. The truth is plenty good enough on its own."
scorpio,2013-10-06,"It grows easier to make an important choice than it was yesterday because the pressure of your schedule doesn't leave you many options. It's key to make your stand now while you have logic on your side. Rational Mercury is receiving powerful support from your ruling planet Pluto, allowing you to benefit from conversations that sink beneath the apparent surface distractions. Dig deep to uncover the information you need to make up your mind."
sagittarius,2013-10-06,"Ceremonies and rituals may be quite intriguing now as you remember a religious tradition from your past or learn about a new one as you embark on a different spiritual path. You might want to persuade others to join you in your exploration, but you have some explaining to do first. The problem is that your intensity can be overwhelming for people to handle. Limit your words to only those necessary to make your point. Less is more when your message speaks for itself."
capricorn,2013-10-06,"Your intentions are strong today, but excessive talking only scatters your thoughts all over the place. Don't just go along with the flow; make a schedule and then stick to it as best you can. This tactic enables you to stay on point now while preventing you from meandering around the outer limits of your mind or revealing more about yourself than you should. Setting clear priorities helps you accomplish more than you thought possible."
aquarius,2013-10-06,"There may be a recent misunderstanding or a mistake that continues to bother you, adding emotional stress to your relationships. If you have a particular issue on your mind, don't wait for a better moment to get it out into the open. If others have something to say to you now, make the time to listen -- and then you can share your feelings, too. Life might become more complicated for a while, but then the dynamics should begin to simplify. Keeping the doors of communication open cultivates stronger bonds."
pisces,2013-10-06,"Losing your train of thought in the middle of a conversation could make you feel quite anxious today. Ironically, excessive preparation can actually work against you now, so don't waste too much time practicing what you want to say. There is no need to read off your notes or memorize a speech about a particular topic. Simply allow your passion to lead the way; speaking from your heart inspires others to do the same."
aries,2013-10-07,"It's hard to hide your feelings today, especially if you're experiencing jealousy now that the possessive Scorpio Moon is visiting your 8th House of Intimacy. You might try to keep everything light and easy, but others aren't necessarily playing by the same rules. You don't know whether to heat things up by expressing your feelings or to cool off by withdrawing until you can regain your equilibrium. Take a step back; the intensity settles later in the day, allowing you to address the issue in a calm and collected manner."
taurus,2013-10-07,"You may not understand why someone needs to be so intense today. Nevertheless, a close friend or colleague might appear to be unable to let go of an unnecessary drama. You find it annoying and frustrating if you attempt to use reason to settle down the energy. Your discomfort becomes less problematic when you finally realize that you don't have to empathize with everyone around you. All you need to do is be present and listen; sometimes offering a supportive shoulder is enough."
gemini,2013-10-07,"A case of irritability could get the best of your morning, but the emotional skies begin to clear this afternoon. Your restlessness is magnified by so many planets dragging you into the deep waters of Scorpio and drawing you into personal issues that you would rather avoid. Instead of wasting your energy resisting the currents, it's safer now to go with the flow when Venus shifts into inspirational Sagittarius today. Rather than lingering in the past, start looking forward to the possibilities ahead."
cancer,2013-10-07,"You're comforted by the change of dynamics today as someone close to you acknowledges your feelings and supports you in an unexpected manner. However, the more you talk, the more you might realize that your goals aren't in alignment. Keep in mind that you may be a bit oversensitive now, so don't judge others too quickly just because their assumptions are different from yours. Diversity is healthy because it fosters a more creative approach."
leo,2013-10-07,"You may be feeling the need to retreat as your thoughts pull you into the shadows of your inner world. Exploring the hidden realms of your imagination could be quite productive, but others might be worried about you and attempt to lure you back out into the sunshine. Remember, it's not necessary to live up to someone else's expectations now. The most important thing is to learn what you can from your visit to the dark side so you're ready for the next round of progress."
virgo,2013-10-07,"You feel more secure when you have useful information at your disposal, but being overwhelmed with unnecessary data only fills your head with noise. Unfortunately, you may be caught in a complex swirl of emotions these days, making it difficult to ascertain what to do next. It might feel like an exercise in futility if you can't immediately apply the lessons you are learning. Practicing patience is your smartest strategy now; integrate your current experiences before swinging into action for the best results."
libra,2013-10-07,You're feeling quite attached to your possessions these days with so much planetary action packed into your 2nd House of Resources. You might even appear to have more than you actually do because you're willing to get along with less. But feeling good about yourself encourages you to also feel more positive about your finances. Don't delude yourself and spend more than you should since banking on future income could create trouble. A more realistic approach leads to a richer tomorrow.
scorpio,2013-10-07,"Your persuasive powers are hard to resist now; it's as if you can put a spell on someone you love or convince people to see a situation from your perspective. However, there is more going on than meets the eye, so refrain from using your charms for anything other than the common good of all. Controlling anyone for a selfish reason is likely to backfire quicker than you think. Happily, an altruistic attitude sets the stage for success that exceeds your expectations."
sagittarius,2013-10-07,"Your intuition is telling you that sunny days are on the horizon. But you may appear smug today if you truly believe you know something that others don't. Rather than explaining your point of view, you're tempted to bask in the light of the superiority of your privileged perspective. Don't take advantage of your current position because it won't last forever. As soon as everyone else catches on and recognizes the potential, the playing field will be even again. Sharing the good news right away cultivates a lovely spirit of generosity."
capricorn,2013-10-07,"Playing nicely with your friends and family is easy today because you're able to cut through the noise and be fully present in your personal interactions. It's not that you forget about more serious issues, but you are tempted to place your ambitions on hold while you deepen your most important social relationships. Don't waste energy doubting your sentimental approach; you can always put your professional aspirations back on the front burner next week."
aquarius,2013-10-07,"Being appreciated for your contributions at work is a real boost to your confidence today, especially if the current recognition is from people you respect in return. But you might be concerned that someone isn't being totally genuine and their actions aren't only about you. Even if political complexities exist that could justify someone's ulterior motives, don't let your fears prevent you from enjoying the attention in the present moment."
pisces,2013-10-07,"This is a great time to discuss your plans with others to get their reactions, especially if you have been considering a long vacation or even a quick getaway. Fortunately, with so much action occurring in your 9th House of Travel, you will likely receive the approval you want. Don't hold back; dream big and share your aspirations. You may be happily surprised at the response. Pack your bags and go before anyone changes their mind."
aries,2013-10-08,"Just when everything seems to be going your way, another obstacle might stop you in your tracks. Perhaps you underestimated the amount of work on your plate, or maybe you missed an important piece of information. Either way, it makes no sense to complain. You could have seen trouble coming if you were paying closer attention. Instead of wasting energy talking about your predicament, take care of what you need to do as quickly as possible. A positive attitude helps more than you might think."
taurus,2013-10-08,"You don't want anyone to assume you're being frivolous; you may even choose to hide your actions today rather than be misjudged. You might even feel as if you don't have anything left to say, but chances are you just need a bit of time to decide how to express yourself clearly. Don't worry so much about what others think. Simply tell the truth exactly as you see it and you won't be faulted for speaking from your heart."
gemini,2013-10-08,You can't avoid your own serious attitude as work issues sneak back into your awareness to haunt you today. You may experience a weird combination of excitement and concern as past memories are stimulated by someone in the present. Attempts to evade a meaningful discussion won't be all that successful now. Proactively engage in a discussion about what's important instead of spending your time trying to sidestep the truth. Someone has to take the first step and it might as well be you.
cancer,2013-10-08,"People close to you may think you're acting too negatively today, yet you might not see yourself in this light. Your harsh perspective stems from the fact a weak link in someone's story is all too apparent, and you're simply not willing to support sloppy logic. Don't try to deny your feelings; instead, just change the tone of your words. It's okay to be honest as long as you don't blame anyone else in the process. Honoring your integrity is all that truly matters."
leo,2013-10-08,"Today could be a turning point as you obsess about your shortcomings, especially if you have been facing issues about your self-esteem. Everyone has regrets; there are always things you could have done better or, perhaps, shouldn't have done at all. However, instead of aspiring toward perfection now, it might be smarter to accept your limitations, along with the obvious fact that you are human. Shift your thinking by making a list of what you do well. The power of positive thinking will tip the scales in your favor."
virgo,2013-10-08,"Your analytical skills are even more finely tuned now that an exacting Mercury-Saturn conjunction focuses your mind like a laser beam. Nevertheless, it's counterproductive to undermine others with your criticism; there's nothing to be gained now by nitpicking their work. Providing constructive feedback enables you to explain what improvements could be made without resorting to negativity. Use your powers wisely to bring out the best in everyone."
libra,2013-10-08,"You may feel as if you are stuck in a rut in spite of your current desire for excitement. You might even feel rather disillusioned today about your future prospects. Although a recent disappointment might add to your malaise, don't make despondency a habit because crucial aspects of your life are about to change for the better. Instead of being sad about an event in the past, switch your focus now and imagine the best possible scenario that could be waiting just around the next corner."
scorpio,2013-10-08,"Understanding where your life is leading these days is a real challenge, but you believe that you would be happier if you knew for sure. Your somber attitude weighs heavily on you and you feel burdened by responsibilities that may not even be your own. Unfortunately, you might not be able to imagine an easy remedy to cure your current blues. Thankfully, accepting the truth could be enough to transform your moodiness into hope. Have faith; the sun will come out tomorrow."
sagittarius,2013-10-08,"Your friends and associates may tell you exactly what's wrong with your new plan today, even if you're not seeking any feedback. Unfortunately, others aren't necessarily tactful in their criticism of your ideas. Compounding matters, you could be overly sensitive now and might not take their comments well. But don't dwell on the negative; you have a lot to do and there's no time to entertain unproductive thoughts. Things will start to improve once you swing into action and are more open to the constructive input you receive."
capricorn,2013-10-08,"It's tempting to put extra time and effort into your job today or, perhaps, become more involved in a community project. Either way, your optimism might be flagging now, leaving you with sense of uncertainty about your future. Although you may wonder if your work will actually pay off, it's not wise to retreat. Don't abandon your plans; instead, just be more realistic about your expectations so you can actually reach your goals on schedule."
aquarius,2013-10-08,"It's nearly impossible to think about having fun when things at work are so serious these days. You may even walk away from previous plans for an upcoming vacation or a weekend getaway because you simply don't have time. It's smarter to focus your energy now on something more practical that contributes to your stability, rather than escaping on a getaway. Sticking close to home makes sense; don't push out beyond safe limits until you feel as if you're back on more stable ground. Taking care of unfinished business is your first step to regaining more control of your life."
pisces,2013-10-08,"Someone may deliver a harsh message to you today, but you really don't have to blindly accept anyone else's interpretation of reality. Nevertheless, you're likely to be vulnerable to what you hear if you trust the source. Listen carefully to what others say now, but don't take anything too personally. You can put what you learn into motion to improve your game if you assimilate the facts without an emotional charge. Remember that those close to you might truly have your best interests at heart."
aries,2013-10-09,"Although you're feeling confident about a recent decision, your newly rediscovered optimism could make your energy a little too much to handle. Others may quickly grow tired of hearing your exaggerated tales about your amazing life. Temper your excitement with a strong dose of compassion for others. Scaling back your enthusiasm just a little bit creates a harmonious environment that inspires healthier relationships."
taurus,2013-10-09,"You're not very shy about your desire to deepen the level of emotional commitment with a very close friend or intimate partner today. Although your straightforward approach may be startling at first, others might be receptive to your ideas once they adjust to your style of direct communication. Being aware of someone's boundaries doesn't come easily to you now, but demonstrating respect builds stronger trust in the relationship. Be brave and authentic: take a chance and express what's in your heart."
gemini,2013-10-09,"You might not be so quick to head off on your own today, since the idea of working with a buddy sounds quite appealing. The Moon's presence in your 7th House of Relationships shifts the energy away from your personal needs, making you more conscious of what others are thinking. Keep in mind that your discrimination skills may be lacking, so exercise extra caution when choosing who you connect with now, professionally or romantically. You don't have to follow every whim to be happy."
cancer,2013-10-09,"It's exhilarating to think you can power your way through your chores today and still have enough time left over to unwind with some friends. Unfortunately, you could underestimate how long it takes to accomplish your work. Make certain that you allow plenty of extra time, for if you leave a task unfinished, you may not be able to relax fully, just knowing there is more to do. Managing your calendar wisely improves your efficiency and increases your chances for fun."
leo,2013-10-09,"You're ready to kick up your heels and have a great time today, even if you haven't fully met your obligations. Unfulfilled responsibilities don't have to prevent you from having a memorable experience. You might be so excited in the moment that you're ready to do whatever is necessary to enjoy yourself. If you must leave some chores undone, at least let others know that you are cutting out early and remember to come back and finish up tomorrow. Play now, work later."
virgo,2013-10-09,"If you are working too hard, it's time to start claiming your slice of the fun. But the Moon is in your 4th House of Roots, suggesting it might be nice to hide out at home instead of going out to play. You may even end up undertaking a simple domestic project or, perhaps, inviting a friend over to share some quality conversation. Home is where the heart is."
libra,2013-10-09,"Controlling your restlessness is complicated today as the exuberant Sagittarius Moon visits your 3rd House of Short Trips. You might even make an extra run to the store or head out to the park during lunchtime just to get out of the house or escape from work. Don't be too self-critical if you haven't made much progress by the end of the day. If you're having trouble concentrating now, it's probably smart to just call it quits and pick up the pieces tomorrow."
scorpio,2013-10-09,"You might be riding high on positive emotions today and feeling confident enough to spend a bit of money on something special. You may have suddenly grown more optimistic about your income potential, allowing you to justify a luxury purchase now. However, it's still smarter to wait and see how you're feeling in a few days before making a large expenditure that you could later regret. Sometimes the best things in life really are free."
sagittarius,2013-10-09,"You are more in touch with your own vulnerability now, since the receptive Moon is hanging out in your sign all day. However, you're still likely to take an emotional gamble today and reveal your feelings to someone special. But just telling people about your needs or fears is only one part of the equation. Real intimacy has two sides, so make sure to leave room for the other person to share his or her heart, too."
capricorn,2013-10-09,"Normally, it doesn't make sense to keep your optimism to yourself, and yet it may be the most socially astute thing you can do now. You might think your overconfidence could offend someone and you want to avoid any trouble today as you rally support for an idea of yours. Thankfully, your diplomatic skills are currently polished enough to take you far if you trust your instincts and do whatever you believe is best."
aquarius,2013-10-09,"Your vivid imagination is running on overdrive now and it's exciting to share your dreams with like-minded people. The Moon is traveling through your 11th House of Groups, prodding you to surround yourself with supportive friends and associates. With just a little extra effort today, you can create exactly the kind of congenial atmosphere you crave. A party might be the perfect venue to find the camaraderie you now want, but a smaller and more intimate gathering could work just as well. It's the connections you make and not the places that matter."
pisces,2013-10-09,"Passionately defending your social values or political beliefs can be quite empowering today, whether it's at work, home or in your community. Keep in mind that fulfilling your responsibilities in the present moment is more important than daydreaming about unrealistic possibilities. Nevertheless, your unique perspective inspires others, so there's no need to hold back now when sharing your visions about the future. Seize the day by being the creative leader that everyone wants to follow."
aries,2013-10-10,"Your words are as smooth as silk today and you can use them to spin fantastic stories to support your goals. Your visions sound real to others as you describe your plan or try to persuade someone to join your cause. However, treading carefully is wise because you could convince yourself that you are right, even if you're missing the point. Telling everyone what to do might just work out okay if you consider the needs of the whole community and not just yours alone."
taurus,2013-10-10,"You can't turn off the flow of fantasies that are springing forth from your imagination today but, thankfully, you're still aware of what you can do with your visions. Your idealism enriches your day by bringing an endless supply of creative material, but this stream of thoughts or pictures could also distract you from the real work at hand. Escaping into dreams might not seem productive, but using them for motivation is a wise move now."
gemini,2013-10-10,"You're not interested in beating around the bush now; you want to say whatever's necessary to justify your position. Nevertheless, you are afraid of hurting someone's feelings, so you might approach the situation tentatively. Fortunately, you're pleasantly surprised by the feedback you receive that clears the way for constructive conversations. Keep all your facts straight today, because a faulty assumption can turn a spirited discussion into a comedy of misunderstandings."
cancer,2013-10-10,"Sharing your emotions with someone you trust at work might not be on your agenda today, but something may stimulate a strong reaction, prompting you to share your perspective. Unfortunately, once you start talking, you could inadvertently say too much. Thankfully, it's easy to prevent an awkward situation by simply considering the consequences of your words before you open your mouth. Be smart and tailor your message to your audience."
leo,2013-10-10,"Your creative spirit is flowing strongly today, whether you are working hard or simply enjoying yourself. You might not want to plan too many details of your day, since each activity slips dreamily into the next one. But you have to stay on your toes because your emotions allow you to be easily misled now. Verbal communication could be the source of confusion, so carefully observe what others do before trusting what they say. Actions speak louder than words."
virgo,2013-10-10,"Your inflated hopes about a gathering of family or friends can run into trouble if you harbor unrealistic expectations about those closest to you. Unfortunately, your current penchant for dreaming could turn a perfectly sensible idea into a major fiasco. As tempted as you are to expand on a sentimental theme, it's smarter to keep your plans simple and the drama to a minimum. All you need is love."
libra,2013-10-10,"You are the master of illusion today as your key planet Venus squares surreal Neptune. Listening to your intuition usually works to your advantage when you're dealing with someone's unresolved feelings. Your diplomatic skills naturally assist you in influencing others with your fair-minded perspective. But keep in mind that your imagination can lead you down the wrong path now if you lose sight of reality. Thankfully, paying attention to the facts enables you to create a lasting positive impact."
scorpio,2013-10-10,"Relationship dynamics may be confusing today if someone is quick to hide his or her true feelings. It's challenging to know what others want unless you are willing to climb out on a limb and ask them. This tactic sounds straightforward enough, yet you might end up hearing a lot more than you ever wanted to know. Nevertheless, you'll feel better once you learn the truth and then honestly share what's on your mind as well. An open dialogue cultivates trust."
sagittarius,2013-10-10,The power of your convictions should be enough to carry someone else through an episode of low self-esteem. The smartest reaction to today's uncertainty is to figure out exactly what you know as quickly as possible and then talk about what can be done to clarify the issues. Don't be afraid of looking ahead; the bold actions you take now set the pace for your friends and family. Blaze your own path and others will happily follow.
capricorn,2013-10-10,"Your schedule may keep you busier than you ever imagined today, even if you were planning on less activity rather than more. However, the current noise in your life might seem worse than it actually is because you cannot turn off the stream of creative thoughts and unconventional feelings. Remembering that you don't always need to be in control of everything allows you to enjoy every moment for exactly what it is. Go with the flow and see where it takes you."
aquarius,2013-10-10,"You might think you're fully aware of what's best for everyone else today, and would like to be acknowledged for your altruistic behavior. However, your spiritual ideals may be incongruent with other people's expectations. Fortunately, you won't have to choose one over the other. If you muster up enough courage to talk about how your inner desires conflict with your responsibilities, you can achieve satisfaction on both fronts."
pisces,2013-10-10,"You have a long list of chores that could be left over from earlier in the week, but you may feel unsure of your ability to accomplish much today, anyhow. The best strategy to deal with your current concerns is to concentrate on fulfilling your social and professional obligations as soon as possible. Your doubts will ease once you start crossing items off your to-do list. Fortunately, you can indulge in the pursuit of pleasure once you have made tangible progress."
aries,2013-10-11,"Although you're tempted to take a risk at work, it's probably not the smartest idea. It's a better strategy to stick with the conventional plan now, instead of following a whim. Socializing may be more fun, but your productivity suffers when you wander away from your chores. Set a steady pace early in the day and be as methodical as possible. If you accomplish a lot today, you can always be spontaneous tomorrow."
taurus,2013-10-11,"You're quite serious when you tell others today that you're going to take an extended vacation to a secluded tropical island or some other exotic location. Even if your ideas seem ridiculous, your fierce determination might just find a way to make it work. If anyone calls you to task because of your imagination, be selective enough to keep the rest of your plans to yourself. Save the details for a trusted friend or the person you wish to be your travel companion. Making your dreams come true isn't as hard as you think."
gemini,2013-10-11,"Your restlessness could turn the most pleasing person in your life into an ornery antagonist today. Just when you believe you have everything figured out, the emotional dynamics may shift, proving your assumptions wrong. Unfortunately, you can't hang on to the status quo any longer. Your relationships are in flux now, as are your feelings. Prevent regret by giving yourself some time for reflection before making any big decisions that can't be changed. When you calm down so will everyone else."
cancer,2013-10-11,"You might not be willing to make so many changes so quickly today, but you have to do whatever it takes to hold it together. Your feelings of insecurity could rise to the surface, only to be buried again as you are happily distracted by external events. If you have previously chosen to suppress your emotions, you now have an opportunity to shift gears and do things differently. Sharing what's on your mind allows others to lend a helping hand."
leo,2013-10-11,"Anything can happen today if you're willing to make a plan and then execute it accurately. Today's opulent Venus-Jupiter connection reminds you that pleasure is closer than you realize. But you might still run into trouble since there could be some instability in your relationships. Instead of claiming that you will accept the outcome whatever it may be, give yourself permission to state what you want, so at least you know that you tried."
virgo,2013-10-11,"You're quite serious about relationships today, but, thankfully, your cautious attitude doesn't have to get in the way of romance. Your calm demeanor might make you very appealing to someone you admire. The more responsibly you act now, the easier it is for others to find reasons to love you. As always, just being yourself is your best strategy."
libra,2013-10-11,"It's not easy to keep quiet today because you might have more to say about your feelings than those around you. You don't have any perfect answers, but you can see where the lines of tension have been drawn. Don't shy away from the stressful points. Go through them one by one and iron out any disagreements for the good of everyone involved. A lively discussion will clear the air; find a tactful way to get the ball rolling."
scorpio,2013-10-11,"You're eager to try something new if you believe that it can bring happiness today. You don't want to sit around and idly wait for life to happen; instead use these days to push through your resistance to change. Don't worry; any forward movement is better than returning to the past, even if you're unclear about your destination. It's not time to be too cautious. Take a few deep breaths before boldly following your intuition into the great unknown."
sagittarius,2013-10-11,"You could make everything appear to be effortless today, but you're probably stressing a lot more than anyone realizes. You want to finish what you started but you can see divergent paths everywhere you turn. Unfortunately, no option is perfect. Eventually, you must stop the analysis process and just make a choice. Remember, when making a decision it's always best to choose love over fear."
capricorn,2013-10-11,"You might not be completely ready to move to the next level yet. The Moon is visiting your conservative sign today, but a series of rough aspects probably won't slow you down. However, you may inadvertently cling to an old and worn out habit that becomes more trouble than it's worth. Don't focus on your immediate happiness now. Instead, concentrate on your future goals because they can hold your attention for a much longer period of time. Pursuing your ambitions brings you joy and success."
aquarius,2013-10-11,"You think you have an ace up your sleeve today, but you could be missing a few cards, instead. Although you believe you're at the top of your game when it comes to negotiation, it's wise to settle for a little less than you expect. Nevertheless, stop sweeping the intensity under the rug and don't be afraid to say what you want. Bringing feelings out into the open now is the only logical way to go."
pisces,2013-10-11,"Holding too tightly to your long-term goals doesn't leave room for any new possibilities to enter your life now. You're aware of the opportunities for fun and games, but you can feel the stress between a potential payoff for taking a chance and the loss of security that comes from leaving stability behind. Trust your hunches and your good intentions will shine through, which in turn encourages others to support you."
aries,2013-10-12,"You might think that everyone wants to do something with you today, making it difficult to focus on your previous commitments. Your popularity is running high and you want to grab every opportunity you can to have fun. But it's not a great idea to say yes just because you're afraid of being left out of the action. Balancing your approach to work and play allows you to get the most out of your day."
taurus,2013-10-12,"You may be extremely excited about all the wonderful things that are happening now because you believe that the current opportunities will lead to greater success. Although you are hopeful about what you can manage today, your expectations are probably out of proportion with reality. Rather than setting yourself up for a fall, avoid the temptation of taking on too much. Surely it's better to do an admirable job at fewer tasks than to tackle everything haphazardly and fail."
gemini,2013-10-12,"Your current charm can be quite persuasive now. However, an inflationary square between the Sun and pompous Jupiter warns that you may not remember how to set boundaries and honor limitations. You could inadvertently detract from your accomplishments if you talk too much, so be extra careful about rambling on after you have already made your point. The adage ""less is more"" is sensible advice to follow today."
cancer,2013-10-12,"You could find yourself wrapped up in a controversy today because you aren't very concerned about the changes ahead. Your friends or coworkers might try to tell you why you should be acting more maturely, but you just want to have a little fun. Enjoying yourself is wonderful as long as you don't forget about your previous obligations, especially if others are depending on you now. There's no substitute for how good you feel when you do something helpful for someone special."
leo,2013-10-12,"You are quite opinionated today and might create situations where you can let everyone know exactly what you think. But others aren't necessarily interested in listening to your rant for very long, so deliver your message as quickly as possible. Wasting time with too many details only weakens your story and makes you less believable, so demonstrate your ability to be concise and considerate. Use the art of persuasion to your advantage by leaving your audience wanting more."
virgo,2013-10-12,"You might have a brilliant idea today about an activity that involves your friends. But you can become so excited that your expectations grow by leaps and bounds, making the logistics of your plan unmanageable. Even if you want to do things differently, don't be so stuck on having your way now that everyone else loses interest. Share your thoughts with others and then listen carefully so you can integrate the best of their feedback."
libra,2013-10-12,"You have a clear sense of what you stand for today, but communicating your beliefs could be challenging if you lose your objectivity. Your optimism can go so far that it inspires you to participate in a project or cause that might be better left alone. But don't push the issue now if others are resistant and don't want to go along for the ride. Your chances for success improve when you just allow the events to unfold as naturally as possible."
scorpio,2013-10-12,"These are intense times, making it even more important to find healthy ways to express your feelings. Thankfully, you are in a spiritually uplifting phase, yet someone may still read your energy all wrong. If something you say or do elicits a negative response from others, rest assured that it's still smarter to share your emotions rather than to bury them. Those that truly know you will understand and appreciate your honesty."
sagittarius,2013-10-12,"You could soar right into an amazing experience today since you're picking up on an upbeat wave of energy from the Sun's square to lucky Jupiter. But remember, your key planet Jupiter is the magnifying lens of the cosmos, so it makes everything look bigger and better than it actually is in reality. Nevertheless, do what you do best and focus on the big picture because the general concepts are even more important now than the myriad of details. Don't sweat the small stuff until next week."
capricorn,2013-10-12,"You need to be careful because you could go overboard with the power of your positive thinking today. Ironically, anxiety might arise from too much of a good thing as the illuminating Sun's square to jolly Jupiter lifts your spirits. Practicing a combination of flexibility and moderation brings you closer to your goals. Thankfully, you can make a lot of progress now if you channel your energy constructively and schedule your time wisely."
aquarius,2013-10-12,"Your friends may appear to be more serious about a particular situation than you are today. Fortunately, you're likely aware of your current Pollyanna tendencies; nevertheless, you still have a lot of good things to say. There's no need to abandon your optimistic attitude, even if others are overly cautious. Remain positive as long as you can, but don't embellish the facts just to make your position more convincing. The truth is good enough on its own."
pisces,2013-10-12,"You might not want to harbor any secrets today, yet keeping quiet may be necessary to earn someone's trust. It would certainly be in bad taste if you reveal something private that was told to you in confidence. Fortunately, you have more options because there are so many other interesting topics to discuss. You'll feel good about your discretion once you fully accept the reasons for your current boundaries. There are some things that are just better left unsaid."
aries,2013-10-13,"You are willing to take on new responsibilities today, even if you might be happier doing something else. Fortunately, you can manage a few days of hard work by holding on to a memory of a recent experience that made you feel good. Although you aren't likely to live in the past, replaying recollections of previous pleasures eases your current frustrations and allows you to be more productive in the process."
taurus,2013-10-13,"It's one thing to raise issues from the past when they pertain to a current situation, but it's quite different to obsess about something that just doesn't resonate in the present moment. If you can't get a painful memory out of your head, avoidance and suppression will only strengthen it. However, it's not wise to arbitrarily share your story with just anyone. Choose someone you trust before you open your heart and release your fears."
gemini,2013-10-13,"You might feel as if someone is attempting to sell you a piece of imaginary blue sky today as he or she puts an optimistic spin on a complex situation. Accept what you are told at face value without necessarily committing to further involvement on your part. Recognizing your limitations is important, but acting on what's in your heart is crucial for your growth. Trusting your instincts will lead you in the right direction."
cancer,2013-10-13,"You may have a breakthrough idea about a project at work now, but self-doubt prevents you from telling anyone what you are thinking. Perhaps you recall a different time when you took on more than you could handle. Nevertheless, your current anxiety might be unfounded. Sharing your thoughts is easier if you are honest about your strengths and weaknesses. Ask for help up front instead of promising more than you can possibly deliver. Sometimes an objective opinion is all you need to set your plans back on track."
leo,2013-10-13,Someone you trust may inadvertently hurt your feelings today by bringing up a relationship issue that you thought was ancient history. Don't take it personally even if it involves you because this is probably more about the other person's residual feelings than your reaction. Choosing to travel the emotional high road is essential or you might become mired in the past instead of happily moving into the future.
virgo,2013-10-13,"Since you are usually very conscientious when making commitments, it's surprising to others if you agree to something today and then turn around and rescind your promise. Your cooperation initially stems from your eagerness to please those you respect. But once you know the entire situation, you might want to repair your error in judgment. Remember, we all make mistakes; the quicker you can set it right, the better it will be for all involved."
libra,2013-10-13,"You are often the one who graciously hides your emotions to make everyone else feel better about an unchangeable set of circumstances. However, your patience may run thin as you react impulsively now, without giving yourself enough time to monitor the tone of your words or consider the impact of your behavior. Don't be too hard on yourself if you upset someone in the process. Taking care of your own needs is more critical today than keeping the peace."
scorpio,2013-10-13,"You are tempted to sidestep a financial issue today, but it's much wiser to deal with the situation before it gets any worse. It may be as simple as paying a bill that is overdue or untangling an accounting problem. Whatever it is, don't allow your resistance to an unpleasant money matter stand in the way of handling business while it's still easily manageable. A stitch in time saves nine."
sagittarius,2013-10-13,"Your perceptions are quite accurate today and your vision is strong enough to believe that what you see is the truth. Uncharacteristically, you can easily pick up on the emotions of others and this heightened empathy encourages you to share your revelations with them. Your openness is admirable, but don't assume that you know what is best for another person. Your way of handling adversity may work well for you, but it's not necessarily the path to happiness for everyone else. Be a supportive friend without telling anyone what to do."
capricorn,2013-10-13,"Your creative genius can take over today by showing you multiple solutions to a current problem. Unfortunately, you might not be able to discern which one is the best course of action. Although you may want to go with the very first idea that comes to mind, this isn't necessarily your most effective move. Take your time and methodically follow each option through to its logical conclusion before making your final decision."
aquarius,2013-10-13,"Your chances for success are strengthened by today's intelligent Aquarius Moon. But even if you know how to fix a difficult situation, moving slowly and deliberately still works to your advantage now. A hurried plan reveals your weaknesses while a cool and calm approach helps you gain the power you need to make your plans happen. Additionally, this thoughtful strategy allows others to connect with you in more meaningful ways."
pisces,2013-10-13,"Acting in a self-assured manner today throws others off course so your insecurities aren't apparent. Ironically, a veneer of confidence might get in your way because expressing your self-doubt now shows your strength of character. Don't shy away from speaking the truth. Ultimately, your position is stronger if you are completely honest about your feelings. Being your authentic self earns you the respect and admiration you deserve."
aries,2013-10-14,"You're wary of trusting your feelings now, since a rational approach to life makes the most sense. You might even try to rebel against what you already know in your heart. It's not that you don't want a more emotionally charged life, it's just that you aren't interested in giving up on your dream of stability. Nevertheless, you won't be able to deny your desires, so stop trying to justify your inaction because you're afraid of losing control. Indulge your heart without going too far."
taurus,2013-10-14,"You might be quite confident now as you gain momentum on a project that was recently set aside. Perhaps each moment has you dreaming about making your life more pleasant. However, caution is advised, since you could push hard only to find that you're reaching for the wrong star. But if you take a deep breath and pay careful attention to what you're feeling in your gut, you could actually catch a glimpse of your new direction."
gemini,2013-10-14,"Something shifts energetically today and suddenly you just know what you need to do. Unfortunately, your moment of awareness doesn't necessarily translate into sustainable action. Although you may be back at work or school now, you might not feel very motivated. Try to avoid becoming too indifferent about what you want, for it is your passion that will ultimately bring you closer to your dreams."
cancer,2013-10-14,"Anticipating a change of direction means that you must also shift the focus of your thoughts. You might think that you're ready for new adventures, but you could also inadvertently push them away out of fear. It feels as if your entire life is moving too fast now, and that the pace is just beyond your control. You won't be able to keep up with everything if you continue to hold onto the past. Fortunately, it's much easier to handle the current intensity once you let go and embrace the future."
leo,2013-10-14,"Your emotions grow more extreme throughout the day and there appears to be no way to escape the looming storm. Thankfully, you won't be scared off by a little relationship drama if it helps you to recall something very important from your forgotten past. Remembering an old story can boost your current motivation and inspire you to make an overdue change. There's no time like the present to take charge of your life."
virgo,2013-10-14,"You are rejuvenated by a fresh surge of energy that washes through your life today. Unfortunately, it can be quite a challenge to figure out which way to turn. Seeking counsel from your friends or associates may not help you make a decision because your agenda is so different from theirs. Nevertheless, someone else's perspective still gives you a different way to look at the same old thing. At least, another point of view provides an objective frame of reference."
libra,2013-10-14,"You don't want everyone to notice you today, yet, paradoxically, you may be thinking about what you want to share with others. Unexpressed fear isn't the only thing holding you back now. You also need to establish a daily routine so that doing your chores or homework won't stand between you and your greater aspirations. Even if you are unsure of your destination, practice trusting your intuition. Your inner voice won't let you down."
scorpio,2013-10-14,"Being your same-old reliable self today is challenging if your daydreams distract you from what you must do. It's not that you're incapable of hard work; it's just that you might have lost your edge as your motivation dwindled. It's wise to push yourself now by getting others involved in your cause. Setting up a few appointments or meetings makes it harder for you to procrastinate. Once you're finished with your tasks, give yourself permission to spend some time with your dreams."
sagittarius,2013-10-14,"You might not be ready to return to work today. If you're feeling restless, you may even want to hightail it out of the office and take some time off. Although you have a lot on your plate now, you could talk yourself into believing that your co-workers can, somehow, get the job done without you. Unfortunately, nothing much is accomplished without your effort and expertise, so find a healthy balance between productivity and relaxation to make everyone happy."
capricorn,2013-10-14,You don't want to sit still today because you're jumping up and down with an excitement that just won't settle down. You might be tempted to hide your enthusiasm because you're not interested in destabilizing your life. But your aversion to risky behavior that shows your vulnerability can actually block your intent to get closer to someone you admire now. Take advantage of your energetic buzz and let your guard down.
aquarius,2013-10-14,"Settling back into an old relationship dynamic might seem like a great idea today. However, it's still wiser to try to push through the resistance and make the necessary changes in your plans for the future. You could try to justify your overall safe approach to life right now, but tense aspects won't likely let you get away with taking the easy way out. Make up your mind to move forward and then get busy creating the future you want."
pisces,2013-10-14,"You want everyone to know how you are feeling today because you think that being transparent will make you less lonely. Ironically, you may be scared to reveal too much about yourself. However, the Moon's visit to your sign draws your emotions up toward the surface where you can't help but wear them on your sleeve. The choice is yours; you could make someone else unhappy with your sad song or you could make it better by changing your tune."
aries,2013-10-15,"No matter how scattered you feel today, it's time to ground yourself in your daily routine. Your key planet Mars, now in earthy Virgo, encourages you to pay attention to the details of your own life; however, this tricky transit can also be rather annoying. Although you are more apt to initiate action first and work out a plan as you go along, it's helpful to move in a methodical manner in order to lessen your frustration and increase your productivity."
taurus,2013-10-15,"Over the next several weeks you have an opportunity to express yourself in more creative ways, but there is a catch. You must treat your playful expressions as if they were part of your daily routine. This doesn't mean you can drop your responsibilities to go off and make music or write poetry. Instead, just set aside a little time every day to focus on more artistic endeavors. What begins as a distraction gradually gains in importance over the days ahead."
gemini,2013-10-15,"You're usually open to receiving input wherever it comes from. However, you must be selective now that Mars in Virgo tells you to utilize only the most reliable data. Be careful about what you say and be sure to reference your sources if you are quoting someone else. And, most importantly, consider the overall usefulness of whatever you intend to do -- before doing it."
cancer,2013-10-15,"Surround yourself with your best friends and don't be afraid to lose yourself into the spontaneous activities of the day. And although you must still be discreet about what you say, it's probably better to share what you're feeling today than keeping it bottled up any longer. It will actually feel good to be a part of any communication process when you are in the company of people you can trust."
leo,2013-10-15,"This is a time for you Lions to do things in a very basic and practical manner. It's essential to focus on building your own self-worth, both financially and psychologically. However, your fires of inspiration may be dying down today as Mars leaves lively Leo to enter efficient Virgo. It's not the end of the road, but rather a transition into a time when considered actions have more impact than the obvious and noisy ones."
virgo,2013-10-15,"Your energy level skyrockets now, giving you more oomph, zest and pizzazz in everything you do. Your adrenaline shoots through your system as Mars rushes into your sign for a seven-week visit. But because you are burning somewhat hotter than usual, you could come across as more aggressive than others expect. If you aren't watchful, this can lead to petty ego disputes or conflicts. Focus on putting the power of Mars to work toward accomplishing your goals."
libra,2013-10-15,"Your energy may be hidden from others, but it runs deep over these next few weeks and this can present some problems. You might not be able to express your anger directly, so others can't tell what's really going on for you. You tend to avoid direct confrontations more than usual now; you could even feel like going on a retreat. Don't let your ego run the show, for your happiness doesn't depend upon recognition. Do the hard work behind the scenes and get ready for what comes next."
scorpio,2013-10-15,"You receive much-needed support from your friends now, allowing you to focus your attention on what is important rather than being distracted by the noise of circumstances. Don't take your eyes off your goals, for your long-term success depends upon consistent concentration at this time. Keep moving in the same direction, for even if it seems as if you're not gaining ground, you really are."
sagittarius,2013-10-15,"You might feel like your ambitious plans are being thwarted as aggressive Mars begins his seven-week tour of duty in detail-oriented Virgo. However, don't take any setback too personally. This transit is less about you than it is about the conflict between expansive Sagittarius and concentrated Virgo -- the classic ""big"" versus ""little"" dilemma. Your frustration may rise, but if you can hold back your horses while attending to the details, success will be yours."
capricorn,2013-10-15,"You're entering into a highly focused phase when your ability to diligently apply yourself at work is at its peak. Even if you don't have one specific task you must finish, you're now able to get more things done. The danger is that you can become so enamored with your work that you lose track of the lighter side of your life. Set aside time for plain old fun; you'll actually accomplish more if you do."
aquarius,2013-10-15,"This is an intense period as you delve into the mysteries of your emotions. These might not be familiar energies to you and you may resist the journey if other people's agendas conflict with yours. There really isn't much you can do about these annoyances except to keep them in your awareness. Your discomfort will likely pass without ill effect, unless you make it into something bigger than necessary. Don't push these experiences away, the treasures you encounter now make your life richer."
pisces,2013-10-15,"You have more reason than ever to sort out your relationship tangles. It's easier to cooperate with others now, especially if you are working toward a common goal. But don't try to do it alone, even if there is an interpersonal conflict brewing. If you do find yourself in a disagreement today, make sure it isn't just a silly misunderstanding. Working out the surface differences enables you to meet on common ground."
aries,2013-10-16,"You're quite determined to fulfill your heart's desire, but you may be thwarted each time you make a move toward your goal. Fortunately, you are not so quick to give in to negativity now. Pick yourself up as often as necessary and start all over again. Your persistence will play out in your favor today if you have everyone's best interests in mind."
taurus,2013-10-16,"Your friends and coworkers might witness your stubborn side today, even if you aren't expressing the real power of your desires. Perhaps you believe that what you really want is so far outside the range of acceptability that you refrain from telling them anything at all. Unfortunately, your discretion can make you feel disconnected from others. It's not an all-or-nothing matter. Taking small risks will be rewarded if you're willing to be patient."
gemini,2013-10-16,"You are feeling a bit scattered as you jump into your chores with a whole new way of looking at them today. You're not satisfied by just doing the same old thing in the same old way. Innovation is your game, but too much originality now might send you back to the drawing board. Try transforming your unconventional approach into a slightly more conservative one for the best results."
cancer,2013-10-16,"Although you may be drawn out of your self-protective shell today, you still could have mixed feelings about it. You are eager to engage with others as you share your deepest feelings, yet simultaneously wish you had more privacy. Even if you find it difficult to let go of your fear of being judged, this is a great opportunity to stretch outside of your comfort zone. Nothing ventured, nothing gained."
leo,2013-10-16,"You might be feeling even more reclusive than others realize today. Everyone else thinks you are fully engaged, but you are actually keeping your most passionate emotions hidden. There is no need to satisfy anyone else's expectations of you now. Be true to yourself and take whatever personal time you need. Sometimes you just have to work things out on your own."
virgo,2013-10-16,"It's tricky to keep your emotions in check today. Logically, you know what to do, but something motivates you to take a different course of action that brings you dangerously close to the edge of rebellion. Don't waste too much energy doubting yourself now. Instead, speak up and surprise someone by asking for something you really want, even if it's out of character for you. Be brave and let the words fall out."
libra,2013-10-16,"A simple relationship issue is intensified today when someone lays his or her values on the line and then impatiently waits for your response. However, you are of mixed emotions now; although your key planet Venus is activating non-conformist Uranus, you're still feeling some self-restraint. Your indecision may be insurmountable, so it might be wise to let the other person decide for you both. Choosing compromise over conflict is often your best instinct."
scorpio,2013-10-16,"Someone might be pushing you into a situation against your will and you don't like it one tiny bit. Events are unfolding too quickly and you resent being coerced. Although you seem willing to go along with the plan today, you may be cooking up your own resistance so you can plant your feet when the time is right. Don't react too quickly, for your position will only increase in strength if you delay your response a little while longer."
sagittarius,2013-10-16,"It may feel like a playday today, but behind the excitement lurks a more serious tone. Nevertheless, delicious Venus in your fun-loving sign is zapped by electrical Uranus, drawing your attention away from work and toward social pleasures. But you're also quite aware that you have obligations that need to be taken care of before you go out and enjoy yourself. Normally, you are the one who tells others to lighten up and have fun, but now you should remind yourself."
capricorn,2013-10-16,"You might be caught between two opposing ways of responding to your current circumstances. On one hand, you want to reward yourself for your hard work. There are treats already waiting for you and it would be very easy to take advantage of what's being offered. On the other hand, you may not be able to forget about your responsibilities, even if you have completed your chores. Indulge yourself for a change; you can always tie up any loose ends tomorrow."
aquarius,2013-10-16,"Nearly everyone will find you more sociable and charming today, and you can use this secret weapon to move closer to your goals. Your key planet Uranus electrifies sweet Venus, putting a high-frequency buzz into the atmosphere. Unfortunately, someone might try to prevent you from having the fun you know you deserve. Acknowledge the resistance you perceive from others and take their feelings into consideration before charging ahead with your unconventional activities. The pleasure may still be well worth the consequences."
pisces,2013-10-16,"Take a leap of faith today and risk exposing your dreams to the outer world; your timing couldn't be better. But don't give up if you also receive a strong reality check in the process. Keep in mind that some of your fantasies may be better left unrealized. Nevertheless, others are unusually receptive to your ideas now, so move forward with your plans while you can. Step out of your imagination and into your future."
aries,2013-10-17,"It could feel as if your whole life is renewing itself and you are quite eager to embrace the future. Your enthusiasm may get you started on your path but, unfortunately, it won't be enough to ensure that you reach your destination. But dreaming about it is just the first step; you need to walk your talk to make things happen. Add a dose of determination, though, and you just might accomplish the goals you are now setting."
taurus,2013-10-17,"Someone may ask more of you than you can give today, which tempts you to go into hiding to avoid confrontation. It's crucial, though, to meet the current challenges head on without ignoring the role your consistency plays in keeping everyone else on track. The good news is that you don't have to carry the whole burden upon your shoulders. Others are more than happy to pitch in and help when you need it."
gemini,2013-10-17,"You're more productive today if you can be part of a group, rather than having to work by yourself. Paradoxically, you may also feel relief when you are finally alone. Acknowledge the conflict between your need to connect with others and the more subtle benefits you receive from solitude. Don't choose one over the other; allocate time for both."
cancer,2013-10-17,"Your tendency to care for others may stand in the way of your own personal ambitions today. Paying close attention to what each person requires at work could clear a path for you to become a star, even if you merely play a supporting role. Don't be concerned about temporarily losing sight of your own goals; they will still be there when you finish with your current obligations. Your willingness to nurture others casts you in a favorable light."
leo,2013-10-17,"Keeping your mind focused on your immediate tasks is a challenge today, especially if you are very busy. Your confidence continues to grow and your daydreams might even be work-related. Unfortunately, they won't likely make you any more efficient on the job. Still, as you contemplate how to escape current responsibilities, remember that your increased effort now should provide you with greater freedom later on."
virgo,2013-10-17,You like the idea of doing something different at work today or even enrolling in a whole new course of study. You might want to consider a field that allows you to discover hidden mysteries or explore uncharted relationship dynamics. Don't worry about applying your current interest to your career. This is more about personal growth and the immediate connection to your job may not be apparent at this time. Follow your bliss and see where it leads.
libra,2013-10-17,"Everyone seems to stir up too much unneeded excitement in your life now by offering you one too many points of view. Although this information may not support your old perspective, you are eager to see where it takes you. A bit of common sense goes a long way today. Don't change your mind too quickly; instead allow the transition to unfold at its own pace."
scorpio,2013-10-17,"You bring a renewed vigor to your job and are anticipating what you can tackle at work today. You feel refreshed, as if your emotional batteries have been recharged. But don't let your enthusiasm run off with all your good intentions. Be careful, for apologies might not be enough to undo a broken promise if you overcommit your time. Make the most of your momentum while you have the chance to gain real progress."
sagittarius,2013-10-17,"Although it's a work day for many, you are already dreaming about the weekend. Unfortunately, you probably have too much to do, even before adding recreational activities to your hectic calendar. In this same situation others might decline a social engagement, but not you. Somehow you think you'll find the time and energy to fit it all in. Stop and get some much-needed rest; remember it's not healthy to burn the candle at both ends."
capricorn,2013-10-17,"Consider your ideas twice before you just blurt out what you're thinking since impulsive expressions complicate nearly any situation today. You may not actually mean what you say; it's just your way of blowing off pent-up feelings. But someone could interpret your words more seriously than you intend. If it's really important, you might be better off waiting a few days until you've taken time to solidify your position and develop your plan."
aquarius,2013-10-17,"A heightened pace of activities, along with the many distractions and disruptions that come your way, doesn't make your life any easier to manage today. You needn't be afraid of taking a stand and establishing territorial limits. Normally, you might prefer to go along with the changes throughout the day, but now you gain more by remaining grounded and focused. Establish clear priorities and keep calm no matter what happens."
pisces,2013-10-17,"Your life could settle down enough now to get your personal responsibilities under control. Perhaps you've been remiss in meeting your obligations, but today you are driven by more practical concerns. Forget the idle fantasies and sentimental journeys. Taking direct action -- not dreaming about it -- will bring you face to face with the happiness you seek."
aries,2013-10-18,"You're looking forward to the weekend, even if you have to handle complicated relationship dynamics. The Aries Full Moon eclipse stirs emotional change, but it also instills you with a sense of quiet power. Find peace by setting a sustainable pace that gives you time to improvise. Thankfully, you don't need to stand on your desk and shout; others can tell that you are on to something big. Just remember to keep the energy moving forward no matter what happens."
taurus,2013-10-18,"Hidden feelings are brought to the surface today and can trigger an uneasy response when they are released. You may actually breathe a sigh of relief that others hear as the energy of the excitable Aries Full Moon eclipse shakes up your 12th House of Privacy. If they ask you what's going on, go ahead and tell them. But don't waste too many words, as you have more important things to do now than justifying your emotions."
gemini,2013-10-18,"Rather weird events involving your friends seem to be veering out of control today. Actually, your calendar may be the furthest thing from your mind with the spontaneous Aries Full Moon eclipse occurring in your 11th House of Social Networking. It's not that you're in denial; it's just that you're missing the clues that indicate there's more going on than meets the eye. You could be having too much fun playing the role of a diplomat. Ultimately, it's better to attend to your own business now than attempting to make things easier for someone else."
cancer,2013-10-18,"A temporary crisis at work may alter your plans for the weekend. But don't let big changes stop you from scheduling some fun with your friends or associates. However, circumstances might require you to set firm boundaries. Take care of your own needs for fellowship and make time to hang out with like-minded people. Don't be overly concerned about whether you can afford the time or the expense to treat yourself nicely. You are certainly worth it."
leo,2013-10-18,"Normally, you act out your feelings, but it may be better to talk things out now before swinging into action. But don't get lost in the details; the Aries Full Moon eclipse activates your 9th House of Big Ideas. Be bold in your thinking; leave no stone unturned when considering your current options. There's no reason to hold back; stretch your mind and reach for new horizons. Today's dreams can become tomorrow's reality."
virgo,2013-10-18,"You may be high on life today, but your current confidence about your future is tempered by concerns about the past. You are being drawn into deeper emotional realms, which often makes you uncomfortable. However, you might actually be enthusiastic about exploring the shadows of your own subconscious now since the Aries Full Moon eclipse energizes your 8th House of Intimacy. The passions that rise to the surface will settle back down once you understand how they fit into the larger picture."
libra,2013-10-18,"Relationship issues that you are avoiding come crashing out of the closet now. And although everything doesn't necessarily go your way, you can sense that you've made it through the thick of it by the end of the day. Today's Aries Full Moon eclipse falls in your 7th House of Companions, so stay with your emotional process even if you run into resistance from someone else. Don't retreat if communication is challenging; establishing common ground is possible if you are patient and persistent."
scorpio,2013-10-18,"You refuse to be bored today as you navigate your way through your demanding schedule. Although today's Aries Full Moon eclipse rattles your 6th House of Routine, try to get in some rest and relaxation since next week may even be busier than last week. Don't be afraid to redefine your boundaries and set new expectations based upon the unfolding events and how they impact your work."
sagittarius,2013-10-18,"Your enthusiastic intentions are magnified by the Aries Full Moon eclipse that shines in your 5th House of Spontaneity today. Although you are looking toward the future with great anticipation, you're also grateful to be living in the moment. However, you might be feeling more emotional than usual and may want to address these issues with a close friend or lover. Charm is on your side; just remember to use it wisely."
capricorn,2013-10-18,"You may be experiencing unsettling flashes of uncertainty now, but this intense emotional weather might be exactly what you need in this moment. Your reactions are swift and self-protective as the impulsive Aries Full Moon eclipse lands in your 4th House of Inner Security. Meanwhile, others are depending on you in the workplace, and this motivates you to take on even more responsibility. Surprisingly, you become more determined throughout the day to stir up issues that can create positive change."
aquarius,2013-10-18,"Tension develops on the home front as you feel real pressure to come through with your end of the deal. Perhaps you promised too much, but you'll probably be able to get away with pulling back a little at work while you take care of personal matters. Today's Aries Full Moon eclipse creates static in your 3rd House of Immediate Environment, but don't make the mistake of withdrawing from communication with others now; staying present is more than half the battle."
pisces,2013-10-18,Your current priority is to plant your feet more firmly on the ground and claim your authenticity. Take advantage of today's powerful Aries Full Moon eclipse in your 2nd House of Values by letting others know what really matters most to you these days. Concentrate on clarifying your core beliefs instead of compromising to keep the peace. Say exactly what's on your mind now and everyone will respect your position and appreciate your honesty.
aries,2013-10-19,"Your key planet Mars tempts you to turn on the lights, crank up the volume on your music and make noise as if to scare off your enemies. However, making unreasonable demands isn't helpful because you would rather avoid confrontation at all costs today. Unfortunately, whatever action you take won't likely end up as successful as you think. You may have better luck just chilling out and spending the day indulging your romantic fantasies, instead."
taurus,2013-10-19,"You have an abundance of emotional energy to express now, but your approach is softened and confused by your interactions with others. This ambiguity isn't necessarily a problem, for it could take the hard edges off your day. Be careful about over-indulging in anything today, including alcohol, which can alter your perception of what's real. It may be a great way to relax for some, but don't use it as an excuse to avoid reality. Taking time to process your feelings gives you the chance to listen to your heart."
gemini,2013-10-19,"If you can harness the powerful planetary energy available today, you could tap into creative levels that are normally out of reach. Your vision inspires you to soar to great heights. However, the cloud layer might be so thick that even as you fly through your dreams, you may not be able to see very far. But it's not a good idea to clear away the clouds of illusion now just to make your way through the fog. Instead, just use your colorful imagination to create your world as you wish it to be."
cancer,2013-10-19,"You may be reassessing issues regarding your own self-worth today and might wonder what you actually have to bring to the table. Do you believe your life is as fulfilling as it could be? Are you clear about your core values? These questions linger on your mind now, especially if you think your coworkers or friends don't know the real you. In any case, start the ball rolling by sharing your concerns; your current openness helps others to better appreciate your valuable contributions."
leo,2013-10-19,"Attempting to create the same magic that often comes to you on its own may be a tricky proposition today. You like being the center of attention and there is enough energy cooking in your life now that you can put on quite a show. But something isn't clear, and it makes you wonder if you are playing the right character or if you are even on an appropriate stage. Be patient, for this phase of self-doubt only lasts a day or two. Ultimately, the rest of the script writes itself, enabling you to be the hero in the end."
virgo,2013-10-19,"Mastering the gift of compassion isn't always easy, but now it's what the cosmic doctor is prescribing. However, it's odd because you uncharacteristically want to make a really big deal about everything today. You just want everyone to hear your side of the story. At the same time, remain open to that part of you that doesn't want anyone to know anything. Forgiveness, after all, is a private matter just between the parties involved."
libra,2013-10-19,"Sweet romance is out there somewhere and you can feel it in the air. You might even want to believe that it's just around the next corner. Whether or not you are currently in a relationship, romance may seem a bit elusive these days -- especially if you are attempting to capture it and put it in a jar. Rather than trying to make something real, just enjoy the fantasy of love for a couple of days and see where the journey takes you."
scorpio,2013-10-19,"Your mind is currently on your work, even if you're not at the office. You are likely thinking of what you need to do to better your position in the outer world. And although you would rather be with your family or friends today, don't miss an opportunity to foster community spirit by participating with a group of like-minded individuals. Nothing specific needs to happen now as long as you use creative visualization to conjure up more possibilities for your future."
sagittarius,2013-10-19,"Your long-awaited adventure may be about to begin, but something is lurking beneath the surface. You are aware of the complications that your vivid imagination brings. Nothing is quite as simple as it seems. Nevertheless, dream large dreams in brilliant colors. Share your fantasies with someone you trust, for they can set the stage for your next journey."
capricorn,2013-10-19,"Sometimes it's difficult for you ambitious Mountain Goats to completely let go of your responsibilities. But now you benefit most by getting involved in an activity for the sake of learning without worrying about being practical. Rather than checking off tasks on your list, try doing something just for the fun of it. Watch a movie or go play at the beach. Engage in discussions about the hidden meaning of the universe and explore any topic that resonates with you. There will be plenty of time for more productive efforts again tomorrow."
aquarius,2013-10-19,"You might believe that you are being quite clear in your communications now, but people just don't perceive you the same way that you are seeing yourself. It's likely that there is a slight disconnect between you and everyone else today. However, it works both ways, for you can also misunderstand others. This may not be a great day to work on a concrete plan of action, but it could be an amazing day to share your dreams. Let go of the details and fantasize about the possibilities. Clarity will return soon enough."
pisces,2013-10-19,"Keeping your fantasies separate from the facts is nearly impossible today. Actually, it may be rather discouraging if you try to break out of your illusions now. You might even feel as if your dreams are more important than the dreary world around you. Communing with nature and connecting with your spiritual side brings out the best in you. In just a few days, you'll receive landing clearance to arrive safely back on planet Earth."
aries,2013-10-20,"You may resist any form of constraint today, but practicing self-discipline is a very effective strategy, even in small doses. It's not that you are out of control; it's just that you might agree to deliver more than you can handle now. Unfortunately, you could ruin a good thing if you accept too much responsibility without setting clearly defined boundaries. At least, think twice before saying yes."
taurus,2013-10-20,"Trying to simultaneously juggle too many chores might impress someone at first, but everything changes if you can't complete what you start. Effectively breaking down a large task into manageable components enables you to concentrate on each one separately. Although a major project may be overwhelming, you can accomplish more than you expect if you just take it one piece at a time. Inch by inch it's a cinch; yard by yard it's hard."
gemini,2013-10-20,"Your playful approach to serious issues can be too much for someone else to handle today. A friend or partner might even complain that you aren't working hard enough to hold up your end of the bargain. Nevertheless, you believe that you're actually doing more than your fair share. If anyone comments on your lack of productivity, shrug it off. Don't let a battle of dueling egos take over your day. Put forth your very best effort and your actions will speak for themselves."
cancer,2013-10-20,"You could be so blunt with your opinions today that you accidentally hurt someone's feelings. You're a bundle of extremes now as you push out beyond the old limits. You imagine a variety of possibilities where others only see obstacles. You can explain exactly where they have gone off track, but being critical of everyone else won't help anything at all. Sharpening your skills and improving your productivity enable you to lead by example, instead."
leo,2013-10-20,"You might take the idea of being busy to a whole new level today, but secretly you would rather be relaxing. You want to have fun but you intuitively realize that the current temptations are acting as one big test of your willpower. It's not wise to just give in to your irresponsible inner child now; you will feel better about yourself when you behave like a grown-up, instead. Whistling while you work inspires everyone around you to do the same."
virgo,2013-10-20,"Regaining control of your finances and getting a handle on your spending might be tricky business today. There's no need for impulsive behavior, especially if you are considering the purchase of a luxury item in order to add more beauty to your life. Unfortunately, buying something special may still leave you feeling emotionally empty now. Look beyond the material world to discover the fulfillment you seek. The most precious things in life are free."
libra,2013-10-20,"Taking pride in your appearance comes as second nature to you and you like to look your best, no matter what you are doing. However, you could push vanity too far now as the radiant Sun in your 1st House of Personality aligns with unrelenting Pluto. You can inadvertently set up a power struggle if you don't rein in your ambitions early on. It's better to show support for your team today than to run out ahead of the pack."
scorpio,2013-10-20,"It doesn't matter much if your dreams are unrealistic; you're not ready to give up on them just yet. Paradoxically, you're quite optimistic about your future even if your progress has been delayed. You believe that your logic is clear, but it's challenging to be productive now if your perspective is warped. If you ask your closest supporters for advice, make sure that you actually listen to what they say. A simple reality check may be all that you need to get back on track."
sagittarius,2013-10-20,"Speculating about money and power is likely to be high on your agenda today. You might have an opportunity in front of you that's hard to resist. Someone may offer to give you something for nothing, but rest assured that same person will return to collect on a debt or promise. If you don't inflate your expectations now, you won't have to deal with any disappointments later. Follow your intuition but keep your common sense close at hand."
capricorn,2013-10-20,"You can feel your emotional intensity building up again, but today you are unsure whether to trust your instincts or your logic. Unfortunately, you may still be smarting from a recent run-in with an authority figure, yet you have enough new ideas now to turn a previous setback to your advantage. Don't worry about winning or losing; honoring your intentions and doing your absolute best is good enough."
aquarius,2013-10-20,"You want to examine both sides of a complicated issue now, but this mental exercise won't bring you any closer to a solution. Fortunately, finding a lasting compromise isn't nearly as important today as you believe. Just drawing everyone's hidden agendas out into the open is enough mischief for one day since it clears the air of any residual tension. Turn on the light of awareness and let nature take its course."
pisces,2013-10-20,"Believing in yourself brings untold benefits because you realize you can't always count on others to support you and your work. It might surprise you today if an associate takes the time  to help you without expecting anything in return. Let down your guard; this isn't the moment to prove how independent you are. Instead of feigning self-sufficiency and pushing others away, accept their generosity with an open heart and a smile."
aries,2013-10-21,"You're eager to blast off today, but the launch may be postponed due to circumstances beyond your control. Communication issues are emphasized when messenger Mercury begins its three-week retrograde phase. Conversations wander off track if you don't have all the details in place. Although you might be inclined to take a direct approach, it's helpful to allow time to assimilate your experiences before doing anything about them."
taurus,2013-10-21,"Problems may arise through a misunderstanding with a close friend or intimate partner today. Instead of just brushing conflict aside, it's best to uncover the source of the disagreement and talk about it while it's still fresh. Once you see where you went wrong, it will be easier to let it go and move on to something more positive. Extending an olive branch demonstrates your willingness to take the high road."
gemini,2013-10-21,"It makes sense today to stop running around from one distraction to another. You won't get much done if you keep going at this breakneck speed. Unfortunately, you may be required to go back and redo what you didn't do right the first time around. Paying attention to details now can prevent delays later on. Cultivate patience as a coping skill to help you adjust your pace. Slow and steady wins the race."
cancer,2013-10-21,"You're through with struggling to keep your feet on the ground today. Fantasy is overtaking reality, which, ultimately, might turn out surprisingly well. The key is to enjoy your mental meanderings without necessarily acting on your feelings. You could run into trouble if you treat a dream as if it were real. There's nothing wrong with using your imagination to entertain yourself as long as you remember your way back home."
leo,2013-10-21,"You're motivated to get things out in the open, but you may be fighting an uphill battle as a family member or someone at home seems to be keeping secrets. Your lack of clarity could send you into a state of confusion, but you might not want others to know about your uncertainty. Thankfully, a vicious cycle of non-disclosure can be broken once you decide to openly share what's on your mind. Don't let pride get in the way of progress."
virgo,2013-10-21,"Be extra careful as you schedule your time today, since you can't afford to miss an appointment or get behind in your work. Still, your best intentions can fall short due to an uncharacteristic disregard to the details. Compensate for your current spacey behavior by writing everything down so you don't forget what you need to remember."
libra,2013-10-21,"Although you might want to focus all your mental energy on a very practical issue now, it's rather unlikely that you can prevent your mind from wandering all over the map. You may be distracted by your creative desires or by a less productive romantic interest. Don't worry so much about what you accomplish today. Give yourself a gift; go ahead and entertain a playful diversion just for the fun of it."
scorpio,2013-10-21,"You might feel as if you're enveloped in a self-protective bubble today that insulates you from other people's problems. But you're not as safe as you think now that trickster Mercury turns retrograde while visiting your sign, creating the illusion of suspended time. You may be unsure of choices as your moods swing wide and fast, making it difficult to take definitive action. Be gentle with yourself until things settle down and you know which way to go."
sagittarius,2013-10-21,"You are a study in cosmic contradiction today as you soar into the highest spiritual realms of your imagination. At the same time, however, you are pulled into the emotional shadows where you aren't as confident. Don't try to choose one path over the other. If you do, your reverie might suddenly come to an end and you'll be plunged back into the mundane world again. Oddly enough, you can be in both places at once if you keep both your mind and your heart open."
capricorn,2013-10-21,"Your impatience with overly emotional friends and coworkers can stir up more trouble than it's worth today. You don't want to interact with those who might get in the way of your productivity, but avoidance may not be possible. Others are merely reflecting your own subconscious tendencies now. Let go of your goals for a while and let yourself drift. Funny enough, sinking into your dreams will help you accomplish more in the long run."
aquarius,2013-10-21,"Instead of pushing forward on your career path, it might make more sense today to take a breather while you integrate your recent experiences. Taking time to regroup and consolidate during the next three weeks may be the best use of this Mercury retrograde phase. You will ultimately gain more ground if you have the wisdom now to relax and reassess your priorities."
pisces,2013-10-21,"Dreamlike images flood your consciousness today, challenging you to untangle your desires from the real world. But your key planet, surreal Neptune, can easily inspire a spiritual breakthrough now or confuse you with its lack of focus. Don't worry if the intuitive flashes are impossible to interpret; it may take a while to understand them. You'll receive great insight about where to go next in your life if you recognize that your colorful visions are direct messages from your subconscious mind."
aries,2013-10-22,"You have obligations to meet, yet the faster you spin your wheels, the less you actually get done. However, self-awareness is now the key to change. Methodically slowing down your response to any emotional news is a good idea, even if you have an immediate visceral reaction. Don't put too much on your calendar today; keep some time squirreled away so you can contemplate your role in the web of life."
taurus,2013-10-22,"Anxiety rears its ugly head today as worrisome waves wash through your mind, especially if you are trying to untangle financial issues. Fortunately, your fears could be unwarranted if you schedule time to plan ahead. Seeking a practical solution should alleviate pressures about love or money before your little problem turns into something much worse. A stitch in time saves nine."
gemini,2013-10-22,"Being conscious of the Moon traveling through your sign enables you to stay in touch with your feelings. However, peace of mind is not dependent on expressing every whim and changing emotion. Exercising caution helps counteract the likelihood of reacting too quickly to a situation as it unfolds. Setting your mind on one specific goal enables you to accomplish more than you expect."
cancer,2013-10-22,"Your friends and associates may see you as cool and calm today, but unbeknownst to them your fantasies are running wild. In fact, your inner world could feel so intense now that you withdraw a bit from your interactions with others. Ironically, this is exactly why everyone thinks you are more serene than you really feel. Practice cultivating your interpersonal relationships while simultaneously enjoying your rich world of dreams."
leo,2013-10-22,"You can land yourself in a heap of trouble today because your coworkers might not be as reliable as you think. It's not that they are purposefully misleading you; it's just that they may overextend their optimism and promise more than they can possibly deliver. If someone comes to your rescue now, gracefully accept the offer of support. However, it's not a good idea to put all your eggs in one basket or you might end up being sorely disappointed. Your secret back-up plan could be just the thing that saves the day."
virgo,2013-10-22,"There are so many intriguing possibilities pulling you in different directions that you could worry yourself silly trying to explore all of them. You might be tempted to throw in the towel and just acquiesce to everyone else's demands. Nevertheless, it's wiser to rethink what you can do as you respond to the changing circumstances. Laughter is the best medicine, so maintain your sense of humor throughout all the twists and turns of the day."
libra,2013-10-22,"Making rigid plans can end up being a problem today because everything will likely change more than once. Don't bother setting your schedule in stone by trying to follow your agenda to the minute. Instead, be ready to respond to each and every situation as it develops. Thankfully, this spontaneous approach helps to stabilize your day and increase your overall productivity."
scorpio,2013-10-22,"Weird weather is blowing into your life from hidden quarters, but everything could shift when the Sun enters your transformational sign tomorrow. Meanwhile, your day is a magnet for odd occurrences that elude logic. Nevertheless, a little trust at the right time can go a long way now, and you may be pleasantly surprised when you relax some of your boundaries. Don't be too concerned about the current instability; you don't have to do anything except practice flexibility and follow your instincts."
sagittarius,2013-10-22,"Everyone around you seems to be running in circles faster and faster, and all the chaos just makes you feel like going back to bed. The truth is that you are moving slower now, which makes other people impatient. Working on a team is fine -- if you can keep up with your associates. Unfortunately, the speed of your external world could be a reflection of your boredom. Instead of avoiding the noise of the day, embrace it as a shadow aspect of yourself."
capricorn,2013-10-22,"You're feeling a lot of pressure as you reach an important deadline or the end of a project. It's time to establish more stability as a buffer against your desire for change. Unfortunately, you shouldn't attempt to force a resolution to a conflict or you'll only end up creating more frustration. Although you might want to experience something new today, step back and take a deep breath so you can appreciate the many blessings you already have in your life."
aquarius,2013-10-22,"You are ready for fun and games now that the Moon is lighting up your 5th House of Play. Unfortunately, you still have work to finish first. Naturally, you can't force the week to end any sooner than it will; however, you don't need to postpone your enjoyment. Instead of reasoning that someone else will bring you more pleasure, focus on your current activities with a renewed sense of acceptance. Being present in the here and now is a conscious choice towards happiness."
pisces,2013-10-22,"You may feel as if you're being drawn in conflicting directions today, yet you still might believe that it's possible to simultaneously follow more than one path. But the weird truth is that all roads eventually lead you to the same destination now. Entertain as many possibilities as you can and then choose the course of least resistance. There are many ways to make your dreams come true."
aries,2013-10-23,"You can't work in a vacuum all the time, independent of everyone in your life. You are tied to other people's activities and schedules more than you wish. There's a part of you that enjoys working alone, and, preferably, answering to no one. However, this solitude is not what the universe has in store for you today. Try to avoid others now and you won't be able to get your ideas off the ground. Engage in the dance willingly and you can touch the heavens."
taurus,2013-10-23,"Your attention is shifting toward the distant horizon, yet you may have something important to say about your current relationships. However, your message isn't likely light and easy. You have given your predicament significant thought and now you want to present your solution in a rational and balanced manner. Nevertheless, it helps to acknowledge your specific point of view so you can better understand how your desires color your logic. Seeing your own personal bias makes it possible to change your perspective."
gemini,2013-10-23,"An ongoing conversation with a close friend or coworker may grow so intense today that you want to just walk away from it. However, continuing an honest dialogue could lead to resolution as long as you don't get hung up in unimportant details. Instead of defending your position, assume a less aggressive posture that encourages the other person to speak. Taking the time to listen changes the dynamics of the discussion, making it easier to find common ground."
cancer,2013-10-23,"When issues get emotionally complicated, you are tempted to withdraw into your private world until you figure out how best to act. Sometimes you don't know how to reach your destination, so you wait until the tide of external events carries you along to the next place. Now is one of these times when it may be easier for you to slink quietly back to your cave and hope that no one sees you. But this self-imposed isolation isn't in your best interest. Pick out the most important feelings and share them with someone close to you to find your answers."
leo,2013-10-23,"In order to make the best of the circumstances around you, you must respond to your current situation with rational sensibility. Avoiding unrealistic schemes now helps you remain on track. Keep it simple; and then be like the Rock of Gibraltar. Don't waver from your chosen path. Be open to modifications as suggested by others, but demonstrate your determination and stay focused on your goal."
virgo,2013-10-23,"You have more accessibility to your own emotions today, and this can help you in ways that may not be obvious to anyone else. What comes to the surface now isn't necessarily pretty, but you're not a contestant in a beauty contest. Thankfully, you begin to feel better once you reveal your feelings and reestablish a sense of balance. Surprisingly, expressing your darkest fears can open the door to a meaningful dialogue that benefits both parties."
libra,2013-10-23,"You may be quite loquacious today, but you're not necessarily talking about the same things that interest others. Typically, you like to keep the chit-chat light, even when you're being serious. You seem less afraid to shake up the status quo now and confront others with issues that concern you. Just remember to approach the most difficult subjects with your typical grace and a compassionate heart. Staying present emotionally helps the conversation go somewhere special."
scorpio,2013-10-23,"The potential for transformation is high and you stand to gain plenty from decisions you make at this time. You begin to look back over your previous year and think about the next one now that the Sun enters your sign, marking the beginning of your astrological birthday month. Don't let personal development fall to the wayside; the positive impact of therapy, yoga or other spiritual pursuits is greater now than ever. Living well is the best revenge."
sagittarius,2013-10-23,"Take a deep breath before diving into a potentially intense conversation. Even if you're riding a powerful wave of passion, it may be time to go with the flow instead of trying to control your feelings. Let go of your old assumptions; you don't need them anymore. There's no need to panic; you have plenty of time to soak up the magical wonders that can only be experienced when you swim in the sea of emotions."
capricorn,2013-10-23,"Exploring your feelings in the context of a professional relationship requires your special brand of diplomacy. It's rapidly becoming apparent that more is going on than you previously imagined. Accordingly, it's crucial to make an extra effort to explain your preferences to your friends and associates. You stand to gain respect at work now, but you may have to go out of your way to prove that you are a valuable member of the team, rather than sitting on the sidelines watching the action."
aquarius,2013-10-23,"You can sense a shift of the energy today into a deeper and more complex emotional space. You are beginning to understand that there may be another level to what you see and you are fascinated -- and also frightened -- by all the possibilities. Nevertheless, don't ignore a new piece of information that takes you by surprise just because you weren't prepared for it. Fate is finding a way to get your attention. You may be pleasantly surprised by what you learn once you stop resisting the unknown."
pisces,2013-10-23,There is something magical and mysterious about this time of year for you Fish. You don't really mind the descent into the shadowy realms of consciousness as the Sun begins its month-long journey through the deep waters of Scorpio. You are searching for answers to some pretty serious questions about the meaning of life. Be patient; solutions to spiritual dilemmas take time to manifest.
aries,2013-10-24,"There may be a lot of positive movement in your life and you're probably quite enthusiastic about what's happening. You appear to be forthcoming with your feelings, yet you're so smooth now that you might even fool yourself. Step back from the fun and games long enough to look beyond all the distractions. Once you get past the noise, you can reconnect with your emotions and speak directly from your heart."
taurus,2013-10-24,"Responsibility is calling your name, even if you're visiting an amusement park. You want to jump off the ride before it ends in order to get back to your obligations. Unfortunately, you may have to wait since the controls are out of reach -- so you might as well relax and just enjoy yourself. Being open to pleasure today is a challenge surely worth pursuing."
gemini,2013-10-24,"You can't help but be thrilled if someone tempts you with a wonderful invitation. However, you aren't sure if you can say yes now. Normally, you would have to pass on the fun if your previous commitments were not yet fulfilled. Luckily, the cosmos has given you the gift of gab, enabling you to talk your way around most obstacles and to pursue the adventure you seek. Proceed with caution because you may feel the stress later on if you don't deliver what you promised today."
cancer,2013-10-24,"Your ever-changing moods might make others impatient with you now that the evocative Moon is back in your sign. But you are in charge of your own destiny, and you can choose to keep your more serious feelings to yourself. This behavior is not dishonest; it simply creates a temporary boundary that allows you to work on your self-esteem. You don't have to share every thought with everyone. Wait until your emotions settle down and then disclose whatever seems right."
leo,2013-10-24,"You aren't operating under any false illusions now, yet you may be even more optimistic than before. Part of your exuberance comes from the fact that you know what you are worth and can see the light at the end of the tunnel. Don't lose faith, even if it's been a long, hard haul. Your destination really could be within reach if you just keep believing in yourself."
virgo,2013-10-24,"A family member or close friend may come through for you now in a way that touches you deeply. You're more aware of what others say today, especially if they inspire you with their words. But even if it feels like you've taken a step backward, there's no need for major concern at this time. Although you still might need to practice patience for a while longer, your momentum is building and the rewards will follow."
libra,2013-10-24,"It feels good to be needed at work and you are more than eager to go out of your way today to help others. This sense of camaraderie can be a wonderful opportunity to give even more than is expected, but be careful about committing to so much now that you can't deliver on your promises. Good intentions are not enough if you spread yourself too thin; true success comes from knowing your limits."
scorpio,2013-10-24,"You want to maintain a positive attitude, but it's challenging to trust logic today if you're not in touch with your feelings. Speaking from your heart can be a tricky maneuver, but you are better off acknowledging your emotions at work, even if they are not directly connected with your performance. Don't try to make anyone else responsible for your reactions; just respond authentically and then move on."
sagittarius,2013-10-24,"Everything appears to be coming up roses today. Nevertheless, you can't seem to shake off a bad feeling about something that's just below your radar. You think you're missing an important piece of the puzzle but you don't know where to search for it yet. For now, consciously let go of your attachment to the mystery and simply enjoy yourself in the present moment."
capricorn,2013-10-24,"Someone may ask for your help today, but there really is nothing you have to do other than listen. The greatest gift you can give another person is to accept him or her as is, without any further demands. Ultimately, your unconditional support could turn into a spiritual gift that returns to you as you learn something special about yourself. Although your altruistic intention is to be of assistance, surprisingly, you stand to benefit the most from the process."
aquarius,2013-10-24,"Although relationship dynamics may be a bit confusing these days, a new wave of clarity is on the horizon. Instead of putting a relationship into a box by defining it with your specific goals, try being more open-minded in your approach. You can bring out the best in others now if you engage them without too many expectations. True love is an unchained melody."
pisces,2013-10-24,"You may be ready to put extra time into a romance during the days ahead. However, your creativity might also be channeled toward playing with children. Either way, your current tenderness leads you to be extra-protective of those closest to you. Remember, however, that fostering freedom can also be an empowering way to demonstrate your love. Balancing supervision with independence enables  you to nurture all of your relationships now."
aries,2013-10-25,"Speaking with authority doesn't make your message true, but you might still try this ploy as a defensive strategy today. You may actually think you can talk someone into seeing the world through your eyes. But overpowering others by insisting you are right only makes you sound foolish, since your rationalizations are probably more transparent than you realize. Don't pretend to be in control when you're not. Those who know you love you simply for being yourself."
taurus,2013-10-25,"Your future looks bright today, but you may not be heading in exactly the right direction to realize your dreams. It's not your goals are unrealistic; rather, it's that you might underestimate the resources needed to reach your destination. Thankfully, you can see possibilities that others miss if you let your imagination wander. Just remember to separate fact from fancy or you could be rudely surprised by the outcome."
gemini,2013-10-25,"Your most vivid dreams are ripe for harvesting now, but don't let your confidence run away with the show. Although you may think that you can be successful without working harder, this false illusion will dissipate as circumstances continue to change. If an unrealistic fantasy fades as you approach it, it's probably best to let it go and move on to another idea. But don't give up; your imagination holds the keys to your success."
cancer,2013-10-25,"It may seem as if you can describe your hopeful feelings today, but it's still challenging to start a conversation about your future dreams. Instead of wasting energy by being self-critical now, keep your visions to yourself until you have a good reason to share them. It isn't useful to reveal your plans prematurely or you could create an awkward impasse. Be patient and remain quiet just a little bit longer. Trust your intuition to tell you when it's time to open up."
leo,2013-10-25,"You may feel as if you're in an ideal social environment today because everyone seems to enthusiastically support your decisions. You don't even have to think about what to do next; you're part of the flow and everything seems to happen naturally. Unfortunately, your current spontaneity doesn't play well with your desire to establish deeper connections. Thankfully, you can have the best of both worlds by letting others participate in your success."
virgo,2013-10-25,"Relaxing is a challenge today because you're afraid of what may occur if you don't resist the prevailing emotional currents. You prefer rational behavior and like to be in control all of the time -- but unfortunately you're not. Therefore, your most logical strategy now is to avoid getting hooked by your own desires. Nevertheless, attempting to ignore your needs just gives power to whatever you fear most. Escape your regular routine by leading with your creative imagination rather than your analytical thoughts."
libra,2013-10-25,"Beginning your daily tasks at work early in the day might sound like a smart idea, but nothing seems to go quite as planned. Your unflappable positive attitude is the most significant factor today in deciding whether or not you can put your schedule back on track. Don't be overly rigid in your thinking if you run into an obstacle; being flexible now actually enables you to regain control later on."
scorpio,2013-10-25,"You might be willing to take the easy way out of a problem today. Typically, your determination inspires you to achieve your goals, even if your non-negotiable approach complicates your life. But keeping your dreams alive may be more important now than accomplishing anything specific. Although your current productivity could suffer, you're likely to be happier in the long run by following your heart's desire."
sagittarius,2013-10-25,"Your imagination is extremely vivid today, encouraging you to mix up your daydreams with reality. You might even believe that you can accomplish more than is possible because everything flows effortlessly in your mind. Unfortunately, each task you begin takes more time to complete than you expect. You may create trouble for yourself if you race through a chore, assuming you will make up for lost time. Instead, promise less and deliver more."
capricorn,2013-10-25,"You can fool your workmates today by appearing to be busier than you actually are. However, if you want to be fully recognized for your contribution to a project, don't try so hard to steal the spotlight. If you take your little song and dance too far, you might inadvertently overstep your bounds. You are better off if you just work hard and then let the chips fall where they may. Ultimately, your efforts won't go unnoticed or unappreciated."
aquarius,2013-10-25,"Your current lack of a concrete plan won't necessarily get in your way today. Ironically, making it up as you go might just be your key to success now. Expressing your creativity brings recognition, and can even lead to some extra income. However, you could feel as if you're wasting time managing unexpected interruptions, but it's wise to simply handle them as they occur. Paradoxically, the current distractions may even inspire you to reach greater heights."
pisces,2013-10-25,"It's tempting to shut out your problems by withdrawing into your imagination today. But escaping into your own personal fantasyland works best only for brief moments of time. Sooner or later you must return to the real world issues you tried to leave behind. Working on tangible solutions preemptively, rather than after the fact, is the most productive strategy now, even if you would prefer to take a less ambitious path."
aries,2013-10-26,"You're all set to join in social activities today but it's wiser to think about your involvement in the wider context of your life. Curbing your enthusiasm helps you minimize complicated emotional entanglements, but you might not be able to avoid getting hooked if you see positive potential, even in a challenging situation. Although you may end up having more fun if you stay low key this weekend, don't judge yourself too harshly if you slip and act on your unrealistic optimism. Simply make the best of whatever happens."
taurus,2013-10-26,"Although you prefer sailing on smooth waters, you still might stir up a few waves today if your emotions clash with someone else's. You could be drawn into an irresolvable disagreement if you believe that your needs are more important than the desires of others. There is a very fine line now between maintaining your integrity and just being plain stubborn. It is fine to know what you want as long as you remember that you're not the only one with an agenda."
gemini,2013-10-26,"You might feel as if your family and friends are trying to make something look better than it is today. Although you don't want to be negative, you're afraid of glossing over the truth in your haste to join in the fun. However, others may grow annoyed with you if you decide to dig for more details. If you turn over every stone looking for trouble, you're sure to find it. There are no quick and easy answers to your questions. Just be as authentic as possible when making choices and allow others to do the same."
cancer,2013-10-26,"Some of the more obvious tensions in your emotional life have abated, but you still may be uncertain about the direction you have chosen. You're attempting to stay between the limits of too little and too much, but avoiding extremes is not as easy as you think. Don't be too hard on yourself if you can't yet find the peace of mind you seek. Clarity will be within reach once you stop trying so hard."
leo,2013-10-26,"Acknowledging your emotions enables you to add your perspective to the ongoing discussion today. But you Lions can be as bullheaded as your Taurus cousins, and your stubbornness could make everyone's life nearly unbearable now if you let it. It's not important that you actually change your mind; what's crucial is that you remain open to new information. Don't be the one who is responsible for all the trouble just because you wouldn't take the time to listen."
virgo,2013-10-26,"An unresolved relationship issue is on your mind now that you're trying to put your life into perspective. You have earned the right to feel good about your personal connections, but now you may be facing another annoyance as you try to find a balance between what you want and what you are willing to pay for it. Thankfully, no decision is required just yet. If you can live with this dilemma now, the uneasiness should dissipate over the next few days."
libra,2013-10-26,"It seems as if everything you do now is either totally amazing or simply not good enough. It's like someone has placed a distortion filter on the volume control of your senses. Even if you know what you want, others may tell you that you shouldn't be asking for so much. Meanwhile, you don't think your expectations are out of line. Hang in there; there's nothing that needs to be resolved today. Things will begin to settle down as early as tomorrow if you let them."
scorpio,2013-10-26,"You may feel stuck as you struggle to separate your personal emotional life from the frustration and pain of the world. The important lesson buried here is simple: it doesn't always have to be an all-or-nothing proposition. You have the power to create moveable boundaries. Even if you stay current with the news and discuss the events with those close to you, you still can receive great pleasure from your personal interactions. Think globally; enjoy locally."
sagittarius,2013-10-26,"Even if you describe a general concept today with great passion, it's not as easy to drill down to the key details. Opinionated Jupiter tricks you into believing that you can separate useful ideas from unrealistic fantasies. Your ability to justify your desires now makes it challenging to know your limits. Of course, there is no harm in having a fund as long as you don't set responsibilities aside in search of sensory fulfillment. Remember to employ moderation as you establish priorities for the rest of the weekend."
capricorn,2013-10-26,"You are in touch with the most practical issues in your life, even though circumstances seem to be pushing you toward blatant overexpansion. You're easily captivated by someone today, but other people's irresistible charm leads to trouble if you're not careful. Listen to what your emotions are telling you, but for now, follow your logic instead of your heart. Trust your sensible inner voice, for you really do know what's best."
aquarius,2013-10-26,"You're weary of struggling to transform your most ingenious ideas into concrete form. Nevertheless, it's difficult to ignore your thoughts even if they seem to be over the top. Setting your goals too high ensures frustration and could prompt you to give up prematurely. However, you might not push yourself to accomplish something extraordinary if you don't aim high enough. Finding that sweet spot in the middle is worth your persistence because your efforts won't go unrewarded."
pisces,2013-10-26,"You may feel as though a thick fog is obscuring your goals today and you're drifting without a map to guide you. Additionally, the emotional landscape continues to change as you explore your need for pleasure. Unfortunately, you don't seem to be able to get exactly what you want yet. Although you are growing more aware of your desires, it's apparent that there's no quick route to satisfaction. Fortunately, living in the present moment, at least, allows you to appreciate what you have now."
aries,2013-10-27,"It's easier to just say what's on your mind than to keep your feelings to yourself today. You might even claim that you have considered the impact of your words before you open your mouth. But the truth is that you really have no idea what will come out until you actually hear it along with everyone else. It's great to make your point, but putting on a show to get attention now won't likely bring the results you want."
taurus,2013-10-27,"Although you hope to take full advantage of the weekend, you don't want to expend too much energy just to have some fun. You realize how much work is in front of you next week and, fortunately, have the common sense now to reserve some of your strength for when you need it later. Enjoying some time in the company of others can still be rejuvenating if you keep your activities low key and close to home."
gemini,2013-10-27,"Don't worry about making plans today; just enjoy yourself moment to moment now that the lively Leo Moon is spicing up your 3rd House of Immediate Environment. But don't get too wild and crazy or you could regret your actions pretty quickly. Keep in mind that cleaning up an emotional mess won't be nearly as much fun as making it. Thankfully, you can still have a superb time while acting in a more mature manner by simply toning your energy down a notch."
cancer,2013-10-27,"You are tempted to spend more money today than you budgeted, especially if you're responsible for entertaining others. Naturally, you want to make a good impression on everyone with delicious food and drink, but your friends may be less concerned with the details than you are now. Your extravagance can bring its own punishment if it makes you short on cash or causes you too much stress. Remember that it's the company that matters most."
leo,2013-10-27,"You might attempt to create a strategy for success around your current notion of only stating the absolute truth when it is necessary to give it voice. However, the Moon's presence in your expressive sign encourages you to share more of your feelings today even if they don't move you closer to any of your goals. It's great that you feel upbeat and want to inspire others to be happy, but keep in mind that your plan to reach nirvana is not ideal for everyone else. Saying fewer words about the future is smarter now than rambling on unrestrained."
virgo,2013-10-27,"Your advanced organizational skills are needed to bail someone out of trouble today, and you are happy to ride to the rescue. You don't mind working behind the scenes, and you're even less interested in receiving personal recognition as the reflective Moon moves through your 12th House of Secrets. First and foremost, you want the satisfaction of knowing that your hard work helped to save the day for your friend or colleague. The universe is reminding you that you can accomplish nearly anything you set your mind to now."
libra,2013-10-27,"You're ready to show off your stuff to the entire world today, and a social gathering can act as your temporary stage. Although you want to be seen and acknowledged, it's wise to hold some energy in reserve. Others may not know your entire story and you might prefer keeping it that way for a while longer. Avoid the temptation to bring everything out into the open now, for those who matter will still see what you bring to the party."
scorpio,2013-10-27,"It's easier to buckle down to do whatever is expected of you when the rules and the limits are well defined. Unfortunately, there are so many fuzzy boundaries today that things could get sloppy pretty quickly. Don't wait until you have fallen over the edge before creating a strategy. Pay attention to social protocols, for they can prevent you from getting yourself into trouble. Embark on your spiritual quest, but do yourself a favor and wait to make any major moves until your clarity returns."
sagittarius,2013-10-27,"You can't even hear your own voice of reason today, or, maybe you are just choosing to ignore it. It's a rather straightforward choice: have yourself a good time or work hard while delaying the fun for another day. Naturally, no one is surprised if you are the first one at a party and the last one to leave. Self-indulgence most likely wins out, so you might as well enjoy yourself while you can. Your unfinished chores will still be there when you return."
capricorn,2013-10-27,"It's often difficult to set your responsibilities aside unfinished, because you typically prefer to do the work first and then relax later. But today, you might impulsively decide to leave your commitments behind and take time off for the pursuit of fun. Just make sure that you don't forget to return in time to finish your chores so that you also have the satisfaction of a job well done."
aquarius,2013-10-27,"You may feel lucky to have a loyal partner or playmate, but it's tricky to hold up your end of the deal today. Rather than being overly attached to someone else at the hip, you need more freedom now so you can move creatively on your own. However, if you show a little self-restraint, you might be able to find a way to balance your opposing desires and make everyone happy, including yourself."
pisces,2013-10-27,"Your travel plans might be shaken up today as interactive Mercury aligns with unpredictable Uranus. You may attempt to be serious at first, but you quickly realize that your ability to display your creative side also includes having fun. Don't be afraid to brush someone off who tries to hold you back as you seek ways to stir up a bit of excitement. Make the most of the planetary buzz; thankfully, there will be plenty of time tomorrow to fulfill your commitments."
aries,2013-10-28,Your most creative efforts may be blocked because you take yourself so seriously today. Worrying about someone else's reaction to your work can be enough to stop the flow of your self-expression. Dig deeply into your shadows without judgment as to what surfaces. It could take some time to figure out what to do with the material that appears now. A more casual approach to your current process removes some of the pressure and allows the energy to flow unimpeded once again.
taurus,2013-10-28,"No matter how motivated you are to share your feelings today, it may be tricky, considering the current circumstances. This is one of those times when you could be better off leaving your personal issues at home. Focusing on what needs to happen at work is best done now without unpacking any extra emotional baggage that you might be carrying. Discretion is the better part of valor and also your key to success."
gemini,2013-10-28,"Sorting out your schedule makes sense today since it's likely that you have bitten off more than you can chew. Fortunately, your key planet Mercury is available to assist you in rearranging your calendar. Work with the retrograde energy by postponing non-critical appointments to free up enough time for you to get your chores finished. Time management could be your secret weapon."
cancer,2013-10-28,"A social situation might make you feel awkward today because you're not willing to set aside your internal process in order to have a good time. It's not that you are negative about anything in particular; it's just that you don't want to miss an opportunity to experience an emotion that's crucial to your growth. Although it may not be a great idea to push your agenda too hard now, saying what's on your mind goes a long way to alleviate any hidden tension."
leo,2013-10-28,"You have an uncharacteristic tendency to be self-critical today, since it may be impossible to live up to your own standards. You might feel like you are playing for keeps now, but it's likely that the stakes aren't as high as they seem. Change an intense situation into a more relaxing one by removing the competitive aspect. Once the pressure to win has been eliminated then everyone will be able to lighten up and play nicely together."
virgo,2013-10-28,"Keeping your agenda private today may seem like a good idea, but it might not actually work out according to your plan. Your strategy could backfire as others realize you have something up your sleeve, making them less likely to trust you. Be as forthcoming as possible and you will likely receive the assistance you need. Transparency paves the road to success."
libra,2013-10-28,"It may feel as if your friends are not as supportive as usual, which can throw you into an emotional tailspin. The reality is, however, that others are no different today; it's you that has changed. You might expect so much now that no one could possibly fulfill all your needs. Your real work is to transform your attitude without depending on others. It all starts with believing in yourself."
scorpio,2013-10-28,"Responsibilities weigh heavily on you today, for others expect you to carry more than your fair share. Of course, you take your work seriously and want to perform in an exemplary fashion. However, just because you have things to do doesn't mean you can't also have a little fun as long as you don't flake out on anyone. Taking time to think about your plan in advance enables you to gracefully balance work with play."
sagittarius,2013-10-28,"Your unrealistic ideas about a thrilling adventure may crash into reality today, requiring you to consider a scaled-down alternative. Don't let discouragement get the best of you because all is not lost. Your positive attitude allows you to make the necessary changes in your thinking more easily than you expect. A mature approach to integrating a new perspective can ultimately boost your confidence and increase your chances of living out your dream."
capricorn,2013-10-28,"You might think that a close friend doesn't understand what you're going through now no matter how hard you try to share your true feelings. It may seem as if there is a protective wall around your heart that prevents you from expressing your ideas with the same passion you feel for them. Don't struggle; patience works better than anything else today since you'll likely feel more emotionally connected in a couple of days. In the meantime, look for your answers within."
aquarius,2013-10-28,"Your partner or a coworker may come down on you harshly today, forcing you to examine your own shortcomings. Avoid responding with an overly defensive posture, for that kind of behavior only magnifies your insecurities. Instead, take the feedback to heart and think about what you can do to change for the better. A lesson learned now could have long-lasting positive ramifications."
pisces,2013-10-28,"If you are feeling under the weather or grappling with ongoing health concerns, making small changes in your daily routine can be just the catalyst you need to improve your well-being. However, it's not about turning your life upside down now; there's nothing to be gained by overwhelming your system. Instead, show respect for yourself by taking that first healthy step which allows more to follow."
aries,2013-10-29,"Untangling complex relationship dynamics may be the focus of your world today as you pull away from other social obligations. Although your intention is to keep centered, the Moon's midday conjunction with your key planet Mars makes you even more impatient than usual. Nevertheless, it's more important than ever to practice self-restraint so you can get to the source of the current tension before riding the next big wave into the future."
taurus,2013-10-29,"You don't like being pushed into anything too quickly, especially if you feel like you have nowhere you must go. Your natural tendency is to dig in your heels and hold onto your current position no matter how hard others insist you do something else. Lighten up; being overly stubborn now is not a strategy that will bring you happiness. Instead, pay close attention to what people are telling you. Learning a significant life lesson is more beneficial in the long run than having your own way."
gemini,2013-10-29,"Some days you can talk your way around nearly any obstacle. Today, however, reality has tightened the screws and slammed on the verbal emergency brake, making it tough for you to shift into gear. But don't give up; whatever may be holding you back will gradually ease over the next few weeks if you remain focused on your goal and continue to put in the effort. Although taking a shortcut is out of the question, consistent hard work leads to success."
cancer,2013-10-29,"Personal relationship issues can eat up your time and attention today, and a particular situation may require direct intervention on your part. Even if you must play a heavy-handed role now, the good news is that you know what you're talking about and your words carry a sense of authority. Thankfully, your current ability to concentrate on the present moment is working in your favor. Set your feelings aside for a while and do what you know is right."
leo,2013-10-29,"It could feel as if you are stepping up to the plate and everyone on the other team is pitching to you simultaneously. Others might crumble under such pressure, but you have the mind of a Jedi warrior today. Fortunately, you can remain unflappable as long as your intentions are pure. You're up for the challenge; pick the incoming toss that you like best and hit it out of the park."
virgo,2013-10-29,"You're tempted to hide out today, but reality may not be so forgiving. You have pressing responsibilities that need your attention and there's little room for changing your schedule now. However, you can gain a better perspective that ultimately leads to new options if you take time to listen to your inner thoughts. This self-reflection enables you to come out of your shell later in the day. Remember, contemplation might not appear to be productive, but it's exactly what you need to clear your mind."
libra,2013-10-29,"Don't even consider admitting defeat today just because a big idea seems out of reach or because someone has taken the wind right out of your sails. You still have an excellent chance of reaching your primary goal, even if it won't likely happen overnight. Take whatever resistance you encounter now as a vital clue from the cosmos. Return to the drawing board and rework the weakest parts of your plans. Your faith gives you the confidence you need to overcome a frustrating setback."
scorpio,2013-10-29,"You know exactly what is true today, even if the signals you're receiving from those around you say something else. If you're willing to hold on to your integrity and follow your plan all the way through to the end, it will likely work out as it should. Shallow thinking, however, collapses upon itself like a house of cards, leaving you uncertain as to where to go next. Don't waste time skimming over the top; instead demonstrate what you can do by expressing a bit of your infamous Scorpio passion."
sagittarius,2013-10-29,"A close friend or associate who often supports your ideas may come down hard on you today, but it's probably not as bad as it seems at first. Thankfully, there could even be a silver lining in the dark cloud -- and it's to your advantage to locate it as soon as you can. Whatever you do, don't spew negativity on the messenger, or you might miss an opportunity to improve your thinking process. A change of attitude will do you good."
capricorn,2013-10-29,"Don't second guess your intuitive hunches today, for your psychic faculties are more effective than usual. However, your thinking is also grounded in reality now so you could grow frustrated with your own mental resistance. It might even seem as if your thoughts are just leading you around in circles. Reality may be standing in your way, but you can be exactly where you need to be by the end of the day if you have faith in the process."
aquarius,2013-10-29,"An effective relationship at work may cool off a bit or one of your most exciting ideas could turn into something rather ordinary today. Perhaps you are engaged in serious thinking and have finally realized that friendly chatter alone won't produce the results you want. Take this change in dynamics in stride now, for you can use the time to continue developing your plan. Thankfully, your enthusiasm may return as soon as tomorrow."
pisces,2013-10-29,"Your emotions are a bit tangled today and your current confusion can be a bit disorienting. However, there's nothing wrong with your analytical abilities. In fact, the source of your problem may be the opposite -- arising from your awareness and not from your ignorance. Trust your logic. Be ready to jump right in without hesitating one moment after you have made up your mind."
aries,2013-10-30,"You might not be very happy about the attitude of a coworker today and may feel the need to confront the issue. Nevertheless, you're not sure if you really want to stir things up so much that you lose your sense of stability. Instead of turning your world upside down, accept your frustration for a while longer without placing blame on anyone else. The winds of change are shifting and it will continue to get easier to alter your current direction in the days ahead."
taurus,2013-10-30,"An emotionally intense person may attempt to talk you into doing something that you prefer to avoid. Fortunately, you have an extraordinary amount of stamina today and might be ready to apply your legendary determination to the current situation. Normally, it's helpful to hold your ground in spite of external pressure, but knowing when to negotiate can ultimately make your world a better place."
gemini,2013-10-30,"Narrowing your scope of vision is a very smart idea now, since it's arguably more crucial to finish your work than it is to have fun. However, saying no may be the most important thing you can do today because this simple act gives you the additional time that you so desperately need to achieve your goals. Stay as focused as possible since your full presence in the moment makes a world of difference."
cancer,2013-10-30,"You are not readily lured into lowering your defenses today, since it's easier to play with others if you don't get too emotionally close to them. The cool Virgo Moon squares romantic Venus this evening, drumming up social conflict. It's hard to stay in the present moment when there are important unanswered questions about your future. Don't dwell on what's missing; instead be thankful for what is already yours."
leo,2013-10-30,"Sometimes it's challenging to be you, even if your life seems amazing to others. However, external appearances can be misleading, for there are tricky planetary forces pulling you into deeper waters now. Luckily, you're quite comfortable swimming in the intense emotional currents, so don't waste any energy trying to avoid them. Dive in and learn something new about yourself."
virgo,2013-10-30,"You may feel waves of positive energy flowing into your life now, but you cannot integrate them until you resolve an unpleasant situation from the past. You might choose to avoid direct confrontation today, but being true to your emotions lifts your self-confidence. Naturally, when your self-esteem is higher, you can accomplish more than others expect. Roll up your sleeves and get busy while you have the planets on your side."
libra,2013-10-30,"You want everyone to be happy, but you still might need to bring important news to the attention of others. However, you could inadvertently spread negativity now without even realizing what you are doing. Stay aware of how your thoughts impact your deeds throughout the day. Thankfully, it's not difficult to overcome your own doubts if you simply take the time to acknowledge them first. Believe in yourself and anything is possible."
scorpio,2013-10-30,"Your emotional intensity rises to an even higher pitch over the next couple of days as feisty Mars crosses paths with potent Pluto and irrepressible Uranus. It may be difficult to hide an internal conflict you are facing, and it gets harder the more you try. Instead of resisting your feelings, allow them to ripple outward through your life. Thankfully, you can express your needs with kindness and awareness without necessarily having to suppress them."
sagittarius,2013-10-30,"You like the idea of staying on the sunny side of your disposition, but today there could be a rather serious issue that needs airing, too. Naturally, others appreciate your positive attitude; nevertheless, don't let anyone's expectations stand in the way of your honesty. After all, part of your reputation is based on your ability to tell it like it is. You will feel free once the truth is out in the open."
capricorn,2013-10-30,"Your heightened ambition tempts you to ride roughshod over the feelings of others today. You might even try to blame your current emotional disconnection on taking a direct path to success that doesn't consider anything except reaching your goal. Being productive is admirable; however, there is more to life than working hard each and every day. Slow down and take time to smell the flowers along the way."
aquarius,2013-10-30,"You are seeking ways to advance professionally and may find yourself putting in extra time and effort to get noticed. You are motivated now by several planets in your 10th House of Career, inspiring you to postpone fun activities while concentrating on more professional objectives. But working harder by itself might not be enough to do the trick today. Your gentle persistence combined with patience and positivity is an award-winning strategy."
pisces,2013-10-30,"You might feel as if someone is on your case today and you really don't know how to set the record straight without turning the situation into a major conflict. Nevertheless, you can't just let it go, even if it's not that big of a deal. There's no need to take any resistance personally. If you can avoid showing your annoyance, the obstacles could dissipate quicker than you think. Reframing the current circumstances makes more sense than trying to change them now."
aries,2013-10-31,"Fulfilling your career ambitions or finding a new purpose in life grows in importance now as your desire for meaning intensifies. You could even become a bit obsessive, afraid that you might lose your chance if you don't work harder toward achieving your goals. Be careful; it's possible to overwhelm other people with your energy if you don't stop to consider the consequences of your behavior. Fortunately, you can be extremely effective today if you just take time to listen to the needs of those closest to you with an open heart."
taurus,2013-10-31,"Relationship dynamics may grow more complex if your friend or partner is as inflexible as you are today. Thankfully, you can change the energetic flow of the situation by simply meeting others halfway, instead of trying to fit them into your personal agenda. In fact, you might be so amazed with the results of this simple tactic that you give even more in return. Happily, you will find that establishing common ground cultivates richer friendships."
gemini,2013-10-31,"Your intense emotions can overpower your most rational thoughts today, stirring up unsettled feelings. You might even believe that you're losing control of a very manageable situation. Luckily, this could become a magical moment if you are willing to admit that you weren't in charge even when you thought you were. Widening your horizons by exploring unfamiliar territory of your heart attunes you to a deeper message that's buried behind the noise of language."
cancer,2013-10-31,"You enjoy the camaraderie that's part of your day, but you may have mixed feelings about engaging in lighthearted social chatter today. Still, you could be happier if you set aside your sometimes-too-serious thoughts for a while. Focusing too much attention on your emotions now gets old quickly and isn't the healthiest idea anyway. Ultimately, you will have enough time for contemplation even if you join in with others to participate in the fun. A change of scenery will do you good."
leo,2013-10-31,"Although your desire to achieve financial success could become less important in the weeks ahead, you still might feel the need to work harder so you earn more money now. Luckily, you're not in a hurry because you believe your patience will ultimately be rewarded. There's no reason to show all your cards yet or you may give away your power too soon. Play the waiting game; everyone doesn't need to know what you're going to do next."
virgo,2013-10-31,"You may feel emotionally protected but there are tensions still lurking underneath the surface today. You might be clever enough to avoid open conflict with someone close to you, but there are important differences that separate you from one another. Success is yours if you maintain mutual respect and tolerance of different beliefs. Giving the gift of freedom to others now enables love to flourish in a healthy environment."
libra,2013-10-31,"Sometimes you can show your flexibility by encouraging those you love to pursue their interests separate from the ones you share. But today the tables are turned and you may need to defend your core beliefs because you're not so eager to go along with someone else's vision if it contradicts your basic values. Overcome your fears and clearly state your boundaries. Although revealing your position might feel frightening at first, everyone should feel better once you make your limits clear."
scorpio,2013-10-31,"Bringing your emotions to the surface is easier by acting on your feelings today rather than explaining them as physical Mars gracefully dances with passionate Pluto. Although your moods may change throughout the day, your resolve is steady, preventing others from altering your course. Thankfully, you should be able to make great progress now as long as you don't try to cut any corners. Seize the day and don't let anything or anyone get in your way."
sagittarius,2013-10-31,"Your irrepressible energy could trigger shockwaves of change throughout your life now. Others may not fully approve of your apparent need to shake things up because they can't see what's going on within your mind. Meanwhile, your restlessness won't go away until you do something about it. Allowing uncertainty to enter your life may facilitate the transformation, but don't sacrifice your convictions along the way."
capricorn,2013-10-31,"Normally, your ambitions drive you on an ascending path toward your career objectives, but you may be less concerned with professional advancement now than with spiritual fulfillment. You could have a rare opportunity to retreat from your usual responsibilities today, giving you enough time to contemplate where your life is taking you. Thankfully, removing the pressure to succeed opens doorways to new destinations that were not previously on your radar. Be brave and explore the possibilities with an open mind."
aquarius,2013-10-31,"Although it might be a particularly busy day, you may have qualms about living up to someone else's expectations now. Even if others try to tap into your wisdom and experience, you might avoid getting involved because you prefer journeying within today. Nevertheless, you will be much better off if you let people know your true intentions right from the start. Just be certain to state your case kindly so no one's feelings are hurt in the process. However, there's no reason to apologize for following your heart."
pisces,2013-10-31,"You could feel rejuvenated as you regain emotional clarity today. However, your intense feelings about a relationship may not be received so well by someone else. Your message might be very important, but so is the tone of your words. Even if your perspective is radical, there's no need to purposefully provoke other people's fears. Concentrating on the highest potential keeps you on the path to success and inspires others to do the same."
aries,2013-11-01,"Withdrawing from a relationship conflict might be tempting today because you don't want to reveal too much about your inner process. Although you hope to make your point diplomatically, you still could say something you'll regret if you become overly emotional. Thankfully, you realize that escapist behavior won't benefit you in the long run. Take a risk and share what's on your mind now because you have a chance to overcome your current resistance to change."
taurus,2013-11-01,"Encountering problems at work is never fun, but someone who has been standing in your way may suddenly step aside today. Ironically, you might not have to say a thing because your actions have more impact than your words. But you can't get away with simply going through the motions; your behavior needs to be consistent with what's in your heart. Fortunately, your path will clear once you recognize that the obstacles you have been facing were of your own creation."
gemini,2013-11-01,"You prefer to avoid making commitments today because you think you're better off by keeping your options open. Unfortunately, you could miss a wonderful opportunity if you let your irrational fears warp your judgment. Instead, consider how adhering to a schedule gives you the structure you need to jumpstart your productivity. If your creative endeavors don't pan out as expected, you can always redirect your efforts later in the day. Leaving a bit of wiggle room for improvisation increases your chances for success."
cancer,2013-11-01,"Your emotional perceptions are very accurate today, but you still could mix up a sentimental memory with the current situation. Your insecurities are wrapped up in old patterns of attachment that have been followed by disappointment. But you don't have to repeat the past; wipe the slate clean by retelling your story in a new and different way, one that doesn't blame anyone else for your feelings. You become freer to express your love once you accept full responsibility for your reactions."
leo,2013-11-01,"You gain strength from realizing a new sense of purpose today, but you also must acknowledge the inherent weaknesses of those in your immediate environment. Another person's shortcomings can remind you of your own fears. Or, perhaps, taking care of a loved one might drain you more than you wish. There aren't any simple answers now; nevertheless, your loyalty in a close relationship will still bring priceless rewards."
virgo,2013-11-01,"Clarity comes and goes and returns again -- but it is still too soon to make any big decisions. Your emotions continue to overwhelm your cool analytical approach, even if you can tell where the current circumstances are leading. Attempts to make adjustments today may not be very effective, for they tend to be subsumed by larger shifts that are coming your way. Avoid impulsive action that's prompted by frustration; patience is your best strategy for now. Meditate or take a walk; a change of perspective is all you need."
libra,2013-11-01,"Don't worry about people who think you should be more decisive today. Your strength of character originates in your ability to understand multiple perspectives of an issue, especially now that so many people are stuck in their negative perceptions. Your friends will ultimately appreciate how you can quickly spot the potential that someone else might pass by without even noticing. Your kindness is contagious; pass it along."
scorpio,2013-11-01,"You might have to face some ghosts from your past, and they're probably not worrisome enough for you to try to avoid them today. Thankfully, your desires are strong now, luring you to the edge of excitement, even if you still need to work out more details before you can achieve satisfaction. Put your fears to rest once and for all; exciting possibilities are right around the corner if you just open your eyes."
sagittarius,2013-11-01,"You are torn between your desires to stay involved as a member of a workgroup and your need to spend a bit of time alone. Fortunately, you should be able to escape for a while without others even noticing your temporary absence. You certainly could benefit from some quiet time now, and you can reconnect with your co-workers without having any regrets about missing some of the action today. Going off on your own gives you a chance to explore your dreams."
capricorn,2013-11-01,"You are planning for your future, but a part of you lingers in the present moment today because you haven't adequately addressed specific concerns. Maybe you're afraid that you won't have enough time, money or love to fulfill your most important dreams. Although this is a very real dilemma, you gain more from having an enjoyable experience now than worrying about what may or may not happen later."
aquarius,2013-11-01,"You need your independence now and might quickly grow rebellious if you're told you cannot do something on your own. Your reaction may seem rather extreme, but your anger is triggered if you are reminded of the similarity between the current obstacles you face and ones that you previously couldn't overcome. Although you were smart to act cautiously in the past, you can push through these old insecurities today. The ideas that are truly worthwhile are also worth defending."
pisces,2013-11-01,"Feeling nervous about taking a risk today can get in the way of decisive action, but you continue to gain more confidence as you let your heart lead the way. Nevertheless, there's no need to rush your process; you could ruin the entire outcome if you move too quickly. However, pushing steadily against your anxiety like a sailboat leans into the wind gives you the maximum advantage to reach your destination."
aries,2013-11-02,"You are often so eager to begin something new that you have trouble finishing everything you start. But now you are growing tired of running around from one project to the next, especially if you haven't accomplished as much as you wish. Even if you don't want to wait another day or two to take charge of your own life, patience is a virtue. You can't rush events that are beyond your control, so you might as well use this time wisely by tying up any loose ends that could unravel without much notice."
taurus,2013-11-02,"Accomplish as much as possible early in the day, since you might be less inclined to be productive in the afternoon and evening. However, don't worry if you do fall behind even if someone criticizes your efforts. You're bound to get back in the groove over the next couple of days by reclaiming your center and putting your feet firmly back on the ground. It's just as important to recharge your batteries today as it is to push further ahead."
gemini,2013-11-02,Your current sense of urgency isn't your best indicator for timing because you might intuitively fear that you are near the end of the road. Your tendency is to jump into something entirely different now in order to pump some adrenaline into your life. But you're much better off facing your feelings of restlessness without actually giving in to them. Your decisions will be better ones if you postpone making choices until the temporary stress subsides.
cancer,2013-11-02,"You're feeling rather upbeat today becaise you can tell there's excitement ahead. Sometimes you wish you could retreat quickly when the cosmic weather takes a turn toward the extreme, but now you are eager to engage it head-on. These next few days will be intense, for you may have taken on more than you realize. But one thing's for sure: If you want to engage the full passion of life, this is your chance to shine."
leo,2013-11-02,"You have the ability to hold your life steady in the midst of dramatic change, and you may be running through your possible strategies today in anticipation of the future. You might not mind dealing with the intensity of your feelings or with those of others, but there could be a steep learning curve ahead. Pulling back your energy from the community and focusing it at home can be just the thing you need now in order to re-balance your life."
virgo,2013-11-02,"Don't give anyone else the power to lure you off track today, especially if you are fired up and feel as if you're on a mission. You might not appear as driven as you actually are now because you can cool your emotions with sound logic. Nevertheless, don't spend too much time justifying each of your actions or you could fall behind and lose your opportunity to make something special happen. Get out of your head and swing into action while you can."
libra,2013-11-02,"You can maintain your neutrality for only so long, and then something finally must give. You know it's time to make your move today when the Moon leaves your sign to enter incisive Scorpio. Ambiguity quickly becomes a thing of the past; you know exactly where you stand and where you are going. Others are smart to take their cues from you or just get out of your way."
scorpio,2013-11-02,"The Moon's return to your transformational sign isn't always an easy experience because you are bound to feel everything even more passionately now. Needless to say, your extreme emotions may be overwhelming to those closest to you. But it's even harder work to hide your reactions, and you don't have enough energy to do that today. Secrets can be shared and new levels of intimacy could be reached if you are willing to show your vulnerability by meeting others halfway."
sagittarius,2013-11-02,"You are usually upfront with your feelings, yet you don't necessarily dwell on them. You normally let your actions speak for you. However, you might believe you have something to protect now. Luckily, keeping your emotions to yourself is easy today because the Moon is hiding in your 12th House of Privacy. There is a lot to discuss about everything that's happening in your career -- which fortunately takes the attention off of your inner process for a while."
capricorn,2013-11-02,"You may be able to postpone a necessary confrontation for a day or two, but it's not advisable. Your emotions could explode if you don't face them sooner than later. It might seem as if you are running up against a wall today, but this could be a projection of your inner turmoil. When you stop trying to control the change, your stress should settle down, enabling you to maintain a sense of harmony throughout the day."
aquarius,2013-11-02,"Although you are still in the process of stepping into a bigger game, it is imperative that you show up today and take charge of your life the best you can. Let others know your intentions and demonstrate your seriousness about playing for keeps. The cosmic energy is shifting your focus from precise planning into decisive action. Make up your mind not to be distracted by a frivolous goal because you have more important things to do with your limited time and endless imagination."
pisces,2013-11-02,"You may feel very reserved today, yet your highest hopes might still be pinned to a shooting star that's on its way up. Your current intensity is linked to your positive attitude, yet you can be overly dramatic when you finally tell your story. Nevertheless, don't get tricked into believing that everything needs to come out in the open right away. It's an ongoing process and if you disclose new information gradually, it will be easier for everyone involved."
aries,2013-11-03,"Following through with your big ideas is difficult now because it seems like people say one thing yet mean something else. But it's also about what you share with others today, too. A Solar Eclipse activates your 8th House of Intimacy, stirring your passions and intensifying your emotions. Nevertheless, it's a luxury if you actually get to speak them out loud. Your feelings may not easily integrate into your life, so you must make a conscious choice regarding what is critical enough to reveal at this time."
taurus,2013-11-03,"Your relationships are probably more complicated than you prefer now. Today's Scorpio New Moon Eclipse falls in your 7th House of Others, adding boundary issues to your current struggles. You might strive for simplicity because you are happier when all is secure and stable. Paradoxically, in the spirit of getting back to basics, you could be willing to make your life even more complex for a short while. Keeping your goals in mind ensures that you continue to move along on your path."
gemini,2013-11-03,"Make simple adjustments to your daily routine today -- ones that won't turn your life upside down. But even the most subtle modifications can set into motion a series of profound consequences with the Scorpio Solar Eclipse rattling your 6th House of Self-Improvement. The potential to change direction is strong, so choose your actions wisely. However, being overly insistent could overwhelms others, causing your plans to backfire. Gentle persistence is much more effective now than one dramatic gesture."
cancer,2013-11-03,"You may feel as if your life has come to a standstill, but in truth it has not. In contrast, you're on the verge of something big. Perhaps you've been thinking about starting a creative project or initiating action on the romantic front. With today's New Moon Eclipse joining restrictive Saturn in your 5th House of Self-Expression, whatever it is won't happen overnight, so be patient with yourself and others a little while longer. It's always darkest right before the dawn."
leo,2013-11-03,"Your inner world of emotions may be at odds with your outer world of actions. You would like to withhold your feelings and smile now, but you might not be able to get away with it. Acknowledge your inner process while the Solar Eclipse is intensifying your 4th House of Security. Thankfully, you can change the rules of the game; instead of choosing emotions or logic, seek a position that honors both realms. Maintain your connection with your heart while making decisions with your rational mind."
virgo,2013-11-03,"It is time to put your plans into action because this New Moon Eclipse shakes up your 3rd House of Immediate Environment. Use the powerful energy to get your ideas out into the open, whether verbally or written. There may not be a better time to take initiative on an important project. Nevertheless, it might be nearly impossible to follow through on everything you start today. Ride the waves of change with a healthy sense of humor, for the intense energy won't last too long."
libra,2013-11-03,"You are not saying everything you know today, but whatever secrets you keep to yourself may actually be more important than what you share. It's critical to increase your awareness by realizing your own core values, including the obvious issues of money, love and power. Today's Scorpio New Moon Eclipse falls in your 2nd House of Personal Resources, possibly making you feel less confident about your financial issues. Pushing through your resistance is not about denying real concerns; it's about facing them head-on."
scorpio,2013-11-03,"You can do nearly anything now if you set your mind to it as today's New Moon Eclipse empowers your emotionally intense sign. It's as if you are carrying a secret vial of superpowers, but you must use the potion carefully or you'll create more problems than you solve. There's nothing wrong with trying to save the world, but acknowledging your limits today can save you from disappointment tomorrow."
sagittarius,2013-11-03,"You might miss an opportunity to make a meaningful connection with someone close to you in your desire to demonstrate your competence to the world. You seem to be emotionally present and living in the moment, but no one really knows for sure as today's Scorpio Solar Eclipse occurs in your 12th House of Secrets. Deep soul-searching might reveal that you are not yet ready to share your vulnerability with anyone else. Don't push it; you will know when the time is right."
capricorn,2013-11-03,"Shine your awareness onto the outer world now, as you are quite skillful engaging in the social scenes unfolding around you. But your ideas may be more fixed than anyone realizes, and you really don't want to change your plans with the Scorpio New Moon Eclipse landing in your 11th House of Goals. You can engage others with calculated precision as if you are playing a game of chess. Trust your intuition; you know exactly what moves to make. Keep your eyes on your goals; your single-mindedness might just bring you the treasures you seek."
aquarius,2013-11-03,"Your career goals are more important than anything else now that the Scorpio Solar Eclipse emphasizes your 10th House of Public Responsibility. Your ability to control your emotions can create a magnetism that could have people eating out of your hand. But this isn't about manipulating anyone else. Instead, it's about using your powers of persuasion carefully so others will line up to be on your team. Integrate your altruistic intentions with decisive action for the best results."
pisces,2013-11-03,"Successfully planning for your future requires that you have a good map showing the lay of the land. But sometimes it's quite challenging for you Fish to get your bearings, especially now that the mysterious Scorpio New Moon is being eclipsed in your 9th House of Journeys. Nevertheless, you should land safely at your desired destination just in time, as long as you continue to visualize your arrival. Take an extra step and make an itinerary for the months ahead so you can stay on track as you move toward fulfilling your dreams."
aries,2013-11-04,"You have entered a mysterious passageway that leads to unfamiliar territory, a place where reason doesn't always give you the practical answers you seek. However, it's time to push forward with your agenda anyway, even if you don't yet fully understand the deeper meaning of current events. Operating on faith works for a while as long as you take the time to integrate your emotions with your thoughts. Exploring the unknown reaps rich rewards."
taurus,2013-11-04,"You may have to work closely with others today, even if you prefer to be on your own. You can't simply withdraw because it seems as if everyone wants you involved with what they are doing. Even if relationships aren't easy now, they have a lot to teach you. Express your feelings and then stick with the process. If the dynamics become uncomfortable, just remember the situation is temporary and the energy will shift soon enough. Lead with your heart and the rest will follow."
gemini,2013-11-04,"Someone may bring good news today, yet there's more to it than first meets the eye. A discussion with the messenger can grow more complex if you have the courage to delve into a serious conversation. It's tempting to avoid an intense interaction, but you're better off knowing what's happening beneath the surface before you become more involved. Narrowing your focus offers more benefits than just accepting whatever comes your way. Your power of discrimination can save the day."
cancer,2013-11-04,Memories flood your mind and put you in touch with previously forgotten feelings that can rush back into your awareness today. It may be challenging to concentrate on meeting your current responsibilities since old desires are reawakening and you can't get them out of your head. Don't worry if your chores slip a bit; take advantage of the potential opportunity for personal growth while the positive energy is present. Remembering your past helps you envision the future.
leo,2013-11-04,"You may be at the top of your game now, eager to say yes to anything that sounds like fun. Nevertheless, you hesitate to jump in because you don't want to waste your energy on something that's unimportant in the long run. There's no need to hide behind a song and dance today; express your concerns kindly without worrying about the reactions of others. Weigh your options and make your best choice."
virgo,2013-11-04,"Spending time at home sounds like a good idea, but you may have to go in to work anyway. In fact, you might have many things to do now that require you to head out into the world. Keep in mind that your words can make all the difference between success and failure, so don't complain about your professional obligations or social commitments. Instead, be as positive as possible when talking about your plans today and then try to manifest what's most important to you throughout the day."
libra,2013-11-04,"Big ideas about your goals could set you up for frustration today when things don't end up quite as perfect as you imagined. Nevertheless, you may still accomplish a lot and your current productivity helps to improve your self-esteem. Don't waste time comparing yourself to some unobtainable ideal. Instead of thinking about what you didn't do, focus on what you can make happen in the present moment."
scorpio,2013-11-04,"You may be very confident about your financial situation now that the Moon is visiting your 2nd House of Money. Luckily, the Sun in your sign blesses you with vitality, enabling you to take on more projects than ever. But this high level of intensity can also bring anger to the surface, so find ways to burn off your unexpressed feelings or you might attract needless conflicts about things that ultimately don't matter."
sagittarius,2013-11-04,"You may feel very energetic now that the Moon returns to your sign for a couple of days. But you might also sense an incoming wave of uncertainty as signals from your subconscious mind overflow into your awareness. You could attempt to ignore these premonitions, but they are too distracting and convincing today. Even if you don't know where these currents are taking you, it's futile to fight against them. Save your energy for the specific issues that could arise instead of simply shadowboxing with your own fears."
capricorn,2013-11-04,"Your suppressed negativity could leak to the surface today, yet you may not understand why until you realize that there are serious questions that still need answers. It's not that you are overly pessimistic, but you can't help but notice problems that others easily overlook. Remember, you can be very successful, even if a few details are left hanging, so let go of your concerns and allow your confidence to build."
aquarius,2013-11-04,"You're quite likely to succeed now, partly because you're unwilling to take no for an answer. You can hold firm to a goal, even if you encounter severe resistance along the way. Other people may be surprised by your tenacity these days, but don't let their reactions sway you from your objectives. Fix your attention onto your destination and push steadily in that direction no matter what."
pisces,2013-11-04,"You are using a wide-angle lens to perceive reality today and your scope of understanding is still growing because of all the planetary energy buzzing around your 9th House of Big Ideas. Others will naturally come to you for advice because you can see farther into the distance. Be careful; there may be two possible paths and as soon as you favor one, you'll encounter resistance from those who are leaning the other way. Stay in the middle as long as possible and avoid making a choice until the last possible moment."
aries,2013-11-05,"Your emotions are flying all over the place today as the evocative Moon's visit to exuberant Sagittarius accentuates your impulsive reactions to whatever is happening. However, your moods are inconsistent now and others could tire of your changing needs. Don't push your luck. You might just get what you want if you know when to quit. But if you expect too much, you may be left unsatisfied. Ultimately, the choice is yours."
taurus,2013-11-05,"You may be more concerned with fulfilling obligations to others than enjoying yourself today. Your key planet Venus enters dutiful Capricorn, requiring you to set aside your desires for immediate pleasure. Fortunately, it's easy to postpone gratification if you believe that waiting will increase your overall stability. Make your decisions carefully now; the more time you spend considering your options, the better the outcome."
gemini,2013-11-05,"You don't want to do what everyone currently expects of you, but this isn't an ideal time to express your true feelings and rebel against the status quo. You might think you can just skip an activity that you prefer to avoid now, but your retreat won't go unnoticed and could create unnecessary ripples. Save your great escape for another day; just be responsible and hold up your end of the bargain today if you want others to do the same."
cancer,2013-11-05,"Your resistance may be futile as you're dragged out of your shell today no matter what you do. Although you're tempted to go to great lengths in order to protect yourself from being judged, you're better off softening your defenses and interacting lovingly with your friends and family. Keeping things real is more important now than avoiding your emotions just because they are inconvenient or scary. Open your heart and let love in."
leo,2013-11-05,"Your inspirational perspective is contagious today and your positive attitude is appreciated by your coworkers. Nevertheless, there is a mysterious brew of complex emotions in your world that could compete with one another. Don't be too quick to choose sides now or your rigidity will only add to the chaos. Make a choice if you must, but avoid attaching yourself to a specific outcome. Ultimately, happiness comes from within."
virgo,2013-11-05,"Steering clear of authorities might be the key to making this quite a memorable day. However, you could inadvertently say or do the wrong thing, thus provoking an unnecessary battle for control. If you are sincere in your intentions, you should be able to avoid getting into trouble with someone who is in charge. Forget about showing everyone how powerful you are today; instead simply focus on creating harmony."
libra,2013-11-05,"Apparently you're not in control now, even if you thought you were running the show. The fact is that someone else may be the real authority, even if he or she isn't around to oversee things. Nevertheless, it's up to you to take charge of your own life. Thankfully, self-discipline is easier for you when your key planet Venus is moving through calculating Capricorn. Carefully observe what's happening, but don't try to alter the dynamics."
scorpio,2013-11-05,"You know that you can do everything that's required of you today, even if your confidence is waning a bit. Ultimately, you come through for one good reason: you know that someone is counting on you. You're highly motivated to push up against your limits and exceed everyone's expectations. Go ahead and show others exactly what you can do, but don't judge anyone else too harshly just because you are accomplishing so much."
sagittarius,2013-11-05,"Managing your self-esteem may be a real challenge for you these days. Luckily, there are some fairly straightforward things you can do to keep yourself on the right track now and eliminating unnecessary activities should be at the very top of your list. It's far better to have fewer tasks to do and more time to get them done. Be smart and create realistic goals to set yourself up for success."
capricorn,2013-11-05,"Although you could have your fair share of impulsive moments today, nothing is gained by letting your need for instant gratification run away with your day. Responsibilities are weighing heavily on your shoulders and as much as you can support the weight, you're also watching for quick escapes throughout the day. Your commitment to doing the right thing grows stronger now that sweet Venus is visiting your practical sign. Thankfully, taking the higher road is enough to get you through these days without creating unnecessary trouble."
aquarius,2013-11-05,"You don't want to be seen as the responsible one today. And although you would prefer just being part of the crowd, you might begrudgingly take the lead so you can make sure that everyone has as good a day as possible. You are quite deliberate in your overall approach now, even if you appear to be footloose and fancy-free. Pay attention to how you are being perceived because your strategy could backfire if it looks like you aren't being serious enough."
pisces,2013-11-05,"The idea of being a member of a larger group is quite appealing to you now that resourceful Venus is entering your 11th House of Friends. You seek stability and meaning from your interactions with others, but your need to express your own beliefs could create problems with those who disagree with you. Minimize conflict by temporarily downplaying your personal proclivities. Make today about team spirit and not your individual needs."
aries,2013-11-06,"Your natural inclination is to race through a task so you can hurry on to the next one. But today you can appreciate the benefits of slowing down and sticking with a job all the way through to completion. Accept any delays as a part of the process and stay focused on the project at hand, even if you wish you were doing something else. Your persistence will be rewarded sooner than you think."
taurus,2013-11-06,"If you're not willing to take responsibility for your behavior today, someone else could do it for you -- but at a price. If others do come down heavily on you now, your first impulse may be to blame them for complicating your life. Even if they just want to help, it's difficult to respond positively to their criticism. Nevertheless, you still might not be able to avoid the fact that you need to change your ways. Your willingness to learn a necessary lesson alleviates the pressure and improves the dynamics."
gemini,2013-11-06,"Although you have obligations that demand your attention today, it's not necessary (or even wise) to forego all pleasure. In fact, making a bit of time for structured play -- like going outside for recess when you were a child at school -- might be exactly what you need to be more productive. But don't just take off when you feel like it; instead, create a schedule and stick to it for the best results. Balancing work and play is key."
cancer,2013-11-06,"It's relatively easy to keep your thoughts to yourself today. Even if you have a very definite opinion, it may be nearly impossible to talk casually about your current plans. If you end up sharing what's on your mind with someone else, you still might feel misunderstood. There's no reason to question your own point of view just because others don't understand your perspective. Trust your common sense; it won't steer you wrong now."
leo,2013-11-06,"You might find yourself drifting down Memory Lane today, thinking about how a previous failure could negatively impact your current life. Your nostalgia can remind you of how you fall short of your own lofty expectations, turning a minor setback into a more serious one. Thankfully, you are not a slave to your past. Rather than letting old fears limit your choices, move beyond your personal history and do something brilliant. There is no one to stop you but yourself."
virgo,2013-11-06,"Don't be satisfied with maintaining a comfortable distance between you and an acquaintance today. Bringing up a sensitive topic can transform a casual friendship into something more meaningful. Today's Sun-Saturn conjunction occurs in your 3rd House of Communication, making this an ideal time to tackle a difficult issue. Remember, following frivolous desires only distracts you with trivial information, so pick a subject that is practical enough to improve your relationship in a positive and lasting manner."
libra,2013-11-06,"Sometimes you find it challenging to make a final decision because you naturally see the pros and cons to each and every possibility. However, you can narrow your field of vision today, enabling you to focus your intentions on whatever you decide is most important. Concentrate your energy on accomplishing a task that makes you feel good about your work. If you start to think about something you did wrong in the past, consciously switch your attention to what you can do right in the present."
scorpio,2013-11-06,"Reality may have an obstacle or two to place in your way now, as the Sun joins Saturn in your magnetic sign. Consider the extraordinary pressures you have encountered since Saturn entered Scorpio last year to determine what lessons you can learn from this hard-nosed planet. Awareness is crucial; fortunately, understanding your role in what's currently happening empowers you to push through to the other side and plant the seed to create something significant."
sagittarius,2013-11-06,"You could exhaust yourself as you vacillate between overly optimistic thinking and an accurate analysis of the facts -- especially if you can't tell which is which. You might overcompensate by acting as if you know more than you actually do. Instead of pretending you have all the answers, just ask for help. Usually, you are the one cheering others on, but now it's your turn to lean on someone else for a change."
capricorn,2013-11-06,"You are more realistic than ever as you make plans for your future because the Sun is forming its annual conjunction with your key planet Saturn. However, as the energy crystallizes in your 11th House of Long-Term Goals, Saturn can also bend your thoughts toward negative thinking. Don't give up; fortunately, your critical analysis enables you to make improvements to a current project if you're willing to act on your conclusions with a positive attitude."
aquarius,2013-11-06,"If you experience trouble at work today, don't simply assume that you did something wrong. Instead, look at the resistance you face as a lesson from the universe. Even if your original attempt was not met with much enthusiasm, you have an opportunity now to improve on what you did and then try again. Don't give up on your goal; instead, work even harder to prove that you deserve it."
pisces,2013-11-06,"Setting a goal can mean serious business today, because you won't be able to easily change your mind once you make a decision. Whether you are considering a new residence, job or school, it's crucial to take your time and think through all your options before choosing what to do next. But merely knowing that you're capable isn't enough. You must resolutely overcome your own inertia and take action, however small it may seem."
aries,2013-11-07,"Take your time before expressing your feelings today or you may have to clean up a mess of your own creation. It's not that you shouldn't speak the truth; it's actually required. But be smart and choose your words carefully. There's no need to stir a hornets' nest now, unless you want to spend time soothing your stings later on. It's less about what you say than how you say it. Delivering your message with kindness is your best move."
taurus,2013-11-07,"Tread carefully because your emotions are a bit slippery today and you might not fully understand what you are feeling. You could inadvertently lead someone down the wrong path now because of your own lack of clarity. But don't get upset if this actually happens, since your anger will only blow things further out of proportion. Instead, imagine a comfortable future and respond accordingly. A rational approach will keep you on track."
gemini,2013-11-07,"Although you stand to gain a lot through meditation or prayer today, it may be difficult to learn how to find peace within if you haven't already developed a spiritual practice. You might feel way too restless to hold still for long, making it tough to receive much benefit from any sort of contemplation. In any event, remind yourself to slow down. Life is not as confusing or as complex as it seems."
cancer,2013-11-07,"Your feelings will come out into the open sooner or later, so you might as well bring up your hidden issues now. Maybe you shut down because you weren't sure how someone else would react. However, today it may not matter. Find a way to let some of your pent-up emotions flow past your protective shell. You could be pleasantly surprised at the response you receive, and by how much relief you feel about pushing through your own resistance to the truth."
leo,2013-11-07,"Letting off a bit of excess steam is a sensible strategy today, but find a way to do it gently. Hold the biggest issues in check for a while longer so you don't lose your cool. Staying in touch with your own dreams enables you to maintain a clearer perspective on those things that seem bent out of shape. Even if you allow your imagination to run wild, say as little as possible. It's more important to get the ball rolling and to establish a sustainable pace than it is to tell your whole story now."
virgo,2013-11-07,"Your ideas could be beyond brilliant today, but there's also a bit of room now for self-deception. It's tricky to ride your thoughts to their conclusions, because new ones float into awareness before the old ones are completed. Cutting back on caffeine is helpful as long as you also focus your mind on the practical issues that are right in front of you. It's tempting to drift off into your dreams, but it's more important now to keep your feet planted firmly on the ground."
libra,2013-11-07,"Integrating your fantasy life with the real world today adds stress to your day. It's challenging enough to keep up with your dreams by yourself now, and trying to bring others along on your ride seems nearly impossible. Instead of complicating your inner process by involving anyone else, concentrate on expressing yourself creatively. Thankfully, you can burn off some of your excess mental energy by having fun, especially if you make life more beautiful in the process."
scorpio,2013-11-07,"You might feel as if you're on an emotional seesaw today, but if you think of it as a joyride you should be able to find pleasure in your ever-changing moods. Don't try to force your experience up into your brain for logical analysis; you're better off by staying in touch with your world intuitively now. Remember the images that pop into your awareness and spend time reflecting on their possible meanings, for they hold important keys to your future."
sagittarius,2013-11-07,"You're on the edge of something big, but you might not be able to figure out exactly what it is yet. Your past and future are colliding and it feels as if the present moment should be more definable than it is. You naturally seek excitement and adventure, but today may leave you unsatisfied with a series of unreachable fantasies bouncing around in your head. Accept your current limitations for what they are and move on when you are ready. Ultimately, the real world is much more interesting than your dreams."
capricorn,2013-11-07,"The solid ground that you believed was beneath your feet has apparently gone soft, making it harder to accomplish as much as you want. Things that should be stable are disintegrating right before your eyes. Fortunately, this can be a magical and creative time if you have faith in yourself and in the universe. Access your superpowers and use your imagination to sail right past the very same obstacles that were recently in your way."
aquarius,2013-11-07,"Your nervous system may be gently rebelling as visions come and go too quickly to fully grasp. Although you thought that you were grounded, you're not completely in control, so don't try to stop your brilliant ideas from cycling in and out of consciousness. It's not necessary to understand everything that crosses your mind now. Just enjoy the images and let them distract you for a while. They will begin to settle down later in the day and your restlessness will subside."
pisces,2013-11-07,"Following through with all your commitments today can be tricky as dreamy Neptune in your sign is captivated by romantic Venus' magical charms. However, you might feel jumpy as the littlest things set off uncontrollable cascading reactions within your mind. Even if you aren't sure where your thoughts are taking you, don't let the uncertainty slow you down too much. Keep the energy moving and have faith; you'll know more about your destination soon enough."
aries,2013-11-08,"You are poised to catch the wind to points unknown today, but at least you can tell which way the breezes are blowing. Nevertheless, once you're soaring, you might discover that the currents aren't quite as stable as you first assumed. But coming down isn't as straightforward as getting airborne. Relax and enjoy the ride, even if you no longer have a clue as to where you are going."
taurus,2013-11-08,"Although your well-known determination may not be enough to guarantee your success, you still have high hopes for reaching your goals today. Rather than relentlessly pushing toward a singular destination, pay attention to what's being revealed by the changing circumstances. Remember, it's more important to remain light on your feet and willing to switch direction on a moment's notice than to doggedly drive toward an objective that no longer makes sense."
gemini,2013-11-08,"Another person's idealistic approach could open your mind to a whole new way of looking at things today. Fortunately, you are very receptive to what is being said and something you discover now can have a lasting impact on your life. It's like you are being supplied with a missing piece of data that enables everything to fit into place. Although you are learning about the truth, spending a few more days gaining perspective might just prevent you from jumping into a situation you don't yet fully understand."
cancer,2013-11-08,"The hold that someone has over you is reinforced today by the authoritative Capricorn Moon's visit to your 7th House of Partners. But events can take interesting twists and turns, shifting the center of power from others to you. Nevertheless, tread carefully; being in control isn't as great as it appears to be. If possible, find a supportive copilot so you don't have to do all the work on your own. Sharing responsibilities lightens the load and increases the joy for everyone involved."
leo,2013-11-08,"You may have many wonderful ideas today, but they aren't necessarily very practical ones. Your irrepressible idealism is the driving force behind your current creativity now, but it could also lead you astray. This isn't the time for idle daydreaming. You must take action, even if you're not yet sure of your goals. Trust your instincts and have faith that you're heading in the right direction."
virgo,2013-11-08,"Establishing objectives in your personal life now is as important as creating them within your career. If you don't have any specific goals, you'll just flounder around aimlessly without direction. Don't be a casualty of your potential professional success; your life will be more meaningful if you can find a healthy balance between your job and your family. One cannot live on bread alone."
libra,2013-11-08,"The overall spiritual buzz today is kind of cool, but it can be tiring to keep your mind on the more ethereal side of life. The Moon's evening entry into conceptual Aquarius feels like a breath of fresh air, but you can't help but think that something strange is going on. Don't succumb to self-doubt when wondering if your perceptions of the dream world are actually valid. Just live your life knowing that your visions are as real as you allow them to be. Believe in something with all your heart and it might just come true."
scorpio,2013-11-08,"You could have big plans involving your friends today. Maybe you are considering a trip or making final arrangements for a social gathering. But there are subtle influences now that can make your choices more complicated, especially if you don't fully understand how all the pieces fit together. Take your time and get everyone's opinion first; the need to hurry is more arbitrary than you realize."
sagittarius,2013-11-08,"You appear to be straightforward in your actions and true to your words yet there's still more going on today than reaches the surface. Your friends may jump to erroneous conclusions, but their false assumptions are easy to fix once they are out in the open. However, problems might arise if something is left unsaid. A bit of honest feedback on your part can help, but don't belabor your point. Share your advice and move on."
capricorn,2013-11-08,If you are keeping a secret you may make a big fuss about something unimportant now just to distract everyone's attention from lingering on the real deal. But you can only play the shell game for so long because it drains too much of your psychic energy. Consider what emotions might be stirred by sharing your vulnerability. Don't just blurt out your truth without having a sensible strategy that leads to healthy closure. Finding the right person to trust is your key to success.
aquarius,2013-11-08,"You are probably quite social today, yet your interactions with others could take you in a totally unexpected direction. However, you don't want to let go of your personal goals. Ironically, the more it appears that you are in control, the greater the gap between your expectations and reality. Trusting in the process is always a smart idea, but it will require focus and follow-through to make your dreams come true."
pisces,2013-11-08,Your actions at work have been pretty transparent recently because your objectives are clear and you're determined to get what you want. But the Moon's shift into your 12th House of Invisibility today increases the level of complexity to what you're doing. Be careful; sending mixed signals can become a hazard if there's something that you're trying to hide. It's safer to be honest and let others know what's on your mind.
aries,2013-11-09,"You are in the driver's seat now because you know the full consequences of what you are doing. You recently had the opportunity to consider all your options before choosing your present course of action. The potential rewards may be quite satisfying, although it could take more time than you think for your labors to bear fruit. Setting a sustainable pace today is more important than your actual production, so keep your eyes on the future and your shoulder to the wheel."
taurus,2013-11-09,"You're not interested in anything superficial now because you want to see tangible results from your extra effort. Unfortunately, confusion can catch you off guard today if the distance between your optimism and reality is too much. Adopt a logical and balanced approach and pay attention to the details. There is great potential for success if you maintain a positive attitude and keep your common sense close at hand."
gemini,2013-11-09,"Whatever you say today could be less important than your actions. Your behavior not only speaks louder than your words, it also has longer lasting consequences. Nevertheless, you have a significant opportunity now, but it might not be obvious at first. No matter what happens, be creative as you tell your story. Dream out loud and share what's on your mind. You may be pleasantly surprised with the wonderful response you receive."
cancer,2013-11-09,"You have an interesting choice to make today as your plans come up for reconsideration. It would be easier if you were the only person involved, but someone else's needs must also be included. Opening your mind to reexamine your goals from a wider perspective can be very enlightening as you see possibilities that you previously overlooked. Don't say no too quickly to anything that comes your way or you could miss a wonderful opportunity to further develop your evolving life strategy."
leo,2013-11-09,"There is so much happening that it tests your ability to remain calm and it might be somewhat disconcerting now as you try to keep it all together. Harmonious aspects conspire to clear the path toward your destination, but doing the work is still, ultimately, your responsibility. Your schedule is so full that you may consider sleeping less just to squeeze everything in. Things will slow down in a few days, but in the meantime, make sure you get some much-needed rest."
virgo,2013-11-09,"Someone at work may be acting overly sweet toward you today and you might not know what to do about it. Your uncertainty could stem from an overall lack of clarity about what you want. Or maybe the other person's intentions are questionable. Either way, your smartest strategy is to explore all avenues before deciding your course of action. Luckily, your reasoning is sound now, even if the options are confusing at first. Once you've considered the pros and cons, make your choice and stick to it."
libra,2013-11-09,"It's hard to feel satisfied with just having a nice experience today; you crave something that goes beyond the ordinary. Even if you finish your work early, you still won't be able to fully enjoy yourself. However, you are currently blessed with the patience to wait for the right moment and the drive to follow through on your plan. Once you know that the timing is right, don't hesitate to make your move. If your intentions are clear, your mind can turn your fantasies into reality."
scorpio,2013-11-09,"Your creative juices are flowing and it's wise to find ways to concentrate on your self-expression. But this kind of sharing isn't just about personal issues; it's time to set new goals and then pursue them. Yet, even if you are overcommitted, you can still do what needs to be done. There is major assistance coming your way from the hidden realms of your own subconscious world. The spiritual growth and psychological work you have done in the recent past may be put to good use in the present."
sagittarius,2013-11-09,"Unfortunately, you may be doing more armchair traveling today than real trekking around the globe. However, as your vision expands, you might miss important details or gloss over data that you don't have time to integrate. Luckily, you could make a lot of progress now by saving money for a future trip. Remember that sometimes the planning stage of a getaway can be nearly as much fun as the real thing; take your time and enjoy the anticipation while it lasts."
capricorn,2013-11-09,"Although you might be uncharacteristically laid-back at work today, you still need to juggle your personal and business worlds while keeping the two of them apart. But don't miss the powerful opportunity to make something special happen, since you have the right balance between intention and follow-through now, enabling you to accomplish whatever you initially set out to do. Make sure that you have your facts straight, but don't get too hung up in the details. Share your vision as you let your inner poet or philosopher out of the closet."
aquarius,2013-11-09,"You may be inclined to spend money on something you don't really need today. Buying a gift for yourself is a lovely thing to do, but you might be drawn toward purchasing an item that is more extravagant than you can afford. Ask yourself whether or not your potential purchase is really such a good idea before you face possible regrets in a few days. Ironically, exercising a bit of self-restraint works to your advantage in the long run."
pisces,2013-11-09,"Although it's wonderful to fuel your life with your dreams, don't let it be an excuse to be completely unrealistic. It's as if you must maintain a double existence now. You have your head up in the clouds, but need to keep your feet firmly planted on the ground since it's tempting to escape to another world. However, you still must pay careful attention to the process or your best ideas will only get lost. Thankfully, you can go anywhere your imagination carries you while riding this powerful spiritual wave."
aries,2013-11-10,"You have been engaged recently in some pretty serious thinking about your life whether or not anyone else realizes it. It's not that your search for deeper meaning is over today, but it is now time to shift gears and turn your philosophical search into something more practical. Knowing the truth is a great start, but can lose its value quickly unless you apply your wisdom in ways that matter."
taurus,2013-11-10,"Relationships might exhibit a fated quality these days as circumstances take on a life of their own. However, maintaining control over others is not a viable strategy, since you won't be able to stop the inevitable anyway. Instead of struggling to cling to your agenda, embrace the coming changes; they can bring you more exciting opportunities than you currently realize. Trust the process and let go."
gemini,2013-11-10,"There really isn't a graceful way to escape the work that needs to be done now, so save your sweet talking and tap dancing for another day. Your clever charm is not going to serve you well today, even if you're feeling extra witty. Actions speak louder than words. The sooner you start your chores, the more time you'll have later to kick back and enjoy yourself."
cancer,2013-11-10,"Responsibilities may prevent you from having too much fun today, even if your idea of relaxation is to just hang out at home with a loved one. You know what you want, but could run into unexpected obstacles. If your satisfaction is delayed, don't waste precious energy fretting. Channel your energy wisely for the best results. Rest assured that you'll get your just rewards soon enough."
leo,2013-11-10,"You might not say everything you feel today because you're exploring recent private moments that could have unresolved issues attached to them. Allow yourself the luxury of dredging up old memories without having to rewrite history just so you can fix what went wrong. You will soon be involved with new and pleasurable experiences, so just let your mind meander down Memory Lane while you can. A sentimental journey could do you a world of good."
virgo,2013-11-10,"Separating the useful information from all the superfluous data is uncharacteristically difficult now. Every little item seems important, but there's just too much of it to make sense. Nevertheless, sift through what you know, even if it's a struggle, and set aside everything but the most essential facts. Rely on the basics and you'll be able to make the best choices for your future."
libra,2013-11-10,"If you have been procrastinating about any financial matters, today might be your last chance for a while to take care of unfinished business. You are being drawn into other pressing issues that are developing now as Mercury moves direct in your 2nd House of Possessions. Don't wait; you may not have a lot of time to go back and redo what should have already been done. The sooner you finish, the better you'll feel."
scorpio,2013-11-10,"Your intense communication style might be more than others prefer now, but they may just have to take you just as you are. You're not in a negotiating mood because you realize that your perceptions are even more acute than usual. Don't back down if you believe that your conclusions are sound. Nevertheless, remember that applying gentle persuasion will still work better than issuing ultimatums. A spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down."
sagittarius,2013-11-10,"Although things are looking up, you still may have serious business to take care of today. Stay focused on your long-term goals now and don't let your frustration get the best of you. The next few days mark a turning point as your subconscious mind sends you powerful messages about your future. Steady persistence is more important now than unbridled enthusiasm. Dig deep and give it all you got."
capricorn,2013-11-10,Your contemplative attitude feels more comfortable today to you than it might to anyone else. Your cautiously reserved behavior brings up issues for someone who wants you to act in a more happy-go-lucky manner. But it won't help if you wear a smile just to please other people. You can't go wrong if you stick with what your instincts tell you now. Your authenticity is your greatest asset.
aquarius,2013-11-10,"Your passionate words may have more impact today than you expect. However, you're not even sure that you fully believe what you said just a few minutes ago. You aren't purposefully misleading anyone; it's just that your logical conclusions are not supported by what you feel in your heart now. Nevertheless, you know you must speak the truth as you experience it in the moment, for maintaining your integrity is what matters most."
pisces,2013-11-10,"Your x-ray vision allows you to see right through any sort of cover-up today, but the question is what do you do with the information you possess? The answer can be found in your attitude. It won't work if you try to show someone what you think they need to know. If, on the other hand, you offer a different perspective without declaring that it is the only path to follow, then you can help people by expanding their options. Sharing your knowledge freely inspires others to do the same."
aries,2013-11-11,"It doesn't take much to persuade you that all is well in the realm of relationships today; you could even convince yourself without trying at all. Unfortunately, you might attempt to avoid the facts if you realize how complex the issues are that need resolution now. There's nothing wrong with recognizing the unrealized potential in people, but don't substitute it for the truth that's right in front of you. Better to be safe than sorry when it comes to your heart."
taurus,2013-11-11,"Your emotions rise into awareness today, but you can't seem to put your feelings into words. You wish your life was simpler, yet your personal desires can still turn everything upside down. Even if you think you're being clear, someone still might misinterpret your intentions. Don't assume that anyone understands what you mean. Take time to confirm that your message is received in the manner you meant."
gemini,2013-11-11,"Today is perfect for daydreaming your time away, but it's probably not so great for delivering a comprehensible message. Your imagination is working overtime now, which can be delightful if you don't try to apply your current thoughts to practical reality. Wait a few days until the transits to ethereal Neptune pass if you have something really important to say. Enjoy the view while your creative muse takes you on a magic carpet ride."
cancer,2013-11-11,"You might want to take the day off because you are remembering everything you want to do that's not connected with work. Although you are able to envision your ideal day, one thing or another prevents you from actually having it. Instead of worrying about what you are unable to do, be grateful for what you can accomplish. Improving your attitude inspires you to make the most of what you have."
leo,2013-11-11,"You may believe you're in a dream where everything is just about as perfect as you can imagine. Unfortunately, once you open your eyes you might see that your life is far from ideal. Naturally, you're tempted to indulge your pleasant fantasies, but avoiding reality isn't a luxury you can afford now. Instead of mind-tripping to a faraway place, concentrate on your home base where you could actually make a positive difference."
virgo,2013-11-11,"You can't easily let go of your preconceived notions of what's in store for you next. Reality is a bit more elusive now as your key planet Mercury continues its communication dance with psychic Neptune. Nevertheless, you don't have any way to validate your current choices. It's better to let a few minor decisions slide, knowing you can return to them and clean things up later in the week. Relax and give yourself permission to wander in your dreams."
libra,2013-11-11,"You desperately want to complete old business today so you can establish a new routine. On the other hand, this could be a great play day, making it hard to accomplish much at all. This internal conflict may be emotionally discomforting, so do whatever makes sense to gain a calmer frame of mind. Nevertheless, the Moon's visit to your 6th House of Self-Improvement indicates that you would be wise to focus on fine-tuning your efforts instead of frivolously wasting a potentially productive day."
scorpio,2013-11-11,"You might feel stuck and you're ready to take a calculated risk today, even if only to stir things up a bit. But attempting to make changes without a concrete plan could be more confusing than exciting. Imagine the best possible outcome and then create a strategy to manifest it. If you can fill in the details in your mind, then you are more likely to make your dreams come true."
sagittarius,2013-11-11,"You may have so many obligations today that you don't feel like doing much of anything. You're more likely to rebel against the entire system of current responsibilities if you feel overwhelmed. Unfortunately, your strategic skills might not be functioning at their best now, which means it won't be as easy to change the rules as you think. Don't become discouraged if your plans don't work as expected; give it a rest and then try again."
capricorn,2013-11-11,"It's quite unnerving if you feel disoriented today because you Goats naturally like to have your feet planted solidly on the ground. You could waste a lot of time and energy trying to regain your footing, but a little uncertainty can also lead to a healthy experience. You have much to gain by questioning your assumptions about your life and your path ahead. Don't worry about making any final decisions now; rest assured that it's not yet necessary to know your next step. Take a deep breath and trust in the process."
aquarius,2013-11-11,"Your dreams appear to be so close today that you mistakenly believe you could reach out and touch them as if they are real. Naturally, it's helpful if you can trust your intuition because currently you're more in tune with the symbolic realm that informs your thoughts than you are with the basic facts. Don't bother seeking rational explanations now, just act on your hunches. Make additional adjustments in a few days when your thinking is more aligned with reality."
pisces,2013-11-11,"Although you might try to act in a rational manner today, your common sense continues to grow more and more elusive. Thankfully, this confusion can be used to your advantage, as long as you don't make any significant life-changing decisions now. Declare this day to be your own personal spiritual holiday and give yourself permission to stay connected with the mysteries within."
aries,2013-11-12,"The results of your recent efforts may bring rewards today, but probably not in the obvious ways you expect. You're able to enjoy life more now, basking in the awareness of a job well done. But don't allow your unrestrained optimism lead to laziness, for you could falsely believe that you deserve time to relax. However, this assumption could end up encouraging counterproductive behavior; don't let your regular responsibilities slip just because you're feeling good."
taurus,2013-11-12,"Your mind can conceptualize new ideas quite easily now because you're eager to broaden your horizons. Sometimes you're satisfied with maintaining the status quo, but today you're so confident that you want to step beyond your regular routine and experience life to the fullest. However, this isn't about setting aside your basic philosophical approach to living; rather, it's a wonderful opportunity to build on the foundation of what you already know."
gemini,2013-11-12,"Sometimes steady growth feels restraining because you want to move at your own pace, which can be faster than everyone else's. However, the Sun's trine to jovial Jupiter in your 2nd House of Income allows you to obtain much-needed support from your boss and your workmates as you bolt ahead of the pack. There isn't any reason to slow down now; explore new territory without worrying about the usual resistance."
cancer,2013-11-12,"New ideas are flowing into your imagination now, but you must be ready to receive them. You may already be in touch with a variety of alternative plans, but the Sun's trine to philosophical Jupiter in your sign today can blast the doors of awareness open. Thankfully, the current growth spurt shouldn't feel like hard work or cause you any stress. Opportunities to expand your thinking and widen your horizons are more fun than you might expect."
leo,2013-11-12,"An emotional breakthrough is possible today if you're willing to examine your feelings from a broader perspective before the coming changes impact your relationships. Letting go of fixed ideas isn't easy, but today's Sun-Jupiter trine may seem like a free ticket to the destination of your choice. Nevertheless, it is up to you to use it. Take a risk or you might stay stuck in your current situation, wishing that you didn't let the opportunity pass you by. Think big and then follow through with confidence and persistence."
virgo,2013-11-12,"Your relationships feed your creativity now, especially if you listen closely to others as they share their ideas. However, inspiration doesn't just happen on its own. You have to put on your thinking cap and be diligent about maximizing your current cleverness potential. Once you start something, stick with it, even if your certainty lags. You are closer to success than you realize."
libra,2013-11-12,"You may be surprised by all the wonderful support you receive at work today. Assistance arrives in funny ways, yet you could miss it if you are looking too hard in a different direction. Nevertheless, you have a great opportunity now to improve the quality of your everyday life if you can get past your own resistance to change. The choice is yours; be courageous and let your friends and associates nurture your current growth."
scorpio,2013-11-12,"The importance of having fun cannot be overstated because you're highly creative today if you are enjoying yourself. There's no reason to impose arbitrary limits on what you can do. Even if you don't reach an idealistic goal now, you will still progress further along your path. Extending yourself as much as possible improves your chances of making the most of the current opportunities. Just be sure to find pleasure in whatever you do."
sagittarius,2013-11-12,"Your dreams are a major source of inspiration, yet you need to exercise a bit of caution today. It's easy to get lost in your inner worlds, but your key planet Jupiter is so radiant now that you might not even realize if something is amiss. Fortunately, you have the power to direct your thoughts away from unrealistic fantasies and turn them into profound creative visualizations that can change your life for the better."
capricorn,2013-11-12,"Lean on your friends and associates today by discussing your hopes and dreams with them. But don't be overly concerned about reaching your goals just yet, for optimistic Jupiter's trine to the Sun in your 11th House of Future suggests that immediate success is not what's most important. Instead, use this time to explore your aspirations without necessarily having to justify every thought you share. Ultimately, you will receive the support you need if you trust the process."
aquarius,2013-11-12,"Your hard work may be rewarded by a bigger paycheck or, at least, the promise of a raise. Your 2nd House of Money and your 6th House of Work are being drawn into a cooperative relationship, creating a perfect storm. Luckily, you can benefit from this cosmic blast if you don't push your luck too far; instead, just show up with your best possible attitude and see what happens. You might be pleasantly surprised with the outcome."
pisces,2013-11-12,"Reach a little farther today while the Moon in your sign is harmoniously aligned. The planets are surely working in your favor now; the Sun's harmonious trine to auspicious Jupiter enables you to balance optimism and realism. This cosmic magic encourages you to choose what you want to do next. Nevertheless, you still must be willing to push past whatever stands in the way of achieving your goals. Believe in yourself and the sky is your limit."
aries,2013-11-13,"Your enthusiasm may spell trouble today because the Moon returns to your active sign, inspiring you to take on the world. But it's tricky to find the right amount of intensity because you might push so hard that your plan backfires. On the other hand, you could set yourself up for failure if you don't try at all. Ultimately, you can increase your chances of being happy by scaling back your goals just a little bit and then taking a giant leap of faith."
taurus,2013-11-13,"You might not be able to discover the source of your irritation today as the Moon's presence in your 12th House of Invisibility hides something from view. It feels critical to find out what you're missing, but the most significant information could be elusive to your watchful eye. Instead of pushing for the truth, try accepting what you already know while you wait for the rest to surface. Time spent alone can give you a chance to find the answers within."
gemini,2013-11-13,"You may be offered a professional opportunity today that's too good to turn down. But it's difficult to stay focused at work now with the Moon visiting your 11th House of Friends. There could be an element of surprise when erratic Uranus flips things upside down, making it tricky to know how best to respond. Don't abandon your responsibilities just because a social event sounds so exciting. Instead of planning your escape, show everyone you're up for a challenge by turning a new project into a game and playing for keeps."
cancer,2013-11-13,"There's no reason to wait for marching orders from your boss today. Take a chance and trust your intuition; you probably already know what he or she wants from you. Nevertheless, you must exercise some caution or you might jump to an erroneous conclusion. Don't make your move too quickly because an incorrect assumption could cause you to waste precious time. A more contemplative approach is likely to earn the respect of others and increase your chances for success."
leo,2013-11-13,"Moderating your enthusiasm is no easy task today. Even if you're able to envision exciting adventures ahead, it's possible to take a plan so far that others tire of your outrageous ideas. Talking less and doing more is the smartest way to demonstrate that you are not all hype. Delivering the goods is just as important now as having a positive attitude. Actions speak louder than words."
virgo,2013-11-13,"Your uncharacteristic desire to be different from everyone else today might make your interactions with others more intense than usual. You may become frustrated because you're attracted to someone who seems as if he or she would make a close friend or intimate partner. However, you don't necessarily like the idea of changing just to make the interpersonal dynamics work. Be willing to walk away from a relationship if you cannot be yourself in it. Your integrity matters more than anything else."
libra,2013-11-13,"A friend or coworker might shock you by doing something totally outrageous today. You may be caught off guard by the intensity of the emotions being expressed, but it's wise not to show your surprise or offer any negative judgment now. Instead of being overly reactive, stick to your current position and maintain your balance in spite of the chaos around you. Find your inner center and hold on tight."
scorpio,2013-11-13,"You may be secretly attracted to someone at work today, yet this won't be your typical romance because you want your freedom now as much as you want love and affection. You might not be clear about what you're willing to give up in order to obtain what you desire. Don't struggle too hard as you try to find a comfortable middle ground. It's possible to remain curiously excited without actually acting on your feelings. Wait and see how things develop before making your move."
sagittarius,2013-11-13,"You are tempted to write yourself a permission slip today and then sneak off to play. Although this might sound like a great idea, you need to fulfill your obligations first. Thankfully, you have the ability now to approach your job with an entirely different mindset that enables you to have fun while doing your chores. There's no reason to be frustrated by your desire to escape; instead, express your creativity by exhibiting a high level of enthusiasm all day long."
capricorn,2013-11-13,"You feel like you have too much to do now, especially if you are needed by a close friend or family member. You might think you can postpone your domestic responsibilities because you're so busy at work, but this isn't a wise strategy to pursue. Instead, make your personal commitments top priority while you let your professional obligations slip a little. It will be much easier to fully concentrate on your job tomorrow once you have taken care of those you love today."
aquarius,2013-11-13,"You might want to shake everything up today, but change isn't always the best idea -- especially if your life seems to be working well. It's one thing to try doing a task in a new way because you're searching for more efficient methods. But doing it differently now just because you're bored may not be the smartest strategy. There's no need to fix what's not broken; channel your excess energy toward more productive endeavors and watch what happens."
pisces,2013-11-13,"Lots of new ideas about making money are popping into your head now, but they may not be practical enough to turn them into reality. Nevertheless, you're sure that you can accomplish more if you just work faster. However, your new approach to your job could be unsettling to your coworkers who would rather maintain the status quo. Don't be afraid to rattle some cages by trying something different. You can always go back to your old ways in a few days if it doesn't work out."
aries,2013-11-14,"Your desires may lead you astray today because you want more than you can have. Magnetic Venus tensely squares irrepressible Uranus in your spontaneous sign, making it difficult for you to show self-restraint. You like the excitement of living on the edge, but it's easy to go overboard now. Instead of thinking about personal satisfaction, consider what you could do to stabilize the progress you already made at work. Even a small amount of concentrated effort goes a long way. However, a lot of steady work carries you forward in ways you cannot yet imagine."
taurus,2013-11-14,"The instability of your changing moods might be a lot to manage now. Normally, you're not so erratic; you usually like to contain the energy of a situation by moving at a steady pace. However, now you get to combine an unrelenting desire for excitement with your preference for stability -- a powerful combination to say the least. You have little to lose by succumbing to your emotions. In fact, this can be a break-through moment because those close to you are able to see a vulnerable side that you don't usually show. Open your heart and let love in."
gemini,2013-11-14,"You are known to be light-footed and quick-witted, so it may be out of character to slow down and take life more seriously. Thankfully, you can gain recognition and respect now for your ability to do just that. Don't panic and make your move too soon, even if you're tempted. The freedom of mobility you seek will return in a few days and you'll be able to make the necessary changes more easily. In the meantime, surprise others with your willingness to focus on the present moment."
cancer,2013-11-14,"Too much information is a trap now, and no sensible Crab wants to end up in a steel cage. Find the routines that work for you and stick with them; when they become automatic you can focus on the whole game and not on each separate play. If you're having a difficult time with any one piece, let it be for a while and move on to other things you need to do. Accomplish as much as possible today; your actions will have greater impact after they stack up into a few days of work."
leo,2013-11-14,"You may become your own worst enemy when your need for attention gets the best of you. If things are going your way now, you can become so attuned to the present moment that you're unconscious about how everyone perceives you. A little humility goes a long way; your friends and family will love you even more if you don't try so hard to hoard the spotlight. Shining the light on others makes you the hero in the long run."
virgo,2013-11-14,"You are motivated by repressed emotions that may come close enough to the surface now to impact your outer world. You can usually differentiate between objective truths and subjective desires, but today it's not so easy. Accept the rumblings of your feelings as messages from your intuitive side. The irrational information you receive in this manner might be more valuable than all the facts put together."
libra,2013-11-14,"It might seem as if you're being led astray by one thing after another that comes into your environment today. However, the truth is that these so-called distractions may actually be the main event. You are in a positive cycle and can handle nearly anything that happens now. Breathe deeply and remain calm, even if your emotions are pulling you all over the place. Take everything in stride, for your reactions mold your future in powerful ways you don't yet understand."
scorpio,2013-11-14,"Your intense desires could be wasted today on such trivial things such as the pursuit of personal pleasure. But you have more important things to do because your current actions can impact your success at work. You are creating building blocks for the future, so don't expend your energy on reaching the wrong goals. You have more tools at your disposal now; make intelligent use of the resources while you have the chance."
sagittarius,2013-11-14,"Your unflappable confidence can backfire if you think everything is going so well you don't need to do anything now. Even if it seems like you're at the peak of your energy cycle, it's not wise to wait until something goes badly before making changes. It's smarter to improve things before they break. Although the world might feel like your oyster now, complacency isn't your friend. You know what would make your life even better -- so get busy and do it."
capricorn,2013-11-14,"You're strangely attracted to playing outside the rules today, which can make you feel uneasy. You normally like to follow a traditional course, but current circumstances are requiring you to step into uncharted territory. It isn't worth fussing too much over someone who chooses not to join you on your journey. Letting go of old habits and worn-out expectations widens your horizons and increases the variety of new experiences ahead. Take a risk now; you won't be disappointed."
aquarius,2013-11-14,"It's nearly impossible for you to conform to the status quo. You can be so unique in your approach that you don't always have the patience to stick with the same old routine. But you might try to hide your originality now because you want to avoid criticism from your friends. Unfortunately, you're not meant to color inside the lines. Don't worry about what anyone else thinks; just go ahead and be your authentic self."
pisces,2013-11-14,"You may be ready to sacrifice your hard-earned security for the possibility of a memorable experience today. You are yearning to do something out of the ordinary with your friends, especially if they are encouraging you to express a part of your personality that you usually hold back. Be daring and experiment to discover what you really want. Letting your inner wild child out to play can be quite therapeutic."
aries,2013-11-15,"You won't likely take no for an answer today, no matter what your question is. You're driven by your desire for success and are ready to do anything that's necessary to achieve your goals. Others who stand in your way are fair game to receive the brunt of your annoyance or anger, but it's still not a good idea to ride roughshod over someone who would be better as a friend than as an enemy. Don't act foolishly; it's wiser to be inclusive than exclusive."
taurus,2013-11-15,"There's nothing wrong with being in touch with your physical needs, but the Moon's return to your sign today encourages you to be more aware of your feelings. Fortunately, your judgment is probably on point now, as long as you remember to take other people's perspectives into consideration. Even if you're certain that your assumptions are correct, you'll do better by remaining flexible and meeting others halfway."
gemini,2013-11-15,"Your fantasies may be running amok today and it's tempting to draw an intimate partner closer by sharing your private thoughts and feelings. However, it might not be all that easy to bring your secrets out into the open now. Luckily, encountering your own resistance could be a saving grace because your inability to tell everything can turn out in your favor. There are some things that are better left unsaid."
cancer,2013-11-15,"You're usually very sensitive to other people's feelings, but you may need to retreat today because someone is just too intense for you to handle. Unfortunately, attempts on your part to establish reasonable boundaries could just further enflame the drama. Act in a caring and supportive manner without taking responsibility for a difficult situation that isn't yours. Remain sympathetic while also maintaining whatever distance you require for your own emotional wellbeing."
leo,2013-11-15,"You have little patience for anyone who isn't willing to stand up for his or her beliefs today. Normally, you would be more concerned with making sure that your ideas were getting all the attention they deserve. Now, however, you are content with just quietly honoring the opinions of others as long as they are being true to themselves. You're not interested in arguing with someone who is looking for a fight; you would rather explore how your own passions can enrich your life, instead."
virgo,2013-11-15,"Your uncharacteristic desire to express your desires today could ultimately surprise others. At first, you might seem as if you're able to maintain a cool and emotionally detached attitude, but as you talk it becomes apparent that you want to say more. You might even find yourself hooked on a feeling and are unwilling to let it go. Don't be afraid of your intensity now; just be certain that your passions are worth the extra effort."
libra,2013-11-15,"You are criticized on occasion for not being able to make up your mind, but today you'll probably fall at the other end of the spectrum. You are quick to state what you want now and are unwavering in your approach to get it. In fact, you might be so firm in your convictions that you're ready to confront anyone who gets in your way. Your current commitment to living life to the fullest is admirable as long as you don't take yourself so seriously that you start a needless fight over something that's just not that important."
scorpio,2013-11-15,"You aren't interested in simply experiencing the power of emotions; you want to communicate your fears and discuss your attractions, even if they make someone uncomfortable. Magnetic Venus joins your key planet Pluto today, accentuating your passions and bringing hidden desires to the surface. Don't back away from your feelings; it's not your job now to manage how anyone else might react to your truth. Real intimacy can only occur when you share what's in your heart."
sagittarius,2013-11-15,It's necessary to find a steady rhythm at work because your consistent efforts could bring increased income as the Venus-Pluto conjunction activates your 2nd House of Money.

The good news is that satisfaction is within reach, but not if you just assume you should have whatever you wish because you deserve it.

Thankfully, you'll be smiling soon enough if you keep the distractions to a minimum."
aquarius,2013-11-19,"Expressing your enthusiasm at work is normally a smart strategy, yet it might get you into major trouble now. Unfortunately, knowing you should keep your big ideas to yourself probably won't be much of a deterrent.

The clearer you are about your motives, the better the outcome."

By working harder you can burn off some excess energy which increases your ability to concentrate on one thing at a time.

You should explain your newfound optimism, especially if others are working hard to hide the truth. Just remember that blame doesn't help your cause. Lead by example to make your point."
leo,2013-11-20,"You dream about escaping now, instead of facing how much work there is for you to do. Happily, you may be able to sneak away from a few unpleasant chores today by simply going into hiding. However, denial isn't a viable option because it doesn't offer a lasting solution.

You can easily understand complex interpersonal dynamics so don't be afraid to tell others exactly how you feel.

Your mistaken belief that you have to be in charge and demonstrate your competence only brings dissatisfaction and frustration. Sometimes it's not easy to sit quietly and hold a space in your heart for other people's issues; nevertheless, it's a good idea now to incorporate this compassionate practice into your life."
aquarius,2013-11-21,"You're done trying to please everyone else. Instead of playing the role of superhero, be smart, work quietly behind the scenes and stay out of trouble. You can emerge victorious if you are secure enough to allow others to take center stage and receive recognition for their accomplishments. Even if you played a supportive role in someone's success, it may be time to let that go. Learning to love yourself is likely to bring opportunities from somewhere you do not expect."
pisces,2013-11-21,"You might not be very concerned about what others think of you today because you are acutely aware of what makes you happy now. Your clear perspective brings a new sense of emotional power. Nevertheless, you might not be overly eager to express your feelings out in the open. Go ahead and trust in the process; there is a direct correlation between showing your vulnerability and the amount of pleasure you experience later on."
aries,2013-11-22,"The current shift in your awareness is noticeable today as the Sun begins its visit to your 9th House of Adventure. The thought of doing something exciting makes you smile, although you may not be able to turn your most exotic ideas into a concrete plan. Ultimately, you need to find new ways to express your freedom, so don't be too eager now to surrender it without gaining something in return."
taurus,2013-11-22,"Relationships grow more complicated as the Sun makes its way through your 8th House of Deep Sharing. You want real intimacy now, and may not be as willing to remain with someone just because it's safe. Even if security is important to you, don't take the easy way out. It's not worth sacrificing your needs just so you can be with someone. Being true to yourself now will make you a better partner in the long run."
gemini,2013-11-22,"You may be more willing to open up your heart and share your feelings with a special friend now that the warming rays of the Sun are shining in your 7th House of Partners. Thankfully, others will be quite receptive to your overtures these days. You could be pleasantly surprised that you can find happiness once you remember to express yourself freely without worry or fear of what anyone else might think."
cancer,2013-11-22,"You might have withdrawn a bit over the past couple of days, yet your interactions with others may become much more interesting now. Although your feelings could trigger childhood memories, it's still important to distinguish what happened in your past from the current situation. Allow yourself the chance to connect emotionally with someone you trust to help you through the process. Experiencing give and take in the present moment can greatly enrich your journey."
leo,2013-11-22,"You are stepping into a fun-filled phase when your life lightens up and you want to express yourself in a more playful manner. Even if it's challenging to find the satisfaction you're seeking, you still might be willing to move forward with anticipation now, rather than close down in fear. It's certainly more pleasurable to be with those you love than spending your time alone wishing for company. Take a chance and invite someone to join you for a memorable experience."
virgo,2013-11-22,"You are not all that interested in overdoing anything, for self-discipline typically comes easily to you. However, today you may need to manage a new set of issues around your current responsibilities and your desire to spend time with your family. Even if you wish you could let your work slide, you still must follow through on what you started prior to partaking in any relaxation or recreation. Meeting your obligations first allows you to have guilt-free playtime later on."
libra,2013-11-22,"You don't mind being so busy now, but it isn't a smart idea to equate too much activity with happiness. It's challenging to know what is enough or when to stop, and you could exhaust yourself before realizing that you can't keep up with all that you started. Even if your weekend calendar is already set, don't be afraid to cut back on your schedule. It's better to have more free time than not have enough time to do what you want. There's a healthy balance between pleasing others and pleasing yourself."
scorpio,2013-11-22,"You have had some intense experiences recently and  thankfully are at the threshold of a more relaxing phase now. Instead of continuing to dig deeper into your feelings, today is a good day to stabilize a current situation. Fortunately, this change of attitude can also be a relief to the people closest to you. Your newfound confidence could have you spending too much money these days, so keep an eye on your resources to make sure you're using them wisely."
sagittarius,2013-11-22,"It's a smart idea to consciously make use of your birthday month by taking the time to do those things you have set aside because responsibilities called you elsewhere. The bright beams of the Sun shifted into your sign last night, bringing you good luck, new opportunities and exciting adventures. Do what you do best; inspire others by living your life to the fullest."
capricorn,2013-11-22,"Concentrating on your work is nearly impossible today because your thoughts are already focusing on the weekend once the Sun shifts into your 12th House of Imagination, encouraging your fantasies to take flight. Your mind is bouncing around all over the place and there doesn't seem to be much you can do to stop it. Instead of resisting the temptation or denying your intuition, give yourself permission to follow your daydreams and see where they lead."
aquarius,2013-11-22,"You may receive much-needed support now that the Sun is pushing through your 11th House of Friends. Nevertheless, the dramatic Leo Moon reminds you of just how bored you become if you can't break free from your everyday routine. You are more interested in pursuing creative activities now than showing up for your regular tasks. Be thankful that others are there for you, but don't expect them to help you escape from whatever responsibilities that could be holding you back. If you must show your rebellious nature, be prepared to pursue your dreams on your own."
pisces,2013-11-22,"You could stir up all kinds of trouble today, especially if you start more projects than you can possibly finish. Your smartest approach is to avoid overload and pare back your commitments as much as possible. Don't wait until others have become fully dependent upon you, for it will be more difficult to make changes once they do. However, there's no reason to eliminate all  pleasurable activities or you will likely have regrets later on. Find a way to have some fun without turning your life upside down."
aries,2013-11-23,"You may receive conflicting signals from your friends today, but upon closer analysis it's probably your interpretation that has gone astray. The bottom line is you must be careful now if you are making plans that have to take other people's needs into consideration. Remember, exercising a bit of compassion helps you move through these tricky times without leaving a trail of hurt feelings. Practice listening with your heart to hear what's actually being said."
taurus,2013-11-23,"Your imagination is taking off as if it has a life of its own. Even though you are usually well-grounded, today you may have some air between the bottoms of your feet and the earth, itself. Be daring and let your vision lead you, but don't lose sight of the practical issues that need your attention. You might not be able to reach escape velocity now, but you can get a clear sense of where you are heading."
gemini,2013-11-23,"Be careful how you use your ability to bend reality today, for you can easily overdo it. Your words inspire others to take action for a good cause, but you may try so hard to motivate them that you stretch the truth a bit too far. Needless to say, this could have the opposite effect that you are seeking. Even if it isn't as glamorous, it's better to stick to the facts to keep your integrity intact."
cancer,2013-11-23,"You have a chance to touch a deep spiritual truth now if you surrender to your intuition, but you might resist because you have too many commitments to fulfill. Nevertheless, your feelings are swirling around and adding a layer of confusion to the situation; but don't get distracted by the apparent inconsistencies in your vision. Just do the best you can meeting your obligations and let the day unfold organically. Happily, you can find meaning wherever you go."
leo,2013-11-23,"The dynamics of the day may unfold in one of two ways: you might mislead someone or they could mislead you. The confusion could be intentional or simply the result of a misinterpretation. Unfortunately, if you try to steer someone in a wrong direction now on purpose, you will deal with the karmic fallout sooner than you expect. No matter what happens, take the time to clarify anything you don't understand. Asking questions and being open to the answers you receive is your best strategy."
virgo,2013-11-23,"The cause of your symptoms may be elusive if something is bothering you physically today. But even if you're feeling fine, there is still plenty of potential for fuzzy thinking. Normally, you are good at connecting a cause to an effect; however, everything seems to be more nebulous now. Don't let yourself become too frustrated by forcing a solution; it's best to let the uncertainties ride for another day or two before making your move."
libra,2013-11-23,"Ah, the thrill of love -- or the frustration of realizing that a current attraction is based more on illusion than reality. You can use the magic of infatuation and romance to spark deeper fires of passion, but impulsive attempts to create an enduring relationship from your current feelings may be futile. Enjoy this wonderful experience while it lasts rather than trying to capture it forever."
scorpio,2013-11-23,"You may experience a struggle between attachment and separation today. On one hand, you love the idea of having your personal life in order, but you don't want to get too stuck on a particular goal that has the possibility of failure attached to it. You might even sabotage what you have because of your fears. Alternatively, you can work hard toward achieving your goals without becoming obsessive and learn to be satisfied with what you have earned along the way. The choice is yours."
sagittarius,2013-11-23,"The words flow off your tongue or through your keyboard now in a way that makes you seem more poetic than usual. This can be good news if you are a storyteller, a songwriter or courting a new love. But if your current communications are strictly practical or technical in nature, you might want to reread what you write, for you may not be as clear and straightforward as you think. Creativity is a wonderful thing as long as it doesn't get in the way of the truth."
capricorn,2013-11-23,"You don't feel especially comfortable when things get fuzzy -- especially around financial issues. You like to know where you are and where you are going, but this may not be as easy as it sounds. There might be factors now that prevent you from placing a clear value on your current assets. Blind optimism, which isn't normally your style, can get you into serious trouble. Paradoxically, concentrating on your long-term goals today enables you to gain more clarity in the moment."
aquarius,2013-11-23,"You've stepped into the fun house at the carnival and now find yourself in the hall of mirrors, where everything is distorted. Nothing is as it appears -- especially you. Your current self-image is far from the truth. If you are using extra makeup today or are spending too much time picking out what clothes to wear, ask yourself what you are trying to cover up. In the meantime, relax and enjoy the show; you will soon be returned to the real world from which you came."
pisces,2013-11-23,"The easy way out works for many people some of the time, but it might not work so well for you today. You're not going to be able to simply dream your escape from an impossible situation. The best way to handle the current conflict between your obligations and your goals is to keep your perspective wide open while simultaneously doing what is expected of you. There will be time later to make the changes you want. Right now, honor your commitments and speak the truth as simply as you can."
aries,2013-11-24,"You may think your imagination will conjure up a wonderful future on its own, but you could be fooling yourself today. It's true that your fantasies might actually guide you along your way, but your intentions must be grounded in reality or they will remain as castles in the air. Although disappointment occurs if you set unrealistic goals, practical seeds can grow into the nourishing fruits of your labor."
taurus,2013-11-24,"Someone could easily mislead you today, yet it might be your own eagerness to reach your goals that steers you wrong. Perhaps you misunderstand a message based upon what you want to believe rather than what is actually said. Don't waste time being discouraged if the facts comes out differently than you expect. Instead, give thanks that you figured out what's really going on and make whatever adjustments are necessary to put yourself back on track. The truth will set you free."
gemini,2013-11-24,"Stress arises today from trying to balance your playful nature with a more serious side of life. For example, your need to discuss your feelings in a one-on-one partnership might conflict with your fear of being too vulnerable. Or, perhaps, your parenting skills are challenged by changing dynamics at home. In any case, just acknowledge the truth and take the high road whenever possible."
cancer,2013-11-24,"Family matters are still highlighted now, even if your role at home has already undergone a dramatic change. You might be taking yourself very seriously these days, but it appears as if your load is beginning to lightening up. Unexplored alternatives are being put in your path, but these exciting opportunities do not free you from previous obligations. Instead of worrying about what to do today, express what's in your heart -- even if you don't know where it will lead. No one can fault you for being yourself."
leo,2013-11-24,"You may need to face an unsettling situation today that has you wondering about your role at home or within your community. Don't lose touch with your emotions, even if you are highly analytical when it comes to forming your conclusions now. Although your head and your heart could have wildly different agendas, it's still a wise idea to keep them in balance without favoring one over the other. Even if you follow your bliss, make sure to bring some common sense along on the trip."
virgo,2013-11-24,"You might think that your life is moving right along with progressive Mars traveling through your sign. But you're also aware that your real foundations are built on your beliefs and, perhaps, they are not as firm as you would like. Don't let fear persuade you to hold onto old assumptions just because what you know is more comforting than what you don't yet understand. Embracing the unknown may be scary at first, but it enables you to be open to the amazing potential ahead."
libra,2013-11-24,"Someone's story could move you so deeply today that you wish you could avoid further conversation to prevent yourself from becoming overly emotional. Thankfully, your imagination isn't restrained now by the facts alone; you're actually able to envision a happier scenario, allowing you to paint a positive picture instead of just responding passively. Be courageous and inspire others with your passionate dreams of change."
scorpio,2013-11-24,"Although you long for meaningful social interaction, other people may prefer to keep things more lighthearted today. However, it isn't just business as usual these days and you're not interested in pretending that everything is fine just to satisfy someone else's needs. Nevertheless, don't hesitate to say yes to an intriguing invitation if you think getting together with like-minded individuals might provide a safe container for spiritual exploration."
sagittarius,2013-11-24,"Embracing reality may be difficult today because your fantasies are flooding your imagination. Ironically, others might not even realize you're on a mental holiday, since they see a more practical side of you that shows up to take care of business. Fortunately, it doesn't require much effort to meet your obligations now. You can continue to gain inspiration from your inner world while simultaneously making progress in the outer world."
capricorn,2013-11-24,"A minor run-in with self-doubt could quickly grow out of hand today if you think that you're not traveling on the right path. However, you should be able to refocus your energy by drawing from your deep reserve of willpower. Be bold and imagine your future just as you want it to unfold. But don't expect your dreams to become real unless you're willing to believe in yourself, work hard and focus your attention on one simple task at a time."
aquarius,2013-11-24,"It's wonderful when you enhance reality with all your favorite colors, but your cosmetic treatment most likely won't last, possibly leaving you disillusioned at the end of the day. However, since you may drift in and out of your fantasies today, make a concerted effort to discern your dreams from what's actually happening. Be grateful that you get to escape from the mundane world for a while, but don't forget to return to earth so you can gain the satisfaction of meeting your obligations as well."
pisces,2013-11-24,"Your idea of the future might be so warped by your feelings today that you cannot see what's actually around the bend. The Sun's square to elusive Neptune in your sign blurs the facts and challenges you to gather enough accurate data to make a smart decision about your goals. Set aside a specific time when you can lose yourself in your fantasies without feeling guilty. Paradoxically, daydreaming is the key to unlocking the possibilities of the present moment."
aries,2013-11-25,"On one hand, it might seem as if you're on top of the world. On the other hand, your enthusiasm comes at a price, since it forces you to move away from the deeper understanding that comes from being still. Your natural tendency is to do something that makes you feel as if you're embarking on an amazing adventure. Nevertheless, it may be better now to let the opportunity for fun pass you by, and instead find joy in the quiet emotions you experience alone or in the company of someone you love."
taurus,2013-11-25,"A friend may offer assistance today, but you need to be open to the help. You could be somewhat confused about what's most important now. Make sure you don't let your financial obligations slide or you will be digging yourself out of a mess in a few days. This irresponsible behavior isn't normally your style, but you are distracted by social opportunities that might not turn out as enjoyable as they sound. Demonstrate your determination by following through on whatever you start."
gemini,2013-11-25,"Be wary of people painting pretty pictures and selling you a bill of goods now. If someone brags to you about how great everything will be in the future, take a deep breath and then ask a lot of specific questions. Others may not even realize the extent of their inflationary thinking, but that doesn't mean you need to be their next unsuspecting victim. Retreating from a group interaction for a while enables you to develop the perspective you need to keep yourself on track."
cancer,2013-11-25,"Helping those less fortunate than you may be the most amazing medicine for your heart now. It doesn't matter if you are nurturing your own kids or assisting at your local animal shelter, put your caring nature to good use in a creative way. Don't worry about all the things you're not doing; just do what you can with your limited resources. All sincere actions are positive ones; they will gather momentum throughout the day. Let your heart guide the way."
leo,2013-11-25,"Your family may be the center of your world now as you start to pull back from other social activities. However, there is a catch, for you could be feeling so restless that you want to shake things up a bit. You're ready for nearly anything, but are restrained by emotional connections on the home front. Make sure that you know what you're getting into before you say yes. All the excitement you need might be right in front of your nose."
virgo,2013-11-25,You must be extra cautious today when you tell others why you cannot join in their activities. Your own internal resistance makes you more vulnerable if someone pushes you to go beyond your comfort zone. Don't give in too easily. You know what you feel now and no one can change your mind for you. To thine own self be true.
libra,2013-11-25,"Your energy is buzzing today, even if you didn't drink that second cup of coffee. The down side is that getting enough sleep may be difficult now, as your system is flooded with adrenaline and you are primed for action. Meanwhile, you recognize that you cannot run helter-skelter all over the map. Take the time to check in with your inner GPS and make sure that you're heading in the right direction before you apply the gas."
scorpio,2013-11-25,"Your current optimism continues to draw you outside of your protective shell, and if you move strategically, you'll actually feel safer once you've broken through the resistance. You are being supported by the actions of others now, and you have allies working on your behalf. Be aware, however, that all is not as it seems. Act with caution until you know that everything is securely in place. In the meantime, trust your instincts above all else."
sagittarius,2013-11-25,"Keeping up with all your responsibilities today is challenging. However, worrying isn't very helpful either; everything will be alright if you are careful not to get sidetracked by someone who lures you away from your chosen path. Bring your focus back to the real world or you may sail into the foggy mists of your own fantasies and crash on the rocks. Fortunately, honoring your commitments increases your chances for success."
capricorn,2013-11-25,"Although you're feeling a bit pessimistic, today's Mercury-Saturn conjunction can help you to methodically break through an obstacle that's standing in your way. You have enough stamina to accomplish quite a lot now, yet it's hard to know where to apply your energy. Chances are you've already overcommitted your resources, so don't waste time dwelling on your fears. The sooner you get the ball rolling, the more time you'll have later for your own personal pursuits."
aquarius,2013-11-25,"You may be tempted to forget about your job-related responsibilities so you can just relax and enjoy the day. However, the problem is you can't let others down when they are relying on you to keep everything on track. Put your best foot forward, go out and do what is being asked of you. It will probably be more fun than you expect once you are in the flow. A positive attitude makes all the difference in the world."
pisces,2013-11-25,"The stresses between the inner worlds and the outer circumstances are very apparent now as you imagine all the possibilities before you. But you cannot move toward your dreams yet, since you have ongoing commitments that just don't seem to let up. Be responsible and do the right thing today, but then allow yourself enough time to pursue whatever brings your heart lasting pleasure."
aries,2013-11-26,"There is an undeniable gulf between your thoughts and your feelings today. You prefer to rely on relevant information and clear thinking instead of letting your desires dictate a more subjective agenda. Although sticking to the facts sounds good on paper, the truth is that you're better off now if you also listen to your intuition. Balancing your head with your heart helps you to fulfill your highest potential."
taurus,2013-11-26,"It is wise to speak up once you know where your thoughts are taking you. But blurting out a partially formed idea only complicates your life today. Usually, you can slow down and think things through, but your impatience may get the best of you now. Your attempts to sidestep authority or bend the rules won't work. However, you might be pleasantly surprised if you just acknowledge the limitations imposed on you by others. Simply relax and trust the process."
gemini,2013-11-26,"You might not be clear about everything that's happening now, yet you can get to the bottom of a complex situation if you focus on what's important. Although others may think that you're just putting on a show, you don't need to let their assumptions distract you from your real work. Remember, it's not sensible to set aside your strategy if you believe that your plan will succeed. Just don't push too hard; taking small steps is smarter than overreaching and then having to admit you were wrong."
cancer,2013-11-26,"You wish that everything would happen on time today, but you may be so obsessive about your schedule that you accidentally miss a potentially memorable experience. Letting go of control isn't easy now, but it can be a very powerful antidote to your current inflexibility. Quit trying so hard. When you allow your energy to flow with the currents, magic follows you everywhere you go."
leo,2013-11-26,"You may want additional recovery time, but you might not be able to find it today. You are being pulled in multiple directions now, yet the real message is to reconnect with the most practical routines. Even if you feel slightly out of step with what's going on around you, this probably isn't a smart time to shift your course. Concentrate on your immediate needs while surfing the waves of change."
virgo,2013-11-26,"The Moon's return to your straightforward earth sign is a reminder to be as simplistic as possible in your approach to life today. Making some changes on the home front may be helpful, but your time is at a premium now. Nevertheless, frustration arises if you let your own needs go unfulfilled for too long. Divide your day so you can take care of your chores first and then move on to more enjoyable activities later."
libra,2013-11-26,"You can feel the weight of your responsibilities continuing to grow today, tempting you to retreat from non-critical social activities. Still, you are likely to participate in pointed discussions about the very real issues now facing you and your friends. Ultimately, you must decide your level of involvement. Don't blindly accept the rules that someone else makes for you; follow your own intuition, instead."
scorpio,2013-11-26,"Your survival instincts kick in today, prompting you to concentrate on an all-too-familiar unresolved issue. But simultaneously, waves of hope wash onto your shore, making your goals appear closer than before. Don't give up; extra hard work will be rewarded. Reaching for satisfaction in your dreams can make a huge difference in the days ahead. What you now imagine has the potential to become your future if you want it bad enough."
sagittarius,2013-11-26,"You have a natural inclination to aim for the stars, even if an unexpected change in circumstances throws you a surprising curve ball today. Your reaction may be immediate, but don't assume that making a quick decision is better than carefully thinking through all of the alternatives. Others are eager to listen to you and will respect your thought process as long as you consider a variety of possibilities prior to committing to just one."
capricorn,2013-11-26,"You are in your own earthy element today because the practical Virgo Moon harmonizes with profound Pluto in your sign as it continues to slowly deconstruct and reconstruct your life. Thankfully, there's no reason to develop several different contingencies; one concrete strategy is enough. Remember, you don't need multiple options now; you only need the chance to follow through with a plan that makes sense."
aquarius,2013-11-26,"Circumstances might force you to think about an old emotional issue that's still bothering you. Even if you attempt to evade the problem today, you will just be lured back into the melodrama tomorrow. Since you may not feel very comfortable in this situation, play through the possible conversations in your imagination prior to facing them in real time. A bit of advanced mental preparation now makes it easier to speak from your heart."
pisces,2013-11-26,"You may be feeling a bit more independent these days, but you still must stand up to someone who tries to be authoritative in order to put you in your place. Thankfully, you aren't willing to do as you are told if you can envision more appealing alternatives. Don't take the easy way out; the course of least resistance might not lead you to your goals. Once you know what you want, do whatever is necessary to fulfill your dreams."
aries,2013-11-27,"You don't like being asked to choose between your professional and personal life. However, your role is changing and your job duties may infringe on your private world more than you prefer. Unfortunately, your resistance to the new arrangement can lead to frustration. Even if you're stressed out today, try to be optimistic about the future without slipping into denial. Facing the current dilemma and dealing with work issues now enables you to maintain a positive attitude about your future."
taurus,2013-11-27,"You aren't one to ignore the facts, but today you may be tempted to avoid the truth to get through a complicated predicament. Thankfully, you can see the positive side of a difficult issue even if it seems irresolvable in the moment. Although the ultimate answer might be just beyond your reach now, going through the motions of seeking a sensible solution helps to boost your confidence along the way to achieving your goals."
gemini,2013-11-27,"You may be struggling to get to the bottom of a complicated situation involving your family, but it's not clear which stories are the true ones. Usually, you're pretty good at discerning fact from fiction, but today you are holding everyone to a higher standard. Don't waste time demanding an unattainable level of accuracy; instead, just do your best with the information you're given. When in doubt, trust your intuition."
cancer,2013-11-27,"Someone may claim you're so gullible that you believe nearly anything -- so think twice before you blindly accept what you are being told today. However, it's not about you being naive; instead, you're capable of seeing the potential where others might just pass it by. Remember, there's nothing wrong with having a positive attitude as long as you check your facts before making assumptions that could get you into trouble. Don't let others rain on your parade."
leo,2013-11-27,"You can't decide if it's a smart idea to accept additional responsibilities today. A new project could lead to the recognition you want and even to a promotion. But you could underestimate the amount of effort that's required to meet your deadline. Even if the whole deal sounds promising, it's still not wise to make your life more complicated now by taking on more than you can deliver. Take your time to analyze all the facts before making a final decision."
virgo,2013-11-27,"Relying on your common sense can be tricky now because you keep changing your mind as new information comes to your attention. It may be challenging to remain optimistic, yet it's important to consider if you are actually fooling yourself. You can see the world through two different lenses today. One makes everything appear better and the other one makes things look worse. Keep in mind that the truth is found somewhere in the middle."
libra,2013-11-27,"Laying your feelings on the line is never easy, but if you don't share what's on your mind today, your frustration could push you right to the edge. Fortunately, everything will become easier for a while once you choose to share whatever you were hiding. You still have a lot of work to do, but you can accomplish anything if you truly believe in yourself. Trusting the process isn't as great a risk as it seems."
scorpio,2013-11-27,"Although the overall prognosis may be quite excellent today, you still have to face your own shadow before you can fully realize the potential that's all around you. This isn't about any one specific interaction or a single decision you're required to make. Your attitude is directly impacted by your thoughts; if you believe that you are successful, then you are. Put your amazing intensity to work and make something magical happen now."
sagittarius,2013-11-27,"Your extra efforts will likely pay off with a bonus check, the possibility of a promotion or at least words of praise. But it isn't very smart to think that the world owes you something, for you aren't entitled to rewards you haven't earned. Ultimately, you won't do as well if you believe personal satisfaction is guaranteed. Stop worrying about what you want in the present moment and set your sights on a more significant long-term goal. Once you have a plan, get to work."
capricorn,2013-11-27,"You may not understand why no one has acknowledged you today for your positive contribution. You feel as if you're doing well responding to all the stressful circumstances, and you know that you deserve more credit now than you're currently receiving. Nevertheless, your lesson is that accomplishing your goals requires more time than you initially expected. Thankfully, once you accept that success take time to achieve, you might not be so frustrated in the moment. Find comfort in a job well done."
aquarius,2013-11-27,"You want to be known as a considerate friend who puts the wishes of others first. But taking care of everyone's needs except your own isn't a path to happiness. Unfortunately, you could be so involved with doing what's right that you inadvertently overlook the much-needed support of an ally. Show your vulnerability by acknowledging that you have needs, too, and you don't always know the best way to get what you want."
pisces,2013-11-27,"You might appear quite enthusiastic about something you are doing today, but you could just be hiding your fears for the sake of simplicity. You may feel as if there are no correct answers anyway, but don't let this concern stop you. Instead, respond to the current stresses by showing up with an open heart, even if you don't have a long-term plan in place. It turns out that living in the present moment is the best possible strategy you could have now."
aries,2013-11-28,"You might hit a few emotional speed bumps if you move too fast today. Even if your life is running smoothly, you would be wise to pay attention to a potential problem before it creates trouble. If you're not careful, your enthusiasm may get the best of you and you could even go too far. Remind yourself throughout the day that your high energy can make others uncomfortable. Tempering your exuberance with a little common sense enables you to lead with your heart while still acknowledging the needs of everyone else."
taurus,2013-11-28,"Enjoying the finer things in life now without overdoing it isn't as easy as it sounds. You may be tempted to eat or drink more than you should or to spend more money than you have. Thankfully, you don't need to let these warnings prevent you from having a wonderful time. Go ahead and joyfully indulge in a bit of sensory pleasure, but make sure that you don't push your limits too far."
gemini,2013-11-28,"You may feel like a million bucks today; you're at the top of your game when it comes to dishing out your clever repartee. You can easily put your best foot forward and then do your famous verbal tap dance to impress others. However, you might be too smart for your own good now. The power of positive thinking only works if you don't push the envelope beyond what's socially acceptable. Taking a calculated risk is a good idea as long as you're ready to abandon your plans if they go awry."
cancer,2013-11-28,"You can communicate quite effectively today, even if you would rather withhold your emotions. You should be able to manifest your dreams if you just let your intuition take over. However, there's a delicate balance between your ideals and what you actually achieve. Your romantic fantasies may now be realized, but you must give voice to your feelings or you won't get what you need. Be brave and speak from your heart."
leo,2013-11-28,"Letting your errant feelings out into the open can be stressful today, for your current needs might appear out of character for you. Nevertheless, it's nearly impossible to adjust your desires to what others are willing to give. Meeting someone halfway begins with listening rather than just stating  what you want. Finding a way to be emotionally flexible now will better your chances of having a memorable day spent with those you love."
virgo,2013-11-28,"You might prosper in love today, but circumstances could stress you out, nonetheless. Normally, you are careful about what you say and what you eat, but now you are tempted to overindulge. As long as you aren't concerned with making these pleasures last, this can be quite an amazing day. But tomorrow may not be as pleasant when you realize what you've done in the name of immediate gratification. Paying attention to your limits makes more sense and won't detract from your fun."
libra,2013-11-28,"Going out of your way to consciously perform random acts of kindness can make your day much more pleasurable. Even if you're just chatting with your friends today, your optimism encourages those around you. Your spirit of generosity is reflected back to you in the form of greater freedom, more expansive thinking and heightened creativity. Something special will happen if you continue to express love and beauty in an altruistic way."
scorpio,2013-11-28,"Say whatever's on your mind today because the planets can maximize the positive impact of your words. Even if you have felt unforgiving in the past, it may be the right time now to reassess the situation. Relationship issues are best tackled with a loving and supportive approach, but behind the serious talk is your desire to bask in the glory of love. Be extra sweet to someone you cherish and the positive repercussions will ripple back to you quickly."
sagittarius,2013-11-28,"You like to dream big and your fantasies are over the top today, enticing you away from a more practical approach. Your key planet Jupiter is overstimulated by sensual Venus and mischievous Mercury, encouraging you to partake in one too many social activities. There's nothing wrong with indulging in the fun, but don't go overboard. Steer clear from jumping to conclusions before you logically think your vision all the way through."
capricorn,2013-11-28,"Your organizational skills are operating at peak efficiency, but you could become distracted today and gloss over a few important details. Although you can clearly see the whole picture, it's difficult to stay on track as temptation tests your self-discipline. It might be too easy to let your responsibilities fall to the wayside now as you seek the pleasure in your life that may be long overdue. Balancing work and play is your best approach -- as long as you lean toward having fun."
aquarius,2013-11-28,"You want to be appreciated for your actions today and your current routine may send you off in an entirely different direction than you imagined. However, this isn't a great time to trust your intuition, for you might be attracted to the easiest path instead of the smartest one; your sense of proportion is slightly bent out of shape. Remember, it's less important to be recognized now than it is to feel good about what you've done. True self-esteem comes from within."
pisces,2013-11-28,"It's all too easy to become obsessed with the ideas, myths and religions of another culture as expansive Jupiter harmonizes with mental Mercury in your 9th House of Distant Places. Falling in love with someone or something is quite possible now. Opportunities for pleasure are knocking at your door, but they won't wait around forever. Enjoy each experience for what it offers, but don't ruin it by trying to make it permanent."
aries,2013-11-29,"You may go out of your way to communicate your desires today, but you could take things to an extreme. People might even grow annoyed if you aren't willing to meet them halfway. Fortunately, your good intentions should be enough to smooth over any ruffled feathers. But others won't be able to hold a grudge if you simply tell the truth with kindness. You really don't have to negotiate away your need for independence. Just remember you can still be considerate while honoring your integrity."
taurus,2013-11-29,"Being able to trust your friends means the world to you. Even if you disagree about something important today, it's better if everyone openly shares what's on their minds. However, your tendency to gloss over difficult emotions now can create problems down the road. Take extra time to check in with your heart to make sure that you know what you  want, even if it's inconvenient. Being completely honest paves the way to true intimacy."
gemini,2013-11-29,"Giving up on a good idea today sounds easier than it is, even if you know you cannot add one more item to your list of tasks. The lingering positive energy from yesterday's easygoing Mercury-Jupiter trine continues to remove obstacles from your path and increases your optimism. However, your resources are limited and you could exhaust yourself trying to deliver on all your promises. Paring back your activities optimizes your efficiency and improves your chances for success."
cancer,2013-11-29,"It's easier to talk about what you're capable of doing today than it is to actually follow through with decisive actions and get concrete results. Accordingly, it may be smarter to spend your day engaging in meetings, making phone calls and writing emails, rather than executing your plans. Networking with potential supporters now can help you develop an effective strategy. Figure out the best way to reach your goals and prepare to make your move."
leo,2013-11-29,"You're feeling on edge today because you know that something big is brewing but you can't yet tell what's around the next bend. Although your positive attitude works in your favor, you're also worried that you aren't in complete control of your destiny. Fortunately, you have more stability now than you realize, so just let the current events flow without trying to direct every single outcome. Trust the universe and let the Force be with you."
virgo,2013-11-29,"You may believe that anything you can imagine is possible. Although clever Mercury is beginning to settle down today, your thoughts are still flying all over the place. Just remember that you're not invincible, so don't fill up your life with plans based on unrealistic dreams. Reach for the stars, but don't lose sight of your valuable common sense. There's nothing wrong with setting ambitious goals now as long as you also keep your feet firmly planted on the ground."
libra,2013-11-29,"You would love to get by with less hard work now that the reflective Moon is back in your sign. However, you could end up wasting precious time and energy today if you believe that an ingenious shortcut will get you to where you're going faster than taking the tried and true path. But these days your most reliable approach comes from setting a manageable pace early in the day and then sticking with it as best as you can. Slow and steady wins the race."
scorpio,2013-11-29,"You're feeling your oats today because mischievous Mercury in your sign harmonizes with joyful Jupiter in your 5th House of Fun and Games. You might not be able to forget about all the serious issues in your life, but at least you can put them into a healthy perspective that allows you to have a good time no matter what else is going on. Ultimately, the choice is yours; either focus on all the uncertainty or make a temporary escape and enjoy the power of now."
sagittarius,2013-11-29,"You still have secrets to keep, yet it may be a struggle to remain quiet for much longer. Nevertheless, it's more important to honor your commitments, even if you feel comfortable enough to spill the beans. You might be able to see the positive side of sharing everything you know, but it's not your decision to make now. Take the high road and don't stir up any unnecessary trouble yet; wait a few days until the Moon is back in your sign before reconsidering your options."
capricorn,2013-11-29,"Engaging in small talk is just a waste of time today; you're eager to dig into the core of the matter. You aren't interested in acting diplomatically now, even if you realize that it can help you obtain what you want. Thankfully, your friends and associates appreciate your direct and honest approach, so follow your instincts and get down to business without beating around the bush. The early bird gets the worm."
aquarius,2013-11-29,"The most boring tasks can morph into lots of fun if you only adjust your perspective. Luckily, the potential for sudden change is still growing. Unpredictable Uranus is in the spotlight today, shocking you with new and exciting experiences -- even if you have routine responsibilities to handle before you move on to the more pleasurable stuff. Stay focused and get your work out of the way quickly so you have time to expand your horizons by pursuing other interests that bring you personal satisfaction."
pisces,2013-11-29,"You appear very positive today, even if you're holding some doubt in reserve while you vacillate between optimism and worry. However, others won't likely sense your uncertainty, especially if you think it's to your advantage to hide your lack of confidence. Ultimately, it's in your best interest if you can find enough courage to share your fears with someone you trust, for they will most likely dissipate once you've given them voice."
aries,2013-11-30,"There are so many options available now that it could be difficult to decide what to do first. In fact, you may be dreaming about things that you don't normally let yourself imagine. It's as if your nerves are standing at attention, waiting for the next thrill to come their way. Don't try too hard to hold this energy back or you might explode. Find a healthy way to make use of this adrenaline rush through physical exercise or conscious meditation."
taurus,2013-11-30,"You normally trust your senses over your feelings, but now your emotions might stand in the way of rational behavior. Your energy is tightly wired today and your jumpiness may be making you ill at ease, especially if you try to hold still. Sometimes your cage needs to be rattled -- especially when your relationships become too rigid. But don't wait for lightning to strike. Instead, preemptively stretch your boundaries and practice being more flexible in both mind and body. Take a walk on the wild side."
gemini,2013-11-30,"It's quite a rush to stand at the edge of an emotional cliff. You want action now and may be drawn toward adventure and freedom. You feel as if you're up for nearly anything, but your current enthusiasm doesn't necessarily mean that you should follow every whim. Your flirtatious behavior could attract someone who is different from your usual preference. The danger of the day is only in how quickly and unconsciously you respond to your own desires; slow down and make your feelings last."
cancer,2013-11-30,"It's one of those rare days when you're not interested in remaining safe and secure within your protective shell. It's not that you're in emotional denial; it's just that you feel grounded enough now to step outside your own cave for a breath of fresh air. If you've been holding back on expressing your needs, this might be an opportune time to bring them out into the open. Although others may be quite surprised at first with your current disclosure, ultimately they'll appreciate you stretching out of your comfort zone."
leo,2013-11-30,"You can operate in unorthodox ways today without creating too much of a stir. It's as if you've been given permission to be weird and unpredictable. However, you might take your rebellious attitude too far, especially if you think that you're being misunderstood. Instead of slowing down to explain your intentions, you could work yourself up into a tizzy because you don't want to accept the status quo. Fortunately, you can shine your light brilliantly now as long as you take a moment to consider the consequences of your actions."
virgo,2013-11-30,"You might develop nervous anxiety from the unusual thoughts and feelings you are experiencing today, especially if you don't have the benefit of immediate feedback from a trusted friend. Normally, your common sense prevails when it comes to issues of the heart, but you may be feeling a bit hot under the collar now. You could try to ignore your emotions, but paradoxically, they won't go away until you pay them some attention. Writing in a journal is a great way to engage the process without creating additional drama."
libra,2013-11-30,"This is your chance to be radically different; even if you are a bit conservative in your taste, you are tempted to flirt with the edge now. It's as if you need to make a bold statement to prevent others from putting you into a nicely wrapped box. Your actions may surprise those close to you, but don't let their reactions stop you. You've done enough according to the book, so throw those manuals away. It's time to embrace the unknown and make it up as you go along."
scorpio,2013-11-30,"You might believe you need an emotional meltdown to clear the air today, but just as everything starts to rumble, the skies open up and you are released from your mundane troubles. However, your desires are still a bit erratic as you are simultaneously attracted toward attachment and independence. A relationship that allows you the full freedom to acknowledge whatever you feel is ideal, but you may create more trouble than is necessary if you act on every whim that crosses your mind."
sagittarius,2013-11-30,"You have to sink down into the depths in order to release a negative charge that has turned into an unhealthy anchor in your life. You may think you can simply cut the emotional ties that bind you and be free, but it's never that simple. This radical strategy isn't about making a quick escape; it's about finding a way to put passion back into your life and doing something that makes you feel fully alive. Fortunately, you receive some cosmic help today from irrepressible Uranus. Spontaneity is your friend; be here now."
capricorn,2013-11-30,"You're on the edge of something big, and as a sure-footed Goat, your first inclination is to step back so you won't fall. You're not normally the one to jump off the cliff, unless you are properly trained for climbing and fully tethered. Now, however, there is something inside you that wants to shed all the restraining ropes and fly. If you really believe in yourself, take a leap of faith and don't look back."
aquarius,2013-11-30,"Lightning may strike suddenly and change your social standing today as your key planet Uranus is activated by the radiant Sun. New relationships can create a whole different set of circumstances that revitalize your network of friendships. Although your intuition is working overtime now, don't ignore your common sense because it's easy to get swept up in a wave of excitement and find yourself in over your head. All will turn out well if you remember to keep a healthy balance between calculated risk and potential reward."
pisces,2013-11-30,"The planets are encouraging you to use your rich imagination while developing new career objectives. However, making money could become an annoying source of confusion now. Just because you are captivated by a particular goal doesn't mean that it's your most sensible destination. Keep in mind that you always feel more alive when following your heart. Integrating your dreams into your real life may not happen overnight, but today is as good a time as any to get the ball rolling."
aries,2013-12-01,"A current bout of anxiety may be the most recent recurrence of a very familiar story as you struggle to be happy without giving up whatever you already gained. Your frustration triggers your natural tendency to act without thinking; however, impulsive reactions won't bring you any closer to your goals today. Don't assume that everything will change immediately; risk-taking only pays off if you consider all your options first."
taurus,2013-12-01,"What appeared to be a sound idea yesterday might not be so appealing today, especially if someone is pressuring you to make a commitment. Nevertheless, you are tempted to step beyond your usual limits because you're bored of doing the same old thing. Make a rational choice instead of setting aside your common sense and then regretting it later. Just remember that a little self-discipline works in your favor."
gemini,2013-12-01,"Don't lose sight of your responsibilities even if you're itching to do something crazy today just to get your adrenaline pumping. Although you don't want to turn your life upside down you could make a hasty decision that is overly disruptive. The temptations are all around you and you are capable of talking yourself into nearly anything now. Instead, listen to your inner voice of reason; be certain to fulfill your obligations first before heading out to look for excitement."
cancer,2013-12-01,"Sharing your thoughts about a household project can put you in the spotlight today, but be ready to pare back your big plans if you meet too much resistance. It's not worth exhausting your energy just to fight a battle that can't be won. Nevertheless, this doesn't mean you should give up on your dreams. Your current task is to create a path based on compromise without negotiating away your vision. A solid solution may seem elusive now, but persistence will move you in the right direction."
leo,2013-12-01,"You don't want to be the serious one now, especially if you have already been playing an authoritative role for a while. Thankfully, you could have a chance to demonstrate a different approach today -- a new and improved version of you is ready for action. However, if you're having trouble letting go of control, try increasing the quantity of fun-loving people in your immediate environment. A little laughter goes a long way toward healing what ails you."
virgo,2013-12-01,"You've made some important choices recently, but now you may see new options that weren't available before. You could grow frustrated if you think you made a bad decision. However, you have an opportunity to make additional changes today, even if that means temporarily complicating your life even more. Remember, your situation might suddenly change again. Don't fall into the trap of thinking that you're stuck since your attitude can actually create the positive results you seek."
libra,2013-12-01,"You often live up to your reputation of being indecisive, but today you're overly eager to make a choice. Instead of moderating the extreme options by bringing them toward the center, you can't wait to jump one way or the other. You may be worried that you don't have enough time to weigh all the alternatives before making up your mind. An objective approach is usually the best strategy, but now it's more important to make your judgment quickly and then move on."
scorpio,2013-12-01,"Measuring your personal success against someone else is not a productive use of your time, yet it still may be difficult to avoid such comparisons today as you try to figure out what to do next. But assessing your current position isn't all that simple because you can overvalue or underestimate whatever you bring to the situation. Changing your mind quickly takes its toll on others, but don't stop your decision-making process even if they aren't comfortable with your volatility. To thine own self be true."
sagittarius,2013-12-01,"Your opinions are emotionally charged today and your thoughts singularly focused, but your actions may not be aligned with your words. You might run wild without knowing where to begin; regaining control seems nearly impossible. Unfortunately, your usual supporters can make things worse now by distracting you from your agenda. Nevertheless, you have the skills to stay on track, and it's your choice to use them. Take a few deep breaths and step back from the chaos to clear your mind before starting again."
capricorn,2013-12-01,"Concentrating on one thing at a time may be a real struggle now as trickster Mercury dukes it out with ruthless Pluto in your sign. But even if circumstances seem to be out of control, you don't have to be pulled into dramas that aren't yours. Instead of scattering your energy today, make a list of the unfinished business you want to complete. Once you have prioritized your tasks, you have your work cut out for you. Put your blinders on and get busy."
aquarius,2013-12-01,"You are aware of trivial problems that are tied to deeper issues today and you're prepared to delve into a sticky situation in order to reach the bottom. But your strategy might not go so smoothly, especially if someone has a different idea of what you should be doing. You're not likely to walk away from your search without a fight, but your sense of urgency isn't necessarily based on reality now. Slow down; you can always return to your investigation later if you still feel the need."
pisces,2013-12-01,"Something needs to give as your professional and personal goals clash today. You want to take care of relationship issues but thinking about your week ahead could stress you out. Try not to push for an ultimate solution now. But, remember that avoidance isn't a viable strategy, either. Even if you don't know the answers to your current questions, radical honesty might be the key that brings you peace of mind."
aries,2013-12-02,"You can go so far today fueled only on your boundless optimism that you could stir up some unexpected resistance, especially if you're behaving outrageously. Although you may overlook a critical fact with the cavalier Sagittarius New Moon activating your 9th House of Big Ideas, your current intentions are strong enough to overcome challenging odds. Acting on a strong conviction is healthy, but it's not necessary to spend energy defending your position with hollow words. Let your work speak for itself."
taurus,2013-12-02,"Including another person in your plans could be quite advantageous now that the fun-loving  Sagittarius New Moon lands in your 8th House of Deep Sharing. However, you must be open to what your partner wants, too. A positive attitude is always an asset, but it won't be enough today unless you pay close attention to the facts. Don't minimize what you're told because slipping into a dreamy space of denial won't help you reach your goals. Keeping your feet firmly on the ground is just as important as knowing your destination."
gemini,2013-12-02,"A personal relationship may be infused with exciting energy today because the fiery Sagittarius New Moon falls in your 7th House of Others. Or, perhaps, someone might enter your life now and inspire you with possibilities of creating something very special. Either way, it is your responsibility to transform your dreams into reality by releasing previous expectations and allowing the power of the moment to work its magic."
cancer,2013-12-02,"You want to accomplish a lot of work today, but you could underestimate the amount of effort required to meet your obligations. You're up for the challenge because the optimistic Sagittarius New Moon occurs in your 6th House of Employment, but you also might discover that you're in over your head. If you suddenly realize that you overcommitted your resources, taking out your bad judgment on others isn't a useful strategy. Instead, be up front about your predicament and ask for assistance. You may be surprised at how quickly your real friends rush to your rescue."
leo,2013-12-02,You may feel like letting loose and kicking up your heels today with the playful Sagittarius New Moon charging up your 5th House of Fun and Games. You might be so eager to enjoy yourself that you temporarily forget about your previous commitments. But don't be overly concerned now; you will finish everything even if you have to work harder later. Give yourself permission to truly enjoy the present moment while expressing your gratitude as often as possible.
virgo,2013-12-02,"Your philosophical perspective and realistic attitude can have a very positive influence on those around you. But you would prefer to focus on the good news today rather than the bad. Even if your actions portray the purest of intentions, your self-criticism might be harsh and you may fall short of your own expectations. Today's Sagittarius New Moon energizes your 4th House of Emotional Security, so don't be too rough on yourself. Simply do your best while leaving enough time to enjoy the company of those you love."
libra,2013-12-02,"You're quite appreciative of your closest friends and family now because their presence adds so much joy to your life. Thankfully, the Sagittarius New Moon lands in your 3rd House of Immediate Environment, so anyone can inspire you just by initiating an interesting discussion. Although you might prefer to narrow your focus, everyone around you will be happier if you are flexible and allow the day to carry you along on a wonderful ride without worrying about your destination."
scorpio,2013-12-02,"You find it challenging now to separate your philosophical views about personal wealth from any judgments that you might have of yourself. You may appear certain of your current financial choices, but it's still wise to exercise a little caution with the zealous Sagittarius New Moon falling in your 2nd House of Money. All the details haven't surfaced yet, so don't draw any premature conclusions. In the meantime, don't underestimate the value of the connections you have with those who care about you the most."
sagittarius,2013-12-02,"You might believe you're on a roll, especially if you have a lot to be thankful for today. But the happy-go-lucky Sagittarius New Moon could inspire you to feel so enthusiastic about what may come next in your life that you are a bit sloppy with the execution of your plans. Instead of building your entire future on a dream, make certain that your strategy is grounded in reality. Success requires equal parts of creative imagination and hard work."
capricorn,2013-12-02,"It's not that you want to rain on anyone's parade; it's just that you value your integrity more than your desire to project hope. Nevertheless, you could set aside your high standards today while you encourage everyone to create his or her own vision. The Sagittarius New Moon occupies your 12th House of Fantasy, so don't take the easy way out by glossing over the truth just to go along with the crowd. Hold on to your level-headed approach, even if others don't always appreciate what motivates you. Only you can decide which path you should follow."
aquarius,2013-12-02,"You have a cheerful attitude and it seems as if everyone's taking notice now that the exuberant Sagittarius New Moon activates your 11th House of Social Networking. You're very easygoing today and don't require a lot of maintenance. You might even prefer to have a memorable time with your friends without being the center of attention, instead of putting yourself through performance anxiety. Even if you shirk the spotlight, you will still be recognized for the joy you bring to others."
pisces,2013-12-02,"You have a strong desire to know where you are heading in your chosen profession now that the Sagittarius New Moon emphasizes your 10th House of Public Recognition. Your general career path may be the topic of a hot discussion today, but don't try to reach any final decisions or make a detailed action plan for what comes next. The greatest limitations at this time can arise from within your own mind. Instead, just go ahead and  dream big because nearly anything is possible if you simply believe in yourself."
aries,2013-12-03,"The seas are calm today, you have a gentle wind in your sails and the world is your oyster. Even if you require assistance, others will come to your rescue with exactly the skills and resources you need. If someone offers help, don't exhibit false pride; acknowledge your predicament and say yes. Ultimately, being thankful for whatever generosity you receive now allows everyone to feel good about participating in your success."
taurus,2013-12-03,"If you were a dancer, you would tell exquisite stories with your movements today, but you currently prefer to rely on words to get your message across. However, rather than being passionate about sharing your ideas, you secretly wish you could be chilling out. Unfortunately, pleasure may seem far away and you probably won't be able to avoid meeting your obligations. Thankfully, the sooner you start your chores, the quicker you will finish."
gemini,2013-12-03,"You may wonder if a certain partnership is worth the trouble today, but unresolved issues seem to come together just in the nick of time. It's easier to discuss your concerns openly now since people won't likely take your accurate perceptions in a negative manner. Pick a subject and get the conversation rolling. Stick to the chosen topic because you cannot afford to waste energy being scattered by other people's ideas. Tell the truth; even if your honesty temporarily raises the stress level, everything will settle back down soon enough."
cancer,2013-12-03,"Your positive attitude has a motivating effect on your coworkers today, but your optimism could be slightly misleading. Although you might have concerns about the quality of the job you're doing, you may still appear so sure of yourself that others don't offer their assistance because they believe you're on track. Be specific and clearly ask for help if required. Fortunately, the support you want will be forthcoming, but not unless you're completely honest about what you need."
leo,2013-12-03,"You have big ideas about relationships now, and you believe that your good intentions can overcome any obstacles. The evocative Moon's presence in your 5th House of Creativity emphasizes your innate need for spontaneity and drama, even if it means that your actual productivity suffers today. However, obtaining tangible results may not be as important to you as sharing what's in your heart with those you love."
virgo,2013-12-03,"You're pulled in two different directions today as the exuberant Sagittarius Moon encourages you to think big, while your natural instincts tell you to maintain a methodical approach when making plans. This internal conflict might make you hesitant to get too caught up in the excitement of the day, even if you want to jump in and join the fun. Keep in mind you can actually accomplish more than you realize by consciously limiting your overall expenditure of time and money. Moderation is key."
libra,2013-12-03,"It appears that you have a busy day ahead of you, so you might not be able to truly relax until the evening when you are finally caught up with everything. People seem to infringe upon your personal space now, even if they mean well. Oddly enough, you don't mind all the distractions today; they could even inspire you to explore new avenues of self-expression as you interact with others. Enjoy the social noise while it lasts, since tomorrow will likely be much quieter."
scorpio,2013-12-03,"You may have ambitious plans to revamp your finances and if your goals survive today's reality check, then you can be assured they are in the ballpark of plausibility. But if current events shake your security or stress your cash flow, set aside your big ideas and refocus your attention on the present moment. Ultimately, here and now is more important than then and there."
sagittarius,2013-12-03,"Nothing -- not even the facts -- is likely to prevent you from seeing amazing possibilities in every situation today. Your opinions might be so strong now that you disbelieve what's in front of your eyes in order to preserve the big picture. Although you can easily soar through the day, being motivated by unrealistic visions isn't necessarily healthy. Adjust your plans willingly, based upon what you learn, instead of waiting until it's too late."
capricorn,2013-12-03,"Your vivid imagination spurs you on today with full-spectrum bursts of inspiration, but you can quickly see where you are overextended. Paring back your dance card is a smart strategy, since it's better now to have one or two excellent partners rather than many mediocre ones. Your discernment is a powerful secret weapon, so use it carefully. Seek quality over quantity for the best outcome."
aquarius,2013-12-03,"Staying on target is tricky now, because your mind naturally drifts off into the distant future. Although you feel highly creative today, following a single project through to completion is tougher than starting a new one. Don't let others tempt you off course. Even if their activities sound like a lot of fun, abstaining from them allows you to take care of your business in a timely manner. Work now, play later."
pisces,2013-12-03,"Displaying a more compassionate side at work may be scary today, yet it's healthier to face your fears so you can overcome them. Others see you as the source of a much-needed solution, but you might be hesitant to share what you know. There's no need to talk until you feel it's totally safe to express your opinions, especially if they are still in the process of development. Your intuition will tell you when the time is right."
aries,2013-12-04,"You're willing to work harder now because you think that your current ambitions have a better chance of being realized. But it's not just because you are eager to put in the extra effort to accomplish more. It's as if you're tapping into something mysterious that adds power to everything you do. Keep in mind that fulfillment of your dreams may take longer than you wish, but believing in yourself today is certainly the first step to success."
taurus,2013-12-04,"You have an extra amount of patience that you can call on today, but it's not because you are so saintly. Actually, you know what you want now and are ready to do whatever is necessary to reach your goals. If it is advantageous for you to push extra hard, you will. But if playing the waiting game is what's required to bring satisfaction in the long run, then that's exactly what you'll do. Just be sure that your dreams are worth your time and effort."
gemini,2013-12-04,"You take your own plans very seriously today and you expect everyone else to do the same. However, you may not be so quick with your snappy comebacks now because you realize that you have a chance to experience something you might normally miss. Instead of relying on your clever repartee, sink into a meaningful emotional dialogue as you would a luxurious fantasy. But remember to play for keeps because this opportunity for connection is real."
cancer,2013-12-04,"Although you might think about ways to minimize your heavy workload today, someone else may successfully convince you to reconsider your plans. Taking time to reevaluate your current motives is a good idea, but don't get duped into doubting your ability to make the right decision. Remember, people are counting on you. Nevertheless, listening to your instincts now is smarter than solely relying on others for guidance."
leo,2013-12-04,"You may feel a little awkward as your lighthearted spirit and playful attitude begin to fade. You aren't necessarily looking for additional responsibilities today, yet others might be putting too many expectations on you, anyhow. However, there's no need to waste energy worrying now since you still have some very pleasant times ahead, even if you have to tackle some less enjoyable tasks first. Take your mind off your current situation by concentrating on the rewards that are just around the next corner."
virgo,2013-12-04,"If you are overly anxious because something seems out of whack, rest assured that a shift toward stability is now in the works. But don't expect all your problems to just disappear since your newly discovered center of gravity brings its own intensity. Nevertheless, you should be able to enjoy yourself today, no matter what stressful situations you might face. Instead of seeking your answers in the outer world, find a peaceful place within where you can reconnect with your higher self."
libra,2013-12-04,"You might try a stoic approach to a complex situation that involves a family member or very close friend. Even if you believe that the most intelligent strategy is to keep your emotions in check now, it may prove impossible to prevent them from showing. Ironically, it could be that expressing your feelings without editing them is exactly the catalyst that's needed to resolve the current emotional drama. Don't hold back; respond directly from your heart."
scorpio,2013-12-04,"You are in a better position now with respect to harvesting the fruits of your labors. But your current success isn't only about your career; it has just as much to do with the overall satisfaction you feel about your personal life, even if it is still far from your vision of perfection. Instead of wasting energy focusing on what is lacking, express your gratitude for every single thing that brings you happiness in the present moment."
sagittarius,2013-12-04,"Obviously you want the good times to roll on forever, but, of course, they cannot. Thankfully, this doesn't mean that you're headed for troubled waters; it's just that your over-exuberant energy needs to mellow out for a while. When you consider your recent experiences, you can't help but realize how many wonderful blessings are present in your life, even if there are no fireworks currently lighting up the sky. Fortunately, you don't have to wait for something major to happen; share your love with those in your life who deserve it right now."
capricorn,2013-12-04,"An emotional interaction can wake you up today and remind you of something that you have been trying to avoid. Luckily, you don't have to fix everything that needs changing all at once. It's better to be a silent observer now than to push your agenda forward in a way that might not bring you any closer to happiness, anyway. Simply being more aware is sufficient to start. Letting your feelings play through as naturally as possible allows the transformation to happen on its own."
aquarius,2013-12-04,"You might decide to go into hiding now as the reflective Moon visits your reclusive 12th House, although your need for seclusion won't likely last long. Nevertheless, treat this urge for solitude with respect, especially if you have been a social butterfly recently. But don't confuse your current desire for privacy with moodiness. Although creating healthy boundaries is a great way to replenish your spirit, there's no reason to feel alone in the universe."
pisces,2013-12-04,"You aren't overly concerned with what you're supposed to do in the real world today because your dreams have grown too special to set aside. It's crucial to understand that your happiness is not dependent on acquiring more material wealth. Instead of focusing on your professional ambitions now, surround yourself with friends who encourage your spiritual growth and are willing to stand by you no matter what. Spread your wings and fly."
aries,2013-12-05,"Even if your feet are planted firmly on the ground today, your mind is beginning to drift out toward the distant edges of the universe. You have relentlessly paid attention to your thoughts in order to get to the source of your current feelings. Now it's time to simplify your thinking and free yourself from previous emotional burdens. Fortunately, making the shift might actually be  easier than it sounds once you truly let go."
taurus,2013-12-05,"Your obstinate behavior could overpower your good intentions now that the evocative Moon is in traditional Capricorn. Practicing mental flexibility is a smart strategy today, but it may be easier said than done. Nevertheless, keep reminding yourself that a stagnant mind can dam up the waters of creativity. Thankfully, an open mind allows your fertile imagination to flow with lush motivational ideas."
gemini,2013-12-05,"You are taking a more philosophical approach to relationships now that your key planet Mercury is visiting your 7th House of Partners. But you won't likely be satisfied with emotionally detached discussions unless they have a direct impact on your life. You want to see real progress, so move your conversations out of the theoretical realm and into the present moment. Choosing your words carefully improves the chances of deepening a connection between you and someone special."
cancer,2013-12-05,"Colleagues at work may be a source of tension now as they pressure you to modify your plans and take a different course of action than you initially intended. You probably can rationalize your strategy to yourself, but it's more challenging to convince others that they should cooperate with you. It might be better to bite the bullet and do what is expected today, even if only to buy some temporary peace and quiet. Return to your original ideas later when there's less resistance all around."
leo,2013-12-05,"You're on the edge of something amazing and you can feel it right to the bottom of your feet -- even if you don't yet know what it is. You may be a bit frightened at the magnitude of the changes ahead, but holding on to your past never seems to make you happy for long. Keep wiggling your toes in anticipation of what's next because your agility will suddenly become very handy when it's time to make your move. But don't rush the start; you will know when to act if you trust your instincts."
virgo,2013-12-05,"You're turning into quite the philosopher these days, which may be somewhat out of character for you. Normally, you like to focus on the most practical applications of your analytical thinking, but now you don't have to be so concerned with the mechanics of the real world. This strategy isn't an excuse for sloppy thinking. Stay sharp and let your thoughts roam free without taking any action yet."
libra,2013-12-05,"Your emotions are intensifying and it's crucial to stick with the inner process, even if it makes you feel vulnerable with those closest to you. Sometimes you take the easy way out of an emotional dilemma, for you often see both sides of an issue. However, your basic values could be at stake now, so don't be afraid to speak with integrity. You can learn something special about yourself if you stand up for what's important."
scorpio,2013-12-05,"Even if you experienced an emotional crisis with a friend or lover recently, it's time to move past the drama today and consider what's next. You still might be attached to your unresolved feelings, but these just may have to heal on their own. There's really no reason to involve others in this process. Instead, visualize a path toward a happier and healthier future. What you create in your imagination now can become reality later on."
sagittarius,2013-12-05,"You may be experiencing a refreshing wave of joyful energy. Your mind carries you to great heights now as you explore new areas of interest when cerebral Mercury is visiting your sign until December 24. Although it could feel like a breath of fresh air, be careful that your enthusiasm doesn't distract you from the real work in front of you. Adventures can be fun, but don't use them to escape your commitments."
capricorn,2013-12-05,"Your heart is softening, yet it's still challenging to risk telling others how you feel today. Paradoxically, your caution can actually make life more difficult because someone may notice that you're keeping something secret. Even with the best of intentions, hidden agendas have more impact than you realize. If you have something to say, get it out into the open where it won't do as much harm. Speak your mind and then focus on reclaiming the joy of the present moment."
aquarius,2013-12-05,Your social life is on the upswing now because you are more drawn to the energy of group dynamics with interactive Mercury visiting your 11th House of Friends. Be bold and pencil in activities for the rest of the month even if you don't have any concrete plans yet. There's no need to wait until the holidays are here to put things on your calendar. But don't just talk about it; get busy and start making the magic happen.
pisces,2013-12-05,"A shift in your workplace is underway and you may have to collaborate with your coworkers more than ever before. You might even have to step up to the plate to assume a managerial role. In any case, the hierarchy of your office or community is becoming more apparent. Find your place within the social structures and play out your part the best you can. Keep in mind that a positive attitude will take you even further on your path to success."
aries,2013-12-06,"You feel so clever today that you might grow enamored with your own wild and crazy ideas. Ironically, reality appears to encourage your thinking until you have turned up the noise too high. In order to teach you a lesson, someone may have to pull the plug on your fantasy world. It's nearly impossible to tell exactly what's happening, but if you're willing to sit still long enough to tune into your feelings, you can turn your confusion into clarity. Wait a day or two before deciding what to do next."
taurus,2013-12-06,"You might receive mixed signals from friends and associates today as you try to reestablish your lost authority. You just don't feel clear about what others are expecting of you, which may prompt you to run off and hide. But unfortunately, you can't. Talk about your predicament with someone you trust but don't make any sudden moves. Apply your common sense to the situation and keep plodding forward -- even if you aren't sure of your destination yet."
gemini,2013-12-06,"It may appear that you are indecisive, but this label doesn't even begin to touch the depth of your current uncertainty. Others might not see how distracted you are with the conflicting messages you're hearing from your own subconscious mind. Acting as if you're dazed and confused is understandable when you've already given yourself permission to go on a mental holiday. Remember, there's no need to pretend to have all the answers when you don't. Accept the fact that people love you for just being yourself."
cancer,2013-12-06,"You can feel a flood of powerful emotions as it washes over you and takes you for a ride today. However, it doesn't really matter whether or not you are a willing passenger. There is no point in fighting the currents or trying to control your feelings. Go with the flow and let the circumstances take you where they will. Ironically, relinquishing control for a while ensures that you end up where you need to be just in time."
leo,2013-12-06,"There is something powerful brewing beneath your friendly exterior. Your insecurities could play a significant role as they gnaw away at your confidence, preventing you from living life to the fullest. Still, you cannot quite put your finger on where your uncertainty originates. There is no need to run from your feelings. The elusive solution will become apparent once you are truly ready to be honest with yourself."
virgo,2013-12-06,"You might not be able to trust your own logic today, even though you Virgos are normally the champions of precision thinking. You are a study in conflict now as you swing back and forth without finding resolution. Your perceptions are like an out-of-focus camera and no matter how you change the lighting the picture is still blurry. Free your imagination from the rules for just one day and embrace the unknown."
libra,2013-12-06,"Experiencing stress doesn't motivate you to resolve a conflict between your idealistic plans and your current reality. You may want to be a superhero and save the whales or ride to the rescue to help someone special in your life. However, you might not have the resources to put your altruistic strategy into action today. Keep the faith; you will somehow find a way to be of service, even if it's not in the manner you originally imagined."
scorpio,2013-12-06,"Do your best to avoid defending your beliefs today because you probably won't be able to explain yourself succinctly, anyway. On one hand, you might exaggerate a statistic or misquote a source. On the other hand, you could present all your information correctly, only to have someone completely misunderstand what you said. Save the debate for another day and use your time in a more creative fashion now. Live your dreams instead of trying to justify them to others."
sagittarius,2013-12-06,"Your thoughts are tugging at you today like a petulant child who doesn't take well to being ignored. Mischievous Mercury is in your sign, inspiring you to tell stories before you have figured out the plot. But being practical is not your forte at this time because Mercury's alignment to spiritual Neptune draws your mind up into the clouds of illusion. Enjoy the ride on the Ferris wheel of your imagination without trying to understand what it all means. Don't worry; there will be plenty of time to work things out once you're back on the ground."
capricorn,2013-12-06,"Someone might present you with an emotional problem that doesn't seem to have an easy fix. However, it still could be necessary to drop what you're doing and place another person's agenda above yours. Don't seek rational answers now; instead, engage your intuitive powers, even if it doesn't seem very practical. It may not make complete sense yet, but you can be more helpful than you realize today by just staying in the present moment."
aquarius,2013-12-06,"New ideas are jumping into awareness now like corn popping in hot oil. You have a high level of originality and your approach to problem-solving is unconventional to say the least. However, not every brilliant idea hits the nail right on the head. Listen to the feedback you receive today and be ready to drop those thoughts that are rightfully criticized by others. As Einstein said, ""ninety-nine percent of genius is knowing what's important."""
pisces,2013-12-06,"It appears as if you're viewing the world through rose-colored glasses as communicator Mercury stresses your key planet Neptune today. In fact, everything you experience now is tinted by your own subjectivity. Although you may be looking through a filter that drops out unwanted perceptions, this doesn't mean that they aren't there. Ask someone for a reality check if things seem to be too good to be true. Remember, what you see is not always what you get."
aries,2013-12-07,"Trouble seems to find you today even if you attempt to keep your nose clean. You might try to make it through the day by focusing on your chores, but other people can still lead you astray. You may need to set your previously constructed plans aside and just figure things out as you go along. Thankfully, your enthusiastic nature could turn a temporary setback into an opportunity to bring more excitement into your life."
taurus,2013-12-07,"Your creative abilities impress others today, but you could also get so carried away with an unrealistic idea that you reveal the inner workings of an incoherent mind instead. Both extremes can be shocking, but the paradox now is that there might not be a lot of difference between appearing competent and sounding crazy. Make sure that your radical approach is justifiable before you say too much about your plans. Worry less about what anyone else thinks and more about what you need to do."
gemini,2013-12-07,"Your friends and family might not support your radical ideas today, even if you thought they would. Perhaps your allies are not available, or maybe someone is actually opposing your current plan. Either way, you must work extra hard now just to prevent losing precious ground. Although you may not make as much progress as you wish, clear communication can ultimately mean the difference between success and failure. Choose your words carefully to ensure they have maximum impact."
cancer,2013-12-07,"You thrive on being busy today, but over-scheduling yourself is not wise because one mistake could create a domino effect that messes with your entire day. Luckily, you can stack the cards in your favor by saying no to more activities before it's too late. Once you have opened up some free time on your calendar, you will be more prepared to positively respond to changes as required. Giving yourself a bit of breathing room allows you to choose the most successful path."
leo,2013-12-07,"You might not expect a money issue to hijack your day today, but don't wait for someone else to fix the problem if a financial concern arises. Fortunately, your analytical powers are sharp now, but you may be so rational in seeking a solution that you forget about the emotional consequences of your actions. You could even react so abruptly that you inadvertently hurt a partner or coworker. Be compassionate in your interactions, but don't get sidetracked by anyone else's drama. Ultimately, you only need to be responsible for yourself."
virgo,2013-12-07,"Working extra hard could backfire today as the Moon travels through your 6th House of Daily Routine. You might feel compelled to demonstrate your competence by completing all your chores, but others may find your approach intolerable because you seem so overbearing now. However, you aren't likely aware of how persistent you sound. Although your goal is simply to finish your tasks, it's smarter to temper your desire for efficiency by being less judgmental of those who have different priorities. To each his own."
libra,2013-12-07,"If someone pushes you to express something you weren't ready to reveal, your reaction might be uncharacteristically volatile today. However, it's not easy to be cool-headed if your feelings are agitated. Although losing your temper can turn your life upside down while warrior Mars is visiting your sign, anything that comes out into the open now could help to clear the air of lingering tensions."
scorpio,2013-12-07,"Declaring your desire for more independence isn't the same as actually getting it. Defining interpersonal boundaries isn't easy because you aren't all that clear about them yourself, but expressing your uncertainty can be a first step to establishing new limits. Acknowledging the changes that are on the horizon is a good place to start, but you don't have to fix everything all at once. Be patient; your perspective is gradually shifting and it may take a while for your new view to come into sharp focus."
sagittarius,2013-12-07,"Someone you look up to may be flexing his or her muscles of freedom, reminding you of your own restlessness. You might feel agitated today, like an insect before a storm. Thankfully, it's not necessary to figure out how to respond to the current situation all on your own. Instead, ask for advice from someone you trust. The wise counsel you receive now -- especially from a friend or a sibling -- can help you solve your current dilemma."
capricorn,2013-12-07,"Even if you are fairly sure about your current goals, you can still discover something today that causes you to question if you're actually on the right track. Upon closer analysis, you may realize that you're more wrapped up in existential self-doubt than needing to redirect your life's path. Being flexible is usually a smart strategy, but don't change your course now just because your self-esteem is in a temporary slump. It's wise to wait a few more days before making any major decisions."
aquarius,2013-12-07,"Taming your rebellious instincts can be challenging now, so it's best to do something to release your building frustration before it grows unmanageable. Nevertheless, the evocative Moon's current visit to your sign reinforces your need to be different. Instead of creating conflict with someone you love, find a way to express your restless energy and reduce the pressure within an intimate relationship. A little change will do you more good than you think."
pisces,2013-12-07,"You aren't likely to act very cautiously today, especially if someone confronts you about how you express your creativity. Although you might instinctively recoil from any criticism, try not to resist the good advice you receive. Responding impulsively isn't a wise strategy; exercising a bit of self-restraint, however, will ultimately enable you to increase your sense of freedom in the near future."
aries,2013-12-08,"Although you're naturally the outgoing type, problems may surface that are exacerbated today by your desire to hurry up and move on. If an acquaintance spontaneously shares a tender moment, you might try to keep your reactions hidden by acting tougher than you feel. You can even shut down emotionally if you think you are protecting someone you love. Dig deeply into your motives and examine whether you're more concerned with safeguarding yourself than anyone else. Being honest is more important now than feeding your irrational fears."
taurus,2013-12-08,"Your subconscious mind may be afraid of intimacy now, even if you exude confidence in all your personal interactions. However, this nagging fear can prevent others from getting close to you. Paradoxically, your need to cling to a difficult memory could be the very obstacle that seems to be in your way. It's confusing because you're facing the limits of your own imagination. Fortunately, the dynamics will change if you simply change your mind."
gemini,2013-12-08,"It may look like familiar territory if something in your daily routine isn't living up to your expectations. Time is running out and you might feel as if you are being given one last chance to get it right. Instead of worrying that you won't reach your goals, share your concerns with someone you trust. Putting your feelings out in the open without any negative assumptions today can shift the energy in a more positive direction. You'll never know what will happen unless you try."
cancer,2013-12-08,"You Crabs are amongst the most sensitive creatures in the entire cosmic zoo. However, if something reminds you of a past disappointment, your inclination is to shy away from interactions that restimulate the pain. Unfortunately, the very act of shielding yourself from rejection can also fulfill your worst fears by restricting the flow of love and acceptance. Don't make a decision based upon an event from long ago. Instead, open your heart and allow yourself to feel what's really happening in the present moment."
leo,2013-12-08,"You want to do what comes naturally today, but the Moon's visit to your 8th House of Intimacy reactivates a hidden struggle with your past. On one hand, practicing patience is a healthy way to avoid childish behavior. But on the other hand, your fear of failure might just seal the deal before you even try. Don't invite defeat by accepting it prematurely. You could be pleasantly surprised if you take a leap of faith and assume the best possible outcome."
virgo,2013-12-08,"An emotional dilemma seems unsolvable today as someone holds you back from experiencing the potential joy. However, upon closer examination, the real obstacle appears to be you. If your thoughts are standing in your way of happiness, you must figure out how to change your attitude. But don't waste energy blaming anyone else. It's time to face the music that you are playing -- or, even better yet, dance to it."
libra,2013-12-08,"Keeping everything light and easy today requires extra effort, even if life is looking pretty sweet. An unexpressed resentment or unfulfilled expectation can negatively influence a close relationship now, yet you also have a chance to clean up old karma by putting your feelings out on the table. Revealing your heart may be quite scary at first, but it's your ultimate ticket to love."
scorpio,2013-12-08,"Jealousy might rear its ugly head today if you let your memory of a painful event from the past spill out over into the present moment. If you are unsure of your position in a significant relationship, explore your feelings through honest dialogue, instead of unconsciously pushing a situation toward critical mass. An emotional meltdown won't stabilize the love in your life, so avoid acting on your fears. A little compassion and forgiveness are all you need to heal your heart."
sagittarius,2013-12-08,"It's not that everything is perfect today, but you may intuitively feel that it's just a matter of time until all the pieces fall into place. There might not be any apparent signs yet of your looming success, but don't let negativity bloom or it could hinder the good things already in progress. However, overconfidence isn't helpful either. Just keep the faith and stay on the same track now; the payoff will be well worth the wait."
capricorn,2013-12-08,"Applying your practical skills behind the scenes can be an effective strategy today, even if you think you should be more upfront in your actions. Don't worry needlessly about a disappointment that may or may not come to the surface later. The good news is that if you take a setback in stride, it will quickly recede into the background. Pursuing the course of least resistance now ensures the fastest route to success."
aquarius,2013-12-08,"An emotional issue that prevents you from having fun can be rather disconcerting today. Your tendency now may be to sulk instead of just handling whatever comes up in a rational manner. You might have a difficult time aligning your feelings with your actions. Ultimately, you're the one that must change; no one else can make the gray clouds go away. You can't control all the events in your life but you certainly can control your response."
pisces,2013-12-08,"Just a few days ago you could see your future clearly, but your goals are getting fuzzier and fuzzier the closer they get. It's as if you are farsighted, yet putting on reading glasses cannot help you now that the reflective Moon is back in your imaginative sign. Keep your feelings out in the open, even if you are unsure about where they are leading today. You could receive additional clarity from others if you include them in your process. But it is your faith in your dreams that will carry you to success."
aries,2013-12-09,"You may be more concerned about everyone else today than you are about yourself. Obviously, wanting to help those you love is wonderful, but trying to fix everything is not healthy. Learning to respect other people's boundaries is a huge lesson for you now because you might unconsciously ride roughshod over someone's feelings, without even realizing it. Remember, you can be of assistance by actively listening and kindly sharing your emotions; just don't try to run the show."
taurus,2013-12-09,"Thinking about cosmic questions that don't have easy answers might occupy a lot of your spare time today. Searching for the meaning of life isn't on your everyday agenda, but now it can deepen your spiritual connection. Even if you are oftentimes satisfied with simple explanations, take this opportunity to explore a more complex set of issues that go beyond finding emotional security and personal pleasure. Look within to find the solutions you seek."
gemini,2013-12-09,"An unusual turn of events might shake up your schedule, but there's no reason not to go along for the ride. Fortunately, you are able to make good use of your toolkit of clever ideas and smooth moves, which can ease the complexity. Remember, if anything goes awry now, it's most likely a sign of a deeper problem. Do whatever you must to extinguish any brush fires that smolder while continuing to work on cleaning up the underlying issues. The more effort you put in, the more you will receive in return."
cancer,2013-12-09,"Knowing exactly what's appropriate today is tricky, since your emotional boundaries may still be a bit fuzzy. You could even waste time and energy lost in feelings that actually belong to someone else. Visualizing a barrier of impenetrable white light around you can be enough to reestablish a strong perimeter that keeps out the negativity and allows you to reconnect with your center."
leo,2013-12-09,"You may be quite hopeful now about the possibilities of a new romance, yet caution is advised so you don't overlook an important piece of the puzzle. Although no one is purposefully trying to mislead you, everything is not exactly as it seems. It's your willingness to give others the benefit of the doubt that can create problems. A healthy dose of realism today saves you from disappointment tomorrow."
virgo,2013-12-09,"A challenging relationship issue may give you a headache today, but if you face the situation with a realistic attitude, you'll be thankful in the long run. You could learn something crucial that helps you to see things more clearly in the days ahead. However, burying your head in the sand is not a viable strategy. Dealing with the truth that is right in front of you creates a foundation strong enough to endure the current circumstances without having to retreat. Handle the situation the best you can and don't look back."
libra,2013-12-09,"Maintaining a steady work pace while taking care of business is difficult today, but pushing yourself harder won't necessarily be an efficient strategy. Try cutting yourself some slack and let your energy ebb and flow throughout the day without attempting to control it. In between short bursts of concentrated effort, make time to revel in your creative side, even if you aren't productive for a while. Think of yourself as a metaphysical surfer; ride the waves while the surf's up and regroup when it's calm."
scorpio,2013-12-09,"Making enough time to commune with nature or with your inner guides can turn today into a sweet memory. Even if you have responsibilities to fulfill, don't cheat yourself out of the magic you might find by creating a bit of solitude. Thankfully, your imagination reveals unconventional solutions to mundane problems if you successfully quiet your thoughts. Giving yourself permission to be spontaneous now empowers you to move through a current roadblock. Listening to your intuition is a good place to start."
sagittarius,2013-12-09,"Your sound judgment pours from you so smoothly today, you may not realize how much you help someone else. You have a great deal of philosophical and spiritual wisdom to share, and this is your chance to return the generosity that others have shown you in the past. There's no need to seek recognition or approval now; giving back to those who require assistance is its own sweet reward."
capricorn,2013-12-09,"Making intelligent decisions could be tricky business today because your mind isn't on your regular mundane concerns. You may be drifting around in your own private fantasy, instead of carefully calculating how to reach your next set of goals. Don't try to suppress your dreams even if they seem unreachable; there are treasures waiting for your discovery within the realms of your imagination. Open the door and let them in."
aquarius,2013-12-09,"You may have to deal with complicated money issues today, yet you can avert a messy problem if you face them head on as soon as they surface. Although the current situation might not seem like a significant concern in the big picture, it's still a smart idea to consider what you could learn from exploring all your options before making an important decision. However, if your intuition tells you one thing and logic points elsewhere, go with the facts for now."
pisces,2013-12-09,"You are happily splashing around in your own watery element today and are able to dive deeper into your dreams if you so choose. This can be a most luxurious time if you are in a positive state of mind. But if you are even mildly depressed, you could find yourself drowning in your own tears. Don't be afraid to talk about your fears with a trusted friend. The first step to getting help is asking for it. Remember, Fish are most content when they are swimming in a school of like-minded souls."
aries,2013-12-10,"You are not a stranger to overextending your energy and you could fall into this all-too-familiar trap today unless you take necessary precautions. Fortunately, avoiding problems is easy now if you're willing to scale back on your promises and your plans before you're in over your head. However, it's much trickier to find your way back to a manageable place if you wait until you're already exhausted. Incorporate realistic thinking into your day while you're still ahead of the curve."
taurus,2013-12-10,"You can talk a big game today, but playing it according to your plan won't be as simple as you wish. It's easy to minimize important details, but they might come back to haunt you before you're able to fulfill your commitments. Recognizing that everything appears better than it actually is now may be enough to prevent an uncomfortable situation from developing later in the day. Taking time to reassess the situation before jumping in enables you to put everything into a healthier perspective."
gemini,2013-12-10,"It's never wise to shoot the messenger, especially if he's bearing good news. But your key planet Mercury is the Trickster, possibly stirring up trouble if you automatically believe what you hear. Don't take everything at face value today or you will encourage the delivery of more exaggerated information. The truth is being stretched now, but you can save yourself from a headache by verifying all the facts as you go along. Nevertheless, keeping an open mind allows your friends to surprise you with a bit of unexpected fun."
cancer,2013-12-10,"Although you probably still have your share of problems, they appear to be more manageable today. Your current willingness to take a risk increases your options now, but more alternatives don't necessarily mean that any of them will be the right one. Standing up and defending your point of view sooner than later enables you to avoid potential conflict before it grows out of hand. Ultimately, others will appreciate you even more if you honor your integrity from the start."
leo,2013-12-10,"Be sure that you're motivated by good intentions if you involve others in your drama today, rather than just wanting to garner extra attention. Your current crisis really does need to be handled and, thankfully, someone may ask the right questions that can help you focus your thoughts. Your intuition won't steer you in the wrong direction now, but you still need to bring your brilliant ideas down to earth. A pragmatic approach helps you capture the magic of this inspiring moment."
virgo,2013-12-10,"Your current business savvy is admirable, but your analytical superpowers could turn you into someone who can find justification for anything you want to do. Your ruling planet Mercury is on fire today, and may lure you down a slippery slope of inflated confidence. Instead of wasting time trying to rationalize your choices, pay attention to the feedback you receive and adjust your course of action as necessary. Acting on the advice of others paves the road to your success."
libra,2013-12-10,"You don't enjoy arguing with anyone, but you might need to speak up and give someone a piece of your mind today, anyhow. Just be careful because you're likely to get caught in a whirlwind of fast-moving energies that can spin you up into the jet streams and quickly carry you far from home. Luckily, you should be able to talk your way into or out of nearly anything now. Relying on your charm and cleverness works in your favor when you need it most."
scorpio,2013-12-10,"Overspending to impress someone you love may not be as appreciated as you wish. In fact, you can't accurately express your feelings by buying anything material. Instead of putting yourself in a precarious position by going over budget on something that's unnecessary, try stating what you're feeling as directly as possible. Your message is much more powerful today if you simply speak from your heart."
sagittarius,2013-12-10,You may feel like a bee that's drunk on pollen in a field of blooming wildflowers. Every brilliant thought you have is the best one ever and leads to yet another one. The supply seems endless as the radiant Sun aligns with bountiful Jupiter to inflate your confidence. But others might not agree with your positive assessments; they could even think that your optimism is foolish. Waiting a day or two before making any final decisions helps you pick the best idea and develop a successful plan of action.
capricorn,2013-12-10,"You're quite confident today, but an unexpected event might require you to put your perspective back in balance. You can maintain a spiritual point of view based on the idea that everything is exactly as it should be at this time. But don't use this line of reasoning to justify your inaction. Ultimately, working toward a significant goal will make you feel better, even if you don't see any real progress for a few more days."
aquarius,2013-12-10,"You might lose focus today because it seems more fun to imagine your future than to live in the present moment. Unfortunately, putting all your eggs in the basket of hope shifts your concentration away from what you currently need to be doing. Imagining the possibilities of what may come to pass is often a useful endeavor; however, it can also get in the way of the work that's right in front of you. The real challenge is not to achieve your long-term goals; it's to remain present in the here and now."
pisces,2013-12-10,"It may feel as if you have another chance to grab the brass ring, yet your time is quickly running out. However, the sense of urgency that you're experiencing now is based on a faulty assumption. Although your current actions seem to wield more power than usual, pushing too hard can stir up more resistance than you need. Ironically, backing off just a bit might actually enable you to reach your goals sooner than you expect."
aries,2013-12-11,"Your refusal to take no for an answer now motivates you to find an original solution to an ongoing problem. Thankfully, you're able to sustain a high level of energy today, turning you into a hero at work. However, you must stay fully focused on your goals or you could be tempted to set aside meeting responsibilities in favor of having fun. Don't give up; the satisfaction you gain by creating something lasting is much more fulfilling than the memory of fleeting pleasure."
taurus,2013-12-11,"Conforming to your regular routine can be a real challenge today because your emotions seem to have a life of their own. Your reactions aren't necessarily rational, especially if friends or coworkers expect you to join them on a social outing. You may think that you don't have the time for such frivolity, but it might be wise to go ahead and participate anyway. Thankfully, you won't need to run away from your obligations; they will still be waiting for you when you return. A little joy in your heart serves you well."
gemini,2013-12-11,"Talking yourself into going along with the group sounds like a good idea, but you still may modify your plans during the day and end up doing something on your own. Although you could blame your change of mind on the current situation, it's better to take full responsibility for your decision instead. It's okay to acknowledge that you're feeling stifled now and need some immediate action. Fortunately, you don't have to hold yourself back today, since your spontaneous behavior will likely lead you in the right direction."
cancer,2013-12-11,"You may be provoked to initiate action at work today by someone who goads you into stepping beyond your normal limits. Even if an outrageous plan sounds enticing, the very idea of doing anything so unconventional might make you feel anxious. Thankfully, you could receive support from the most unlikely sources now. Go ahead and spread your wings and fly; you'll never know how far you can get if you don't at least try."
leo,2013-12-11,"Your optimistic attitude might tempt you to express previously hidden feelings, but saying too much could turn into something you later regret. Take your time and carefully consider your words and actions today before following an impulsive whim. Thankfully, there are many shades of gray, so you won't have to make an all-or-nothing decision. Don't go overboard with your disclosure; exercising a bit of caution now is your best strategy to keep the energy moving in a positive direction."
virgo,2013-12-11,"You're more restless today than anyone realizes, but you're doing a good job of hiding your excitement. You may appear to be much more serious than you actually feel. Be careful; if someone close to you is ready for action, you might just cut loose and join in. However, as long as you stay conscious of your obligations, you should be able to slip away for some fun and get back before anyone even notices that you're gone. A little change can shake things up just enough to be interesting."
libra,2013-12-11,"You could work yourself up into a state of anxiety today as you compare your ideal fantasies with the realities of the day. You really don't want to repeat an old routine in the exact same way you did it before. You're intrigued by doing things differently now, and anything or anyone unconventional is appealing to you. However, just because you can imagine it, doesn't mean that you should make it real. Using your common sense enables you to enjoy your daydreams without having to experience disappointment later on."
scorpio,2013-12-11,"Although your day flows pretty smoothly, you may still want more freedom than you have today. Thankfully, your workday could allow you more opportunity for independence, so trying something new makes a lot of sense. Don't close yourself off to unrealized possibilities before you even explore your options. Muster up an extra bit of courage, take a risk and let others know what you need; you might be happily surprised with the support you receive."
sagittarius,2013-12-11,"You enjoy having fun and playing games, but the excitement level could end up being a bit too much today, even for you adventurous Archers. Your feelings are inconsistent now, and it might seem as if your attention should be elsewhere no matter what you do. Nevertheless, the lack of stability increases your attraction to the thrill of the uncertainty. Enjoy the buzz while it lasts, for things will begin to settle back down in a couple of days."
capricorn,2013-12-11,"You might be uncomfortable with the current emotional turmoil, yet nothing you do seems to calm your inner turbulence. You're better off now to let go and ride the rough waves instead of attempting to resist them and change your direction. Thankfully, your anxiety begins to dissipate once you concentrate on maintaining balance, rather than trying to manage all the variables in your environment at once. Paradoxically, loosening your grip on the future ultimately puts you back in control where you belong."
aquarius,2013-12-11,"Nothing is as simple as it could be if only you were willing to share your feelings today. Although you may know exactly what you want and where you are going, you might not wish to involve others in your process yet. Your impatience tempts you to jump the gun and impulsively do something foolish now before you have the support of your allies. Move carefully and think twice prior to doing anything rash. Rest assured you have more time than you realize."
pisces,2013-12-11,"You're so eager to try something that's outside your comfort zone today that your sudden actions can take others by surprise. Unfortunately, they may judge you unkindly because of your erratic behavior; they might even accuse you of being immature or irresponsible. Nevertheless, act with confidence and express who you are and what you want. This is your moment of truth, regardless of anyone else's expectations. The only person you need to please is yourself."
aries,2013-12-12,"You don't have to take charge by acting in a dictatorial manner, even if you believe you know what needs to be done. Although you are a champion of choosing the fastest route to your destination, there are other ways to reach your goals today. Yours may be the best method for you, but it might not work as well for someone else. It's better to give up control around the outer edges of your life now and let some things run their own course."
taurus,2013-12-12,"You should be able to accomplish your objectives today, but you might start out distracted by an inner conflict as you contemplate the best way to assert yourself in the current situation. You may struggle reining in your emotions this morning, but steadfast support from a close friend has a calming influence. Relationship dynamics improve as the day wears on, freeing you to find a sustainable pace at work. In the meantime, any movement is better than inaction even if you don't see tangible results until later on."
gemini,2013-12-12,"It's probably not a trivial issue if you're concerned about your current obligations to coworkers. However, your mental gyrations might actually push you to a critical point as you turn your thoughts into effective action. You know that you shouldn't let a crucial opportunity slip away now without making your move. Go forward with determination; your efforts will pay off in ways you can't yet imagine."
cancer,2013-12-12,"Your resolve deepens today and may turn into an obsession unless you're able to put your goals into a healthier perspective. Fortunately, you seem to have a natural ability to know when to let go because your intuition is right on target now. Don't waste energy second guessing your decisions. Overcome your insecurities and trust your judgment. If you keep your eyes on the prize, you'll be amazed by the progress you make over time."
leo,2013-12-12,"You must wield your power carefully because your actions have greater consequences now than you realize. However, it's crucial to lead by example and not by intimidation. Use of force isn't effective and only encourages others to resist getting in line with your goals. You have a deep pool of physical and mental energy today, so make these days as productive and positive as you can."
virgo,2013-12-12,"Although you may be unsure of your goals now, you can lean on your close friends and associates for a reality check. However, once you let others help you reach a decision about your course of action, you must rely solely on your own practical and efficient manner to achieve the results you want. The good news is your high level of integrity has come through for you in the past and it will do so again today."
libra,2013-12-12,"Your long-term career goals are on your mind today but you might not choose to share your plans with anyone else yet. You can achieve the greatest satisfaction by considering various scenarios and imagining your future success. Luckily, these thoughts are not just idle fantasies now because you also have the ability to work hard and improve your life. Don't expect immediate results; some things are worth waiting for more than others."
scorpio,2013-12-12,"Your tendency toward concentrating on a single task might make you seem a bit ruthless now, but it's a small price to pay for achieving your goals. Others may feel as if they are in your way unless they agree to do everything you suggest. But you don't have to be so quick to push your agenda. Even if it doesn't seem apparent at first, there's always room for compromise. Success is within reach if you can establish a productive routine to follow during the next several weeks."
sagittarius,2013-12-12,"You have a high level of concentration today, especially if you establish clear objectives because karmic Saturn is harmonizing with your key planet Jupiter. Instead of inflating your confidence to cover your uncertainty, you're able to keep your optimism on a long slow burn, sustaining a steady level of production. Remember, practicing patience can buy you the time you presently need, but there's no substitute for solid preparation and hard work. Don't jump yet; leap only when you feel ready."
capricorn,2013-12-12,"You are very conscious of interpersonal boundaries now and could go out of your way to clarify the dynamics in your relationships. Thankfully, others can bring you a sense of well-being as your key planet Saturn harmonizes with generous Jupiter in your 7th House of Companions. You may feel disarmed by someone's encouragement, prompting you to let down your guard. However, you're acutely aware of your goals and how to achieve them, so there's no danger in being subsumed by someone else's agenda. Open your heart and let the force be with you."
aquarius,2013-12-12,"You aren't in a mood to be messed with today, especially if your work has piled up and you feel pressure to meet your obligations. You won't let anything prevent you from accomplishing your goals. Thankfully, your coworkers may turn out to be a source of much-needed support. It's a blessing to have good people around you who can jump in and offer useful assistance at exactly the right moment. There's no need to shoulder the burden alone; gratefully accept the help in the manner it is intended."
pisces,2013-12-12,"Expressing yourself creatively might be more important to you than to anyone else in your environment. Other people may question your motives or even ask you to do additional tasks for them. Luckily, you're not easily sidetracked now, even if you don't have much to show for your efforts at first. But don't slip into the tempting waters of irrational self-doubt. No one can pull the rug out from underneath you if you remember that your instincts are trustworthy and rarely steer you wrong."
aries,2013-12-13,"Money issues may be on your mind today, raising concerns with a coworker or partner as you figure out the best way to handle the problem. Even if you have a viable solution, the path might not be easy now. Your unrealistic optimism could be upsetting to someone else who is familiar with the situation. You're tempted to slip into denial and just let the whole thing slide. Unfortunately, this is not your best choice. Facing a predicament head on takes courage, but can bring the resolution you desire."
taurus,2013-12-13,"Digging in your heels and maintaining your current emotional perspective might be your first choice, but you'll be better off in the long run if you can adopt a more flexible attitude. It might feel as if you're being tested to see what is most important to you. Prioritize your needs and compromise on those issues that are not crucial. It's better to lose a few battles along the way so you can win the war in the long run."
gemini,2013-12-13,"Keeping a secret is not the easiest thing for you chatty Twins, yet today this is exactly what you must do. Don't let anyone talk you into disclosing anything that you aren't ready to share. Be careful if your high expectations lead you to place too much trust in someone else. For now, it's more important to process your feelings out of sight. Listening to your own wise counsel might require solitude, but it's the best thing you can do for your heart."
cancer,2013-12-13,"Relying on your friends today sounds like a good idea, but they might offer to help you in ways that are different from what you prefer. Unfortunately, your rigidity can get in the way of useful assistance. Instead of putting up walls because you don't want anyone to sense your insecurities, just tell the truth exactly as you perceive it. You may be surprised how gentle others will be with you now if you are willing to let down your guard."
leo,2013-12-13,"You may judge yourself harshly if you don't live up to your own high standards now, but you still tend to keep your shortcomings under wraps. Acting as if you have it all together at work is a mixed blessing because you could inadvertently isolate yourself through your lack of honest communication. In order to overcome any self-esteem issues, it can be helpful to look at your current situation as one that will ultimately teach you a deep spiritual truth. Forgiving yourself is the first step to creating positive change."
virgo,2013-12-13,"Just because you know where you're going doesn't mean that you know the best way to get there. You want to be practical because you instinctively understand how much having your feet on the ground will help. However, it's challenging to focus your attention on the details now, no matter how important they may be to your strategy. Allow yourself to meander through your imagination for a couple more days before deciding which path to take."
libra,2013-12-13,"You might feel as if you're caught in the middle of a conflict today and your involvement may be unavoidable. It's imperative not to take sides if you are going to be of any value in this situation, for in doing so you lose the title of diplomat and become immersed in the battle. Remaining neutral allows you to be effective without becoming swept up in the emotional turmoil. Assuming the role of a mediator makes the best use of your talents."
scorpio,2013-12-13,"Someone might enter your life today with a burst of energy, apparently quite certain about what you should do. Impulsively, you want to trust his or her perspective, but the more you listen, the less sure you are about your next move. Remaining open to another person's point of view is one thing; doing what they tell you is something else. Accept good advice for what it's worth, but trust your own intuition for the best results."
sagittarius,2013-12-13,"Your fantasies may turn to romance, but just because you can go there in your mind doesn't mean that it would be a good idea to follow through in reality. In fact, you might already have previous responsibilities that leave little time for the enjoyment that dangles in front of you like a carrot. Be sensible and take care of your obligations today before pursuing the bright lights of potential pleasure."
capricorn,2013-12-13,"Although you often have a pragmatic way of looking at the world, it may be challenging to maintain a realistic course of action today. Fascinating distractions pull you first one way and then another, even as you attempt to do the right thing. Instead of forcing yourself to work, it's better to cut yourself some slack and enjoy the diversions coming your way. You might learn something vital about your personal growth and you'll be able to return to your chores with a refreshingly different outlook."
aquarius,2013-12-13,"You may be torn between what your senses tell you today and where your dreams are pulling you. This internal conflict might not be a new dilemma, yet it could seem increasingly important now. Unfortunately, your options become less clear the more you struggle. Instead of believing that you must choose between your head and your heart, forge a new path between the extremes to include both."
pisces,2013-12-13,"Your day may be much busier than you wish, yet there seems little you can do to lighten your load. Fortunately, you might have a great time interacting with your colleagues while accomplishing your work along the way. Instead of hiding your feelings for the sake of efficiency, integrate them into your discussions. Oddly enough, you are more productive if you continue to let people know how you feel. Others appreciate getting to know the real you."
aries,2013-12-14,"It seems as if everything that is being told to you is in line with what you perceive, but upon more careful analysis something appears to be out of sync. Unfortunately, you may not be able to put your concerns into words. But if you do give voice to your feelings, you could inadvertently strengthen them. It's better to hold steady and let the awkwardness pass before you say anything you regret. Timing is everything."
taurus,2013-12-14,"People are acting strange today and if you try to determine the reasons by asking questions, you may be unpleasantly surprised with their answers. Even if you mean no offense, someone might feel as if you are being overly critical or even on the attack. Don't stir up unnecessary conflict now; one of your greatest strengths is being able to stoically maintain the status quo while chaos ensues around you. Quit worrying about other people's reactions and just focus on what you can do to make the world a better place."
gemini,2013-12-14,"You might unintentionally agitate someone's fears today if you overstep your bounds. A close friend may be more worried about loss of control than you realize, and your actions could tread on his or her territory. Since you're not trying to take over, you probably won't even realize the impact of your actions until it's too late. If a conflict erupts, quickly retreat since nothing is gained by turning a disagreement into a major argument. Your best strategy is to take the high road, apologize and move on."
cancer,2013-12-14,"You can't help but fear the worst about a storm that you see brewing on the home front. However, your current concerns could actually add to the tension, unless you intentionally try to defuse the stress by bringing the topic up in a conversation. Worrying will only make matters worse, but actively doing something can clear the air and turn things around. Be brave and make the first move; others will appreciate it more than you think."
leo,2013-12-14,"Someone in your family might not be fully honest today, but they believe that their failure to tell you the complete truth is for your own good. You, on the other hand, know better. You understand that there are deep differences of opinion on a matter that won't come to an easy resolution from one quick conversation. Although the lack of disclosure bothers you, it's not your place to bring up the subject now. Take a deep breath and walk away."
virgo,2013-12-14,"It feels like one of those strange days when extraterrestrials could land in your front yard and that would just be one more situation to handle. Events that might otherwise be extraordinary seem as if they are as plain and ordinary as could be now. Of course, this is because unusual is the new normal today. Taking it all in stride is a wise idea, but don't minimize something special when it happens. Magic is everywhere you look."
libra,2013-12-14,"You are more singularly focused these days as if you have a final exam coming up soon and you need to be fully prepared. But taking your regular responsibilities too seriously today may lead you to miss an important experience. A subtle feeling washes over you to remind you of how wonderful life can be in the present moment. Doing your best is admirable, but performance isn't everything."
scorpio,2013-12-14,"You could pick up on messages from other dimensions today if you are psychically sensitive enough. However, even if you don't hear anything, you'll still know that something special is happening now. Either way, rest assured that you are in tune with a transformational cosmic song that's being played for you, whether or not you can make out the words. Giving yourself time and space to listen increases the positive impact of this magical experience."
sagittarius,2013-12-14,"You may try to do whatever is necessary to remain focused on your chores today. However, it becomes increasingly more difficult as unexpressed feelings color your attitude and distract your attention. Keep in mind that you don't have to be on task every minute of the day. Taking a time out can lift your spirits and ultimately make you more productive in the long run."
capricorn,2013-12-14,"Although you're quite capable of keeping your feet on the ground, you're visiting a parallel universe now that several supernatural septiles sweep you onto a magical mystery tour. Just because you are able to justify your current goals, though, doesn't make them sensible. Acknowledging that you aren't a good judge of practicality today gives you a perfect reason to put off a major decision until your thoughts return to earth."
aquarius,2013-12-14,"You may think that family commitments are holding you back, but being held accountable for your obligations now can actually help you stay on track. Although you're attracted to some rather eccentric ideas, today's Taurus Moon is a tangible reminder that there is beauty in simplicity. Fulfilling your promises isn't all there is to life, but at least it's a good start to feeling a sense of personal satisfaction. Sometimes the greatest mystery is right in front of your nose. All you need to do is believe."
pisces,2013-12-14,"Today's events have a surreal overtone to them as several otherworldly septiles lure you down the magical rabbit hole. You might incorrectly think you can explain your motives right away, but they are too complicated for anyone to understand. Thankfully, you should be able to convey how you're inspired by your visions if you are patient. But don't lean exclusively on words; you'll get the most benefit out of your current interactions if you use your sixth sense to connect, instead. Relax and let your intuition be your guide."
aries,2013-12-15,"You might feel more optimistic about your future today, even if you can't shake all of your lingering problems. Your growing confidence is supported by coworkers and friends who are enthusiastic about your ideas. Although something still seems missing, try not to make any major changes to your previous plans. Holding your current course now is your best strategy in the long run."
taurus,2013-12-15,"Paying attention to what's most significant is growing more complicated today even if you try to concentrate on just one issue. However, someone or something may come along now, distracting you into scattering your energy before you realize what happened. You might not be able to stop your mind from wandering, but your conscious intervention can pull you back to reality before you falter. Controlling your thoughts subsequently improves your chances for success."
gemini,2013-12-15,"You have been anticipating a change in direction for a while, and now is the time to make your big move. It might seem as if a minor adjustment is all that's needed, but a twist on the road of life can turn out to be a significant one. Don't make choices based on a whim of the moment; consider your options carefully and then run with the one that will carry you the farthest."
cancer,2013-12-15,"Your friends might get on your nerves today, especially if they seem to be unreasonably determined to have their own way. You can't comprehend how anyone could remain so completely blind while facing contradictory facts. Don't show others the errors of their ways now; everyone needs to learn their lessons on their own. Meanwhile, clean up your own yard before worrying about anything else. Lead by example instead of telling people what to do."
leo,2013-12-15,"It's fun to connect with your friends in a social situation today, enabling you to express your more playful side. However, you might be tempted to overdo the celebrating now. Rather than unconsciously wasting your physical energy on passing pleasures, pay attention to where your interactions with others take you. Make intelligent decisions based only on how you want your day to unfold. You will be happier with the results if you take charge of your destiny with a sense of purpose."
virgo,2013-12-15,"Your thoughts are focused on decisions you must make at work next week, but you still can clearly see two opposing solutions to your problem. It's tough to pick one path over another, for they both have distinct advantages and disadvantages. However, you will have to make a choice soon, so jot down the pros and cons of each option and then choose wisely. Fortunately, there are no wrong answers as long as you take the time to step through your analytical process."
libra,2013-12-15,"You have plenty of interesting ideas today, but it's difficult to focus on any particular scenario at a time. You want to explore a variety of options to determine your future and don't want to be limited by just one choice. Fortunately, there's no reason to narrow your thinking at this time. Just enjoy playing with all the possibilities and leave the big questions for another day."
scorpio,2013-12-15,"You are often ready to dig down to the center of complex circumstances to discover the buried truth. But now you might try to avoid any extra emotional intensity by tap dancing around the edges of a significant issue. Even if you feel isolated, you don't have to solve every single mystery today just to gain acceptance. Give yourself permission to go along with the currents long enough to see where they take you."
sagittarius,2013-12-15,"Everyone might appear to be moving too fast for your liking today. You could even try to slow others down by engaging them in philosophical conversations, but your workmates are nearly as distracted as you are now. It may be easier to withdraw, instead of attempting to control what's happening around you. There's nothing wrong with taking some time to be alone for a while. Reconnecting with your own center revitalizes your energy so you can keep up with the busy pace of the season."
capricorn,2013-12-15,"You might grow increasingly anxious today as you temporarily lose control of your schedule. Prioritizing your responsibilities is helpful because you need to acknowledge that you can't do everything that is being asked of you now. Leaving a job unfinished for a bit longer may be frustrating at first, but it's the best way to manage the current complexity. Be gentle with yourself; you are only human after all."
aquarius,2013-12-15,"You're like the Energizer bunny today and your spirits lift as things begin to improve all around you. You're able to fully enjoy yourself while meeting your obligations now, but you're certainly busier than normal. It's tempting to bite off more than you can chew, but it's a wiser idea to practice a bit of self-control. If you don't go running around all over the place, you might just accomplish more than you expect."
pisces,2013-12-15,"You may be surprised or even shocked by how much there is to do today, even when you're securely situated inside of your castle. The reflective Moon's current visit to your 4th House of Home and Family highlights your need to retreat from the fast pace of modern life. Practice enjoying the distractions instead of trying to shut them out. There will be more time to relax next week once your chores are done."
aries,2013-12-16,"You may be feeling extremely enthusiastic today as effervescent Jupiter pumps up your optimism. Even if you are facing tough circumstances, you can still find something positive to focus on. But don't paint such a worry-free picture that you overlook an important truth right before your eyes. Instead, map out a realistic strategy for the upcoming months ahead and concentrate on accomplishing your goals. Sheer determination and hard work could be all you need to make your dreams come true."
taurus,2013-12-16,"New perspectives continue to expand your understanding of the big world outside your door. You are going on a journey within your mind, so take every opportunity you can to learn more about yourself as you travel. Explore your interests in religion, philosophy, or metaphysics, even if you are normally concerned with more mundane things. Put your current inspiration to work by doing your best to discover the secrets of the universe."
gemini,2013-12-16,"Your moods may be a bit uncontrollable today, prompting you to react without thinking. Usually, you're the one who cleverly motivates others, but the tables are turned for the next few weeks as your associates push you into action. You won't be able to get away without cooperating, so use this time to act in a forward-thinking manner instead of waiting until it's too late. It's okay to take a risk, but allowing others to lead may be more productive for now."
cancer,2013-12-16,"Your big ideas might not solve any work-related issues, but they do help you think more globally. You could try to bury your feelings so you can kick yourself into action today, but you could move so fast that you overdo it. Don't let your impulsive excitement lead you into any agreements that limit your range of action or you may feel stuck until the end of the year. Relying on your natural cautious instincts now works in your favor."
leo,2013-12-16,"You receive an encouraging boost of energy today from witty Mercury as it stirs up colorful ideas in your 5th House of Creativity; however, it's your decision on how best to use your current inspiration. You may be highly productive or choose to have a whole lot of fun instead. The good news is that you can get the best of both worlds, applying your playful spirit in a spontaneous way whether you are at work or at home. Whatever you do, don't waste this magical moment."
virgo,2013-12-16,Your primary concern over the following weeks may involve finding the right mixture of enthusiasm and restraint as you vacillate between moving forward with your career aspirations and retreating into the safety of your nest. Your best strategy might be to avoid making a final decision for a while. Let the internal conflict inspire you to imagine new possibilities even while circumstances continue to slow you down.
libra,2013-12-16,"You may feel another surge of mental energy as you search for long-term solutions to current problems. But don't squander a wonderful opportunity by staying within your head. Now that you are buzzing, do something about it and initiate a bold move. Don't get hung up wondering if you are making the right decision or not; any movement now is better than waiting for the perfect moment. Strike while the iron is hot."
scorpio,2013-12-16,"Your financial security might seem so important to you now that you're tempted to set aside matters of the heart so you can focus on managing your business. Of course you realize your silence will not last forever, so you're probably just delaying the inevitable. Although your self-esteem may be shaky today, you could boost your confidence by pushing past your fears and guiding your actions from a place of love."
sagittarius,2013-12-16,"The party vibes kick up another notch as jovial Jupiter spreads his good cheer all over the place. You may feel charged up with an energetic buzz, allowing you to enjoy just about anything that attracts your attention. Unfortunately, your short-term enthusiasm can temporarily overwhelm your long-term strategic goals. Beware of saying yes too quickly, even if you are more than ready for whatever happens next. A little bit of caution improves your chances of success."
capricorn,2013-12-16,"Preventing your feelings from bottling up within you is critical today because your intentions will probably slip out even if you don't express what's on your mind. Taking full responsibility for your needs is much more admirable than playing the role of a victim. Your ambitions may be honorable, but circumstances can quickly get muddled unless you are prepared to walk your emotional talk. Thankfully, your sense of integrity will see you through."
aquarius,2013-12-16,"You might be very surprised with all the changes occurring in your life. Your social calendar continues to get even busier as friendly Mercury is activated in your 11th House of Friends. Enjoy the energetic shift outward as you think about filling up your calendar with exciting activities. Just remember that it's okay to turn down an invitation if you don't feel up to it, for there will be plenty more opportunities for fun throughout the holiday season."
pisces,2013-12-16,"Although you may be a fairly private person, you now have a chance to show the world how well you can play with others. Perhaps you feel more ambitious today, yet you're not certain how best to apply your efforts. Don't worry about finalizing a new plan, for your greatest strength today is your ability to make it up as you go along. Have faith in the process of collaboration and be ready to create positive change."
aries,2013-12-17,"Self-indulgence isn't necessarily a bad thing, as long as it's in moderation. But self-restraint may be elusive today as the Gemini Full Moon lights up your 3rd House of Information, unless you stay on your toes. You are compelled to share what you feel and your moods are intense and immediate now. Before going to extremes, examine the negative consequences of expressing your moods too soon. This proactive approach will help you gain a healthier perspective."
taurus,2013-12-17,"You may be lured out past your regular boundaries of safety as the restless Gemini Full Moon rattles your 2nd House of Core Beliefs. Resistance is futile, but going along with the flow doesn't necessarily mean slipping into denial if your values are tested. You might even feel as if you're being overloaded with too much information. Thankfully, relief arrives when the evocative Moon sinks into care-giving Cancer later in the day, shifting the focus to your heart."
gemini,2013-12-17,"You're experiencing the pull of your own feelings quite strongly now, but it may be difficult to act as today's Gemini Full Moon floods your sign with a variety of emotions. The biggest danger you currently face is a loss of perspective, making it easier to blow something out of proportion. Even if you feel strongly about your opinion, let the energies settle for a day or two before sharing what's on your mind."
cancer,2013-12-17,"It's all about how you process feelings and then talk about them as the clever Gemini Full Moon brightens your 12th House of Destiny. The seas of your emotions are normally contained securely within your boundaries. However, you're riding the emotional high tides and there may be little you can do now to keep your dreams, desires and fears from flooding right out into the open where everyone can see them. Fortunately, your vulnerability could ultimately deepen the bonds between you and those you love."
leo,2013-12-17,"No matter how hard you try to meet someone's expectations now that the Full Moon emphasizes your 11th House of Social Networking, you can't really be everything to everyone in your life. Even if you are gloriously multitalented and multifaceted, you can still be pulled into something too deeply. If you find you are in over your head today, begin a gentle self-extraction from the situation. Expressing what's in your heart doesn't necessarily require the approval of anyone else."
virgo,2013-12-17,"Today's energy may bring a bit of emotional anguish as you wish the complexity of life's circumstances would settle down. Your feelings are in the spotlight now that the reflective Full Moon is highlighting your 10th House of Ambitions. You might be nostalgic, but you must focus on the present and not the past. Make the mental adjustments necessary to balance your future objectives with the current circumstances. But don't settle for less; just acknowledge that it could take more time to reach your goals."
libra,2013-12-17,"You could easily spend your day talking with friends and sharing your ideas about what you want to do with your life now that the chatty Gemini Full Moon is agitating your 9th House of Big Ideas. Your emotions are all over the map today, but you are intently fixated on the potential of your own future. Although this may not be the best time to make firm plans, it's a great time to imagine the plethora of possibilities that are in front of you."
scorpio,2013-12-17,"You understand the big picture in theory, but in practice it's difficult to apply what you know today. Your mind is on overdrive now as it runs through every possible scenario. The flexible Gemini Full Moon falls in your 8th House of Deep Sharing, intensifying your resolve to make the most of your current relationship situation -- even if it's not ideal. Let logic be your guide until the Moon shifts into emotional Cancer and you are back in your element."
sagittarius,2013-12-17,"You are influenced by the inconstant feelings of people around you as the changeable Gemini Full Moon shines in your 7th House of Relationships. A close partner may be the source of a minor conflict now, distracting you from what you prefer to be doing. But don't ignore the messages you are receiving today because you have something special to learn from the differences of opinion between you and others. Open your heart and listen to those you love."
capricorn,2013-12-17,"You might not know how you got yourself into such an awkward predicament today. Unfortunately, you won't escape from your dilemma by just walking away now that the Gemini Full Moon stimulates your 6th House of Employment. This is a very busy time and there are many things that need your attention. You feel tugged in too many ways and it's difficult to know exactly where to begin. Take a deep breath and a small step. And then take another one. You're already on the road to success -- even if your destination still feels far away."
aquarius,2013-12-17,"Don't attempt to make everything fit into place now that the flighty Gemini Full Moon occurs in your 5th House of Self-Expression. Although you want full resolution, you need to let go before you have all the answers. It might even be fun if you take a risk and share your feelings with those involved. But you could have some apprehension, for you sense that things are not going to unfold the way you envisioned them. You may want to run out on your responsibilities today, but some issues are just too important to ignore."
pisces,2013-12-17,"You feel as if you must do something immediately to exercise your control in the outer world, but the Gemini Full Moon emphasizes your 4th House of Home and Family, drawing your energy inward. You can think of each and every possible option, as if you were playing a game of chess. But it's just too much today to keep it all in order. You may have to throw in the towel and just ride the uncertain waves of emotional change to see where the currents will take you."
aries,2013-12-18,"You're ready to make something happen, but acting in an aggressive manner isn't such a wise idea today. Rather than rushing into a new project or activity, allow some time to assimilate what has already transpired over the past few days. Even if you want to demonstrate how responsible you are, charging ahead won't deliver the message of maturity you wish to send. Paradoxically, you can make your point and accomplish more now by slowing down and doing less."
taurus,2013-12-18,"You may be so sensitive now to what others say that a good friend could rub you the wrong way with a casual remark. Although the comments might actually be directed toward someone else, it still feels as if you're the one that's actually being criticized. Over-personalizing what you hear leads to a misinterpretation of the facts. Taking a more laid-back approach to personal interactions allows you to avoid unnecessary problems."
gemini,2013-12-18,"You begin to feel relief as your extreme mood swings settle down. Although yesterday's Full Moon was in your sign, today's nurturing Cancer Moon could soothe your heightened emotions. Thankfully, you can choose to concentrate your energy instead of scattering it. If someone needs a bit of special tender loving care, step up to the plate and demonstrate your willingness to be there for those you love."
cancer,2013-12-18,"Today's events may stir up memories from your childhood that evoke strong feelings, since the emotional Cancer Moon is at her height of power. You could be nostalgic at first, but your longing transforms into much-needed clarity about a pressing issue. Nevertheless, it's dangerous to assume that your processing is over, for your moods may continue shifting through tomorrow. Be gentle with yourself while traveling on your sentimental journey."
leo,2013-12-18,"Hiding your emotions gives you enough space and time to consider your reactions without also feeling like you must share them with everyone else. However, the self-contained Cancer Moon's presence in your 12th House of Secrets indicates that your imagination is more active today than is apparent to others. It's not necessary to express everything you're thinking until you are ready to deal with the consequences of what you say. Exploring your dreams is a wonderful way to get in touch with your heart."
virgo,2013-12-18,"You tend to over-analyze everything you want to say today because you're concerned about what everyone might think. You believe it's safer to be discreet than to agitate others with something they don't really need to know. Nevertheless, a conversation could lead you to disclose more than you intend. If so, remember that it's better to be honest than to cover your tracks with half-truths and innuendos. Speaking with integrity is your best course of action because your real friends expect you to be sincere no matter what."
libra,2013-12-18,"You may have mixed feelings about helping someone less fortunate today. You might resist at first, relying on logic to give reasons why you cannot jump in as requested. Maintaining a sense of humor can be crucial to offering what is needed now, for a good laugh enables you to dissipate the tension while also doing the right thing. Thankfully, you're able to follow through with useful assistance in the nick of time; be the friend you want to have."
scorpio,2013-12-18,"You're experiencing uncertainty about an upcoming business trip or vacation as the tentative Cancer Moon visits your 9th House of Travel. You might try to gloss over important details today because you don't want to cancel a fun adventure. It's challenging now to keep everything clear so you don't end up somewhere lost and far from home. Go ahead and continue making your plans, but scale back your expectations to be on the safe side. Trust your instincts to be your guide."
sagittarius,2013-12-18,"You might not have an outlet to express the emotional intensity you are feeling today. The needy Cancer Moon can be unsettling as she moves through your 8th House of Deep Sharing, stirring your passions. The problem is that patience doesn't come naturally for you Archers, making it tough to slow down enough now to see where your feelings take you. However, if you ignore your emotions, they'll just resurface stronger and be even more difficult to handle the next time around. Confiding in someone you trust may be all you need at this time."
capricorn,2013-12-18,"You might not be able to avoid a friend or acquaintance who asks for help in solving an emotional problem today, even if you would prefer to sidestep this potentially complex situation. But your natural assumption that you need to fix anything is not true. Instead of taking over, encourage others to talk and then show your support just by listening. You don't have to do anything except receive what's being said with an open mind and a compassionate heart."
aquarius,2013-12-18,"Although you might wish you could take the day off and even lose yourself in a movie or a book, there's just too much to do now. Unfortunately, your responsibilities may restrict your freedom and stand in the way of your happiness. Don't fight the inevitable today; show up and do what's required. Thankfully, you should be able to find some time later in the day for a well-earned escape -- and it will be more enjoyable if your work is already done."
pisces,2013-12-18,You may be willing to wait patiently today for something you want because you believe there's a better chance of finding satisfaction once you can see the whole picture. But the current dynamics aren't about denying your desire for pleasure; it's more to do with realizing your dreams. Impulsively taking action could create more problems than good times. Being cautious is wise as long as you don't let any significant opportunities slip through your fingers in the process.
aries,2013-12-19,"You actually think that you're being sensitive to the needs of everyone else now, but you're probably not looking much further than your own ambitions. Instead of just assuming that others have goals that are identical to yours, ask them what they want. Remember, you must listen to how they respond without trying to convince them to change their minds. Be wise and keep an open mind in all your interactions today. You might be pleasantly surprised by how much you have in common."
taurus,2013-12-19,"It may be flattering if others attempt to persuade you to participate in their far-out schemes today. However, you need to be firm about your limits so you don't end up wasting your valuable time and resources on someone else's idea that distracts you from your own work. Be exceptionally cautious now if an opportunity seems too good to be true -- because it probably is. Be smart and wait a few more days before actually saying yes."
gemini,2013-12-19,"Hold on to your wallet today since you could quickly get into trouble by purchasing something that's beyond your means. If an investment opportunity comes your way, it may not be as lucrative as it appears. You might think that you are in control, but that's because you cannot tell if any of the facts are being distorted. Double check everything you are told now before taking an unnecessary risk; it's better to be safe than sorry."
cancer,2013-12-19,"Play it cool today because you may be feeling vulnerable and managing your emotions can be challenging, especially with the Moon moving through moody Cancer. To complicate matters even more, someone could be exaggerating the story they are telling you, which makes it harder to know if something is awry. Nevertheless, constant suspicion on your part creates its own set of problems and you might miss a real opportunity. Your best strategy is to verify your facts before making any long-term commitments."
leo,2013-12-19,"Things are looking up today, but don't put all your eggs in one basket because your current view may be a little too optimistic. Be careful, for your positive thinking can stoke your confidence so much that you get in over your head. Cut back your expectations just a bit so you won't have to face unnecessary disappointment in the near future. Adopting a realistic approach enables you to achieve the creative expression you seek."
virgo,2013-12-19,"Your hopes for a relationship might be so high now that you can't possibly make your unrealistic dreams come true. You may become frustrated, leading you to try overly hard to please your friends. It's tempting to expect so much from others that they cannot possibly satisfy all your needs. Instead of fixating on the outcome today, keep bringing your attention back to the present so you can fully engage in the process as it unfolds."
libra,2013-12-19,"Although you might be hesitant to share your true feelings today, your tone might convey more than you actually intend, anyhow. It's hard for others to tell whether you are exaggerating or if they are just reading more into your words because of their own expectations. Ultimately, it makes no difference where the problem begins. Avoid misunderstandings by softening your message. Less intensity works wonders now when it comes to matters of the heart."
scorpio,2013-12-19,"There are a limited number of productive hours in each day because some of them need to be reserved for sleeping and eating. Although you can pack a lot of activity into a short amount of time, your tendency is to take on more than you should today. You might even tell yourself that you're being practical, but you could convince yourself of nearly anything now. Make your life easier by reducing your commitments before things get out of hand."
sagittarius,2013-12-19,"Your interest in discovering new ideas might open up an unexpected avenue of exploration today as you seek to understand the mysteries of the universe. You could be drawn toward a spiritual tradition or unusual philosophy if you attempt to delve beneath the surface. But don't just accept the truth in everything that comes your way. A bit of healthy skepticism now can save you a big headache down the road. Nevertheless, traveling with an open mind is still your ticket to the next adventure."
capricorn,2013-12-19,"You are the one that everyone comes to for advice because you see opportunities through a very wise and practical lens. Additionally, you are able to communicate your ideas with great clarity now. While others may miss the potential problems with your plan, you can quickly spot the flaws, too. But this isn't about being negative; it's more about keeping it real. Relying on your pragmatic nature improves your chances for success."
aquarius,2013-12-19,"You may think you have to share every little detail in order to clearly explain your position, but spending too much time on the minutiae actually gets in the way of your message. After a certain point, the more you talk today, the less anyone will listen. Give your audience the basics in as few words as possible. They can always ask questions if they need to know anything else. Less is more."
pisces,2013-12-19,"Sharing your feelings may be just what you need today, but you can alienate others if you say too much too fast. It's misleading if your friends encourage you to keep talking, since they might be supportive only because they think it's their duty to listen. Luckily, there's no need to shut out those who truly care about you, but rambling on about the details of your life won't make anyone feel any better now. Thinking about your message in advance allows for the best possible reception."
aries,2013-12-20,"Your self-esteem is on the upswing today, yet your enthusiasm could create problems if you don't take the time to listen to what others are saying. It's tempting now to just ignore an important piece of information that can come back to haunt you later, costing you time and money. Someone may unintentionally give you incorrect data, or you might misunderstand what you've been told. Either way, it's wise to check everything you hear twice. Sticking close to the facts is your smartest strategy, even if it's not the most enjoyable path to take."
taurus,2013-12-20,"Oddly enough, although the pace of your life may be speeding up, it feels as if your progress is slowing down. It's difficult to keep up with all that you should be doing now, and you might exhaust yourself by trying to finish everything that you start. Even if you want others to appreciate your reliability, it's still important to take your time and produce high-quality work. Focusing on excellence will impress your colleagues more than hurrying through your tasks just to get them done."
gemini,2013-12-20,"Your life seems quite complicated today, as the evocative Moon visits your 3rd House of Communication, turning up the volume on your conversations with others. But if your day becomes too noisy, a possible misinterpretation can add chaos and confusion. Nevertheless, don't worry if you need to untangle a delicate issue; it's worth clearing up a misunderstanding now before it causes any trouble later on. Carving out a bit of peace and quiet may be the first step toward finding clarity."
cancer,2013-12-20,"You may become quite stubborn if a coworker suggests you change your plans today. You might dig your heels in even further if you have already taken the time to carefully consider your options. You want to do what makes the most sense, but you don't think you should revise your agenda just to make others happy. Compromising is a necessary part of negotiation, but there's no need to sacrifice your values to reach a successful agreement."
leo,2013-12-20,"Escaping your daily routine to have some fun might be tempting, but you have more important things to do because others are depending on you now. You have been itching to make something exciting happen, and it's time to push ahead with your plans. Just don't become impatient; positive change must be grounded by a strong foundation, so impulsive action is unwise. Build on what you already have today instead of betting your future success on the unknown."
virgo,2013-12-20,"You feel torn between presenting your ideas to others and withdrawing to keep your point of view to yourself. Your creative juices are flowing, but you're not sure if it's appropriate to express your crazy ideas. Fortunately, your imagination won't steer you wrong today, so trust your instincts no matter what. Taking a chance by putting yourself out there for everyone to see isn't as risky as you think."
libra,2013-12-20,"Chilling out with your friends sounds like a great idea, but you could end up far from your goals if you don't take things more seriously today. It's tempting to assume that everything is on track and will turn out as you wish, but you need to deliver on your promises to keep the day from spinning out of control. Thankfully, if you take the time to put your recent commitments into proper perspective, you should be able to negotiate a course of action that won't require as much hard work on your part."
scorpio,2013-12-20,"You intuitively know what others want today, which may help you get a head start on the job. There's no reason to wait patiently for your boss to assign you a new task if you already know what needs to be done. Starting on your chores earlier and being more methodical in your approach can turn a hectic day into a pleasant one, enabling you to accomplish more than you originally thought possible."
sagittarius,2013-12-20,"Your feet are planted firmly on the ground today, yet the Moon's visit to your 9th House of Adventure also inspires you with a touch of wanderlust. You have a pretty good idea of what you should be doing now, but your restlessness won't go away on its own. You're eager to embark on a big trip, but this might not be the most convenient time to travel. There's no hurry; thankfully, solid preparation will pave the way to your success. The future may be even more exciting than you can imagine."
capricorn,2013-12-20,"Although the emotional intensity seems to be mellowing out today, there's still a lot happening in your personal life. Fortunately, you have a specific destination in mind, making it easier to follow the path toward your goals. Visualize your success, make a plan to reach it and then set out toward your target. Keep in mind that shortcuts won't help you get there any faster now, so prepare to take the more traditional route that consists of hard work and sheer determination."
aquarius,2013-12-20,"You may strive to take a centrist position today because you really don't want to stir up any extra trouble. You prefer sharing a point of view that's easily defendable, but it seems as if everything you say now provokes conflict, even if you're just trying to make your opinions known. Remember that your plan is merely one way to approach a dilemma;  grace others with respect, even if their conclusions are different from yours. Thankfully, there's more than one route to reach your goals."
pisces,2013-12-20,"Although you can competently analyze a project by breaking it down into manageable components, it's not necessary to make such a big deal of what you are doing today. Fulfilling your commitments is important, but don't waste energy explaining how you developed your strategy. Others don't need to know your inner process now, as long as you focus on getting the job done in a timely manner."
aries,2013-12-21,"You are apt to receive more support from your friends now than you ever thought possible. In fact, it might even seem like too much, making you feel uncomfortable about not being able to repay the debt. However, you could let others love you and choose to accept it at face value. Set your fears aside so your friendships can deepen and bring more joy into your life. But your biggest problem today may be your impatience to make something happen. Forget about immediate change and bask in the love while you have the chance."
taurus,2013-12-21,"You are one to appreciate the sensible logic of reality, even when it isn't telling you what you want to hear. However, you're on a roll and you may not be so practical now. Perhaps you are riding the frenetic energy of the holiday season. Or, maybe it's just your nerves getting the best of you. Either way, pay attention to the signs and slow down before you run out of gas. Racing around isn't going to bring you the peace and happiness that you seek. Instead, take a more moderate approach based upon your most important values, rather than trying to impress anyone else."
gemini,2013-12-21,"Your enthusiasm may not overcome the obstacles appearing in your life now. You might as well understand that you're not going to get everything done that you set out to do. Frustration can build, because you're being much harder on yourself today than is necessary. It's healthy to be motivated by serious intentions, but don't go to extremes. Give yourself permission to slack off just a bit. Lighten up and enjoy the spirit of the season."
cancer,2013-12-21,"Your finances may need some extra attention now or they could get in the way of your holiday fun. If you have put off your fiscal responsibilities, you must refocus your efforts and do whatever it takes to get your money situation back on track. Don't wait for the new year; consider cutting unnecessary expenses as soon as possible. The good news is the best things in life are free."
leo,2013-12-21,"Relationship dynamics play a pivotal role now, especially those with your friends and colleagues. Although it may seem as if others want to help you, you might not be able to find the exact words to motivate them to take action. Instead of frustrating yourself by trying to change someone else's behavior, focus on your own routine by establishing new habits to increase your efficiency. If you take care of your responsibilities without waiting for assistance, you'll have more time to enjoy the holidays."
virgo,2013-12-21,"You may be fascinated by the tiniest details of your life, but as a picky Virgo this seems like just another day. However, you might be driving your friends crazy with your slightly obsessive behavior. However, that's their problem now and not yours. It's time for them to adjust to your approach rather than you changing what comes naturally. Being true to yourself feels good, and it allows you to maintain your sense of individuality. Nevertheless, there's no limit to what you can do for others once you have learned to take proper care of yourself."
libra,2013-12-21,"Although you like to do nice things for those you love, you may grow resentful of your domestic responsibilities today unless you also take some time for yourself. Your key planet Venus turns retrograde in your 4th House of Home and Family, requiring you to reevaluate what you're willing to give up in return for emotional security. But don't bury your desires for the sake of convenience or they will just resurface. Sharing your needs is easier now, and it dissipates the tension before it reaches a critical point."
scorpio,2013-12-21,"You may not feel as playful as those around you these days, but you are still ready to nurture a potential relationship. However, you first need to know that the other person is taking you seriously before you reveal much of anything. After all, you're not interested in pursuing unrequited love. Unfortunately, your fear of abandonment can prompt you to close your heart even before you take a risk and share your feelings. Thankfully, the choice is yours. Shine your love light irrespective of the consequences."
sagittarius,2013-12-21,"You don't have time to waste energy now, so steer clear of any unnecessary disputes. They are probably just distractions and won't amount to anything important anyway. You are alternately full of energy and then totally exhausted. Keep in mind that your stamina is intrinsically tied to your emotions, so find ways to manage your anger before it becomes problematic. Vent any unresolved feelings through physical exercise or hard work to manage the mental stress. Taking a moment to remember what matters most puts you back in touch with your heart."
capricorn,2013-12-21,"It's not too soon to start formulating your wishes now for the new year, because the Winter Solstice marks a turning point as the Sun returns to your calculating sign. Although mental clarity is working in your favor, Venus Retrograde in Capricorn indicates you might have to wait a while longer to get what you want. Don't try to force anything into place. Loosening your grip on the controls helps you reach your goals in the long run."
aquarius,2013-12-21,"Feelings of paranoia may surface today, but the truth is that someone could actually be trying to undermine your efforts. Any hidden agendas have a tendency to complicate matters, so your current goal should be to bring secrets out into the open. Shine the light of your consciousness into the darkness. The more you know now, the better for all involved."
pisces,2013-12-21,"The pace of your social life is already picking up -- and the activity is more than just a holiday buzz. You have a practical need to be around people who have supported you in the past and who will be there when you need them in the future. Additionally, you are eager to be a real friend to others. Push your feelings outward; being part of a group can add security and stability to your life. Not surprisingly, it's even more rewarding to give than it is to receive."
aries,2013-12-22,"It's annoying if others are critical of your behavior today, especially if you're not doing anything differently. Their pickiness might seem unnecessary, but consider addressing everyone's concerns before you quickly write them off as inconsequential. Look at this as an opportunity to improve your game rather than wasting energy by complaining about anyone else. Fortunately, a simple adjustment in your attitude can turn an unpleasant situation into a joyful one."
taurus,2013-12-22,"You should be able to keep your focus now no matter how many distractions tempt you. But the same friends and family members who often lead you astray from your own plans currently have enough happening to keep them busy. Put relaxation on your schedule, but don't be lazy all day. You can accomplish a lot at home when you concentrate on specific tasks that are simple to complete. Tomorrow's workload will be easier to handle if some chores are crossed off your list today."
gemini,2013-12-22,"You want to make smart use of your time today, but too many things seem to conspire against your personal agenda. Luckily, unexpected social situations may brighten your day, but you must be willing to drop your previous plans in favor of something new. You don't have to completely abandon your original ideas; it's about carefully analyzing all your options so you can make the best possible choices. A little spontaneity goes a long way."
cancer,2013-12-22,"You are usually quite happy when your ideas resonate with your emotions. Even if you're feeling more serious than everyone around you, your confidence is amplified by the down-to-earth Virgo Moon moving through your 3rd House of Communication. But there's no need to hurry now; your current vision might still take a few days to solidify, so don't rush to make anything happen. Relax and fully enjoy the magic of the holiday season."
leo,2013-12-22,"You are motivated to take stock of what you have acquired as the Moon enters your 2nd House of Material Possessions this afternoon. It's also an opportune moment to step back and reevaluate your core beliefs. Instead of getting caught up in the material world now, shift your attention to the metaphysical and spiritual realms to round out your spectrum of experiences. There's magic to be found everywhere you look."
virgo,2013-12-22,"It's time to consider everything you have to gain by maintaining integrity in your relationships and continuing on your path of self-improvement. But the Moon's return to your sign today also emphasizes your subjective feelings, raising self-doubts as you second-guess a recent decision. It's imperative to pay attention to both your heart and your head. Fortunately, arming yourself with enough facts, combined with conscious self-awareness, enables you to think clearly enough to make wise choices."
libra,2013-12-22,"You can feel the growing intensity and it's smart to tie up as many loose ends as possible today. However, don't begin any new projects around the house, even if you think you have sufficient time. It's a much better idea to focus on completing an unfinished task, instead. Unfortunately, you won't be satisfied with simply meeting your obligations now so seek ways to add a bit of creativity to the mix. Although there are a variety of paths to success, you will be happiest if yours also embraces elements of beauty and grace."
scorpio,2013-12-22,"You are inexplicably drawn toward the future as the evocative Moon visits your 11th House of Hopes, Dreams and Wishes. However, you can't afford to forget where you are today and the responsibilities right in front of your nose. Find a way to balance your colorful visions with mundane reality. Remember, you are at your best if you can hold on to your fantasies, even when you are being practical in the real world."
sagittarius,2013-12-22,"You are usually quite comfortable with big ideas and grandiose plans, but today's detail-oriented Virgo Moon reminds you to narrow your world view, rather than to expand it. No one can make this shift of perspective for you; this new focus must originate from within. Every time you notice that you're longing for a distant horizon, bring your attention back to the immediate task at hand. Staying in the present moment allows you to fully experience the power of now."
capricorn,2013-12-22,"You might try to shake yourself loose from the extra responsibilities that seem to gravitate toward you today. Although a pragmatic approach leads you to make better decisions, you don't want to be in charge now. Forget about all the calculations and analysis; just open your heart and follow the most joyful path. Seeking spiritual answers, rather than chasing material distractions, infuses your life with new-found meaning."
aquarius,2013-12-22,"You may grow uncomfortable if someone raises a sensitive issue that you cannot gracefully avoid today. Your repeated attempts to resist an emotional journey to an unfamiliar place can create more problems than just closing your eyes and diving in. Even if layers of complex feelings are challenging, take a deep breath and push forward. You could emerge from a difficult encounter recharged with renewed vigor and an appreciation for the infinite possibilities ahead."
pisces,2013-12-22,"Your friends and family might not be so fast to encourage your dreams today and this can be rather upsetting. However, the Moon's shift into cool Virgo and your 7th House of Partnerships turns the focus away from you and toward those who are an important part of your world. Just remember that you cannot get away with blaming someone else for your discomfort. Spend a bit of time by yourself to nurture your inner process, even if it remains unacknowledged by everyone else. Ultimately, following your bliss inspires others to do the same."
aries,2013-12-23,"There is a lot weighing on your mind now, yet you're already feeling impulsive Mars pushing up against irrepressible Uranus, indicating that you might leap before you look. Of course, you know better; you've been in this position countless times before. Take a chance by trying a different approach to your dilemma. Change an old pattern by doing the responsible thing rather than following the whim of the moment."
taurus,2013-12-23,"Although you attempt to be conscientious in everything you do today, a shortcut might be so tempting that you cannot resist it. However, taking the easy way out may only lead to additional work rather than saving you time and effort. Be cautious in your approach now; once you create a plan that is based on common sense instead of appearances, don't take any detours until you have reached your goals."
gemini,2013-12-23,"Getting to the bottom of an important issue is challenging today, but recognizing the source of your drive can prevent unnecessary headaches down the road. Instead of distracting yourself with one thing after another, set aside some quiet time to think about your life and what you could improve in the months ahead. But don't just visualize your future; reflect on your past choices to better understand how you got yourself into the current situation in the first place. A little self-awareness might do you a lot of good."
cancer,2013-12-23,"Establishing a concrete schedule is a smart idea today because you feel more comfortable when you know in advance what you will be doing. But even if you use your common sense when planning your day, you still should remain flexible to allow for unexpected changes. A lot can happen that's outside your sphere of control and it's better to roll with the waves now than to exhaust yourself struggling against them. Knowing when to hold on or let go is the key to your success."
leo,2013-12-23,"Reconciling your current feelings with your goals for the year ahead is tricky. You may be ready to cash in your chips and start anew, but that's not necessarily a viable option. Instead, consider what can be done to revitalize your life without suddenly turning it upside down. Bold thinking makes sense but there's no need to be in too much of a hurry to put your ideas into motion. Time is on your side when you slow down and do things right."
virgo,2013-12-23,"Understanding your feelings is a complex matter now because they might not conform to your expectations. The Moon's visit to your sign heightens the intensity of your emotions, so don't bother trying to rationalize your reactions; instead, observe them without judgment. The universe is granting you permission to change your mind as often as needed until your new perspective begins to solidify. Your values are in the midst of a complete metamorphosis and there's no use in rushing the process."
libra,2013-12-23,"Your fantasies may be overactive today, but you can't afford a whole day of escaping into your imagination. You have important decisions to make that could alter the direction of your life. But don't be concerned if you're unable to put your new plan into motion right away because you could come up with such an original strategy that it changes the rules of the game. Sudden shifts in your thinking are quite likely now; just don't do anything radical until you've had enough time to develop your ideas. Slow and steady wins the race."
scorpio,2013-12-23,"Reality is catching up with you these days now that your key planet Pluto is aligning with karmic Saturn in your sign. You intuitively know that change is possible or even necessary, but it might seem too overwhelming today to do anything about it at all. If you feel like you have bitten off more than you can chew, announce a temporary moratorium to give yourself a bit of downtime. You have a better chance of meeting your deadlines if you simply take a break to replenish your energy and adjust your attitude."
sagittarius,2013-12-23,"Seeing the potential in the current set of circumstances can be a real challenge today, but a sudden breakthrough in your thinking makes anything possible. You might even have flashes of extreme optimism now that elevate you above your serious mood. But don't worry if you can't solve all your problems with one brilliant idea. Remember, you're in an extended period of change and it will take time to create your new plans for the future."
capricorn,2013-12-23,"You feel most secure when you know that the foundations of your life are stable. Unfortunately, those very same things that you normally rely on are now undergoing a very controlled yet dramatic transformation, making it harder to plan your next career move. You might be at your wit's end because you don't feel in control today, and intense concentration doesn't seem to help matters much. Fortunately, a breakthrough is possible if you aren't afraid of stepping outside of the box and seeing things from a whole new perspective."
aquarius,2013-12-23,"Your desire to make long-term plans can be quite frustrating since you know that they are logistically out of the question today. Part of the problem is that you want more stability, yet the current circumstances stir up old issues. You're reminded that everything changes, including those things you believed would last forever. Although it may not be easy to separate your past from the future now, critical thinking is still your best tool in your struggle to see the present moment in a clear light."
pisces,2013-12-23,"Ironically, if someone appears to be overly critical today, it may be a direct result of your unfounded optimism. But it's not that you actually believe everything is awesome. It's just that you're aware of the difficulties ahead and you understand the importance of maintaining a positive attitude. Nevertheless, others may think you are lost in a fantasy world and could judge you harshly. Be open to receiving a reality check and make sure you aren't avoiding the truth. As long as you're not in denial, there's no reason to let anyone rain on your parade."
aries,2013-12-24,"Your adrenaline kicks up another notch higher today as your key planet Mars provokes you to take initiative, even if you don't have a real plan in place. You may feel a bit out of control and could do something that you soon regret. Thankfully, you also have the ability to take a more measured approach to your relationships now. Don't be in such a hurry; just a touch of self-control at the right moment goes a long way to help you gain a healthy perspective."
taurus,2013-12-24,"Concentrating on your chores can be challenging today, but you probably have things to do that can't be postponed any longer. Although it's not your style to just walk away from a commitment, you're intrigued by this option now. If you find yourself getting all worked up by the exciting possibilities, remember that you'll be happier in the long run if you stick to your original agenda. Taking one step at a time is the most reliable way to reach your destination."
gemini,2013-12-24,"You don't know what to think as you are bounced around by the changing cosmic tides today. It's rather tricky to maintain a balanced approach to your social life now; you could go overboard by accepting one too many invitations. On the other hand, you might overreact to the emotional overload and decide to become a recluse for a few days. You may be totally psyched up about life one minute yet quite subdued the next. However, inaction isn't a smart strategy; choose the path that brings you the most joy and follow it the best you can."
cancer,2013-12-24,You can receive great benefits by carefully watching your energy output today because you could easily exhaust yourself by attempting to be in too many places at once. It's helpful to also monitor your feelings so that unexpressed anger doesn't drive you to do something foolish. Consider your motives before behaving recklessly. Taking time to contemplate your actions might very well save you from making a scene. Starting from a place of gratitude may be all you need to turn things in a positive direction.
leo,2013-12-24,"Although you know the importance of thinking before you act, it's still a challenge today to consider the ramifications of your risky behavior. Others may caution you to refrain from spending so much money or warn you about taking a trip you can't afford. But their advice might not be useful now because it doesn't lead you in a positive direction. Thankfully, the situation isn't as complicated as it appears, but it's still wise to have your contingency plan in order and ready to go."
virgo,2013-12-24,"You may feel a sense of discomfort today, going from a quiet mood to being a social butterfly. But even if you flirt with the idea of spontaneously heading out to have fun, it still makes more sense to work before you play. Naturally, you shouldn't run out on your responsibilities. Nevertheless, time spent with those you love can be rejuvenating so make sure to schedule it into your day. Man does not live by bread alone."
libra,2013-12-24,"You don't have the foggiest notion what to do today because someone might be trying to convince you to start something new. Fortunately, you won't likely be talked into any activity that's not already in your plans; but you still can get thrown off course by your own weird ideas. In fact, your thoughts may be quite unsettling now, instead of inspiring your creativity. There's no need to take everything so seriously. Luckily, you're comfortable with ambiguity, so don't force a decision before its time."
scorpio,2013-12-24,"Your extreme emotions might provoke you to express yourself in a dramatic outpouring of opinions today, especially if you are angry with someone and haven't yet shared your feelings. Telling a friend what you're thinking may be a sensible first step, but ranting won't likely make a problem disappear. Nevertheless, don't accept things as they are; a compassionate strategy that aims for a long-term solution instead of a quick fix is your best bet."
sagittarius,2013-12-24,"You must be patient today because others may be inadvertently distracting you from finishing a project. You could feel as if you're getting nowhere fast and your growing frustration motivates you to take an unnecessary risk. Acknowledge that your current point of view is warped by your dreams and remember that you'll be better off if you wait a few more days before doing anything rash. In the meantime, enjoy the holiday celebrations with a grateful heart and a positive attitude."
capricorn,2013-12-24,"You have way too many options in front of you and it's nearly impossible to pick a single course of action. Nevertheless, you may feel the pressure to make a choice today, prompting unnecessary panic and rash decisions. Normally, you are willing to wait for clarity prior to making your move. However, your enthusiasm could get in the way now. Take a deep breath, listen to your heart and figure out what you really want to do."
aquarius,2013-12-24,"Doing what you are told could end up taking more time today than you expect. It's not likely that anyone is trying to create more stress, yet you might jump to a conclusion now and misunderstand what was said. Your desire to respond immediately may cause you to twist what you hear to support your assumptions. If you are uncertain about someone's message, ask for clarification before you land yourself in trouble. Fools rush in where angels fear to tread."
pisces,2013-12-24,"Pay careful attention to your finances today because an unpremeditated buying spree could cost you much more than you thought. You may be able to justify a large purchase because of how much benefit you will derive from it, but then find yourself disappointed if reality falls short of your expectations. Instead of attempting to determine your most logical move, it's smarter now to rely on your intuition and do what feels right."
aries,2013-12-25,"Circumstances may lead your day in a different direction than you expect because people aren't following your script. Luckily, your key planet Mars acts as a shuttle diplomat now, connecting your personal intentions with those of your family or community. But Mars isn't known as a peacemaker, so this brand of diplomacy might provoke unexpected conflict. Thankfully, even with strained communication, real progress can be made toward finding lasting solutions once you let go of your need to be in control."
taurus,2013-12-25,"Expressing what you really want can be rather shocking to others. However, even if you prefer to play outside of the box today, you are also establishing the basic framework for a relationship that offers you more freedom than you might normally have. Go ahead and aim high. You may not achieve stability yet, but maintaining the status quo doesn't have to be your main priority at this time. Make the day memorable rather than comfortable. There's no reason to wait for the new year to create positive change."
gemini,2013-12-25,"You may have an awakening experience today as the mental lightning strikes and everything becomes amazingly clear for a brief moment in time. The stress between your inner desires and what you are required to do in the outer world has been gnawing away at you. Just when you thought there was no possible way out of the current dilemma, something totally unexpected happens and shakes things up enough to show you a viable path. Don't hesitate; strike while the iron is hot."
cancer,2013-12-25,"You're more excitable than usual and it feels good to get your emotions out into the open. You may have an unexpected opportunity to expand your freedom of expression. If you're willing to take a risk today, your life could change for the better. However, if you hold back, others around you might act out the independence that you are suppressing. Be courageous; acknowledge your fear and move through it now. Facing your ghosts of the past empowers you to love more fully in the present moment."
leo,2013-12-25,"Change seems to be defining your current landscape, and there's even more going on than meets the eye. But you are still a work in process, so you cannot necessarily see the completed transformation just yet. Nevertheless, your desires are pushing you to fulfill your needs today. Self-control is not currently part of the equation, for your impulses are dominating your thoughts now. It's emotionally healthy to express yourself as long as you do it in a way that has lasting value rather than immediate impact."
virgo,2013-12-25,"Although you typically may be cool, calm and collected, logical analysis is not part of your current story today. Instead, you are now caught in a maelstrom of intense emotions, needs and circumstances. Although there might not seem to be a graceful exit from the situation, the dynamics are ready to shift. But don't wait for an earthquake to strike; instead, move deliberately toward your goal before something breaks loose on its own."
libra,2013-12-25,"It's time to step outside of your comfort zone, even if you are entertaining others today. Playing the perfect host or hostess is not what the planets have in mind for you now. It's time to get down and dirty, or maybe even a bit crazy. Jump into your fantasies and let them rise to the surface. Naturally, it's not a good idea to express every single thing you imagine, but it is okay to say more than you usually share. Although it may take a while, your wildest dreams can come true."
scorpio,2013-12-25,"Fleeting glimpses of the bigger picture run through your mind now, enabling you to see a way through the self-imposed restrictions you currently face. Don't avert your eyes when the lightning strikes. It is all meant for you to see, no matter how brilliant the momentary flash of illumination. If you try to restrict the natural rhythm, things will become more difficult today. Breathing deeply allows the energy to flow more smoothly. Just remember, above everything else, awareness is your best friend."
sagittarius,2013-12-25,"These days mark a turning point in how you express yourself to others. Your understanding can reach new levels of enlightenment, but you must be ready to act on what you now know. Changes on the emotional scene may not be easy at first but they could bring you what you need, even if it's additional freedom. Thinking quickly on your feet is fine, but acting slowly prevents you from upsetting the delicate balance."
capricorn,2013-12-25,"You have been greatly anticipating the holiday season, even if it doesn't feel like it today. You naturally strive for stability, but now that you are so close to achieving this goal it seems like things might come apart at the seams and your progress could be in jeopardy. If loose ends fray now, don't resist; just let them unravel. You can't control every aspect of every little strand of your life. Focus on what is most important instead. Believe it or not, the smaller things will magically fall into place."
aquarius,2013-12-25,"Controlling the wide swings of extreme emotions that come to the surface is tricky business now. However, if you try to deny your feelings, you may have to deal with the effects of your own erratic behavior. You are all fired up because red-hot Mars is zapping your key planet, wild and crazy Uranus. Nevertheless, nothing will be solved by quick emotional outbursts. Your grievances might be very real, but you must work with the problems on a deeper level if you're to achieve lasting satisfaction."
pisces,2013-12-25,"Although digging into your core issues is hard work, it creates psychic fuel that can power you to the stars. Pay particular attention to your most intimate relationships, for this is a perfect place for the next phase of your journey to unfold. But this is not a one-day affair. Reflect on the past year and then project ahead through next year in your imagination. Don't settle for less than brilliance today; your life is on the launch pad and you have a chance to reach the outer edges of the universe."
aries,2013-12-26,"You would like to make it through the day without stirring up too much mischief, but your good intentions could run into a roadblock in the form of someone who won't get out of your way. Your promises may land on deaf ears, unless you back them up with responsible behavior. The more you talk today, the further you might wander from the truth. Think carefully about your message and then speak through direct actions rather than hopeful words."
taurus,2013-12-26,"You must own up to the truth today, even if you're tempted to deny reality in order to keep a dream alive. Recent events may have increased your expectations in a romantic relationship or a business partnership. But now it makes sense to reassess your goals and set a new path. Be proactive or an unexpected change in circumstances might catch you off guard. Inflated dreams all but guarantee failure, so clarify your view of the future while you still have time. A realistic outlook greatly increases your chances for success."
gemini,2013-12-26,"Sharing your feelings is challenging today because you're afraid that if you say what's in your heart, you will elicit a negative response. Your message could be so on target that it carries even more weight than you expect. Even if you have the very best of intentions, you might lack the subtlety now to get the delivery just right. Start off slowly and feel your way into the conversation, rather than blurting everything out in the very the first sentence. A measured approach works in your favor, allowing others to see you in the best possible light."
cancer,2013-12-26,"Your even-handed approach may be rewarded today, but you still have to wait longer than you think to receive what you want. Fortunately, you Crabs have powerful pincers that enable you to be amazingly tenacious. Nevertheless, you still must exhibit extreme patience now. There's absolutely nothing wrong with knowing exactly what you want as long as you're not in a hurry. Stay the course and you might just get the results you seek in the long run."
leo,2013-12-26,"If your creativity has been hampered recently by distracting circumstances, your life is now beginning to move forward again. You may feel the changes coming, but you're still at the edge and need to suppress your urge to do too much yet. Don't waste your energy by jumping in to a new task or planning for a major project. Instead, tie up loose ends, revisit an old idea or retell a story that can help you process your feelings about the past. But don't dilly-dally today; you will want to be ready to go when the lights turn green."
virgo,2013-12-26,"Even if you strive to be perfectly clear when sharing your perspective today, you still might be misunderstood by someone who isn't really listening to what you say. Unfortunately, people might jump to an erroneous conclusion if they don't hear the facts exactly as you report them. Nevertheless, don't let anyone else speak for you, because you're the only person who is capable of expressing your unique point of view. Take your time and present your case as precisely as possible and then move on."
libra,2013-12-26,"The holiday season might not be turning out exactly the way you imagined it would. Ironically, the gulf between your expectations and what actually occurs puts you in touch with your roots as you remember old traditions you wanted to revitalize or avoid. But instead of worrying about the past, recognize that you can start anew right now in the present moment. Create your own vision about how you want to celebrate the new year and share your fantasy with someone special."
scorpio,2013-12-26,"You might not be feeling very confident today, but your situation isn't nearly as bleak as it seems. The Sun is in a stressful alignment with somber Saturn now, which is halfway through a two-year visit to your sign. Instead of fretting over something that went wrong or a goal you didn't reach, set new objectives by narrowing your vision and performing a serious reality check. Using your common sense when planning for your future  improves your chances to regain your power and start moving forward again."
sagittarius,2013-12-26,"You might not feel much like celebrating today, but your current malaise won't last long. You could find yourself wondering how you became so enthused about an idea that turned out to be less important than it seemed at first. Nevertheless, your excitement grew along with your vision. However, you must rethink the whole scenario now because it may not be living up to your expectations. Don't be afraid to let go of an old dream so you can begin to invent a wonderful new one."
capricorn,2013-12-26,"Making progress on your goals is a daily endeavor now because there is a convergence of planets hanging out in your ambitious sign. Paradoxically, the end of the year is a tricky time to tie up loose ends because so many people are celebrating the holidays with family and friends. Nevertheless, your struggle will be well worth the effort. Even if simplification and closure are difficult to attain, lightening your load allows you to say yes to an exciting new opportunity."
aquarius,2013-12-26,"Although this holiday week is a very busy time for many people, you might feel more reclusive than social now. Mercury, the Sun and Pluto are traveling companions in your 12th House of Spirituality now, motivating you to focus your attention on something other than lighthearted fun with your friends. As much as you can benefit from some time alone, there's no reason to avoid interacting with like-minded individuals. The love and support you receive gives you strength for your current metaphysical journey."
pisces,2013-12-26,"You may have grown weary of your never-ending responsibilities and are likely ready for a change of scenery. But even if you are busy today, allow yourself some time to imagine your ideal job. Freely fantasizing about a different career path could trigger a cascade of emotions that awaken a previously hidden sense of purpose. But don't let self-doubt or discouragement take over if it's not time to make major changes yet. Hold true to the vision of realizing your greatest personal potential, no matter what."
aries,2013-12-27,"Thinking about ways to improve a current relationship today won't necessarily make it any better, but it might be a great first step. Finding a course of action may seem hopeless when you consider all the work you must do to reach your goals and get what you want. Don't be so hard on yourself or someone you love; instead, try revising your expectations. You could be closer to satisfaction than you realize if you simply shift your attitude."
taurus,2013-12-27,"You may have to clean up an emotional mess left over from an interaction with a difficult person yesterday. However, you might be puzzled by the apparent lack of progress today. Be careful about making assumptions because productivity isn't always measured by what happens on the surface. You are processing changes in small ways even if you are unaware of it, so don't be too concerned if you seem to have stalled for no reason. Just keep your eyes on the prize and be as kind as possible to everyone involved."
gemini,2013-12-27,"There's always room for improvement in your diet and exercise program, but it may be tricky to sustain a new routine now. Nothing is as simple as it should be when self-discipline is involved. You could run into unexpected problems when attempting to make time to attend to your needs. Fortunately, there's no logical reason to struggle; rather than working yourself into a state of frustration by trying to do too much too fast, scale back and simplify your approach. Everything seems easier when you're relaxed and in the zone."
cancer,2013-12-27,"Naturally, you want to put your best foot forward today, but some things are not as rosy as they appear. Unfortunately, you could channel so much of your energy into presenting a cheerful face that you end up exhausting yourself trying to look good. Keeping up appearances is just not worth the effort if you end up so depleted that you can't enjoy yourself later on. Happily, you don't have to pretend for everyone; your true friends will accept you just the way you are."
leo,2013-12-27,"Opening windows of opportunities for other people has become somewhat of a recent pastime as you advise them how to take advantage of the current circumstances. Although they may succeed with their endeavors, it's harder to see potential in your own life because some things seem more complicated than they once were. You don't have time to waste, so set aside any self-doubt. Instead, aim your sites on a realistic target and get to work."
virgo,2013-12-27,"Your intuition may lead you to the conclusion that you will soon be encountering complex situations involving others. However, you aren't ready to turn your life upside down yet. In fact, you might try to minimize your current frustration by avoiding meaningful discussions about issues that have no immediate solutions. Unfortunately, this delaying tactic won't necessarily work now. Thankfully, you can still delve into a relationship dilemma without making matters worse as long as you postpone any long-lasting decisions until after the new year."
libra,2013-12-27,"One moment, it seems as if all systems are go; but just a few minutes later, your plans must be placed on hold. You may be overwhelmed by the mixed cosmic signals you are receiving today. Although you're tempted to react impulsively and try to fix everything that's wrong, this approach is a mistake. Instead, make a list by considering which changes are the most sensible, but then wait to see what improves on its own before intervening. Cultivating patience might be your best solution yet."
scorpio,2013-12-27,"Understanding why others don't trust you enough to support your ideas today might be a challenge, even if you are quite optimistic about the outcome. Ironically, it may actually be your over-the-top confidence now that can put some people off because they think you're hiding your fears and doubts. Even if it's not comfortable at first, it's still better to be honest about your strengths and limitations right from the start."
sagittarius,2013-12-27,"Today you are caught between your desire to inform people of the facts they are missing and your duty to remain quiet and do as you are told. Sometimes life seems difficult because you think you know more than you should. Becoming a whistleblower may be the morally correct action, but it might also make life more stressful on the job. Do what it takes to thrive, yet keep in mind that harsh practicality can outweigh even your most altruistic ideals."
capricorn,2013-12-27,"Projecting your vision into the distant future may be your idea of excitement now that the Moon is visiting your 11th House of Hopes and Dreams. You're ready to shift your energy to a higher vibration, but an obstacle may arrive in the form of someone who rains on your parade. Thankfully, extra hard work on your part could loosen Saturn's current rigid hold on you. Planning time is over; roll up your sleeves and get busy."
aquarius,2013-12-27,"You might feel as if you're running out of time, but there are so many more things to finish today. Fortunately, you're driven to get as much done as possible and there's not much that will stop your momentum now. However, you still may believe that you're not receiving all the support you deserve from those who could be of service. Don't play the role of a victim; no matter what resistance you run into, keep pushing your ideas forward. Persistence is your friend."
pisces,2013-12-27,"Your desire to go on an adventure may be overshadowing more pressing obligations, but your dreams could still crash into the reality of your previous work commitments. Even if you think you can juggle your schedule and make everything fall into place, it grows more apparent today that your escape route is blocked for some inexplicable reason. But don't overreact by just canceling your plans because the outlook could change in a moment's notice. Wait for the energy to shift before deciding what to do next."
aries,2013-12-28,"Your enthusiasm about the future motivates you to jump into action, yet it also distracts you from what is right in front of your nose. You may be eager to shift your focus away from a complex emotional situation that would benefit from your undivided attention today. Just remember that your positive attitude can be helpful as long as you don't forget to use your common sense along the way."
taurus,2013-12-28,"You might believe that you have finally broken through the resistance that's been holding you back. Thankfully, you do have an excellent opportunity to change your life for the better now. The good news is you're fairly sure that you're moving along the right path, even if the current circumstances suggest otherwise. Your self-confidence is your greatest asset at this time, so hold on to your dreams no matter what."
gemini,2013-12-28,"Although you may grow irritated with the intensity of your own feelings today, you can't just make them go away. You might be worried that there's no obvious way out of an entangled situation now and even with your mental agility, you still can't rationalize your reaction. Stop resisting your emotions; indulge them instead. You will have time later to revisit your experience and logically plan what to do next. In the meantime, listen to your heart to discover what really matters."
cancer,2013-12-28,"You could have one great idea after another today, but you will most likely choose to keep them to yourself. It's not that you're insecure about how others might judge you; you actually believe that you're on the right track. It's just that your plans are still in development and you don't think they're solid enough yet to share with anyone else. Don't feel obliged to say anything until you are ready. Writing your thoughts down is the best way to take them to the next level."
leo,2013-12-28,"An unexpected interaction with a friend or a new acquaintance can boost your self-confidence today. Ironically, the faith that someone has in you may exceed the belief you have in yourself. However, you don't necessarily struggle with low self-esteem; it's just that you need to stretch in order to fulfill other people's expectations of you now. Don't waste your time feeding your doubts. There's no reason to let uncertainty slow you down in the pursuit of your goals."
virgo,2013-12-28,"You may not be able to trust your assessment of a situation because even the impossible looks doable today. It's great to be confident about your capabilities, but it isn't smart to ignore reality. Although your key planet Mercury is already buzzing from its connection to electric Uranus, your logical mind might not be able to remain practical in light of all the brilliant ideas. Be patient; common sense will return in time for you to make the best decision. Nevertheless, thinking outside of the box gives you the most options."
libra,2013-12-28,"Building on what you already started is wiser than initiating a new project now. However, you still could be tempted to skip over a step or two in your rush to finish your chores. Unfortunately, your current judgment isn't as clear as you think, so pushing back your timeline to take the pressure off is a good idea. Delaying your responses allows you to consider the wisdom of your actions before you jump in too far. Less hurrying today means less worrying tomorrow."
scorpio,2013-12-28,"You often downplay your emotions if you sense they could make others uncomfortable, yet you're thinking about trying a different tactic today. The passionate Scorpio Moon turns up the heat on your desires, but you still might be reluctant to share your feelings. Say what you want now, but don't become overly attached to the outcome. Instead of making anyone else responsible for your happiness, just express your needs and then move on. You may be pleasantly surprised by what happens next."
sagittarius,2013-12-28,"There's no time for you to escape into your imagination today because you're being challenged to concentrate on the demanding mundane affairs of your life. You must deal with what's currently happening in your immediate environment, even if it's not as much fun as dreaming about the future. Luckily, no one is reading your mind, so you can continue exploring your unexpressed fantasies as long as you cover your bases in the present moment."
capricorn,2013-12-28,"You might not be on the same page as your friends today. You're not going out of your way to be different; it's just that you feel strongly about something that triggers an unresolved issue. Tread carefully, for the harder you attempt to get to the bottom of the disagreement, the wider the gulf becomes. Thankfully, this dilemma doesn't need to be fixed right away; give the situation some breathing room and things will begin to heal on their own."
aquarius,2013-12-28,"You could be at the edge of your limits today and every little thing that bubbles into your awareness brings cascades of thoughts along with it. Each new idea tempts you to swing into immediate action. However, you can't easily separate the reality of your day from your desire to help save the world. Ultimately, there's no need to confine your thinking now; observe your inner process and watch as the very smallest details magically merge with your global perspective."
pisces,2013-12-28,"Your mind may be racing so fast that there's no apparent way to subdue the flow of ideas today, whether they are useful or not. You might feel so overwhelmed that you just want to turn off your brain and rest. Don't bother attempting to catch any single thought and turn it into something practical. Instead, just let the mental currents rush through your mind and trust that the most important concepts won't be lost."
aries,2013-12-29,"Getting others to follow your train of thought can be challenging today, even if you are inspired by altruistic intentions. You might believe you're being practical, but part of the problem stems from your illogical reasoning. You're inclined to rush to conclusions now without the help of supporting facts and figures. It's great to be so original in your thinking, but don't expect anyone else to jump on your bandwagon until you slow down and start making sense."
taurus,2013-12-29,"You like the comfort of knowing you're right, but radical new information comes to your attention that suggests a change of perspective might be in order now. Unfortunately, your resistance can turn into outright stubbornness. Naturally, your obstinacy won't serve you well, especially if your first assumption is wrong. Adopting a flexible approach won't solve everything, but it goes a long way toward making your day more pleasant."
gemini,2013-12-29,"You have the potential to amaze your friends with your brilliance today, but you must be careful how you interact with others. You could become so enamored with your own cleverness that you take your point of view one step too far. If you don't pay attention to your audience, you can lose the ground that you otherwise might gain. Have the courage to take a risk, but don't push your luck."
cancer,2013-12-29,"Although you are feeling less emotionally vulnerable today, you could inadvertently step on someone else's toes. Normally, you're very sensitive to people's boundaries, but being overexcited may make you less compassionate now. It isn't that you're mean spirited; your current enthusiasm might just make you somewhat unconscious in what you say. Fortunately, you can easily remedy the situation by reminding yourself throughout the day to be more aware of the moods of others."
leo,2013-12-29,"Instead of struggling to finish one project before starting another one, take a more lighthearted approach to your schedule. Thankfully, you can avoid working yourself into a state of frustration by acknowledging your current need for play. Try burning off some of your nervous energy with any sort of physical or creative activity. Whether you engage in sports, artistic endeavors or dancing the night away, you will feel better if you get up and get moving."
virgo,2013-12-29,"Conflicting thoughts are difficult to resolve today. You might struggle between following a methodical plan to fulfill your responsibilities and taking a more risky approach to express what's in your heart. Normally, the cautious route would be your first choice, but you're attracted to the potential excitement of doing something new and different now. Exploring uncharted territory gives you a thrilling adrenaline rush; luckily, you can still cover your bases by backtracking later to tie up any loose ends, if needed."
libra,2013-12-29,"Innovative ideas about an unresolved issue relating to your home and family might save the day. It could even be something as simple as finalizing plans for New Year's Eve. However, nothing is as straightforward as you would prefer now; you might change your mind several times, thereby making others impatient with your indecisiveness. Don't take yourself so seriously. Just pick one of your inspirations and have fun."
scorpio,2013-12-29,"Don't expect your day to run smoothly since uncontrollable circumstances could have a dramatic impact on your schedule. If you attempt to stick to your original plan, you may end up making yourself crazy with irresolvable tension. Let it go; the outcome is temporarily in the hands of fate. Enjoy the surprises instead of fighting against them. Life is full of wonder if you just take the time to notice."
sagittarius,2013-12-29,Your practical concerns may be the source of a logistical dilemma. Potential social engagements push your buttons now as you try to choose whether or not to partake in the fun. Your uncertainty isn't about any lack of interest; it stems from the Moon's return to your sign and your current bout of wanderlust. You simply have to decide how much control you're willing to relinquish in order to participate in the holiday festivities. Follow your heart but don't hurt anyone's feelings in the process.
capricorn,2013-12-29,"You are attracted to the idea of doing something totally different today, so spontaneous activities may supersede any previous plans. In fact, you could be the instigator now as you look for ways to stir up some mischief. You might not have to go far to achieve satisfaction, for excitement seems to be following you around wherever you go. Fortunately, you can have a wonderful time without even leaving the comfort of your home."
aquarius,2013-12-29,"Sharing your visions with those you trust can bring them closer, but you should be careful about saying too much. Your thoughts may be flying all over the map, demonstrating a wilder side of your imagination. On one hand, it's interesting to see how others react to your outbreak of irresponsibility. On the other hand, it might be better to keep some of your fantasies to yourself. But don't shut down your dreams; they go a long way to inspire your future growth."
pisces,2013-12-29,"An old emotional wound may sneak up on you today, especially if you are currently involved in an intimate relationship. It's not that any specific problems must be dealt with at this time. It's just that the present circumstances might remind you of a past event that can influence your feelings. Accept the situation as is, without burdening yourself with unnecessary fears. Bringing your mind back to the here and now enables you to enrich your life moment by moment."
aries,2013-12-30,"You could take yourself too seriously today and may go too far trying to prove yourself to someone. You're ready to fight for your beliefs, but you need to chill out a bit because your passions are blown out of proportion now, especially if you bump into resistance. Even if it seems like others are purposefully blocking your way, it's smarter to work with the energy instead of attempting to overpower it. But don't succumb to fear; you can reach your destination by following the high road instead."
taurus,2013-12-30,"Managing your erratic energy is quite a challenge today, but it should get easier as you gain awareness about what's really happening. A minor run-in with someone whose opinions are different from yours may stir memories of an unpleasant situation. Acknowledge your feelings; a molehill can turn into a volatile volcano if you try to bury them. There's no reason to let the pressure reach a critical point. Avoid losing your temper by gently sharing what's on your mind without blaming anyone else in the process."
gemini,2013-12-30,"You won't be happy if your friends assume that you will go along with anything they want to do today. You may feel that they are being too pushy and you really don't appreciate it. You might reach a point where you have no choice but to respond honestly, even if you don't want to make such a big deal about what's going on. But rather than instigating a conflict through direct confrontation, do your best to move through an uncomfortable situation by talking about your own concerns. Taking responsibility for your emotions is healthier than playing the role of a victim."
cancer,2013-12-30,"Trying to disappear into the shadows isn't a sensible strategy today; something has to be done now and it's up to you to do it. Although you may not want to take charge, it might be necessary if no one else steps up to the plate. Remember, if you take issue with someone's performance, saying it out loud can prevent your anger from hardening into resentment. Keeping your feelings flowing is your key to happiness."
leo,2013-12-30,"You like to play the part of the good guy and are usually happy to focus your intentions on the best possible outcome. You may truly believe your optimistic approach is the most intelligent strategy now, but someone might think you're simply avoiding the facts. Ironically, you both could be right. However, if you try to prove your superiority today, everyone ends up losing. Concentrate your efforts on creating common ground instead of tearing each other apart."
virgo,2013-12-30,"A lighthearted conversation may unexpectedly turn into a very serious argument today. What bothers you most is if someone acts like a know-it-all, bending the truth for apparently selfish purposes. You don't have any tolerance for people who spout facts that are blatantly false. However, a fight to the finish could do much more harm than good. Demonstrate your common sense and wait until everyone's emotions have settled down before continuing the discussion."
libra,2013-12-30,"Everywhere you turn today people seem to be on edge and you don't like the confrontational atmosphere. You might be tempted to blame someone else because you know that your intentions are honorable. Unfortunately, the current circumstances are more complicated than you think; your suppressed anger could be coming back at you in a projected form. Accept full responsibility for your feelings, even the most negative ones. This simple act of courage may be sufficient to begin calming the disruptive energy."
scorpio,2013-12-30,"If you haven't been following a healthy exercise regimen, it's time to put one into motion because your planetary rulers, muscleman Mars and formidable Pluto, cross paths to provoke powerful action. Although you might feel strong emotions bubbling upward into your awareness, this edge of intensity can be softened through physical exertion. Channeling your energy positively by working out at the gym or dancing all night long helps to moderate your extreme point of view."
sagittarius,2013-12-30,"Unfortunately, previous obligations may require you to reconsider your plans today. But you might not be happy when you realize that a social event will still go on, even without your attendance. Although you could be tempted to express your annoyance by criticizing others, shifting the focus away from you isn't a useful strategy to get what you want. This tricky situation is a test of your maturity, so accept the current circumstances that can't be altered and rise to the challenge by improving your attitude."
capricorn,2013-12-30,"If you lose your temper today it will become more difficult to obtain the results you seek. Unfortunately, you may be frustrated because satisfaction doesn't seem to be forthcoming now, and you have run out of patience. Nevertheless, an explosive emotional outbreak could turn your allies against you when you need them the most. Being honest and expressing exactly what you're thinking might be the right thing to do, yet compassionate behavior conveys your message more kindly."
aquarius,2013-12-30,"You might think you're too busy to stop and process your feelings today. Unfortunately, this denial could take you down a bumpy path, causing unexpressed emotions to simmer beneath your awareness and turn a healthy reaction sour. Negative thoughts may be lurking in the shadows, so take your time and talk about your current frustrations. Thankfully, you can avoid a serious conflict if you adopt a proactive approach based on honoring your integrity and establishing clear channels of communication."
pisces,2013-12-30,"You are most often comfortable when feeling your way through a complex interpersonal landscape without a rational anchor. However, you might stubbornly choose to resist all forms of emotional engagement today. You realize that there are still issues left unresolved, and that it's easier to avoid them than to confront the underlying causes. Unfortunately, there may be no way to sidestep the truth. Being honest now is the key to receiving the support you want later on."
aries,2013-12-31,"Listening to the voice of reason isn't easy today as trickster Mercury squares your key planet Mars. Your words are more combative than you realize, especially if you open your mouth before considering anyone else's point of view. Fortunately, you can minimize the negative impact of your rash reaction by simply remembering to be respectful of other people's feelings. Acting for the good of all creates more harmony than just looking out for yourself."
taurus,2013-12-31,"You Bulls tend to dig in your heels (or hoofs), especially on a day like today when you could be provoked to fight back to maintain ownership of what you assume is rightfully yours. However, your opinions can magically turn into facts now. Unfortunately, you begin to believe them so intensely that you can't hear someone's contrasting point of view. Remaining open to new information improves your connections with those around you."
gemini,2013-12-31,"Since you're often the one to change your mind, others might be surprised if you stick with a specific course of action now, even when easier choices become available. You are currently attracted to complex entanglements; you need to experience the deep emotions that often slip through your fingers. Luckily, excitement accompanies you on this profound journey today, stimulating your innate curiosity so you can learn more about yourself and those you love."
cancer,2013-12-31,"You might have to stand up to someone today who refuses to give you what you want. You could even feel attacked by a person who accuses you of using your vulnerability to get your way. It's challenging to let down your guard and share your true feelings; you may think it's safer to keep your desires hidden. However, you can earn respect and admiration now if you reveal your softer sign without surrendering your integrity."
leo,2013-12-31,"You're so eager to work hard today that your peers will either follow your lead or just step out of your way. Even if others try to talk you into taking an easier path, you already know where you're going and how you're getting there. Luckily, you can accomplish more than you realize now if you remain methodical in your approach. Nevertheless, being obsessed with the details is counterproductive. Making a concrete plan is helpful as long as it has built-in flexibility, enabling you to respond to the changing circumstances."
virgo,2013-12-31,"You might try anything to keep your social plans from falling apart today, yet the planetary line-up in your 5th House of Enjoyment could have you preoccupied with wanting to have fun. Remember, issuing heavy-handed commands as if you were a drill sergeant isn't the most effective management style. Instead, lead by example while also indulging in some personal playtime. Relaxing your control makes this a more pleasant and productive day for everyone involved. Leave some room for the element of surprise."
libra,2013-12-31,"You may feel emotionally volatile today as powerful desires build until the pressure becomes unbearable. Although something dramatic could happen, it doesn't have to become an eruption or a meltdown if you stay aware of your feelings throughout the day. Positive change is possible if you are willing to leave your familiar routines behind and jump into unknown territory with an open heart."
scorpio,2013-12-31,"Your two key planets, Mars and Pluto, are both feeling the stress as their forces motivate you into action now. It's not wise to be passive today, letting circumstances develop until you've lost control. Express what you want without issuing any ultimatums or placing expectations on others. Say what you mean and then let the situation unfold on its own without being overly attached to the final outcome. Fortunately, you can claim your power while still being kind in the process."
sagittarius,2013-12-31,"Everything in your life seems up for grabs today. You may not feel as if you're in control and can't yet put your finger on where the current changes are taking you. Simultaneously, it might appear that your options are narrowing. But even if you are still committed to making something happen now, don't act out of desperation. Thankfully, your current sense of urgency will fade, giving you more time to make your dreams come true."
capricorn,2013-12-31,"You could be running a bit short of patience today and you may want to handle your frustration by taking direct action. You're growing tired of waiting for everyone else to get going as chatty Mercury joins powerful Pluto in your 1st House of Personality. If necessary, be prepared to forge ahead on your own while also remembering the wisdom of judicious self-restraint. There are no black-or-white solutions, so consider all your options now before resuming your drive to success."
aquarius,2013-12-31,Bringing an unfinished project to a conclusion makes room for new and exciting opportunities now that a potent multi-planet conjunction focuses energy into your 12th House of Endings. But beginning your next phase will be more difficult if you are still carrying the weight of old baggage. Don't waste time worrying about what's around the next corner. Lightening your load today prepares you for the challenges of the future.
pisces,2013-12-31,"A complex emotional issue that's been brewing within your family or a group of friends must be brought out into the open today. The expression of hidden emotions is a good first step in a necessary process, even if the revealed information isn't pretty. But rather than fearfully withdrawing in denial, be open to the rainbow of possibilities that might be out there beyond your current trials and tribulations."
