SIGN,DATE,TEXT
aries,2012-01-01,"You are eager to get started with the New Year because you believe it will be amazing. Happily, your confidence is likely warranted. You're capable of accomplishing a lot today, but paradoxically, the harder you push, the longer everything takes. It doesn't make sense to force your agenda onto anyone else; instead, relax a bit and let events unfold naturally. Time is on your side so there's no need to be in a hurry now."
taurus,2012-01-01,"You might wake up ready to conquer the world today as a wave of excitement washes over you. However, the rush passes quickly, leaving you with a more sensible outlook. Although you may have a concrete plan, it won't help to overwhelm someone who resists your efforts. It's smarter to turn the tables now and use your stubbornness to work in your favor. Your impatience will only provoke defensive reactions from others. Demonstrate your wisdom by focusing on your long-term strategy instead of wishing for immediate gratification."
gemini,2012-01-01,"You Twins are often of two minds, and today's square between the spontaneous Aries Moon and the calculating Capricorn Sun is no exception. On one hand, you're ready to swing into immediate action, fearing that you'll miss an opportunity if you don't do something right away. Meanwhile, you hear your inner voice cautioning you to wait for a more propitious time. Ultimately, your smartest strategy is to develop your plan more thoroughly first, and then give it your best shot."
cancer,2012-01-01,"Reacting in the moment is often a challenge for you cautious crustaceans unless you're feeling extremely secure. A blast of excitement today can be quite invigorating, but it also raises concerns if you aren't sure what to do next. Thankfully, a bit of planning helps you to sustain your energy once you come down from the adrenaline rush. Keep in mind that nurturing connections with friends and family is just as important now as demonstrating your productivity."
leo,2012-01-01,"Although you may be able to dazzle others with your song and dance, your presentation might lack real substance today. Your fun-loving approach disarms others, eliminating their resistance. Even an adversary won't be able to resist your charm in the long run because your subtle tenacity is relentless. Talking up a storm is fine; just remember to slow down and listen when following your heart's desires."
virgo,2012-01-01,"It's too easy for you to see the imperfections of someone else's plan but not your own. Be careful, for your acute analysis and criticism won't likely work in your favor now. In fact, you might inadvertently push an ally farther away if you say too much or come on too strong. Patience is your friend today; take lots of small steps when you're ready instead of forcing one giant leap before it's time."
libra,2012-01-01,"You are in a cosmic game of tug-of-war as competitive friends try to get you to see things differently. However, playful give-and-take could suddenly turn more serious. Thankfully, there isn't really a need for animosity, even if there is underlying tension today. But you're more interested in making love, not war. Although there may not be any romance involved, focus on creating common ground and the harmonious atmosphere will soon return."
scorpio,2012-01-01,"Your decisive actions demonstrate one story while your unexpressed desires tell a different tale. It looks like you're fully engaged in a social setting today, yet you can also be very productive if left to your own devices. Nevertheless, you're yearning for an entirely different experience, even if you're not yet ready to share your visions. Remember, there is no hurry, so keep your dreams quiet until they're solid enough to talk about with someone you trust."
sagittarius,2012-01-01,"Today is filled with fun and games as the feisty Aries Moon activates your 5th House of Play. Luckily, showing your good-natured personality to everyone helps you build the support you need. Doing too much planning brings diminishing returns, so just live in the power of now and make it up as you go along. If you maintain a joyful attitude, pleasurable rewards should follow."
capricorn,2012-01-01,"Your current excitability may not guarantee fun, but if you can be a little less practical today, you should be able to manage your emotions. However, avoiding your feelings won't work now, for they will return with increased power. Take time to separate your personal goals from your career objectives so you can gain clarity on both. Remember, it's easier to be ambitious when you're involved with something that you love."
aquarius,2012-01-01,"You may feel as if satisfaction is within your reach today, and happily, you could be right. However, too much impatience can turn a pleasant social scenario into a mess. Logically, you know that you should be able to get what you want right away. Unfortunately, everything is going to take longer than you expect. As long you keep an eye on your goal, you should continue to make progress. Don't be discouraged; instead, maintain a cheerful attitude or you could jeopardize the outcome."
pisces,2012-01-01,"You're all fired up and could be quite productive at home once you put your mind toward getting things done. Sometimes you excel at avoiding the details of a project, yet now you're able to maintain a high level of concentration. Apply yourself in the present moment, without being overly concerned about the unknown territory around the next corner."
aries,2012-01-02,"You may be experiencing a high level of mental and physical activity today because the initiating Aries Moon encourages you to engage the day with zest. However, events are unfolding according to their own natural rhythm, demanding that you slow down. You won't be able to bolt ahead at your own pace now, so take your time and respond to delays as gracefully as possible. In the meantime, enjoy the present moment for the opportunities it holds."
taurus,2012-01-02,"You're attracted to new and different kinds of pleasure today as wild Uranus shocks your key planet Venus. Although you are hot to trot, you realize that waiting for the right moment can make the difference between failure and success. You may feel frustrated because you're close to reaching satisfaction, yet it's still just out of reach. Rest assured that the outcome will be worth the wait."
gemini,2012-01-02,"You may feel bored with the idea of going back to work today, even before you get there. Although you might have had a fun-filled holiday, you're already looking for more excitement. Unfortunately, finishing your tasks early won't help because you still need to wait for the clock. Don't frustrate yourself by focusing on what you want to do; instead, bring your awareness back to the present moment and seek happiness there."
cancer,2012-01-02,"Your friends and associates may be depending on you today, possibly leading you to resent them for having unreasonable expectations. Naturally, you enjoy nurturing those close to you, but you don't particularly like it when your personal needs are overlooked in the process. Stop trying to place the blame on anyone else; take charge of your life and do what you must to fulfill your own desires."
leo,2012-01-02,"You may have something sweet to smile about today because it seems as if your life is moving in the right direction. Although you might not have everything you want, it's wonderful to believe that your patience will finally pay off. But blindly pinning your hopes onto a pipedream isn't such a smart strategy. You don't have to get crazy and turn your world upside down; just start making concrete plans while luck is on your side."
virgo,2012-01-02,"Having lots to do can put you in a good mood today, especially if you're satisfied with the quality of your work. You might not even care if others don't acknowledge how much you contribute because peer recognition isn't as important as meeting your own personal standards of quality. Ironically, your understated approach will work in your favor, leading others to express their appreciation for your extra effort."
libra,2012-01-02,"You can be so fair-minded in your dealings with others that your greatest challenge is acknowledging what you need for yourself. However, there's currently no doubt in your mind; you know what you want and would be wise to ask for it today while your intentions are clear. Just remember that you still may have to wait for satisfaction. Fortunately, your chances for success are likely now as long as you express your needs honestly."
scorpio,2012-01-02,"You're looking for new and different ways to resolve nagging old problems. You aren't interested in doing your job the same way as before because a radical approach enables you to gain a fresh perspective on your routine. However, there's no value in shaking up everything at once. Working quietly behind the scenes allows you to make steady progress toward re-establishing your job security."
sagittarius,2012-01-02,"You might wish you could delay going back to work today, but luckily you have the opportunity to derive profound satisfaction from working with people you like. You can experience a wonderful camaraderie that comes from being on a winning team. However, you could struggle as you try to downplay your need for independence. Instead of withdrawing to do your own thing now, bring your innovative spirit and unique point of view to the group process."
capricorn,2012-01-02,"The Moon harmonizes with your key planet Saturn today, empowering you to stand up to a bully or to defend your integrity. Fortunately, if you can stay focused on your objectives, everything should improve as the day unfolds. You may end up making some extra money or seizing a chance to kindle a romantic interest. However, you must be patient; success won't happen overnight."
aquarius,2012-01-02,"This could be a very hectic day, especially if you must handle work that piled up prior to the holidays. Keep in mind that you may not be able to finish everything that's on your plate. Don't take it personally; you really don't need to waste time now reflecting on your past failures. Acknowledging that some things are beyond your control leads to being content with simply doing the best job you can."
pisces,2012-01-02,"You may grow tired with the thought of returning to the daily grind and want to retreat into your own private space instead. Even if you need to be around others now, you're still likely to feel a bit withdrawn. Fortunately, this isn't a problem because you can still do your job while letting your imagination wander. Just continue to do your work while keeping your personal thoughts to yourself."
aries,2012-01-03,"You're known for your ability to be spontaneous rather than planning ahead, yet you can also be very patient when you want something badly enough. Although your current desires may be strong, you are not in a hurry now. In fact, you might even be feeling a bit lazy, luxuriating in the status quo. But don't get too comfortable with the way things are because your efforts today can have positive consequences in the future."
taurus,2012-01-03,"People may lean on you because you seem as steady as the Rock of Gibraltar. You are clear about what you want and how you're going to get it -- and there isn't much that can alter your course today. Others believe that they could find security in the strength of your convictions. But your stability depends on you sticking close to the facts, so don't waste brainpower attempting to understand the mysteries of the universe. Keep things simple and save the philosophizing and dreaming for another time."
gemini,2012-01-03,"You can find a simple kind of pleasure in being serious now because you want everyone to recognize how stable you are. You are often the one who speaks up with a provocative question or a witty comeback. However, you aren't interested in showing others how clever you are today. Taking a few deep breaths instead of replying quickly is an effective tactic to demonstrate that you're contemplating your answers before you speak."
cancer,2012-01-03,"Although you like the idea of working closely with others today, participating in group activities is complicated by dynamic emotional entanglements. Nevertheless, your profound sense of loyalty to your friends and colleagues makes it difficult to do anything that creates tension between you and anyone else. Don't go silent simply to avoid conflict. You can still be a team player, even while standing up for your individual point of view."
leo,2012-01-03,"You're feeling more confident about your job today, even if you're not receiving much feedback. Instead of riding on an emotional rollercoaster, your moods begin to stabilize, allowing you to maintain an overall sense of calmness. Integrate the wild ups and downs you recently experienced rather than stirring up new excitement now. Although this may be a mellow day, there will still be more thrills before your ride is over."
virgo,2012-01-03,"You may be anxious if your day doesn't unfold according to your schedule. Even if there's still plenty of time to finish your work, a fear continues to gnaw away in the back of your mind. It's frustrating because you realize that whatever's bugging you won't be solved in a day. However, it's pointless to spend time being self-critical or judgmental. Although you strive for perfection, remember that you're human and must accept your shortcomings just like everyone else."
libra,2012-01-03,"You're tempted to let someone know that you're annoyed today when working with others who believe they know it all. Unfortunately, expressing your frustration probably won't improve your day. To make matters worse, you could unconsciously provoke someone to act even more stubbornly. If a friend or co-worker digs in his or her heels, remember that it's not your job to change anyone's mind. It's a smarter strategy now to work on your own issues and let your actions speak for you instead."
scorpio,2012-01-03,"You could benefit from setting a steady pace to your routine today, one that will enable you to reach your short-term goals in the days and weeks ahead. Hopefully, you realize that you can't force anyone to move any faster than they're already going -- even if it would simplify your life. But don't worry about things that are out of your control; instead, do whatever you can to positively affect your own behavior. Your unwavering persistence will be rewarded."
sagittarius,2012-01-03,"You may feel very content with your accomplishments today, but true satisfaction requires that you finish whatever projects you start. This means that you must establish realistic objectives, make a workable plan for the day and then follow through with consistent effort. Relying on your common sense supports your dreams, giving you a better chance of success."
capricorn,2012-01-03,"Although this is a propitious day, it might not seem out of the ordinary as it unfolds. The steadfast Taurus Moon is harmonizing with the Sun and potent Pluto in your ambitious sign, indicating that you can accomplish nearly anything you set your mind to now. However, keep in mind that the results of your current work may take weeks to manifest. Just do the best you can and the rewards will follow."
aquarius,2012-01-03,"You might appear less responsible than you actually are today, but you may keep the more serious issues to yourself. You are more practical than sentimental now, empowering you to set your emotions aside and just get down to work. Fortunately, applying yourself extra diligently will be worth it in the long run. Instead of frittering away your opportunity, do something that actually matters."
pisces,2012-01-03,"It's challenging to know if you should take a bit of downtime when you're offered the chance, or if it's smarter to be practical and just keep working. The truth is that your best strategy combines hard work with a little escape. However, the sequence of events is critical. Meet your responsibilities first, and then indulge in your fantasies later on."
aries,2012-01-04,"Sticking with the tried and true method brings better results today than rushing off to start something entirely new. You may grow restless if everything seems too familiar, but it's a smarter strategy to manage your anxiety by modifying your attitude instead of messing with your environment. Thankfully, once you accept that you need to settle into your routine, most everything should get easier to manage all around."
taurus,2012-01-04,"The Moon's visit to your determined sign may be quite stabilizing, but you could become so concerned with getting your way now that you obsess over something you want. Even if you are concerned that things are not going your way, they just might be out of your control. Rather than increasing your frustration by trying to change circumstances that are unchangeable, remind yourself that practicing flexibility helps to prevent your energy from getting stuck."
gemini,2012-01-04,You might not be so talkative today because you're afraid of saying too much. Your self-restraint is an intelligent strategy since there are issues that need your attention and it can be problematic if you wear yourself out too early in the game. Find some time to relax so you have energy for what's ahead instead of pursuing random social activities now.
cancer,2012-01-04,"This may be a perfect day to socialize with friends, but don't worry about figuring out the details in advance. You might experience some anxiety because you want to know exactly what you will be doing later, but ultimately it will be more enjoyable if you leave things unstructured for now. Fortunately, the less you plan, the more relaxed you'll be throughout the day."
leo,2012-01-04,"You could back yourself into a corner with no easy way out today because you might try too hard to make your plan work. In fact, you are banking on everyone sticking closely to your agenda as promised. But the universe might have a slightly different notion about what's next, and you're better off if you don't fight the inevitable. Even if you are successful at forcing reality to fit into your scheme, you could exhaust yourself in the process. Honestly, it's okay to relax your control now because you will regain it later on."
virgo,2012-01-04,"This may be a rather easygoing day if you don't make yourself busy with too much unnecessary work. Instead of shifting into automatic gear and working through your list of regular chores, consider which tasks are non-essential and leave those for another day. Even if you're typically a hard worker, think about taking some well-deserved time off just to relax today."
libra,2012-01-04,"You have a highly unique way of approaching life now, but you might not be able to set your ideas into motion. But this isn't only about your efforts being blocked; your current lack of confidence makes you wonder if you'll be able to reach your goals if you are opposed to the prevailing currents. Actually, you're smarter to wait it out; enjoy yourself today by being creative, instead of productive. Save your strength for another day when the going isn't so rough."
scorpio,2012-01-04,"It's irritating if someone quickly agrees with you in word, yet continues to resist nearly everything you do. It's as if there's a split between the mental and physical universe, which can be quite frustrating. Keep in mind that you won't be able to solve this dilemma today. Instead of forcing any issues, just be an objective witness to what's happening. Thankfully, you can still feel content if you simply make a decision to let it be for now."
sagittarius,2012-01-04,"You might not be able to accomplish all your goals today, but a large part of the problem comes from taking on too much. You can visualize the big picture so well that it motivates you to think beyond your immediate environment. Unfortunately, there isn't a fast way to get to your destination. Nevertheless, you'll be happier if you concentrate on the most practical things you can do, even if that means success is delayed another day."
capricorn,2012-01-04,"Your friends might believe that you would benefit from some relaxation today, but may secretly think that you don't know how to have fun. However, you're ready to let them follow you around so you can prove them wrong. Although you could have a struggle on your hands convincing them, you can still have a good time doing it. Don't bother defending your actions if someone doesn't like your strategy. Just get on with your plans and make things happen exactly the way you want them to now, without worrying about what others think."
aquarius,2012-01-04,The same events that might have upset your life previously don't seem to have the same unsettling effect now. But unresolved issues won't likely vanish on their own unless you maintain a firm inner resolve. Keep your eyes focused on the distant horizon. You will reach your destination if you don't become distracted -- even if it takes more time than you prefer.
pisces,2012-01-04,"You are ready to settle into an easy day at work, hoping that you don't have to deal with any major upheavals. However, you may need to overcome a few obstacles that now stand between you and your personal satisfaction. You won't find happiness if you try to force your position on others. It's more effective to step back from potential conflicts until you're able to talk about your emotions in a rational manner."
aries,2012-01-05,"You may actually enjoy yourself today, even if you don't get very much accomplished. You might be more interested in learning something new than you are in finishing your work. Unfortunately, this can stir up the ire of a co-worker who wishes that you would hold up your end of the deal. Avoid causing unnecessary trouble now by attending to your responsibilities before going off on your intellectual exploration."
taurus,2012-01-05,"You may feel as if you are caught between two opposing forces, yet you're limited in how you can respond. It would be ideal if you could accept a wonderful invitation that is offered to you today, but previous work obligations don't give you enough time. You would love to jump at a chance to make more money, but it probably isn't time yet. Keep plugging away for now; your opportunity to shine will come soon enough."
gemini,2012-01-05,"The Moon's return to your sign is exciting because you see wonderful possibilities everywhere you look. However, too many choices can be a bit overwhelming, especially if you're trying to follow through on a task that you started earlier in the week. Don't be too hard on yourself if you aren't able to concentrate on your work. Just make certain that you return to it later so you don't let anyone down."
cancer,2012-01-05,The Moon's shift into your 12th House of Privacy reinforces your tendency to withdraw emotionally if circumstances become too confusing or intense. But taking defensive action and retreating behind a wall of secrecy won't necessarily make you feel any more secure. Your smartest strategy now is to talk about your concerns. Getting your feelings out into the open saves you from having to pull into your fantasies in order to feel safe.
leo,2012-01-05,"Although there may be pressure on you to fulfill promises you made at work, you might rather be socializing with your friends or associates. Unfortunately, it's so easy to distract yourself today, you could forget to return to your chores. Instead of avoiding your responsibilities by pursuing one thing after another, make a commitment to finish what you start before rewarding yourself with the pleasurable company of others."
virgo,2012-01-05,"You are standing at a fork in the road and have a choice to make now that could have a significant impact on the direction of your career. Although you can clearly see the pros and cons of taking either direction, you must decide based on what you know today, rather than what might happen in the future. Your dreams are important, but it's smarter to be practical and stick with the facts when making major decisions."
libra,2012-01-05,"Your current ideas are not limited by reality, yet thinking big may lead you in an entirely new direction. Unfortunately, placing too much importance on your imagination can be disorienting if you don't balance your dreams with your actual circumstances. It's better to give yourself permission to let your mind wander than attempting to stop your natural creative flow. Just remember that you don't have to act on every whim or share every thought."
scorpio,2012-01-05,"It may be annoying at first if something happens to distract you from your agenda today. You won't likely change your mind easily, but your unwillingness to be flexible isn't helpful now. Having to let go of your plans may seem like a setback, but it could be a blessing in disguise. This is not about your failure to reach your goals; rather, it's a temporary break in your progress that allows you to recharge your batteries so your energy is there when you need it most."
sagittarius,2012-01-05,"It's all about relationships today with the Moon's presence in your 7th House of Companions. Other people can either be a source of exciting fun or irritating distraction. Or, more likely, someone is both pleasant and bothersome at the same time. You don't want to be alone so you enjoy the company, yet it's difficult to maintain a steady pace when another person keeps pulling you off track. There's no simple solution to your current dilemma, but being adaptable enables you to keep a positive attitude all day."
capricorn,2012-01-05,"You are confused about what to do at work today. Even if you've been assigned a specific task, there are several ways for you to approach it. The dualistic Gemini Moon's visit to your 6th House of Details can bog you down in minutiae or red tape unless you keep reminding yourself of your goal. Ultimately, it's better to jump in and get busy than to continue analyzing the various possibilities. The sooner you start, the sooner you finish."
aquarius,2012-01-05,"Losing yourself in fantasies becomes more attractive day by day, but the longer you can remain focused on the real world, the better off you'll be today. Your dreams can be a significant source of inspiration if you also keep your feet on the ground. There will be time to float off into your imaginary world in the days ahead, but for now, keep bringing your thoughts back to the present moment so you can make good use of your original ideas."
pisces,2012-01-05,"Although your life may be filled with things to do and people to see, you might prefer the idea of amusing yourself on your own. Or, perhaps, you like the idea of friends coming over to your place so you don't have to go out to enjoy yourself. Even at work, you may be torn between your desire to keep to yourself and the need to interact with your co-workers. However, there's no urgency to resolve this dilemma today, for it will take care of itself soon enough."
aries,2012-01-06,"It's difficult to maintain a steady work pace today if your natural rhythm feels off balance. Your key planet Mars is stressed in your 6th House of Daily Routine, possibly making advanced planning of your day counterproductive. It's better to be free from too many commitments now because you could be required to respond to changing circumstances. If you feel as if you're stuck in a rut, making small changes is healthier than turning everything upside down."
taurus,2012-01-06,"You typically stick with a decision once you make up your mind, but you might go back and forth several times today before you finally are satisfied with your choice. Your ambivalence could leave you feeling nervous, especially if you're getting pressured by others to make a commitment. However, it's not wise to give your final answer before you are comfortable with it. Step back from all the noise so you can listen to your inner voice; your intuition won't steer you wrong now."
gemini,2012-01-06,"It seems as if time is speeding up and your life is moving faster than you prefer. Normally, you like the thrill that comes from a lot of activity, but today you will be ready for some rest by the end of the day. Give yourself time to relax in the evening, since you will need to have your wits about you if relationship issues surface. An emotionally charged conflict that arises now is best handled in the present moment with honesty and kindness."
cancer,2012-01-06,"You would love to find a harmonious balance today between your desire to resolve an ongoing disagreement and your tendency to avoid difficult communication by withdrawing into your shell. Although you're considering every option, you're fairly comfortable with your own feelings. If you sense emotional tension in the atmosphere, make everyone feel better by confronting the issue directly."
leo,2012-01-06,"You may receive a ""Get Out of Jail Free"" card from the universe, however, you must use it right away. Although you haven't solved any long-term issues, you can sidestep the problems for a while as you relax by taking a scenic ride today. Imagine yourself moving through the day as if it is a dream while always keeping one foot on the ground, so you won't forget what's real. Remain open to pleasurable experiences now without stressing about how you will integrate them into your life."
virgo,2012-01-06,"The proverb ""the devil is in the details"" could be your unraveling today. Everything may appear to be unfolding according to your master plan, but it's entirely possible you could overlook something very important. Rather than trying to minimize your error, face up to it right away. Avoiding a problem will only make it grow in size. Make the necessary changes so you can put things back on track as quickly as you can."
libra,2012-01-06,"Today goes well for you if you can keep your feelings to yourself, since your desires will likely conflict with what others want. Unfortunately, you have something to say and you don't want to put it off. Once you begin expressing yourself, it's hard to know when to stop. You could work yourself into a state of anxiety that makes you less effective in communicating your message. Avoid becoming a victim of your own passion now by using as few words as you can to explain your point of view."
scorpio,2012-01-06,"You may be juggling your responsibilities today because you're trying to accomplish too much at once. Still, you could complete everything that is required if you stop and prioritize what you need to do. Mapping out your day helps to prevent you from scattering your energy and frittering away your resources. Be realistic in your approach; if necessary, pare back activities instead of waiting until you're already behind schedule."
sagittarius,2012-01-06,"You may believe that a new strategy is required now to take a relationship to the next level or to revitalize it with fresh energy. Nevertheless, you still might resist the necessary changes unconsciously if you aren't certain which way you want to go. Don't let confusion stand in the way of truth. Rather than tapdancing around the edges of confrontation, be direct and say exactly what's on your mind. Even if your opinion creates dissension, resolution will be possible once everything is out in the open."
capricorn,2012-01-06,"You have lots of thoughts running through your head today, but it's challenging to put them into words because they are moving so quickly. It's difficult to gauge the impact of your presentation because one minute it seems as if everyone's agreeing with you, and then the next minute someone's belittling your perspective. Paradoxically, you'll be more successful if you don't try so hard. Be patient and save your most convincing arguments until tomorrow when the planets are on your side."
aquarius,2012-01-06,"You might think that you can sweet talk your way through a tricky situation today, but someone may not be willing to take what you say at face value. There can be powerful feelings just beneath the surface, making it difficult for you to get your way. Normally, your fixed sense of purpose enables you to successfully navigate your way through the obstacles. Although it's difficult to focus now, you can still win an argument if you remember to keep bringing the discussion back to the point at hand."
pisces,2012-01-06,"Although you may be an incurable dreamer, it's not helpful to drift off into the clouds now. You won't be able to complete what you have started if your mind keeps wandering into the future. It's more important to concentrate on the present moment than to think about what you will need to do next. If necessary, lean on a trusted friend or partner for help. But even if someone's advice feels more like criticism, listen to what you're being told and consider incorporating it into your strategy."
aries,2012-01-07,"You may set your hopes on a lofty goal today because your enthusiasm can counteract a discouraging mood. Although your thinking may be inspired now, you're still able to remain pragmatic about what you can actually accomplish. Later in the day you might wonder if you extended your reach too far. Don't worry; you didn't. It just going to take time for you to put it all together."
taurus,2012-01-07,"Although your self-confidence should pull you through a bout with uncertainty, your moods swing widely throughout the day. It's not like you to put blind faith into a vision or a fantasy, but it really seems possible to reach for the stars today and grab one. Unfortunately, you may not be as ready for prime time as you think. Don't be too hard on yourself when you realize how much more work is still in front of you. Thankfully, you can rely on your legendary patience now that you need it."
gemini,2012-01-07,"Your day begins as an intellectual curiosity; you wonder if your dreams are worth pursuing. But as the day wears on, you become more involved with your fantasy until you're hooked by the heat of your desires. You may worry that you've lost your objectivity, but you bravely push into unknown territory as you're tempted by your irrational feelings. Just remember to take it slowly; if you suddenly find yourself in emotional deep water you might be tempted to run back the safety of dry land."
cancer,2012-01-07,"As long as you can stay connected with your inner world, the path ahead should remain clear enough to let you continue on your way. It doesn't matter if you run into an unexpected obstacle if you know that you're doing the best you can do. But don't convince yourself that you know what's going to happen. Although your fate can shift several times, staying focused on your goal remains your best strategy."
leo,2012-01-07,"You can appear to be quite an enigma today, especially if you consciously choose to keep your emotions hidden from others. Although you might feel thin-skinned, you're probably more secure if your friends and co-workers can't ask revealing questions because they don't even know something is wrong. Ironically, someone's eager support may annoy you as much as the resistance you face. Thankfully, your troubles fade once you become confident enough to reveal your vulnerability to someone you trust."
virgo,2012-01-07,"You are a fount of inspirational vision and strength for your friends today. If you are participating on a team effort or project, others in the group or your family will look up to you for guidance. But there's no need to be authoritarian; just share your feelings as you respond to what's happening around you. Your instincts will naturally reveal the most logical steps to take next."
libra,2012-01-07,"Sharing your dreams with someone you trust enables you to stay emotionally balanced today. But this isn't an open invitation to float away into Fantasyland. Instead, this is an opportunity express your vision of an ideal future realistic enough to be possible. However, your feelings may be harder to reveal later in the day if you didn't begin the dialogue when you had the chance. Getting a previously hidden secret out into the open enables you to delve deeper toward the evening."
scorpio,2012-01-07,"Your perspective grows more intense throughout the day as magnetic Venus forms a dynamic aspect with your key planet Pluto. If your intentions are altruistic, you can convince others to join you in your cause. Your ability to reframe an unpleasant situation allows you to make it attractive while still adhering to the truth. Take your time to explain exactly what you see now because you can widen people's horizons and help them see possibilities they might have missed."
sagittarius,2012-01-07,"You might appear to be spacey to others at first, but once they hear you explain your idea further it begins to make more sense to them. Your imagination enables you to extend your thoughts well into the future, yet you're able to back up your observations with sound thinking. Ultimately, this is a great day to share your dreams if you're willing to keep one foot firmly planted on the ground."
capricorn,2012-01-07,"Your communication is so clear today that you can hold your audience's attention as you talk about the future. However, you're also in touch with your imagination, so you're not limited to a logical perspective. There's no need to hold on to previous plans as current circumstances continue to change. Letting go of an old agenda helps to make more room for a newer one that is more meaningful to your current state of mind and more interesting to everyone else."
aquarius,2012-01-07,"Your day may start off smoothly enough, but you could be brought right to the edge of your comfort zone before it's over. Although you seem to have a healthy balance between reality and fantasy, you grow increasingly uncomfortable as an emotional drama sidetracks you from your dreaming and planning. Don't fight against the currents pulling you out of your rational world; be patient and remain open to the process of transformation. You can learn a valuable lesson from this experience."
pisces,2012-01-07,"You may feel as if the pressures are easing so you can breathe easily again. You're enthused by the intriguing possibilities you see everywhere you look. Happily, you believe your goals to be within reach. Nevertheless, you can also sense a growing disturbance in your peaceful energy field, and although you can't recognize its source, this disharmony bothers you. Trusting your sixth sense is wise now, but don't let your fear of the unknown overpower the comfort you know."
aries,2012-01-08,"You're trying to catch up on chores and your unrestrained optimism tempts you to take on more work than you can possibly finish. Unfortunately, your exuberance may be stymied if you reach too far. Instead of believing that you need to convert every intellectual breakthrough into tangible results, just allow your thoughts to rise and fall like the tides. Visualize yourself standing on the shores of awareness, but remember that you don't have to capture every individual wave to make your mark."
taurus,2012-01-08,"You feel as if you're waiting for something big to happen, yet it remains out of reach. You want to settle down, but your restlessness lingers until you accept that the resistance comes from your own attitude. Fortunately, when you begin to let go of control, the tension begins to disperse. Forget about adjusting specific details of your day; instead consider changing your long-term goals. Ironically, aiming your attention at the distant horizon has a positive impact on the present moment."
gemini,2012-01-08,"It's challenging to follow through on anything that you start now, but you won't likely be bothered about it for too long. You forget about what you were doing as soon as you get another idea and become immersed in the next activity. Your behavior might be upsetting to others today, yet you'll probably continue scattering your energy until you can no longer keep up with everything. Ultimately, obtaining closure on unfinished business improves your reputation and raises your confidence."
cancer,2012-01-08,"Although you may wish things were simpler today, it feels as if you built your relationships on shifting sands. Thankfully, you might be able to change the energy faster than you thought possible by just telling the truth. Don't hold back; even if your life is turned upside down for a while, it will settle back on the solid foundation that you seek. Have the courage to throw caution to the wind when it comes to following your heart."
leo,2012-01-08,"You think you know what you want today, but the circumstances keep changing. Just as you become comfortable with one perspective, everything shifts and you need to readjust your expectations. Your willingness to be flexible could prevent a serious headache. Pay constant attention to the interpersonal dynamics and respond with your heart, not your head. Too much thinking now can get in the way of your best interests."
virgo,2012-01-08,"Your key planet Mercury is totally buzzing today, yet it may be too much for you to easily integrate, especially if you believe you already have the answers. The more rigid you are in your thinking, the louder the static is from electrical Uranus. But your readiness for change empowers you to explore the outer limits of your imagination. However, remember that you don't have to push your thought process over the edge; your evolving perspective is all you need."
libra,2012-01-08,"Your mind is operating at an incredibly high speed today, yet you're wondering if you're capable of keeping it up throughout the entire day. You might assume that things will eventually slow down, but other people keep introducing more complications. The hectic pace is fun at first, but might become more exhausting as the day goes on. Don't try to do everything all at once. Extending your thinking into the future can help you remain calmer in the present."
scorpio,2012-01-08,"You are possessed with self-confidence today, especially if someone you trust is expressing his or her approval of your performance. Although unpredictable Uranus can set off a strike of lighting that upsets your current routine, lucky Jupiter is standing by with cosmic assistance. As long as you're willing to change your mind quickly, you should be able to make good use of the new information that comes to you now. Letting go of old assumptions clears the way for an exciting new direction."
sagittarius,2012-01-08,"Your key planet Jupiter encourages you to take on more than you would on another day. Fortunately, you're able to accomplish so much today that others might think you are a superhero. However, there's a price to pay for your action-packed day. So many events are interrelated now that one unexpected blip can bring down the entire house of cards. But even a crisis or two won't stop you if you're open to starting over again and shifting your course as needed."
capricorn,2012-01-08,"You may think that everything is going to calm down, but you probably won't have time to catch your breath for a couple of days. You're being called back into action today and you must show up ready to work or you might lose valuable ground. Fortunately, mental Mercury's shift into your ambitious sign indicates that you're up for the task. Accept the current challenges with a fierce determination and get started immediately; you don't have any time to waste."
aquarius,2012-01-08,"Although your thoughts are tied to your future, today's tenacious Cancer Moon reveals your desire to stay exactly where you are now. Unfortunately, you must let go of the past as electric Uranus zaps you out of your nostalgic fantasies. Overcome your fears and face the brave new world that's right around the next corner. You might not be able to see what's coming, but if you're willing to take a calculated risk the rewards will follow."
pisces,2012-01-08,"You don't have to convince anyone that your plan is the right one today; you only need to communicate with honesty and integrity. There are no correct or incorrect points of view now, just differing ones. Even if your opinions are unconventional, others will respect you for clearly stating exactly where you stand. Nevertheless, you will appear more sincere if you are also sensitive to other people's positions. Having an open mind is the key to making the best choices."
aries,2012-01-09,"You're tempted to demand changes at work, but expressing your anger won't necessarily help your cause. You will do much better today by demonstrating your respect for authority instead of challenging it. Be patient with others now since the Cancer Full Moon in your 4th House of Security indicates that maintaining a positive attitude creates more stability than pushing for immediate resolution to your concerns."
taurus,2012-01-09,"You don't like suddenly changing your plans at the very last minute, but you're willing to stir things up anyhow if you're not happy with the current situation. The emotional Cancer Full Moon illuminates your 3rd House of Communication, encouraging you to share your opinions, especially if things aren't going your way. However, overreacting now will only make matters worse, so cool your heels and just do what you can without upsetting the status quo."
gemini,2012-01-09,"Today's Cancer Full Moon in your 2nd House of Values may set your opinions in direct conflict with someone else's. Instead of bringing your feelings out into the open, consider keeping them to yourself because resolution through conversation can be elusive now. In fact, a minor disagreement could escalate into a serious conflict. Just express your ideas and then move on; there's nothing positive to be gained by trying to convince anyone that your point of view is the best."
cancer,2012-01-09,"The Full Moon in your emotional sign reveals previously unresolved relationship tension. You might have believed that everything was settled, only to realize that an important issue was never fully resolved. Don't set unrealistic expectations about finding a quick fix now. Instead, allow sufficient time to straighten things out or the same disagreement will continue resurfacing again and again."
leo,2012-01-09,"You may experience a significant spiritual breakthrough today as the Cancer Full Moon brightens your karmic 12th House of Fate. Even if stressful events arise now, your metaphysical perspective empowers you to avoid dwelling on the negativity. Lessening your involvement in someone else's emotional melodrama could be your best strategy. Minimizing your distractions enables you to undergo a profound attitude shift that can positively impact all aspects of your life."
virgo,2012-01-09,"You could have mixed feelings about commitments you recently made to your friends or workmates. The reflective Cancer Full Moon activates your 11th House of Social Networking today, encouraging you to retreat from noisy group activities that require too much of your energy. Ironically, the notion of losing yourself in a crowd sounds like an easy way to escape your confusion. No matter which path you pick, you might wish you chose the other, so don't judge yourself too harshly."
libra,2012-01-09,"You have a significant social role to play today as the nurturing Cancer Full Moon emphasizes your 10th House of Public Responsibility. However, your idea of living up to everyone's expectations might not match up with reality. Demands being placed on you could create conflict, especially if others are pushing you to follow different agendas. Don't get hooked into an unwinnable argument. Just remain true to yourself while beings as kind as possible to those around you."
scorpio,2012-01-09,"You are wise to keep your thoughts to yourself today because others will intuitively know what you're feeling, even if you tell them something completely different. Just don't take this thinking too far by avoiding a truth that needs to be spoken aloud. The emotional Cancer Full Moon illuminates your 9th House of Big Ideas, making it crucial to bring your opinions down to earth. It's more important to be practical now than to waste your time justifying your actions."
sagittarius,2012-01-09,"The protective Cancer Full Moon occurs in your 8th House of Deep Sharing, motivating you to swing into action to care for those you love. Still, it's useful to check in with your friends today before acting in good faith, but with inaccurate information. An incorrect assumption could lead to behavior that's contrary to their desires. Ascertain whether it's your personal fears or their best interests that you're worried about before doing something you might regret."
capricorn,2012-01-09,"The steady Capricorn Sun is reflected by today's Cancer Full Moon in your 7th House of Relationships. You could get caught up in a power struggle with an associate or a family member, and you might not be able to determine who is actually in charge. There's no clear-cut winner because you both lose if either one of you is disenfranchised. Instead of seeking an ultimate solution, just establish a bit of common ground and let everything else slide for now."
aquarius,2012-01-09,"You're determined to attend to all the details of your day on your own, but the more you try to micromanage your life, the less control you actually have. Today's moody Cancer Full Moon lands in your 6th House of Daily Routine, making it difficult for you to rely on old familiar patterns. Doing things the same way won't bring you the security you're seeking. Instead, focus on the spiritual dimensions of your life so you can confidently let go of the past."
pisces,2012-01-09,"You may be eager to discover new ways of enjoying yourself as today's Cancer Full Moon lights up your 5th House of Fun and Games. Nevertheless, you might be hesitant to let anyone else know about your desires now because you're afraid they will criticize you for being self-indulgent. Even if you wish that others would approve of your current choices, it's healthier to take a risk and cautiously move ahead all by yourself."
aries,2012-01-10,"You may grow bored unless you have an opportunity to do things your way today. The lively Leo Moon's presence in your 5th House of Self-Expression encourages you to share what you're feeling, even if it means shaking everything up a bit. However, actually setting your plan into motion could require more forethought than you want to invest. But don't let that stop you; it's your time to take a risk and be as creative as you feel. Original thinking helps you find the best way to make it happen."
taurus,2012-01-10,"You could be so caught up in your own thoughts today that you can miss an opportunity for fun that's right in front of your nose. Don't worry if you're not motivated to work hard because indulging in pleasure might be exactly what you need now. As long as you don't totally avoid your previous obligations, there's nothing wrong with a quick escape to replenish your energy. After you have relaxed for a while, you should be much more amenable to returning to your responsibilities."
gemini,2012-01-10,"You're motivated to make it appear like you're enjoying yourself today because you're trying to set an example for others to follow. You may think if your co-workers see you having a good time, they will want to join in. Unfortunately, this tactic isn't the smartest strategy since your game playing could alienate the same people you want to attract. Just be straightforward from the start or you'll end up being so clever that you outsmart yourself."
cancer,2012-01-10,"You might be so stubborn when it comes to spending money today that you disagree with someone who thinks you should be more frugal. Although this conflict may not be worth an argument, you still need to be careful about denying your feelings. You could grow irritated if you bury your real needs and remain completely silent. Ultimately, it's best to say what's on your mind now. Even if you must compromise, you'll be more optimistic about what's ahead once you express yourself."
leo,2012-01-10,"Even if you have a serious to-do list in front of you, you're not necessarily in the mood to work today. The Moon's visit to your dramatic sign makes it more difficult to hide your feelings, yet expressing them might not help your day run any smoother. Instead of setting a good example for others by being responsible, you're tempted to evade your chores now. However, handling your obligations early in the day so you have time to play later settles your resistance before it grows into rebellion or resentment."
virgo,2012-01-10,"This can be an enjoyable day even if you don't have a lot going on. The Leo Moon's visit to your 12th House of Spirituality allows you to find great enjoyment, even from the simplest pleasures. There's no need to go out of your way to make something special happen. Instead, just grab a bit of well-deserved rest and relaxation while you can. No fretting is required; your life will grow busy again soon enough."
libra,2012-01-10,"Going out and seeking unusual experiences with your friends today sounds like a good idea. However, you might become so involved with a project at home that you reconsider your previous commitments. Finding a creative flow can be very satisfying, but think twice before you just cancel an engagement. Even if it's a challenge to get moving now, you'll be glad you did once you're in motion."
scorpio,2012-01-10,"Oftentimes you enjoy working behind the scenes, but the Leo Moon in your 10th House of Status encourages you to ask for the recognition you have earned. You may even be tempted to overdramatize your feelings to ensure that they are heard and acknowledged. Unfortunately, being too assertive today might actually produce results that are opposite to what you desire. Ironically, you won't have to practice self-restraint once you realize that grandstanding is counterproductive."
sagittarius,2012-01-10,"Your eagerness to let your imagination dream up future adventures may be stronger now than your ability to turn them into reality. However, you might discover that you don't have to be so pragmatic to make your fantasies real. Lean on using your common sense by eliminating all but the most practical ideas. Then, allow plenty of time to develop your plans before you put them into motion. Mapping out your strategy in terms of weeks and months maximizes your chances for success."
capricorn,2012-01-10,"You are usually capable of working hard and waiting for personal satisfaction if your goals are clearly defined. However, you may feel very disappointed once you realize that you don't have what you want today. Even if your most important needs are being fulfilled, you might still think that there's something missing -- yet you don't know what it could be. Your ongoing frustration can get the best of you unless you truly believe that there's no hurry to find the answer. Take your time; you have a few more weeks to sort it all out."
aquarius,2012-01-10,"You may have to stand up for yourself today if others try to bully you into taking a different course of action. Don't let someone get away with assuming power that wasn't earned. If you see a friend or co-worker misusing authority, be brave and speak up. But don't get hooked into believing that you have to prove anything. Simply getting the truth, as you see it, out into the open helps everyone involved."
pisces,2012-01-10,"You probably have plenty to accomplish today now that the Moon is visiting your 6th House of Work. Although your mind could meander off course, others can see through your attempts to make it look like you're highly focused now. Don't bother trying to hide the obvious; it will only take extra time and energy. Acknowledge the richness of your current fantasy life while still doing your best to cross tasks off your list one at a time."
aries,2012-01-11,"Your ruling planet Mars is held suspended in time today, making it difficult to initiate action. Even if you have a concrete plan, it may be nearly impossible to stick to it. The timing is off now; just as you are finally ready to start a new project, a wave of emotions can sweep over you and catch you off guard. Nevertheless, you don't need to wait any longer; it's time to sprint toward your destination no matter what. Concentrate on reaching your goals, even if they suddenly seem far away."
taurus,2012-01-11,"Taking action too soon may not seem like your regular style, but you might become so impatient today that you do something without considering what might happen next. You could get hooked by someone who has a specific idea of what you should be doing at work. You're willing to jeopardize the stability of your current job for a chance at real success. Go for it, but don't burn any bridges that you will later regret."
gemini,2012-01-11,"You want to create a big splash now as you demonstrate how proactive you can be in a tough situation. However, you might not think that revealing your emotions is a good idea. Although finding your center of gravity is useful, acting cautiously actually helps your cause. There's no need to change everything all at once. Instead, take a few steps backward, breathe deeply and give it your best shot again once you're ready."
cancer,2012-01-11,"You're motivated to take on a new project today, but as you get closer to starting your excitement might begin to wane. Even if you do jump in, you might not have sufficient stamina to finish it, so try not to waste too much energy. Managing your resources wisely now could be crucial to your well-being later. There's a lot happening around you, so it's wise to prioritize your tasks immediately and not after it's too late."
leo,2012-01-11,"You may not be comfortable with your role as an action hero today as fiery Mars runs into a complex web of aspects. You might feel as if you're ready to boil over, yet the fire isn't quite hot enough to do the trick. Cooling your jets until everything is in order may not be an option because the window of opportunity won't stay open for very long. Even if you don't have a detailed plan in place, just grab the chance while you can and apply your energy to creating your future."
virgo,2012-01-11,"You may not feel like seeing too many of your friends and acquaintances today, so your initial impulse might be to withdraw from the action. Unfortunately, this isn't the healthiest response, especially if your presence is helpful. Think about following through with your social obligations while still leaving some time left over to follow your dreams. You can do it all now if you don't lose yourself to your fantasies along the way."
libra,2012-01-11,"Nearly everything in your life appears to be growing more complicated again, especially if your friends and associates make demands that raise your anger. You're not interested in being pushed around now, and if you're provoked you're likely to surprise others by stepping into combat mode. It makes the most sense for everyone to leave you alone today, unless they're ready to play by your rules."
scorpio,2012-01-11,"Your traditional ruling planet Mars is the major planetary player today as it surrealistically septiles magnetic Venus and motor-mouth Mercury. This erratic energy can transform a simple conversation into a major conflict or a passionate encounter. Fortunately, you may be more adept now at making peace, not war. However, you must remain vigilant because conscious effort on your part won't just happen on its own."
sagittarius,2012-01-11,"Your day is busy with noisy conversations, too many emails and a phone that won't leave you alone. You could even lose your temper if today's data overload becomes too much for you to manage. However, ego battles aren't useful and have no place in your life. Blaming someone else won't accomplish anything of value; stop talking about the past and shift your attention to the positive changes you want to make for the future."
capricorn,2012-01-11,"You might want to demonstrate your passion to a loved one today and see where the process carries you. However, you could miss a prime opportunity unless you stay true to your feelings and communicate them honestly. You really don't have to add flourishes to your words or need to embellish your actions. Just tell the truth in a straightforward manner to minimize the possibility of misunderstandings."
aquarius,2012-01-11,"Partnerships remain in the spotlight today as the needy Leo Moon's presence in your 7th House of Companions pulls you toward others. However, Mars is being stressed in your 8th House of Intimacy, prompting you to believe that a friend or lover is crowding your comfort zone. Be courageous and defend your personal space, but don't take things too far by attacking someone else. Even if you're a bit worried, you're probably not in as much danger as you might think."
pisces,2012-01-11,"You may seem more approachable to others today, which encourages them to trust you with their needs. If someone is trying to finish a project and looking for reinforcement, you're the go-to person now. Unfortunately, you're growing tired of having to hold down the fort. But avoiding your responsibilities isn't a real option, so start right away. The quicker you get rolling, the sooner your work will be complete."
aries,2012-01-12,"Be careful about what you decide on doing today because once you make up your mind, you might do nearly anything that's necessary in order to accomplish your goal. Your ruling planet Mars is graced by an energetic trine from the Sun, blessing you with all the right moves, along with enough stamina to follow through on whatever you start now. Set your intentions wisely and then proceed confidently toward your new destination."
taurus,2012-01-12,"It's not necessary to overstate your point of view or oversell your plan because your actions tell your story with great clarity today. Everything you do now seems to convey your thoughts, even if you're not trying to send any particular message. Instead of wasting words by talking about your ideas, take advantage of the power of the current moment and put all your effort into creatively progressing toward your vision of a better life."
gemini,2012-01-12,"You might feel unsure of yourself at first today, but once you overcome your own hesitation you will be glad that you took the initiative. Don't try to convince yourself that inaction is a better strategy than taking a calculated risk, because you may miss out on a very meaningful experience. Being practical is always a smart idea, but you could have regrets later if you restrain from expressing yourself now."
cancer,2012-01-12,"Sometimes you're so patient that it looks like you're just procrastinating. However, that's not a problem today because you can see the potential opportunity through a very practical lens. There's no need to wait for a better time to begin a new project. You may be even more successful than you can imagine if you don't immediately bite off more than you can chew. Reaching for the stars is fine as long as you take lots of very small steps instead of trying to accomplish the impossible in one giant leap."
leo,2012-01-12,"It's difficult for reality to measure up to your high expectations now as you take an exciting idea and build it into a concrete plan. Although you're on the right track, you might become so obsessed about what you want that you may end up dissatisfied no matter what happens. Rather than fixating on the outcome today, let go of your agenda by refocusing your mind on the present moment and not the future. Thankfully, your current flexibility increases your creativity along with your contentment."
virgo,2012-01-12,"It's quite natural to act on your desires today as long as you don't waste too much time thinking about them first. Although you are often an excellent planner, the current trine from the Sun to impulsive Mars in your hardworking sign indicates that you're better off making it up as you go along. Usually, you're wise to analyze all of your options before taking action, but logic only separates you from your feelings now. React directly from your gut without stopping to doubt yourself along the way."
libra,2012-01-12,"Your attempts to establish balance today are rewarded if you look at all the alternatives and weigh your options. But don't wait too long because the window of opportunity won't remain open forever. Magically, it seems as if time is suspended, giving you the capability to accomplish a lot quickly. But passivity lessens your chances to succeed. Fortunately, nearly anything started now is blessed with a better-than-average chance to get off to a propitious beginning."
scorpio,2012-01-12,"Even if it might seem like a good idea to keep your thoughts to yourself today, it won't likely happen. You want to involve others in your future plans now that the Sun trines superhero Mars in your 11th House of Social Networking. Fortunately, you don't have to hold back now. You are poised to make noticeable progress toward your goals without exerting too much effort."
sagittarius,2012-01-12,"Others see you as a go-to person to get things done today because you currently won't take no for an answer. You can untangle knotty problems and overcome seemingly impossible obstacles because you know how important it is to succeed now. Although your optimism might result in performances beyond your own expectations, you could take your enthusiasm too far. It's a gift to feel so confident, but your self-assuredness might backfire if you act too boldly. Thankfully, toning down your exuberance prevents alienating your allies while still allowing you to make your point."
capricorn,2012-01-12,"Although you're naturally a hard worker, you might not want to work hard today. However, your disinterest isn't because you're lazy. In fact, a trine from energetic Mars to the Sun in your sign increases your drive now. But your motivation isn't limited to your professional objectives; you are more attracted to finding personal meaning now than career success. Luckily, reducing the emphasis on your job won't have negative long-term effects. Seeking happiness through emotional and spiritual growth is always worth the effort."
aquarius,2012-01-12,"You may not want to waste time interacting with co-workers today. You have a lot to do and wish that everyone would leave you alone so you can get down to business. Unfortunately, you might not be able to avoid anyone who is already involved with you on a project. Instead of withdrawing, find a healthy balance between being alone and participating in a group. Don't hang on to your expectations needlessly; you'll be more successful if you can integrate working with others into your schedule."
pisces,2012-01-12,"You may believe that you cannot do anything wrong today and whatever you start now will turn out well. Unfortunately, there aren't any guarantees, but your self-confidence goes a long way toward your current success. Of course, hard work is necessary, but you have a high level of energy and sufficient reserves on which to draw from when needed. Don't hold back now; you'll feel at peace later, happy that you did as much as you could when you had the chance."
aries,2012-01-13,"You might think that you're being extremely realistic, yet you could fall in love with your own reflection today without realizing what happened. Thankfully, your closest friends won't confuse your dreams with the actual events of the day. Ultimately, the truth may not be as perfect as your imagination, but acknowledging reality for what it is should eliminate most of your potential problems before they can even manifest."
taurus,2012-01-13,"You may believe that you have done everything possible to assist others now as your ruling planet Venus conjuncts delusional Neptune in your 10th House of Publicity. However, you might have your own self-interests at heart, rather than being motivated by altruism. But don't waste energy questioning your motives. The reason you are doing something today isn't as important as whether or not you are kind in your interactions with others."
gemini,2012-01-13,"A relationship with a close friend or business partner is complicated now because you are probably seeing things through rose-colored glasses. Although your subjective view of reality is tinted by your unfulfilled desires, you can steer clear of trouble by tempering your unrealistic expectations with critical thinking. You needn't be afraid of dreaming as long as you stay aware of the difference between fact and fantasy."
cancer,2012-01-13,"Your standards for sharing your true feelings are set at a very high level now because you don't want to fool yourself into believing that everything is fine. However, it's challenging today to create a healthy balance between expressing the truth and bending it. Even if you're tempted to sidestep an unpleasant situation, you'll be happier in the long run if you take enough time to address unresolved issues before they grow out of control."
leo,2012-01-13,"You may run into an emotional wall today, and even though you cannot just keep pushing ahead, it's not sensible to retreat, either. Thankfully, you can imagine an ideal picture of the way you want things to be and your unwavering focus enables you to create a concrete plan to reach satisfaction. Sharing your ideas with co-workers can provide positive feedback, but ultimately the responsibility to make your dreams come true is yours alone. Don't wait for help; you can perform magic on your own."
virgo,2012-01-13,"You know what you want to do today and may become quite angry with anyone who stands in your way. But even without resistance, you might grow confused as you move closer toward your goals because you can't understand why everything is taking so long to finish. However, impatience is counterproductive because you have more time than you realize, anyway. It's more important now to keep your faith than it is to reach your destination."
libra,2012-01-13,"Your ruling planet Venus is touched by angelic Neptune today, dangling idealistic fantasies just beyond your reach. Thankfully, you are quite comfortable knowing there's more work to do before you can earn your just rewards. On another day you might grow frustrated, but now you see the plan in motion and you're happy to let it continue to unfold naturally. Find a working pace that you can sustain and stick with it."
scorpio,2012-01-13,"It's easy for you to look ahead today, unencumbered by your recent past. Intelligent Mercury joins potent Pluto, your key planet, bringing a powerful mental boost that enables you to maintain your focus on the present while also dreaming about your future. Use your creative imagination to set the right tone for the next phase of your life. Just don't reach ahead too far too fast, or your current stability will begin to feel more like a prison than the gift that it actually is."
sagittarius,2012-01-13,"You are able to bend reality today so you can imagine all the possibilities that are ahead. You have a clear shot at whatever you want now, assuming you can conjure up a clear image of your desires. Just remember that daydreaming isn't the only ingredient to your success now; perseverance is required, too. Don't give up on your highest hopes, or you'll never know what might have been possible."
capricorn,2012-01-13,"Others secretly admire your ability to be patient when working toward accomplishing your goals. Thankfully, the cosmos is on your side today as your key planet Saturn forms a harmonious trine with sensual Venus, enabling you to work hard for sweet rewards while delaying gratification if necessary. Keep your eye on the prize; it will be yours once you've earned it."
aquarius,2012-01-13,"Your ability to approach something you want with emotional detachment might seem odd to others, but this logical strategy enables you to maintain your sense of freedom. Today, however, you might swallow the bait if the object of your desire is attractive enough. Instead of wasting time and energy struggling to work your way free, avoid headaches by steering clear of the hook right from the start."
pisces,2012-01-13,"Delicious Venus hooks up with your key planet Neptune today, transforming simple facts into multicolored streams of cascading fantasies. The magic may happen so fast that you're instantly mesmerized by your lovely daydreams. There's no need to deny yourself the sweet pleasures; you can always make your way back to reality tomorrow."
aries,2012-01-14,"You aren't worried about finishing your work today or making progress toward your goals. Instead, you're more concerned with being with someone who makes you feel good about yourself. However, your expectations may be unrealistic now that lovely Venus is visiting your 12th House of Dreams until February 8, relaxing your sense of urgency to reach satisfaction. Although practicing patience improves your chances to find happiness, being lazy doesn't help."
taurus,2012-01-14,"You may need to balance what you want from others with what you're willing to offer in return. Group dynamics play an increasingly important role in your everyday life as your ruling planet Venus shifts into your 11th House of Friends. If you're involved in negotiations now, don't rush your response because you could have an overly optimistic view of the current situation. Allow a few days to see where your feelings go before saying yes to a proposition that's not really what you want."
gemini,2012-01-14,"Everything has been quite intense recently, but today you're finally willing to let your demands slide. If you have already talked about your needs, now you're more likely to be interested in what others want, too. Thankfully, the odds have tilted in your favor, so don't give in too quickly. Creating common ground is healthy as long as you don't compromise your values in the process."
cancer,2012-01-14,"You may have a new idea about how you can reach your goals, but it might be so unrealistic that you're setting yourself up for disappointment. Nevertheless, nearly anything seems possible today. Although you could feel optimistic all day, it helps to scale back your expectations before you discover your limits the hard way. Instead of relentlessly sticking to your old strategy, remain open to taking a new path; exercising flexibility can save you from having to face unnecessary discouragement in the days ahead."
leo,2012-01-14,"You might not be very comfortable with a current situation because you're feeling rather vulnerable today. Still, you realize how important it is to express what's in your heart. Just remember that you can share your thoughts without making anyone else wrong. As soon as you turn your needs into any kind of blame, you set up barriers to your happiness. Discuss your desires and your concerns with a trusted friend, but take full responsibility for your emotions."
virgo,2012-01-14,"Relationships seem to be more important now that affectionate Venus is traveling through your 7th House of Partners. Balancing your previous obligations with your current desire for love could muddy the waters between you and an acquaintance. Although your actions speak loudly, your words can also pack a punch. Explaining your intentions as clearly as you can opens the door to more meaningful interactions."
libra,2012-01-14,"Your ruling planet Venus is visiting your 6th House of Employment until Feb. 8, calming the rising tension at work. Even if you've been considering ways to break out of a job-related rut, it's easier now to hold on to the status quo for a while longer. Unfortunately, your current optimism probably won't resolve the underlying problems. This is no time for complacency, so make the necessary improvements in your daily routine while you still have the chance."
scorpio,2012-01-14,"Sometimes you are so dismayed at how others respond to your heartfelt disclosures that you decide to withhold your true feelings so you don't upset those you love. However, you can confidently share your feelings today without self-restraint because gracious Venus in your 5th House of Self-Expression helps to soften the hard edges of your message. Thankfully, speaking your truth with kindness now could actually get you exactly what you want."
sagittarius,2012-01-14,"An ongoing domestic disagreement may be temporarily set aside today as an amicable agreement is reached. However, the underlying tension could still be present and will need to be handled eventually. Placing your differences of opinion on hold doesn't mean that your current conversations have to be superficial. Establishing sufficient common ground allows you to make steady progress on other issues of concern that can be resolved at this time."
capricorn,2012-01-14,"You may want to take care of everyone's needs at work today and although your intentions are honorable, you might find yourself in over your head. Fortunately, others appreciate your positive attitude and won't judge you harshly now if you fall short of your goals. Nevertheless, you can prevent disappointment if you set healthy priorities so you don't spread yourself too thin. It's better to make a commitment only when you're sure that you will be able to deliver what you promise."
aquarius,2012-01-14,"It's difficult to keep other people's problems separate from your own because you're oversensitive to everyone's feelings today. You may think that you have enough energy to fix everything now, only to realize that your resources are limited. Instead of trying to be a superhero, just talk about what you see as honestly as you can. Speak from your heart; the right words have the power to heal in ways you can't imagine."
pisces,2012-01-14,"If you have been struggling in a relationship lately, charming Venus' shift into your sign today could indicate smoother waters ahead. You appear more congenial and are easier to get along with now, without any additional work on your part. However, with a bit of extra effort, you can parlay your current good fortune into something even better. But instead of just telling others what you want, go out of your way to bring happiness to those you love. Your generosity will be paid back to you many times over."
aries,2012-01-15,"It's hard to know what people really want from you because they seem to follow your lead now that the diplomatic Libra Moon is in your 7th House of Partners. You try to please others today, but even your best intentions may not be good enough if your behavior seems abrasive. Keep in mind that it's smarter to err on the side of caution than to act in an overly aggressive manner. Nevertheless, you can always share your thoughts tomorrow when everyone is feeling less sensitive."
taurus,2012-01-15,"Managing relationships at work today may be more complicated than you expect. Although you might be able to see what's happening, finding your way through explosive emotional landmines could be tricky business. Don't waste your energy trying to carry out a plan that isn't working; instead, respond to current situations as they develop. You can always return to your unfinished responsibilities tomorrow when the coast is clear."
gemini,2012-01-15,"Your motives might not be as altruistic as they seem, even if you go out of your way to put others at ease now. However, there isn't anything wrong with your desire to be accepted by someone you like, especially since you're able to give more fully of yourself when you feel appreciated. Keep in mind that the best kind of love is offered without keeping score of what you receive in return."
cancer,2012-01-15,"Even if you think that everything's unfolding naturally today, someone close to you may still believe that you're too controlling. But your current manipulative behavior is probably motivated by your fear about someone taking advantage of you. However, there is some truth to both sides; if you can become comfortable with any outcome to the current situation, the need for power struggles will dissipate and maybe even vanish."
leo,2012-01-15,"You may be obsessing about what you're going to do today, but too much planning is likely a waste of time. You could read a situation incorrectly and make a faulty assumption by using wrong data. Or, perhaps, the circumstances might change without warning, turning your entire schedule upside down. It doesn't matter whether or not you were ever really in charge; unresolved tensions improve when you finally let go of control."
virgo,2012-01-15,There's no need to overreact if someone makes unreasonable demands of you today. Your best overall strategy is to push back with a firm but gentle touch. Establishing boundaries that you can maintain requires extra clear communication now. Misunderstandings might easily creep into the picture if you respond impulsively without considering the feelings of others first.
libra,2012-01-15,"It might feel as if others aren't being very supportive today, but your worries could be completely unfounded. You may have too much on your mind and too many domestic responsibilities weighing heavily on your shoulders. Just because you're under serious pressure to be productive, don't expect anyone to rush to your rescue now. In the meantime, sticking to your initial plan will actually help you handle your personal obligations on your own."
scorpio,2012-01-15,"Your energy may feel out of balance today, making you rather frazzled if you can't establish a steady work pace. Something has slipped just slightly out of alignment and it could take a conscious attitude adjustment to snap your brain back into place. Take a break from what you're doing; anything that readjusts your focus should also help you regain your natural rhythm."
sagittarius,2012-01-15,"Saving your pennies isn't the most exciting activity you can think of now, but you wouldn't have to pay attention to it today if you took care of your personal business yesterday. You might rather dream about the unrealized potential and make long-term plans, but an immediate cash flow problem demands that you handle the situation right away. Once things are under control, make sure to set aside time to visualize your future."
capricorn,2012-01-15,"It's hard to decide whether you should push ahead more forcefully now or if it's smarter to temporarily retreat. Frustration sets in today if you wish that you took the other course of action. But what you do next might not matter so much; rest assured there isn't any right or wrong way to go from here. Either way, your path may be temporarily obscured. Your wisest strategy is to bide your time until you receive a clear sign that tells you which direction to take."
aquarius,2012-01-15,"Your visions of the future continue to be quite active now. Your dreams contain messages, whether you remember them when you wake up, or they return as fragmented images throughout the day. However, you would be wise to proceed with caution because your fantasies seem so real today that they can take you on a wild goose chase. Don't just assume that you have enough information to discern the difference between fact and fancy; maintain a wait-and-see attitude until your clarity returns."
pisces,2012-01-15,"You are even more intuitive now than usual, making you feel as if you're living your life within a dream. However, something weird happens that wakes you up today, reminding you to be more practical. You may not like having to make such a drastic transition, but applying your common sense in the present moment could save you from disappointment later on."
aries,2012-01-16,"The distinction between friendship and courtship might be a subtle one now. Even if you're not seeking more from a relationship, you still can benefit from being aware of your emotions. However, you don't need to do anything special in order to attain love. Your current lesson is learned by fully experiencing the desires of your heart without trying to make anyone else responsible for your happiness."
taurus,2012-01-16,"You might choose to withdraw from an interaction with a friend because it's grown too intense and you believe that it isn't leading in a positive direction. However, your need to set boundaries doesn't indicate that the relationship is a bad one; it just clarifies a limitation that must be acknowledged. Navigating carefully around emotional discomfort now could be enough to put things back on a healthier track."
gemini,2012-01-16,"You may have a very detailed notion of exactly what you want to do today, yet lingering self-doubt could prevent you from explaining your plans to anyone else. You might be afraid that your words won't express what you mean. Instead of just running off at the mouth, think through what you want to say before stating your intentions. But don't be too rigid; once you share your thoughts, let the conversation flow back and forth without worrying about the outcome."
cancer,2012-01-16,"You might think that you should apologize and retreat now because you recently overstepped your bounds. However, you could feel even more insecure after saying that you are sorry. Fortunately, you probably didn't act out of line as much as you believe, so it might not be necessary to say anything about it at all. Nevertheless, sharing your vulnerability is a constructive way to increase the emotional bond with someone you like."
leo,2012-01-16,"You might feel agitated today if a friend or co-worker misunderstands you. Your frustration may already be obvious because of a recent disagreement between the two of you, but the apparent gulf seems worse than it actually is. Recalling another time that you recently resolved a problem by talking about your feelings could help the situation now. Take a chance and express what's on your mind. You will never know what happens unless you try."
virgo,2012-01-16,"You might not think that you deserve extra recognition for your efforts, but ironically you feel hurt today if you're not acknowledged. You believe that you've been working very hard, so it's not too much of a stretch to fantasize about getting a raise or at least a pat on the back. However, it's counterproductive to dwell on it, so process any disappointment you're experiencing now and get back to the tasks at hand."
libra,2012-01-16,"Your ruling planet Venus meets up with the limitations of healer Chiron today, placing you directly in touch with all the reasons why you can't have everything you want. However, some of the restraints are probably self-imposed and arise from your fears of being vulnerable when you're in love. Go ahead and share your feelings, but don't push your luck too far."
scorpio,2012-01-16,"You can sometimes be attracted to the shadowy side of Love Street because you understand that sweet delights are possible once you work through the darker feelings that stand in the way. However, you might feel stuck today, unable to push through old negative habitual patterns. Don't be too concerned; the clouds will clear soon enough, leaving you more optimistic before you even realize what happened."
sagittarius,2012-01-16,"You're inclined to lightheartedly gloss over a significant relationship issue that arises today. You might believe that concentrating on a problem could actually make it worse. Unfortunately, avoiding your feelings now is more damaging to a relationship than directly facing the truth, even if it makes you uncomfortable. Be brave; slow down so you can dig into the juiciest material. If you do your emotional processing right away, you should feel a lot better tomorrow."
capricorn,2012-01-16,"Thankfully, today's energy may not be so emotionally intense, but it's still going to require time for everything to return to normal. At least, you might start to feel the anticipation of positive change coming around the corner. Don't wait to see what will happen next; instead, make a concrete plan for exactly what you want to achieve in the future and then get busy."
aquarius,2012-01-16,"Your life may have a surreal quality to it now, enabling you to manifest your fantasies as reality or, if nothing else, lose yourself in them. But making illusions practical can be tricky because your best intentions run into your own fears of success. It's a good start to ask for exactly what you want, but being in a receptive frame of mind when it arrives is actually just as important."
pisces,2012-01-16,"Today's forgiving Venus-Chiron conjunction in your sign offers you the ability to detach from an intense emotional situation. Thankfully, your current objectivity comes to your rescue, giving you the ability to weigh your personal desires against the needs of your wider social group. You can bring your innocence into a stressful setting, which is disarming to everyone involved. Just don't try to accomplish miracles; a little bit of progress will go a long way."
aries,2012-01-17,"You might believe that someone is coercing you to become more involved in the very same emotional drama that you're trying to avoid. But your feelings are already aroused and it's tough to shut them off after they have been stirred. You may not be able to prevent an interaction from turning stormy today, but, thankfully, everyone will feel better once the whole story is out in the open."
taurus,2012-01-17,"You naturally prefer to keep things simple, but someone may be pushing you to consider alternatives now that could ultimately complicate your life. Ironically, your stubbornness won't likely bring the desired results while requiring you to handle even more unresolved emotions. This is no time to be obstinate by adhering to your principles. Being extra flexible isn't easy, but it should help everyone get through an awkward moment."
gemini,2012-01-17,"You have a specific agenda today and you don't want to be distracted by anything that doesn't directly help you progress toward your goals. Someone might misinterpret your narrow focus as a personal rejection, but you aren't interested in participating in a melodrama of office politics. Concentrate on your objectives; once you have accomplished enough work for one day, gently inform others that you're ready for a bit of fun and relaxation."
cancer,2012-01-17,"You aren't all that easy to get along with now, but you might be preoccupied with making an important decision. Your friends and family may be insistent on helping you, but you could see these dynamics as a smooth way for them to exert their control over your personal life. There's no need to push away a trustworthy ally now if you sincerely express your concerns while being crystal clear about your boundaries."
leo,2012-01-17,"You have very strong feelings about an old friend or family member, yet you might not be able to share your thoughts now. You're tired of being the one that everyone relies on yet again, but today isn't the right time to let anyone down. Keeping your emotions out of the picture is probably a good idea as long as you don't do it halfway. Process any lingering negativity quickly because your resentment could stand in the way of the love you have to offer."
virgo,2012-01-17,"You believe that you can accomplish a lot more than you actually do today, but it's useless to waste energy on self-judgment. You could definitely use some relaxation, so build some creative playtime into your busy schedule now, no matter what else is cooking. Ultimately, you will be more productive if you make time in your day to do something you really enjoy."
libra,2012-01-17,"You might have to take an unpopular stance today because remaining true to your core values is more important than acquiescing to someone else's decision. It may be very challenging to hold your position, especially if your friends and family are trying to convince you that you are wrong. Ultimately, it's not about what anyone else wants; what counts the most is maintaining your integrity, even if it temporarily alienates you from others."
scorpio,2012-01-17,"Your friends may pretend that a difficult issue has been resolved because they know that you're in a serious mood today and that you have little time for any unnecessary drama. But the Moon's current visit to your insightful sign indicates that you know immediately when anyone is holding out on you. However, there's enough room to misinterpret someone's motives now, so lighten up and give others the benefit of the doubt."
sagittarius,2012-01-17,"You might think that it's better to stay quiet now if you don't have something positive to say. However, your current silence communicates more than you realize because others can't help but notice that you're withholding your feelings. There's no need to pretend that everything is okay just so you can avoid making an emotional scene. Instead, be as honest as you can and just tell the truth as you see it."
capricorn,2012-01-17,"Others look up to you, especially on a day like this when you can set an example by stepping up to a leadership role. However, it's not wise to complicate the situation by telling anyone else what to do; instead, jump in without holding on to an agenda of your own. The most effective thing you can do is show up with a positive attitude today. It's more important to exhibit your integrity instead of pretending that you have all of the answers."
aquarius,2012-01-17,"Everyone seems to be demanding a lot from you today, and you might think that they are being unreasonable. Fortunately, you're not responsible to live up to anyone's expectations except your own. Don't spread yourself too thin; set sensible goals early in the day and then follow up by doing the best you can. Just remember to keep your doubts to yourself or you could just feed into the negativity that isn't even yours to begin with."
pisces,2012-01-17,"It's surprising how easily you can shift today from unrealistic goals to very pragmatic ones. Some of your dreams are fading, leaving you with a realistic sense of what you can actually accomplish. Don't waste your energy trying to conform to someone else's grand plan. Trust your own vision; it's really the one that matters most now."
aries,2012-01-18,"You might feel as if it's too easy for you to be emotionally hooked to someone else's agenda today. An unnecessary melodrama could make it tough to get your chores done at first, but it doesn't take long to acknowledge that things cannot continue as is. Fortunately, you are sensible enough now to change your attitude which can place control of your day back into your hands. Think about what you want to accomplish and then reach for your goals with confidence."
taurus,2012-01-18,"Nothing will be gained if you allow yourself to be dragged into a disagreement because conflict won't likely lead to a positive outcome today. Nevertheless, there's no reason to be afraid of standing up for your beliefs. Although you may have already formed your opinions, it's still smart to maintain a low-key profile for a while longer. You can say what's on your mind later without running the risk of encountering opposition."
gemini,2012-01-18,"You may feel invisible today -- as if others are ignoring you -- but trying harder to attract the attention you desire is a waste of energy. It's wiser to let events unfold naturally because your efforts will be taken more seriously later in the day. Although you don't have to do anything special to get noticed, it's important to stay flexible in your approach to work. If you have a cheerful attitude, your interactions with friends and co-workers should continue to improve."
cancer,2012-01-18,"You may wish that you could avoid tackling a challenging issue today, especially if you and a loved one have expressed differing opinions on the subject. But even if you can hide your feelings, you won't be able to sidestep reality all day. Still, it's best to let your emotions settle before you jump into a conversation about them. Waiting a while ensures that you're able to communicate your position succinctly without making things worse."
leo,2012-01-18,"Although your day may start off slowly, the action picks up later, allowing you to find enjoyment while still being productive. If you have been procrastinating lately, now it's time to begin a creative project at work or around the house. But don't be overly concerned about finishing what you start; just take the first steps and then set a manageable pace for the rest of the job."
virgo,2012-01-18,"It's challenging to stay on track today because there are so many exciting possibilities ahead. However, you could scare yourself with your own enthusiasm and the vast array of choices, prompting you to do nothing for fear of failure. It's true that the big picture may be overwhelming if you can't break it down into manageable tasks. Thankfully, everything becomes easier if you remember to scale back your plans right from the start."
libra,2012-01-18,"You won't be able to avoid your domestic responsibilities today, especially if you made promises that now need to be kept. But your commitment to following through with your obligations doesn't have to prevent you from having fun, too. Luckily, you can turn the most mundane tasks into fascinating diversions. Give yourself permission to let your creativity shine, even while attending to routine chores."
scorpio,2012-01-18,"Your financial condition may be improving now, but this shouldn't be an excuse to spend money before it's in the bank. You still have a significant amount of work to do before you reap the tangible rewards you seek, so it's wise to wait and count your chickens only after they hatch. It's easy to be tempted by good news before it arrives, but remember that there aren't any quick shortcuts to achieving success."
sagittarius,2012-01-18,"The Moon's return to your fiery sign today is bound to raise your spirits, and you can feel the cosmic boost of energy that increases your sense of well-being. Luckily, your confidence grows, enhancing your ability to handle most difficult situations. Nevertheless, don't let yourself become complacent because you still must be diligent in order to overcome the challenges ahead."
capricorn,2012-01-18,"You're a study in paradox today because your thoughts can be wildly optimistic and extremely pessimistic at the same time. Normally, these opposing attitudes would cancel out each other, leaving you somewhere in the middle. But now you're able to hold on to an overall positive perspective, even if you're less confident about specific aspects of your life. Ultimately, it's your more serious side that motivates you to create change. Putting in the hard work is still necessary if you want to accomplish your goals."
aquarius,2012-01-18,"The uplifting Sagittarius Moon enters your 11th House of Groups today, combining your current spiritual approach to life with your relationships with like-minded individuals. You may grow more attracted to some form of organized worship or, perhaps, you're motivated to become more involved with a community or political cause. No matter how this social energy plays out for you, it's time to enjoy participating in something that's larger than your individual story."
pisces,2012-01-18,It's crucial to maintain a healthy balance between your professional and personal worlds by honoring your friends and family now that the Sagittarius Moon is visiting your 10th House of Public Responsibility. But your way of nurturing those you love isn't just about smothering them with affection or compassion. A simple act of unconditional support can be enough to encourage them to shine.
aries,2012-01-19,"Although you wish that your job duties weren't weighing you down today, there's no way to escape from fulfilling your obligations. Although the optimistic Sagittarius Moon encourages you to dream big, you could appear irresponsible to others unless you focus on what needs to be accomplished now. Don't push your luck. You could get all you want and more if you eliminate the excess noise and take care of business."
taurus,2012-01-19,"Although you may be distracted with a grandiose idea about your future, it's crucial to rein in any unrealistic fantasies and be as practical as you can be today. It's tempting to follow your adrenaline rush and grab an opportunity that appears to offer big rewards in return. But things look better than they actually are, so it's sensible to set aside your hopes for immediate gratification and work toward improving your stability in the present moment. A carefully made choice now will ensure a happier outcome later."
gemini,2012-01-19,"You aren't ready to buckle down and do what's expected of you today, yet it isn't an ideal time to reveal your true feelings by rebelling against authority. You might try to avoid an unpleasant activity now, but you'll probably create unnecessary problems if you run out on your obligations. Even if others tempt you with an intriguing invitation, save the fun and games for another day and hold up your end of the bargain, instead."
cancer,2012-01-19,"You might try to resist working with someone today, but you could be coerced out of your safety zone no matter what kind of defensive tactics you employ. Instead of jumping through hoops to set up unnecessary boundaries, you would be wiser to soften your protective posture and be open to what your friends and family have to tell you. It's more important to stay honest now than to deny your emotions just because they make you feel insecure."
leo,2012-01-19,"Your generosity is appreciated by those who have contact with you today because your positive attitude can be quite contagious. However, there may be an emotionally charged agenda that could create disagreement amongst friends and co-workers. Instead of declaring your position and trying to defend it, avoid being too attached to any one outcome. Make a choice if you must, but be willing to meet others halfway."
virgo,2012-01-19,You may have a very productive day in store as long as you can steer clear of conflicts with authorities. You could inadvertently provoke a power struggle by saying or doing something wrong. There's no need to prove your efficiency or your competence today; just concentrate on balancing your work with a little bit of fun. You should be able to minimize conflict now if you remain sincere in your intentions and follow through to the best of your abilities.
libra,2012-01-19,"You might have assumed that you were calling the shots today, but it turns out that you're not in complete control. There may be a hidden person who exercises his or her authority, yet it's difficult to uncover the whole story about who is in charge. Instead of fighting back, it's smarter now to go with the flow while maintaining your integrity the best you can. Be a careful observer of what's happening, but don't attempt to change the power dynamics just yet."
scorpio,2012-01-19,"You thought you could do everything that is expected of you today, but your confidence may begin to wane. Fortunately, you'll come through with the goods because you're motivated by the fact that everyone's counting on you. If necessary, you'll push your limits so you can surpass your current goals. Don't be afraid to demonstrate exactly what you can do. However, nothing will be gained by judging anyone else too harshly just because you're getting so much accomplished now."
sagittarius,2012-01-19,"Maintaining self-esteem is critical today because a harsh Sun-Saturn square can cripple you with self-doubt. Fortunately, the exuberant Sagittarius Moon offers some balance if you're willing to cut back on superfluous activities. You're better off now if there are fewer tasks on your to-do list so you have more time for each item. You can write your own success story by creating a realistic agenda for yourself."
capricorn,2012-01-19,"You could have a number of impulsive moments today when you are eager to reach for something or someone attractive. However, it's not wise to let your desire for instant gratification hijack your day. Your key planet Saturn brings an extra load of responsibility now as it squares the Sun. Although you want to do the right thing, you're also keeping your eyes peeled for a quick escape. Concentrating on your commitment to excellence calms your current wanderlust and keeps you on track all day."
aquarius,2012-01-19,"You would rather downplay your serious attitude today because you want to be considered a part of the group. Nevertheless, you're quite deliberate in your approach to relationships, even if you seem to be much more easygoing than you actually are now. Your leadership skills can shine as long as you take other people's opinions into account."
pisces,2012-01-19,"You're eager to participate in group activities while three planets are still visiting your 11th House of Friends. You may seek stability from your interactions with others, but you also need to express your own beliefs. Unfortunately, problems arise when you're unwilling to go along with everyone else. Thankfully, you can minimize conflicts by downplaying your personal desires today. For now, concentrate on the spirit of the entire community rather than your individual desires."
aries,2012-01-20,"Starting a new project can be quite exciting today because you're eager to see what the future brings. Your mind is buzzing with lots of ideas, but you're not about to jump into an unstable situation just for the thrill of it. You want to know that whatever you do now will produce tangible results. Take your time and make sure that you're working toward sensible goals before you set out in a new direction."
taurus,2012-01-20,"You may feel as if you've rounded a corner and are ready to apply what you know to get ahead at work. But even the most brilliant plan will fail now unless you can ground it by taking a practical approach. Leaning on friends and associates is tempting, but will only take you so far. Even if you receive  support, you'll be disappointed if you expect too much from others. The best way to ensure your success is by developing as much self-sufficiency as you can."
gemini,2012-01-20,"Your energy may be a bit scattered today if you attempt to accomplish too much all at once. You want to say yes to every good idea you hear, but it's best to limit your activities. Don't trust your initial impulse because you'll likely underestimate the resources and time needed to complete a task. Just do the best you can now without making promises that you can't keep."
cancer,2012-01-20,"It's tempting to dream your way to success because today's vision can turn into tomorrow's reality. However, it's not enough to play out a fantasy in your mind and just assume it will happen as imagined. One way to take control is to fill in your mental pictures with as much detail as possible. Ultimately, adding specific information to your ideas makes it easier to transform your thoughts into reality. Planning is a logical first step as long as it's followed by hard work and determination."
leo,2012-01-20,You might feel as if your life is on a collision course with your dreams once you realize where you're going today. But learning the truth is just the first step in an ongoing process that can help you break through stuck energy in a relationship. Letting go of old habits can free you from responsibilities you no longer need to carry. It's time to exercise your individuality and set yourself back on a realistic path that leads to your true goals.
virgo,2012-01-20,"Your natural affinity for efficiency can separate you from the pack because you want to get things exactly right. However, your penchant for perfection could stand in the way of your happiness today, especially if you're short on time. Sometimes it's wiser to be expedient rather than getting stuck struggling with a detail. You'll feel much better now if you finish the job than if you miss an important deadline."
libra,2012-01-20,"You believe that your future holds great promise, and you're willing to wait a little bit longer if you think your patience will help you get what you want. Your desires are strong now that your key planet Venus connects with passionate Pluto. Fortunately, it's easier for you to be optimistic because you truly feel that hard-earned rewards are right around the corner. Your upbeat attitude, in turn, has a direct positive impact on your chances for success."
scorpio,2012-01-20,"Even if you've put a lot of energy into your career, it's time to retreat and take some time for yourself. The Sun's shift into your 4th House of Home and Family motivates you to de-emphasize professional pressures for a while so you can attend to more personal goals. Fortunately, slipping away from the office early won't make you less productive. Ultimately, your newfound joy of life enables you to finish your work quicker than before."
sagittarius,2012-01-20,"You are conflicted about what to do today. You know that you should follow through on your commitments and fulfill your job-related obligations. But you're tired of having to be the one who rides to the rescue and bails out everyone at the last moment. You're tempted to just let things fall apart. However, abandoning your responsibilities now isn't a smart idea. Give it your best shot and then call it a day without taking responsibility for everyone else."
capricorn,2012-01-20,"It's unusually challenging today for you to make an appointment and then show up for it. But irresponsibility doesn't play into your story. Instead, you might want to avoid making commitments for a specific time because you believe that it's important to remain flexible. Unfortunately, your compulsive desire to have an open schedule may be counterproductive. Ultimately, filling in your calendar gives your day the structure you need to achieve your goals."
aquarius,2012-01-20,"The Sun's entry into your intellectual sign today may have you nervously sitting on the edge of your chair. You have been patient long enough and now you're ready to make your move. But the road ahead is uncharted, which might increase your anxiety. Thankfully, you can minimize the negative effects of your uncertainty by acknowledging that the pressure comes from within. Take extra time to determine your most intelligent course of action before you begin the next phase of your journey."
pisces,2012-01-20,"You might not want everyone to know exactly what you are planning now, so you should be cautious about what you say. But it's not only about the words you speak because others may still be able to read your intentions through your actions. Thankfully, you're able to contain your energy by monitoring your thoughts and directing them into safe spaces. There's no hurry; you will know when it's the best time to bring others into your confidence."
aries,2012-01-21,"Although your impatience is undeniable today, knowing what you want doesn't ensure your immediate success. You don't want to suppress your impulsive behavior now, but a foolish move could make a difficult situation even more problematic. Make it easier on everyone by stopping for a moment to think about what you're about to do before it's too late."
taurus,2012-01-21,"Talking about going on an adventure might seem straightforward enough, but you could inadvertently stir up trouble by saying too much too soon. Unexpected information may come to your attention, even if you're just dreaming about a vacation to an exotic destination or thinking about a simple afternoon excursion. There's no need to be overly concerned if you cannot integrate what you learn today. Give it time; the new data will eventually fit into place if you don't try to force it."
gemini,2012-01-21,"You're sending mixed messages because of the increased emotional component of your words today. Your feelings are charged with heightened intensity as your enthusiasm grows out of control, but the self-controlled Capricorn Moon helps you keep things in perspective. Consider the consequences of anything you begin now, but don't be too surprised if your current efforts lead you somewhere different from where you expect."
cancer,2012-01-21,"Your encounters with people today can result in a surprising shift of priorities. You might stubbornly resist cutting back on your plans because you don't like letting anyone down. But being flexible about how your day unfolds is a smart strategy now, especially if you have spread your energy too thin. Ultimately, you will have an easier time if you pay attention to your own limits rather than only what others want."
leo,2012-01-21,"You're jumping with anticipation over exciting new opportunities coming your way. You want to live life to the fullest, but might feel stressed because you also have chores that must be completed. Fortunately, you won't need to choose one over the other now; you should be able to meet your obligations while still having sufficient time left for fun. The key to happiness today is remembering to maintain balance in all that you do."
virgo,2012-01-21,"Your friends might think that they understand what you are going through now, but they may not hear exactly what you say. Although you present the situation in a positive light, you don't want to exaggerate, but others believe that you're not telling the whole story. Be careful; the more you try to hide your enthusiasm today, the less you are trusted. Just act naturally; interpersonal communication will improve if you stop trying to maintain control over too many details."
libra,2012-01-21,"Although you may decide to take it easy and stay out of trouble today, this could be trickier than it seems because you won't be able to suppress your true desires for long. If you have an urge to express yourself, you're better off going for it before something else happens and distracts you from your current plan. Preemptively releasing tension is a better strategy than waiting until frustration warps your good judgment."
scorpio,2012-01-21,"You may be trying to add more fun to your life, especially if you have been extremely conscientious about meeting professional expectations recently. Now it's time to focus your attention on more playful pursuits, especially sharing pleasurable activities with friends. Although you can't escape your basic responsibilities, you should be able to slip away for a while so you can relax without anyone giving you any grief."
sagittarius,2012-01-21,"Although you usually take the extra steps to make sure you're being honest, your unrestrained optimism could lead you to misrepresent the facts today. You might come across more cavalier than you actually feel. Even if you want to impress others with your inspirational attitude and the power of your positive thoughts, remember that you don't have to sugarcoat reality. Do what you do best; just tell the truth and let everyone respond accordingly."
capricorn,2012-01-21,"Your plans may fall apart today if you try to pack too much into your day. You know better, but you just cannot help yourself because there are so many cool things to do and you don't want to let any opportunities pass by without giving them a chance. However, you could have so many choices that you can't decide what to do next. Your fear of the unknown could get in the way of the best possible outcome. If you remain open to surprises, the winds of fate will blow good news your way."
aquarius,2012-01-21,"You might feel as if one phase has ended now and a new one is beginning; however, you don't yet have a clear path to take next. Instead of grabbing the first opportunity that comes along, try looking at your life from a wider perspective. Forget about the details for now; you can fill them in later. Instead, visualize your long-term goals based upon your idealistic view of the future."
pisces,2012-01-21,"Ironically, the stress you feel today is likely caused by too much good news rather than a disappointment. You might not trust what's happening, afraid to believe that something important is finally going your way. There is no time for self-doubt or fear. Dynamic change is in the air, freeing you to follow your bliss. As long as you don't push the limits too far now, you could notice improvements right away."
aries,2012-01-22,"Although this may be your day off, your mind is focused on your ambitions anyhow. You want to make sure that your professional or community contributions will be acknowledged. But don't get your hopes up too much; even if you're working toward specific goals, it could still require time for your efforts to be noticed. Being in a hurry might actually slow you down in the long run."
taurus,2012-01-22,"You seem to be moving at a snail's pace today, yet you should be able to reach your goals if you stick to your plan. However, it's challenging to leave good enough alone because of your enthusiasm. Don't expand your reach now; just do a good job with whatever is already on your plate. Even if everything looks very promising, it's not wise to let anything distract you from your current blueprint for success."
gemini,2012-01-22,"It's wise to go over the details of an idea that you have been kicking around. Take extra time before trying to finalize a decision about an upcoming trip. Unexpressed feelings can complicate interpersonal dynamics, so it's helpful now to check in with your partner about an unresolved emotional issue. Somehow, things are coming to a turning point over the next couple of days and it's crucial for you to be ready for whatever happens."
cancer,2012-01-22,"You may not be able to trust your own logic now, so be prepared to use your intuition to help navigate through a difficult relationship dynamic. There's no need to lose yourself in analyzing what went wrong or what you might do next. Instead, just let your emotions speak to you and then carefully share them with a trusted friend. You don't have all the answers now. Express what's in your heart with integrity and let the interaction evolve from there."
leo,2012-01-22,Your physical and mental health is inseparably intertwined and you must pay attention to both if you want to feel better. Make improvements to your diet or exercise program while also reducing your stress on the job if you want to be happy. But it's unnecessary to do too much all at once. Taking small steps is ultimately more effective than rushing ahead with a giant leap.
virgo,2012-01-22,"You may be feeling frustrated because you're too busy to relax, which can temporarily take the fun out of your life. Even if you are trying to make time for small pleasures, it can be hard to have fun. Don't lose faith; things are going to loosen up very soon. In the meantime, put your ducks in a row so you are ready to take off when given clearance."
libra,2012-01-22,"A family matter may take longer to resolve than you prefer, but an extra effort could be exactly what's needed today to nudge the situation further along. However, you may be stuck with a perspective that isn't working for you anymore. Reconsidering your position is a smart idea because changing your mind can have a positive impact on others, enabling you to move things along again."
scorpio,2012-01-22,"You aren't eager to put in the work necessary to make changes in your immediate environment. However, whatever you have been resisting should begin to be less of a problem. You're standing right on the edge of a major energetic shift that will affect your daily routine for the next few years. Don't worry if it takes a while to manifest. Thankfully, your waiting time is nearly over."
sagittarius,2012-01-22,"You could limit yourself financially without even realizing what you're doing. Your income is linked to how you value -- or belittle -- yourself. You want everyone to see you as a confident person with high self-esteem, but you could have insecurities that get in the way. There's no need to fix everything right away; it's more important to start recognizing how much you bring to your career. Believe in yourself and others will have more faith in you, too."
capricorn,2012-01-22,"You might be experiencing panic if you don't know how you can meet your current deadlines. You want to set a good example for others today, but hiding your anxiety may not be your smartest strategy. Instead of needlessly worrying, set new priorities and focus your attention on what you need to first. Giving it your best now isn't enough. You'll need to keep it up for a few days to see the fruits of your current labor."
aquarius,2012-01-22,"You are like a horse at the starting gate, champing at the bit because you want to start the race. But you're not quite finished with an old project, so barging ahead could be a big mistake. You don't need to start running yet; instead, concentrate on tying up loose ends. Don't bother trying to finalize your long-term plans yet. Just let the future arrive at its own pace."
pisces,2012-01-22,"If you are being coerced to do something that doesn't feel right, you might have to stand up against the pressures you're feeling. Someone may expect you to let go of your own plan to support one you don't really believe in. If you don't have the same vision as others, be clear and let them know. Don't waste time spinning your wheels for someone else unless you're sure that you're both driving in the same direction."
aries,2012-01-23,"You might feel as if your feet are stuck in quicksand as your key planet Mars stops in its tracks today. However, you're more patient than usual and are willing to talk about your plans instead of doing anything about them. Meanwhile, the social Aquarius New Moon enlivens your 11th House of Friends, so you could have fun even if you're not feeling very productive. Keep in mind that your current self-restraint works in your favor as long as you don't overpower everyone with your aggressive approach."
taurus,2012-01-23,"Today's Aquarius New Moon strengthens your 10th House of Public Responsibility, encouraging you to meet your obligations without sacrificing your freedom. Although you are determined to achieve success on your own terms, you're not prepared to jeopardize your job security. Thankfully, you can act independently while also playing it safe. Taking a calculated risk doesn't mean you need to break out of familiar routines."
gemini,2012-01-23,"Your mind is buzzing with unconventional thoughts as the ingenious Aquarius New Moon activates your 9th House of Philosophy. Although your ideas may be impractical, you can still communicate them with such persistence that others will sit up and listen. Fortunately, your key planet Mercury enables you to share a radical plan today without stirring up too much resistance. But don't try to prove that you're right; instead, focus on what you can learn from the discussion and not on the destination."
cancer,2012-01-23,"The intellectual intensity of the Aquarius New Moon may not be apparent at first, but you might have to deal with someone who tries to avoid a deep emotional connection. However, an assertive Mercury-Mars trine makes you less interested in compromising now. You're serious about being heard and won't let a conversation end until you believe that your message is understood. Don't worry about being too serious today; it's more important to maintain your integrity than to live up to someone else's expectations."
leo,2012-01-23,"Today's Aquarius New Moon emphasizes your 7th House of Companions, shining the spotlight on a current relationship. It's easy to make heartfelt promises now because your intentions are pure, but it's difficult to follow through with effective action. Don't let unexpected delays frustrate you; change will come but there's no need to hurry the process. In the meantime, start visualizing your ideal partnership because your imagination is where the future begins."
virgo,2012-01-23,"Today's Aquarius New Moon in your 6th House of Work is a mixed blessing. You want to meet your current obligations without doing everything the same old way. There's nothing wrong with trying a new approach as long as you think it through first. Thankfully, your key planet Mercury aligns with action-hero Mars, enabling you to dazzle others with your brilliance. Just don't get so carried away with a new idea that you forget about a reliable method that's already proven successful in the past."
libra,2012-01-23,"The Aquarius New Moon activates a creative cycle today as she highlights your 5th House of Self-Expression. But you may need to overcome your own inertia if you want to show the world your artistic abilities. You could meet some tough resistance now, but your persistence enables you to win support from those who can help you the most. Although it may take longer than you think to complete what you start, this is your best chance to push for what you want."
scorpio,2012-01-23,"Today's conceptual Aquarius New Moon lands in your 4th House of Foundations, focusing your needs on simple fundamentals. Although you're interested in getting ahead, you want to pay extra attention to your family and personal life now. Even if you must continue fulfilling your social and career obligations, releasing some of your outside attachments allows you to have time to give your loved ones what they deserve. Setting priorities isn't always easy, but the process helps you decide what's most important."
sagittarius,2012-01-23,"Today may be busier than usual, overflowing with a variety of things to do and people to see -- setting the pace for the weeks ahead. The Aquarius New Moon lands in your 3rd House of Immediate Environment, distracting you with one thing after another. However, be smart and complete as many unfinished projects as you can now. This is your chance to free up as much time as possible so you're ready for the next big thing that comes along."
capricorn,2012-01-23,You have a strong desire to solidify your personal finances as today's Aquarius New Moon emphasizes your 2nd House of Money. This is an excellent time to initiate new fiscal practices that strengthen your credibility. Take advantage of messenger Mercury in your pragmatic sign by meeting with a professional who can help you create a useful budget. Minimize future problems by assuming full responsibility for your actions now.
aquarius,2012-01-23,"The New Moon falls in your sign today, allowing you to set your intentions quickly and move in a new direction. Although you can clarify your needs, sudden mood swings are conflicting with your normal intellectual approach. Your dreams seem so real now that you're tempted to treat them as the truth. Instead, honor whatever arises from the depths of your imagination without taking any direct action yet. Patience is your friend; you'll know in your gut when it's time to put your ideas into motion."
pisces,2012-01-23,"The most important events in your life are occurring in realms that are outside of quantification. Today's Aquarius New Moon stimulates your 12th House of Divine Inspiration, bringing visions of a more meaningful existence. Happily, your imagination holds the keys to your future. But don't attempt to rationalize your creative bursts of energy; instead, just let your fantasies flow without doing anything about them. Eventually, your dreams will become more integrated with your everyday life."
aries,2012-01-24,"You may be quite pleased that you can get along with everyone so easily now, but you still must be careful that your optimism doesn't turn into arrogance. You're so intensely focused on what you are saying that you can inadvertently offend someone, and others might even believe that you are bullying them. Hopefully, your best friends and allies will support you, but you could anger a co-worker if your approach is too forceful. Toning down your rhetoric is your best strategy for keeping the peace."
taurus,2012-01-24,"You have a clear agenda today and you won't likely waste time getting started with your work. However, others might view your behavior as more theatrical than practical now, which can be confusing to you. Even if you are annoyed because you're misunderstood, don't attempt to convince anyone of your good intentions. Although it may take a while, your actions will ultimately speak louder than words."
gemini,2012-01-24,"It's wonderful to be self-assured as you look to the future, but you could run into some opposition anyhow. Facing the resistance head-on might not be the best strategy now, because your rigid determination only adds more stress to the situation. Nevertheless, you don't need to let anyone's negativity send you into a crisis of self-doubt. Lighten up and avoid confrontation today; you'll be able to continue on your way once the energy settles down."
cancer,2012-01-24,"You might try to behave in a carefree manner today, but you won't likely be flexible enough to make a big difference. It's difficult to act emotionally detached when you can see through someone's appearance without even trying. Nevertheless, it's not helpful to get on your soapbox and broadcast the truth as you perceive it, since others are unable to comprehend your message now. Even if you are fed up with the whole charade, it may be wiser to let the awkward moment pass quietly and move on."
leo,2012-01-24,"You may get angry with someone you normally like, but expressing your emotions in a forthright manner is tricky today. You're tempted to find a scapegoat who doesn't really deserve your wrath. Don't inadvertently take your feelings out on the wrong person; this unconscious behavior could sour a sweet situation. Instead, seek ways to vent your negativity without pushing anyone's buttons. Try reducing your stress by engaging in vigorous physical exercise and leaving everyone else alone."
virgo,2012-01-24,"You could get carried away with your work today and exhaust yourself before you reach your objectives. If you begin a task that grows into a major project, make sure you have a well-defined limit so you know when to call it quits. There's no need to prove anything to yourself now, even if you believe that others may judge you as a less-than-capable co-worker. Give it your absolute best effort and then just walk away with a clear conscience."
libra,2012-01-24,"You could carry a chip on your shoulder today without even realizing it, especially if you have grown overconfident about your work. Unfortunately, your attitude may stir up animosity from someone close to you. Keep in mind that there are many ways to view current events and yours is only one of them. However, if you hold on to the belief that your approach is superior to all others, you might experience more than your fair share of discord and grief."
scorpio,2012-01-24,"You may be fed up with someone who doesn't respect your boundaries and it might be necessary to take a stand today.

Don't wait until you lose your temper; express your feelings while you still can communicate in a rational manner."
sagittarius,2012-01-24,"You don't want to do everything the same way today and may become determined to change your routine. It's wonderful to be innovative, as long as your restlessness doesn't prompt you to make your life more chaotic just because you're bored. Proceed cautiously or you'll create a whole new set of problems by turning your life upside down. Making small adjustments to your normal routine is smarter than trying to shake up everything all at once."
capricorn,2012-01-24,"You have a unique way of deciding what is most important now, and your unconventional priorities might cause some trouble. It doesn't matter how serious you are about improving your life, others still may believe that you're just being extra weird today. Unfortunately, you might sound more argumentative than you actually feel, so make sure to moderate any extreme behavior. Being successful requires that you stop long enough to consider the impact of your words before you alienate those who only want to help you."
aquarius,2012-01-24,"It's usually easier for you to be more rational than emotional, but the Moon's current visit to your sign brings a variety of emotions up to the surface now. In fact, you might not be fully in control as you vacillate between your head and your heart. Your wide mood swings may confuse others, so it's in your best interest to forge a sensible middle-of-the-road approach by integrating your feelings with your thoughts."
pisces,2012-01-24,"You could actually believe that your common sense will steer you in the right direction today, but you might make assumptions based upon unconscious desires rather than on the facts. Whether or not you're right, defending your position could inadvertently escalate a minor disagreement into a larger conflict. Nevertheless, it's smarter to listen carefully to the advice you receive now than to try to win an argument. Once you realign your idealistic perspective with the truth, everything else will fall into place."
aries,2012-01-25,"You may feel as if anything is possible today, but you could run into resistance if you get your hopes too high. It's not that you are overly confident now; it's just that you might not have a clear read on reality. Fortunately, the circumstances are not likely to be very complicated, but still you should handle issues as they arise or they'll create problems in the future. Balance your fantasies with a healthy dose of common sense to gain control of the day."
taurus,2012-01-25,"Your ruling planet Venus is usually associated with pleasure, yet her karmic aspect to stern Saturn might teach you a tough lesson instead. Be wise and face issues of the heart that surface today instead of doing your best to avoid them. Thankfully, you can end up in a better position to enjoy yourself if you're willing to push against your discomfort rather than slipping into denial. Your best bet now is to keep it real in all your interactions; you might be pleasantly surprised at the results."
gemini,2012-01-25,"Chasing satisfaction is complicated today if your partner's desires differ from yours. You may be willing to set aside your dreams to win the affection of a loved one. However, suppressing your emotions isn't a good idea because you could end up resentful; let your partner know what's troubling you and what you want. The only way to successfully manage a conflict now is to be one hundred percent honest."
cancer,2012-01-25,"You might feel optimistic today, even if you know that your dreams are still out of reach. Unfortunately, you could quickly work yourself into a state of anxiety if you concentrate on what you're missing, rather than what you currently have. Instead, be satisfied with taking small steps toward a big goal that may be beyond your current reach. Don't be overly concerned about achieving success; find your happiness in the journey and not in reaching your final destination."
leo,2012-01-25,"You may pin such high hopes on a relationship today that your rose-colored glasses prevent you from seeing someone clearly. Fortunately, you're not satisfied with appearances now, and are motivated to realign your fantasies with the true story. Re-establishing a solid connection with someone special might bring up an uncomfortable issue, but you will emerge richer in spirit if you face it with an open heart."
virgo,2012-01-25,"The Moon's visit to your 7th House of Relationships could turn a simple interaction into a memorable one today. However, the process might unfold very differently than you expect. It's not easy to let go of your personal agenda because you feel as if you have a lot at stake. Nevertheless, being flexible is the most sensible strategy now, allowing you to patch up a misunderstanding so you can move on with a clear conscience."
libra,2012-01-25,"Your ruling planet Venus is in the spotlight today, raising your hopes in love and setting your heart up for disappointment. Ultimately, you may be irritated with someone who doesn't deliver the good times that you desire, especially if you want your partner to respond to you in a romantic manner. There's no point in blaming anyone else if you don't get exactly what you want; instead, adapt to the new conditions and change your expectations accordingly."
scorpio,2012-01-25,"It's challenging to find satisfaction today if your idealism leads you to put your faith in an unrealistic plan. Nevertheless, the Moon's shift into your romantic 5th House of Fun and Games can bring your dreams to life. Still, everything gets mucky if you mix up your facts with fiction. If you are confused, just remind yourself that your desires can be different from what's actually happening. Go ahead and follow your bliss, just don't stray too far from reality in the process."
sagittarius,2012-01-25,"Although you are often restless at work and in love, you may want to have quiet time away from the maddening crowds today. However, the Moon's visit to your 4th House of Home and Family might not be sufficient to completely take your mind off the greater world of possibilities. Although you like the idea of pulling back socially now, you aren't eager to isolate yourself or alienate others. Acknowledging that your current dilemma is temporarily irresolvable enables you to enjoy your day for what it is."
capricorn,2012-01-25,"It's not easy to let go of your worldly ambitions now, but holding on to them too tightly can create more discouragement than happiness. Thankfully, there's no need to set new goals, but sidestepping them for a couple of days could be smarter than you think. Give yourself some downtime if you need it, especially if it allows you to reconnect with someone on a deeper emotional level. You should be able to return to work revitalized and ready for what's next."
aquarius,2012-01-25,"Your daydreams are all mixed up with reality now, and whatever you do just seems to confuse things even further. The more you struggle to figure out the truth, the more complicated it gets. However, suspending disbelief -- as you do when listening to a story -- enables you to turn frustration into magic. Throw away the self-judgment and enjoy playing in the realms of imagination the best you can. You'll have time to put everything back into proper perspective tomorrow."
pisces,2012-01-25,"Romantic Venus' presence in your sign usually brings joy, but today her stressful aspect to restrictive Saturn sends a frustrating message -- you cannot have what you want. Paradoxically, practicing patience can transform your current dissatisfaction into a more meaningful kind of love. Don't be in a hurry; waiting for the right time to make your move is the smartest thing you can do."
aries,2012-01-26,"If you're floating off into fantasyland today, something may happen that pulls you back into the real world. You might not take no for an answer and respond by pushing harder toward your destination, but persistence may not be enough to overcome an obstacle now. Seek a creative solution instead of trying to force your way forward. Willingly admitting that you don't have all the answers can reopen the doors that were temporary closed."
taurus,2012-01-26,"Although you want everything to flow more easily now, resistance to your plans may be too intense to ignore. Instead of avoiding the current circumstances, reconsider your basic assumptions and find an entirely new way to reach your goals. Use your common sense when processing your feelings today. Sharing your aspirations with a trusted friend could kick off a discussion that ultimately reveals a real solution."
gemini,2012-01-26,"You're usually quite clever, but today you may feel as if you're losing your edge as you try to make a plan. You might believe that you have discovered a brilliant solution, but you could end up being stuck over the details. Stressing about your current circumstances won't help, so use your time in a practical manner. Retreating and taking the time to analyze the problem can help you figure out where you went wrong so you can try again later."
cancer,2012-01-26,"Someone may verbally attack your plan today, or you could feel a lack of support from a person who usually encourages your efforts. However, a setback doesn't necessarily indicate defeat. A challenge tests you to see if you can be courageous enough to stand up to the resistance. Don't get defensive before you even consider what you can do to improve the plan. Take the chance you are being given now to get it right."
leo,2012-01-26,"You believe that you're on the right path today, yet issues surface that can raise self-doubt. You might question the soundness of your thinking if something important happens now that isn't part of your master plan. Narrowing your focus and finishing up old business accomplishes more than getting lost in trying to visualize your long-term goals."
virgo,2012-01-26,Your ruling planet Mercury is a troublemaker now as he bumps into a harsh square with unforgiving Saturn. Your unrealistic fantasies may crash down to earth today as they are confronted by the tough realities of these tumultuous times. Don't give up; modify your plans based upon what you learn and then try again. Your unwavering determination enables you to figure out the right direction.
libra,2012-01-26,"You are easily tempted to sit on the fence today, but mental Mercury's square to judgmental Saturn will probably push you to one side or the other. Unfortunately, you may regret your decision no matter what you choose. Think carefully before making up your mind, but don't grow overly attached to the outcome since your plans will likely change within a couple of days, anyhow."
scorpio,2012-01-26,"Everything feels quite intense today, tempting you to escape your responsibilities or just retreat and play hard to get. However, you're not particularly interested in turning into a hermit; you just want to hide until the current storm blows over. Remember, there is a very fine line between seeking solitude to regroup and admitting defeat. Either way, meditating on the difference can bring clarification when you need it most."
sagittarius,2012-01-26,"You may feel as if someone is coercing you to handle a troublesome financial matter now; nevertheless, you would prefer to sidestep this kind of serious business. Unfortunately, you must meet your current obligations before you head off to enjoy greener pastures. If you choose to skip out on your responsibilities today, you will only add to the current stress. Create new ways to work through old patterns that might otherwise hold you back."
capricorn,2012-01-26,"You could be flooded with waves of facts that force you to confront the limitations of your approach, but you don't have any new ideas to replace the old ones yet. You may feel as if you're standing between two worlds without a sensible plan. Although your previous assumptions are still intact, you know they must be replaced with a newer paradigm. Think outside of the box; lateral thinking strengthens your chances of success."
aquarius,2012-01-26,"Indulging in fantasies tempts you to reach outside of your normal comfort zone, but might also be frustrating if it sets you up for disappointment. It's healthy to acknowledge that your dreams are so wonderful that reality doesn't have a chance of living up to them. Still, you can outmaneuver negativity today by accepting what happens, even if it doesn't match your expectations. Making a realistic assessment of your current situation is the first step to achieving your ambitions."
pisces,2012-01-26,"You may believe that you have a workable solution to a lingering problem, only to discover that you don't have enough time or resources to execute your plan today. However, trimming extraneous distractions from your daily routine increases your chances for survival, and even success. It's easier to make cutbacks now than it will be once you're already in motion."
aries,2012-01-27,"You may be so fast to respond to an awkward situation at work today that your co-workers might think you are hiding something. However, your speedy reaction is more likely about being spontaneous than keeping a secret. Your emotions become more transparent throughout the day as your desire to live in the moment brings your feelings out into the open. There's no need to avoid uncertainty now because new truths can be born when you admit that you don't have all the answers."
taurus,2012-01-27,"You have obligations to meet today, but might be afraid of acknowledging recent promises that you just can't keep. You're worried about your inability to satisfy other people's expectations, but being too concerned about things that are beyond your control is counterproductive. Don't judge what's happening now by something that occurred in the past. Keep your life as simple as you can; give each task your absolute best effort and then move on to what's next."
gemini,2012-01-27,"It's tricky business if you believe that your dreams are slipping through your fingers today. Your discomfort grows when you learn something that enables you to see what's wrong with your current strategy, sending you into an anxious cycle of self-doubt. Nevertheless, don't waste any time fretting about what could go wrong. Just do what you can now to integrate the new information into your objectives and modify your plans to allow for the change of direction."
cancer,2012-01-27,"You have been known to sink deeply into the recesses of your inner world, but today's visit to your subconscious realms may be difficult at first. Tension on the job requires you to face a serious issue and you could make things worse if you think that you can just manipulate everything to your advantage. Thankfully, you could be in for a pleasant surprise if you are strong enough to surrender to your feelings. Being emotionally available can clear a path to an unexpected transformation."
leo,2012-01-27,"You may run into an old fear as you seek satisfaction today, yet the prognosis for happiness is quite good. Even if you are worried about being criticized if you fail to meet your goals, being totally honest about your self-doubt is wise as long as you express your concerns and then let go. Success is within reach if you're not in a hurry; take the scenic route if you encounter a detour along the way."
virgo,2012-01-27,"You may want to serve others today as you search for a renewed purpose to your life. You might consider leaving your comfort zone to go help victims of a recent natural disaster or work for a particular political or religious cause. Unfortunately, you could fall short of your own idealistic standards, no matter how hard you try. However, your new vision can be revitalizing if you don't take your ideas too far. Meanwhile, do something that has a positive impact on someone's life without turning your entire world upside down."
libra,2012-01-27,"You could get lost in your fantasies today about producing great works of art, but you may needlessly worry that you lack the talent to pull it off. Nevertheless, allow yourself to imagine what you might do if you didn't need to earn a living and manage your everyday responsibilities. There's no place for self-limiting thinking now, so express yourself as creatively as you can. Make time for playful endeavors, even if only as a practice to connect with your inner child."
scorpio,2012-01-27,"Nothing will be gained by wistfully wondering how your life would have turned out if one thing or another happened differently in the past. Although it may be tempting today to dream about changing a critical event, it's truly a pointless waste of time. Don't try to rewrite your personal history; instead use your imagination to bring a memory into the here and now so you can positively impact the present moment."
sagittarius,2012-01-27,You might get so excited about breaking out of your normal routine today that you completely forget about fulfilling a previous promise. Take time to quiet your mind so you can hear the meaningful message that's coming from your subconscious. Don't be so cavalier that you disregard the symbolism of a dream or fantasy. Everything that enters your awareness now contains clues about your life's purpose.
capricorn,2012-01-27,"Striving to reach your goals is admirable as long as you remember why they are important. It's helpful to reconsider a formative childhood experience that motivated you to be serious about making such ambitious plans. But, financial responsibilities and other routine obligations also require your attention now, so don't drop the ball on your daily chores just so you can rework your life. Balance your current necessities with what you see on the horizon before making any life-changing decisions."
aquarius,2012-01-27,"You have become more spiritually inclined and reliant on your imagination over the past decade with dreamy Neptune's presence in conceptual Aquarius. Now, mental Mercury in your sign requires you to reconsider recent changes, especially those that elude rational analysis. You are entering a transitional phase and today's realizations may be instrumental in redefining your life. You want to understand everything right away, but patience is required; this profound transformation will take months to unfold."
pisces,2012-01-27,"You are enthusiastic about plowing ahead, but might want a chance to reminisce about your childhood and indulge your need for nostalgia today. Delving into your own history can be helpful, but it also is a distraction if you are attempting to escape from your current circumstances. You may long to revive a meaningful connection with your past; just don't forget to express your creativity in the present moment or you might miss a wonderful opportunity that's right in front of your nose."
aries,2012-01-28,"You are likely to be more easily frustrated now that your key planet Mars is retrograde, yet this is also an opportunity to make small improvements to your lifestyle. However, you could set yourself up for disappointment by thinking that you're able to accomplish more than is humanly possible. Don't worry about what you finish now. Even if immediate satisfaction is elusive, you can all but ensure your long-term success by narrowing your options and taking little steps in the right direction."
taurus,2012-01-28,"You may be lost in an unrealistic fantasy today as you dream about your future, and your mental meanderings might not be grounded in your current life experience. Still, it isn't helpful to be too self-critical as you loosen the reins on reality. Having a practical plan now isn't as important as stretching yourself creatively. Thinking outside of the box will lead to new opportunities, so use your imagination to explore all your options."
gemini,2012-01-28,"You may be tired of being responsible, so you're ready to let go of practical restraints today and go along with someone else's plan without having to worry about the outcome. You are willing to give nearly anyone the benefit of the doubt now because you can see the potential good wherever you look. Fortunately, you don't have to produce concrete results, so just enjoy your little escape and see where others take you."
cancer,2012-01-28,"You are willing to do things with friends and family because you feel that they will accept you without asking too many questions. You don't want to justify everything you do and are happy that you can keep your thoughts to yourself now. Ironically, you may become more comfortable sharing an original idea if others accommodate your need for privacy. But you could regret saying more than you intended so don't lower your guard completely today."
leo,2012-01-28,"If you are pushing forward without a concrete fiscal plan, you might soon realize that you'll need more than just a good idea. Your thoughts are running all over the map today, so you won't necessarily be able to make practical use of your brilliance unless you filter out the excess noise. You cannot pursue every whim that pops into your head. This is not the best time for expansive strategies. Self-restraint will ultimately enable you to get your finances under control."
virgo,2012-01-28,"You may run into obstacles as you attempt to turn your plans into decisive action which could, in turn, decrease your self-confidence now that Mars is retrograde in your sign. But you aren't willing to give up because your key planet Mercury is working overtime to create one original idea after another. Unfortunately, ingenious thinking doesn't necessarily lead to success. Your smartest choice now might be saying no instead of wasting your energy chasing illusions."
libra,2012-01-28,"You might believe that you're being very clear in your communication now, but others may not understand exactly what you're saying. Paradoxically, they could become increasingly confused the more you talk if you gloss over important details without even realizing it. Your expectations may be out of sync with the current circumstances. Instead of asking for what you want today, wait for the energy to settle down. A dose of patience works better than persistent pressure."
scorpio,2012-01-28,"You might feel as if your social life has stalled now that your key planet Mars is retrograde in your 11th House of Community. Fortunately, your confidence is not suffering because your friends continue to show up with uplifting ideas and promises of fun activities. Nevertheless, you're tired of what seems to be all talk and no action. Ultimately, the power of your positive thinking will prevail, even if progress takes a while to manifest."
sagittarius,2012-01-28,"Your current plans seem to have grown out of hand as you took an idea and turned it into something so grandiose that it's now impossible to manage. Instead of confidently imagining that you can do anything today, it's smarter to scale back your expectations and hit an easy target than to aim high and fall short. This doesn't mean that you should allow negativity to rule your choices; just let practicality be your guiding principle, instead."
capricorn,2012-01-28,"You may be overly worried about an unfinished project that still eludes completion. Your discomfort with the delay could escalate into anxiety because there might be lingering tasks that prevent you from obtaining full closure now. Instead of pretending that everything is fine and your work is all done, remain open to modifying your deadlines to match the changes around you. Re-establishing realistic goals will help to settle your nerves and bring temporary relief from the stress."
aquarius,2012-01-28,"Your mind is working faster than reality now, so you might not be able to keep up with your own thoughts. Additionally, your assumptions may be so inflated that you cannot possibly meet your expectations for the weeks ahead. Instead of setting yourself up for failure, establish guidelines instead of deadlines. The possibilities are open-ended if you're willing to be patient; success won't happen overnight."
pisces,2012-01-28,"If you recently made a commitment to a friend or partner, you might need to reconsider your promise today. But this isn't about avoiding responsibility; in fact, it's about demonstrating your integrity by addressing your concerns now instead of waiting until it's too late. There's plenty of room for improvement, even if you face a minor setback. There's no need to be concerned with possible failure; just clarify your intentions and move forward."
aries,2012-01-29,"You are motivated to let everyone know exactly what you're feeling today, but your honesty could backfire on you unless you remember to be gentle in your delivery. Nothing will be gained if you scare people away before they hear you out. Fortunately, your day improves if you can tone down your rhetoric. Although your impatience makes it tough to take it easy, slowing down now helps you to sustain your confidence for a few more days."
taurus,2012-01-29,"You may be very hopeful about finally getting some peace and quiet today, but it still could take another day before you get what you really want. You might be pulled into an emotional drama, but you won't have to get fully involved unless you want to participate. At first, it's challenging to resist the action, but it's smart to withdraw before you're in over your head. Thankfully, others should respect your boundaries as long as you're honest about your motives."
gemini,2012-01-29,"Your day might get off to a rough start, but the loose pieces will begin to fall into place once you make a real commitment to finish whatever is on your plate. It may not be so easy to stay focused now because you would prefer to jump into the next distraction when it comes along. Leave plenty of time to fulfill your responsibilities today, even if your friends tempt you with an intriguing alternative to your previous obligations."
cancer,2012-01-29,You don't need to conform to other people's narrow expectations just because they assume that you're a homebody. Be adventurous and surprise everyone today by impulsively heading out to do something exciting on your own without discussing your plans with anyone else. You don't have to give lengthy rationalizations or seek approval for your decisions; just spread your wings and fly on your own for a while.
leo,2012-01-29,"Although you might not be free to do whatever you want today, it's still a good idea to make some special plans for the immediate future. You can derive simple enjoyment from dreaming up something wonderful, but the opportunity for action has not arrived just yet. In the meantime, think big. The feisty Aries Moon in your 9th House of Adventure is currently setting the stage for a mind-expanding experience. It's wise to consider a variety of options while you have the chance."
virgo,2012-01-29,"There's a lot of activity around you today, yet you may feel uneasy if you think that you could become uprooted from your secure place in the world. On the other hand, relinquishing control might prove to be exhilarating now, assuming you can find the courage to go for a joyride. Fortunately, you will probably end up in better shape than you started, so say yes to an invitation for fun before the opportunity passes."
libra,2012-01-29,"It's a smart idea to defend your boundaries today if you feel the need to protect yourself. You don't have to waste energy trying to be nice if others act disrespectfully toward you. Although you might surprise them if you push back hard enough to make your point, no one has the right to be overly domineering or rude toward you. Your honest decisive action will bring new respect and admiration from someone important."
scorpio,2012-01-29,"It's not a good idea to lose your temper today over something that may ultimately be unimportant. Your perspective is slightly warped by your heightened sense of urgency now, but recognizing that you're more impatient than usual will help you to manage your feelings more effectively. Count to ten prior to reacting; giving yourself enough time to re-establish your emotional center of gravity might be the simplest way to stay out of trouble."
sagittarius,2012-01-29,"It's not a good idea to withhold your feelings today. It's healthier to let them out gradually, rather than waiting until they explode out of your control. You are not doing yourself any favors by keeping your emotions bottled up because they will just continue to intensify. It's better to act consciously by discussing your concerns instead of erupting with a tantrum later on. Find a caring way to share your perspective without going off the rails in the process."
capricorn,2012-01-29,"You may not have to go too far to discover something new and different now. The excitable Aries Moon's presence in your 4th House of Home and Family indicates that adventure could find a way to your door today. Even if you don't think you need an adrenaline rush, you probably won't be able to resist the inevitable. Whether you asked for it or not, opportunity is knocking, so be smart and let it in."
aquarius,2012-01-29,"You may need a quick escape and today can be perfect for grabbing a one-day vacation. Don't worry about your previous plans because you should be able to temporarily put your responsibilities on hold. Naturally, you'll probably need to return to unfinished business tomorrow, but meanwhile, enjoy your mini-retreat. Taking time for yourself now should put you in a great state of mind for the busy week ahead."
pisces,2012-01-29,"Your current confidence makes the difference between a quiet day that comes and goes without much notice and a memorable one that can be very special. The self-directed Aries Moon is visiting your 2nd House of Self-Worth, empowering you to take responsibility for what happens now. Don't just hand the reins of control over to someone else; instead, decide where you want to go and create your own itinerary to get you to your desired destination."
aries,2012-01-30,"You may appear to have everything under control today, but you need to allow plenty of extra time this week to handle all the details or things could fall apart. Instead of letting your desire for pleasure lure you off course, be sure to keep your professional communications as clear as possible. Interactions with co-workers might become complicated if you aren't honest about your intentions, so create a strong foundation by starting at the bottom and building up from there."
taurus,2012-01-30,"Even if you're working against a deadline today, don't worry if everything seems to be taking a little longer than you wish. Thankfully, much-needed relief is on the way now that the Moon is back in your sign. However, the solution might come from giving yourself more time so you won't have to sacrifice quality for the sake of expediency. Although your project may be your main focus, expressing your feelings in a positive manner can motivate your associates and increase your progress."
gemini,2012-01-30,"Messenger Mercury, your key planet, might make mischief today unless you stop trying to outsmart everyone with your cleverness. You may seem argumentative now, even if that's not your intention. If you're not enthused about your job, don't make others pay for your frustration. Instead of sharing your thoughts, take a day or two to re-evaluate your needs and create new goals for the weeks ahead. It's okay to keep your current scheming and dreaming to yourself while you work out the details."
cancer,2012-01-30,"It's difficult to understand someone's message today because the words don't quite match up with the facts. You're tempted to jump to a new conclusion based on the incoming information, but it's smarter to gather more data until you have a wider perspective. Practice being comfortable with uncertainty now rather than arbitrarily pushing for closure right away."
leo,2012-01-30,"You could become so tangled up in the details of your plan today that you can't tell the forest from the trees. There may be so much happening at work now that you attempt to take a very methodical approach to production, separating a large project into several smaller steps. Although setting priorities helps you deal with the complexity, your co-workers might not be as supportive as you expect. Nevertheless, managing one task at a time ultimately enables you to reach the finish line first."
virgo,2012-01-30,"You're managing a mixed bag of circumstances today as Mars continues to retrograde in your sign. It doesn't matter how pragmatic you are now, more common sense may be necessary so you don't get sidetracked by frivolous activities. Even if someone tempts you with a delightful invitation, be smart and consider your current commitments before you decide where to put your energy. Graciously saying no allows you to finish your work on time."
libra,2012-01-30,"You might have parenting duties or family responsibilities that distract you from work today, yet others may be more dependent on you than you like. Luckily, you can draw from a deep emotional well now, giving you an air of authority you could use to your advantage. Just don't push your luck too far. Setting clear boundaries helps everyone feel more comfortable, so stop long enough to inform those close to you what you can and cannot do."
scorpio,2012-01-30,"You are looking forward to less stress at work, but it might not be possible because there are still tasks that need to be finished now before you can rest easy. It's a much more intelligent strategy to accomplish as much as you can early in the day, instead of procrastinating. Someone may surprise you with a social invitation for the evening, and you can happily say yes if you already fulfilled your responsibilities."
sagittarius,2012-01-30,"Stress on the job is troublesome for the next few weeks, but you can minimize problems by setting a positive tone today. Thankfully, the Moon's conjunction with your key planet Jupiter could put a joyful bounce in your step and a cheerful smile on your face. However, you're tempted to gloss over a problem so you don't have to be the serious one. Just remember that loose ends will continue to unravel if you're not committed to handling them when they first appear."
capricorn,2012-01-30,"You're enthusiasm to get ahead has returned, but you'll need to be extra methodical or you could end up wasting time. Don't let anyone talk you into trying a new approach or taking a shortcut because unproven strategies will probably backfire today. Fortunately, putting in the required work should result in success. Calculate the risk factor before doing something new. If you adopt a conservative approach now, you won't likely make an error in judgment."
aquarius,2012-01-30,"You're ready to take a chance by following your intuition now rather than your logic. Although you might not know if your gamble will work out, fate will probably treat you kindly today. Your imagination can lead you to exciting places without the need to get on an airplane. You may feel as if you're in uncharted territory, yet exploring outside your usual boundaries will teach you something very important about yourself."
pisces,2012-01-30,"Planning is difficult because cause and effect are more intertwined than they should be today. It may be tricky to tell the past from the future with so much planetary activity in your 12th House of Imagination. It feels as if time is looped back onto itself and you could easily slip into a parallel universe before you know it. Although you have your information in order, it will only take you so far. Trusting your instincts makes more sense now than relying on facts."
aries,2012-01-31,"Your key planet Mars has been retrograde for a week now, impeding your forward progress. You may be stressing about a project at work that's taking longer to finish than you expected. Thankfully, the Moon's harmonious trine to energetic Mars gives you the chance to catch up today. But don't waste this opportunity; there's still plenty to do in the days ahead. Instead of patting yourself on the back for all you accomplish, keep your eyes on the goals that lie ahead."
taurus,2012-01-31,"You're a smooth operator today as the Moon in your sign harmonizes with your key planet Venus, enabling you to appear at ease even in an awkward social setting. All would be well if you were able to focus on your own needs, but you might be required to set aside your desires so you can fulfill your obligations. You're smart to keep your concerns to yourself for a while longer so you can concentrate on your duties instead of seeking satisfaction for yourself."
gemini,2012-01-31,"You're navigating through a tricky set of circumstances now, although others may not even notice your stress. Unfortunately, you don't want to share your thoughts if they confuse the current situation even more. Opposing perspectives normally don't bother you, but today's dilemma is complicated because you don't have a solid place to stand. Logic falls short of producing a solution, so just let the uncertainty remain unresolved until your direction becomes clear."
cancer,2012-01-31,"You are eager for your dreams to come true and wish that you could plan your life accordingly, but unrelenting demands on your daily schedule prevent you from pursuing your long-term goals. Postponing the non-essential tasks -- even if they support your overall life purpose -- is better than avoiding your obligations now. Rather than judging yourself too harshly today, make the most of the opportunities you currently have on your plate."
leo,2012-01-31,"It seems as if your satisfaction is being delayed today, yet the blockages you face are probably more annoying than debilitating. You may hold on to the belief that you can overcome nearly any obstacle by putting your mind to it and doing whatever is required. However, facing one thing after another could eventually begin to wear you down. Don't give up; your unwavering determination is your secret weapon and will see you through to happier times."
virgo,2012-01-31,"It's hard to comprehend what motivates others today and your lack of understanding could add extra stress to your relationships. You might not realize that you need more assurance than others can offer you right now. Although you think that you know what you want and how you're going to get it, another person's uncertainty stirs up your own confusion. Ultimately, you won't find the stability you seek from anyone else. Solutions come from within and only you will be able to ease your doubts."
libra,2012-01-31,"You have a clear idea of your plans for the day, but might get sidetracked by unexpected changing circumstances. You may be quick to modify your workflow so you can live up to other people's expectations. Although you're willing to alter your agenda today, conforming to someone else's schedule could make you feel anxious, especially if you start to think about the tasks you left undone. Instead of working yourself into a tizzy, just commit to accomplishing your own goals tomorrow."
scorpio,2012-01-31,"You may not have a lot of faith in other people's abilities to honor their commitments, yet it's wise to hold yourself up to the same standard before judging someone else harshly. The difference between your good intentions and your actual behavior may be so obvious to you now that you see it clearly in everyone else, too. Although you can take the high road and feel compassion for another person's shortcomings, it's about time to lighten up and be more forgiving with yourself, too."
sagittarius,2012-01-31,"You feel conflicted now because you want to stay home and let the busyness of the world pass you by. After all, you have been working hard and could use the rest and relaxation. However, you also need to get out and be productive today. Even if you're tired, don't miss the opportunity to push your projects forward. But instead of choosing one path or the other, create a day that allows you to honor both approaches."
capricorn,2012-01-31,"You might prefer a simpler day with less activity now, but you're so practical that you know you don't really have a choice. Your friends and associates are expecting you to do your part and you're not interested in letting them down. Making a big deal about your personal sacrifice won't change anything, so don't lay a guilt trip on anyone. Just focus your attention on what must be done; if you have a positive attitude, everything will work out for the highest good of all involved."
aquarius,2012-01-31,"You may be aware of how your emotions can distract you from what you need to say to someone close to you today. You might even be worried about starting a difficult conversation because you don't think that you are able to keep your objectivity. Although expressing your feelings can leave you uncomfortably vulnerable, this is an opportunity to face your fears by exploring the uncertain boundaries between your head and your heart."
pisces,2012-01-31,"You Fish are usually quite capable of swimming through murky waters because you are good at figuring things out as you go along. However, it's difficult to navigate the emotional currents now because your own fantasies trick you into confusing your inner world with reality. Don't waste energy trying to control the course of events; just go along with the flow today. You can always correct your direction when your clarity returns."
aries,2012-02-01,"You may be so certain of your position today that others don't even want to negotiate with you. Fortunately, you can turn your stubbornness around in a flash; all you need to do is stop talking long enough to listen to what others have to say. Your latest realization might come as a surprise, but you aren't in a debate that must have a winner and a loser. Everything will flow smoother when you accept the notion that people can get together and share ideas in a non-competitive environment where everyone has a voice."
taurus,2012-02-01,"You don't have to wait until midday when the Moon leaves your sign to relax your stance. Stubbornly holding on to your overly simplistic plan becomes less advisable throughout the day. Unfortunately, it grows tougher to compromise and establish common ground after battle lines are drawn. It's your choice; you can make it easier on everyone now by setting your fixed agenda aside for the good of all."
gemini,2012-02-01,"It's challenging to shake the feeling that you didn't do enough earlier and there might not be sufficient time to fulfill your obligations. Ironically, your worrying may be more troublesome now than unfinished business. Excessive fretting slows you down even more because it prevents you from concentrating on your current work. Self-criticism isn't useful either; your best strategy is to set a comfortable pace today and keep at it as long as you can. Whatever remains left at the end of the day can be completed tomorrow."
cancer,2012-02-01,"Although it feels as if someone is pressuring you to accept more responsibilities now, you're willing to say yes if you think your involvement will help. However, don't overlook your own needs just so you can take care of others. Consider what makes the most sense for you, too. You won't have anything left over to give if you exhaust yourself emotionally, so establish healthy boundaries before contributing to the group process."
leo,2012-02-01,"Your resources may be taxed now and you could be left without a safety net. Fortunately, you can avoid a difficult situation by setting priorities before you realize that you're overcommitted. There are only so many hours in each day, so use them wisely and clearly inform those concerned of your scheduling limitations. You may be happily surprised at other people's willingness to adapt to your needs once you take the time to explain your situation."
virgo,2012-02-01,"You would prefer to be creative on your own terms today, but you're engaged in a dance and must follow the existing music, along with your partner's moves. You cannot just wander off and do your work alone. Still, you can gain more efficiency by separating your job into manageable steps. Although you may be annoyed by someone else's time constraints, don't let resentment get in your way. You can attend to your own projects with a clear conscience after you finish your previous assignments."
libra,2012-02-01,"Your ruling planet Venus is in an awkward standoff with combative Mars today, making you feel like someone is pushing you to do something you want to avoid. You may be stuck in the middle of a conflict without a simple way to reduce the tension. Thankfully, all is not lost if you are willing to take a position and defend it, even if your direct approach might make everyone uncomfortable for a while. Letting others know what you want will ultimately improve the situation all the way around."
scorpio,2012-02-01,"You may feel as if you have been placed in a no-win position as planetary lovers, Venus and Mars, reveal a conflict of interest in a close relationship. On one hand, you're willing to take the easy way out today and participate in a compromise. But it's difficult to let go of your expectations, making the path to agreement more circuitous than it should be now. Don't be afraid to make a tough decision about a relationship; your outlook will change for the better once you do."
sagittarius,2012-02-01,"It may feel as if an emotional storm is brewing now and your best course of action is to patiently wait it out. Thankfully, you're not in any immediate danger, but your fears could lead to frustration because you cannot change the weather. Instead of anxiously wishing for clearer skies, just accept your current fate. Acknowledging the limits that are being placed on you today enables you to struggle less and enjoy the present moment for what it offers."
capricorn,2012-02-01,"Although you're working hard, it may seem as if you're not making any progress today. In fact, you might even be losing ground. You are eager to experience some pleasure, but everything seems like such a chore now. Thankfully, you have the power to improve your day by simply recognizing that you ultimately will receive what you deserve. Going the extra mile won't necessarily bring satisfaction immediately, but be assured that your persistence and patience will be rewarded down the road."
aquarius,2012-02-01,"This seems to be a fateful time, especially if your relationship goals appear out of reach. Even if you are in a healthy partnership, you still might be considering the alternatives. However, forcing an issue now could jeopardize your previous gains. Luckily, your current negativity will diminish over the days ahead and your options won't feel so limited. Wait until your optimism returns before announcing any major decisions that you won't be able to reverse."
pisces,2012-02-01,"Everything could appear in black and white today, yet you would prefer a few more shades of gray between the extremes so you can entertain your fantasies a while longer. However, you have relationship obligations to fulfill now, so don't waste time or energy worrying about your fate. Ultimately, your future is in your hands. Thankfully, you're capable of turning nearly any situation into a positive opportunity, so stop daydreaming and get to work."
aries,2012-02-02,"Trying to do too much at once may be your normal approach to life, but things can grow out of control if you don't tighten the reins today. You're tempted to schedule a lot of activity because you think you will become bored if you don't keep yourself busy. However, your concern is unwarranted; there will be plenty of distractions, even if you cut back on your commitments. Practicing self-restraint is the responsible thing to do now."
taurus,2012-02-02,"Acting spontaneously today sounds like a good idea, but a previous obligation could prevent you from accepting an invitation to a pleasant social event. You may be annoyed with a co-worker who steps in to play the role of a heavyweight, even if he or she isn't your real boss. Ironically, once you accept that your work comes first now, you'll probably enjoy yourself more than you expect."
gemini,2012-02-02,"You might feel like you're being set up because you weren't told all the facts prior to agreeing to participate in a project at work. The Moon's visit to your adaptable sign reminds you that you are comfortable learning as you go along, but you don't appreciate it if certain details are carefully kept from you. Don't be concerned about politely withdrawing your support if you think you must; no one will fault you for being true to yourself."
cancer,2012-02-02,"You're not sure what to do about something you hear today, especially if it doesn't match up to the picture you already had in your mind. You want to put all the pieces together, but the circumstances are complicated and may elude logic. You could be tempted to set aside reason and follow your instincts, but you will do better now if you go over the facts again and again, until they finally fit into place."
leo,2012-02-02,"You feel uncomfortable if anyone attempts to avoid facing an important issue today. You're not interested in pussyfooting around; you need inarguable facts so you can get to the bottom of what's happening. Still, others might want to take a more casual wait-and-see approach. Talking about your concerns now can smooth over differences, but final resolution may be elusive. Be patient; the outcome grows more favorable next week."
virgo,2012-02-02,"You often find it challenging to tackle several tasks simultaneously because you naturally prefer setting priorities and concentrating on one thing at a time. However, you're more adept at multitasking now, smoothly moving between projects as necessary. Nevertheless, you still could reach a tipping point when you feel like you're juggling too many things at once. It isn't worth the stress today; simply set some things aside for a bit so you can tie up the loose ends on what's most important."
libra,2012-02-02,"You might appear more stubborn than you actually are now, but anyone who makes assumptions about you too quickly could easily misread you. You're eager to discuss your plans and figure out the best way to bring your ideas to fruition. It's your determination that can be mistaken for inflexibility today. Sticking to your agenda makes strategic sense as long as you remain open to finding better solutions."
scorpio,2012-02-02,"Your commitment means a lot today because you're willing to temporarily set aside the pursuit of happiness while you fulfill your promises. Naturally, you would like to have some fun, but your priorities are quite clear now. You know that you won't be able to enjoy yourself if you're worrying about letting others down. Ultimately, your satisfaction in doing your job well means more than a fleeting moment of pleasure."
sagittarius,2012-02-02,"Hopefully, the relationship work you've been doing will begin to pay off, even if your partner or companion hasn't yet noticed the difference in your behavior. It's easy to get discouraged today if you're tired of waiting for recognition, especially if others appear to be having an easier time than you are in the romance department. However, don't let your impatience spoil the positive changes that are right around the next corner."
capricorn,2012-02-02,"Although you might be afraid that you could buckle under the weight of responsibilities now, others are confident you can rise to the challenge. Even if you're not interested in working so hard today, you still have the necessary stamina to do what is required and finish the job. But if you're sidetracked by an unexpected event, simply refocus your intentions as quickly as you can. Ultimately, your steady demeanor and fierce determination will lead you to the success you seek."
aquarius,2012-02-02,"Even if you have been trying to solidify plans with others, a gulf can widen between you and a co-worker today. It's frustrating if progress is delayed by your attempts to figure out who's right and wrong; it's smarter to assume that everyone has something positive to offer. Your chances of success improve when you take the best parts of each idea and combine them to make the ultimate plan. Cooperation isn't easy now, but meeting others halfway produces the results you want."
pisces,2012-02-02,"There are more than enough facts at your disposal today, yet additional information doesn't make your decision any easier, nor does it ensure a better outcome. Actually, you probably already have the answer you need. Don't bother mulling over the details again; instead, clear your mind of excess noise. The right choice will come from your intuition and not external sources."
aries,2012-02-03,"No matter how charming and witty you think you are today, you can still appear to be overly aggressive. Even if you believe that your clever use of words can get you whatever you want, a little self-restraint is a smart idea now. Tone down your message or you could inadvertently offend someone. Considering other people's feelings before your own is a healthy spiritual practice."
taurus,2012-02-03,"It's difficult to stay on task today, even if your pace has been steady until now. It isn't that you're distracted; it's just that you're over-analyzing everything as you try to determine the most efficient way to get things done. Don't worry if a job is taking longer than you wish. Your primary strength isn't your speed; it's the sheer power of your unwavering determination."
gemini,2012-02-03,"The Moon's current visit to your sign brings a surprise today, so it may be challenging to plan too far ahead. Fortunately, you're able to dance around on the edges of uncertainty better than others, and this flexibility works to your advantage. While everyone else is scrambling to figure out what went wrong, you are busy engaging the present moment brilliantly and happily creating your future as it unfolds."
cancer,2012-02-03,"Your current plans may need to be overhauled today, even if you believe that everything is under control. Thankfully, placing all the facts on the table allows you to quickly see an emerging pattern so you can put everything back in order. Just remember that it's not enough to be clever; you also must be willing to talk about your ideas in order to make your dreams come true."
leo,2012-02-03,"You may be so tired of doing everything the same old way that you actually try a different approach in a social situation today. Thankfully, you can turn your frustration into a coherent message that encourages others to listen to your ideas. However, they won't likely understand how to produce tangible results from your point of view. Talk is easy, but direct action is more convincing than clever words."
virgo,2012-02-03,"Your boss could grow weary of unfulfilled promises today, especially if your productivity falls short of your target. You have good intentions when you commit to doing what's expected, but may be more eager than capable of performing your duties. Be careful about exaggerating what you can do. It's healthier to admit uncertainty up front than to raise someone's hopes before disappointing them."
libra,2012-02-03,"Your hopes are soaring today and you cannot stop thinking about all the possibilities before you. However, dreaming of the future may not be the smartest way to handle the tensions of the present. Resolve differences of opinion between you and a co-worker now, before they become a tangled mess. Don't make excuses; the sooner you start practicing the fine art of compromise the better."
scorpio,2012-02-03,"There may be a world of difference between what you want and what you're doing these days, which motivates you to set new priorities. Fortunately, acknowledging that you probably need to modify your approach or even change your final goals helps to take the pressure off your current decisions. Although you might not have the answers you're currently seeking, it's better to act on an interim plan now than to wait for the perfect one to emerge."
sagittarius,2012-02-03,"You could feel a bit uneasy as the changeable Gemini Moon visits your 7th House of Partnerships. You're not trying to offend anyone, but your need to be honest outweighs any other desires today. If you're not walking your talk now, you'll end up diminishing your spirit. As long as you remember to act compassionately to others, your journey of self-discovery will continue to be a source of inspiration."
capricorn,2012-02-03,"You could be overwhelmed by a barrage of information at work because everyone seems to want you as a friend. Although you may be willing to be a confidant for someone special, you're not particularly interested in becoming the shoulder that everyone cries on. Gracefully saying no isn't as easy as it sounds, but it allows you to establish healthy boundaries between your personal and professional lives."
aquarius,2012-02-03,"Others may assume that you're emotionally detached today because you have such an objective approach to making plans. Actually, your ideas could be flowing so quickly that you just jump in and eagerly share them without considering how anyone else feels. Taking the time to imagine how someone might react enables you to communicate your brilliant solution with disarming warmth."
pisces,2012-02-03,"Your friends may seem overly critical now, but they have important advice to give you. If you forget to pay close attention to the signs, you might miss a significant fork in the road. Staying on the same path may be your best choice, but you must explore other options or you won't ever know if you did the right thing. Keep in mind that when a door begins to open, it's still your choice whether or not to walk through it."
aries,2012-02-04,"Partnership issues are making you feel more impatient by the day, and you might not know which way to turn now. You don't like being so vulnerable; you prefer it when you're independent of the responsibilities that come along with a relationship. Nevertheless, you're still aware of the potential for growth, even if you must confront your own discomfort. Unfortunately, logic won't help you decide what to do today, so just follow your heart."
taurus,2012-02-04,"Your desire to communicate with others could conflict with your need for solitude today. This dichotomy can be frustrating and might provoke you to strike out at someone who is supportive of your goals. If you pay closer attention to what you want, your unexpressed feelings won't have to be the main focus of the day. Clarifying your personal and professional responsibilities enables you to respond more sensibly."
gemini,2012-02-04,"Today you could get a much-needed reprieve from the recent hectic pace of your life. You may as well settle into the silence without stirring up any action because you won't likely make much progress now even if you try. However, an unexpected emotional outburst on your part today could trigger someone to overreact in return. Avoid being sideswiped by your own unconscious feelings by honestly expressing your needs as they arise, leaving no room for any unnecessary drama."
cancer,2012-02-04,"The Moon's return to your sensitive sign today may be the start of something new, even if you're not yet ready to forge ahead. Thankfully, you will have a good shot at reaching your goals as long as you take whatever extra time you need. You'll only make yourself more frustrated if you push too hard because you could inadvertently stir up a hornet's nest of resistance. Be patient; it's smarter to chill out now and try again once the energy settles down."
leo,2012-02-04,"Your friends may tempt you to take a risk now, even if you know better. Other people's eloquence inspires you to act more spontaneously, but the power of the present moment isn't all that matters when you have your hopes pinned on the future. Ultimately, it's smarter to remain silent today and tell everyone else about your ideas on another day."
virgo,2012-02-04,"Stand back to re-evaluate your long-term goals, especially if you feel pressured to take a specific action today. Instead of being coerced into a bad decision, it's time to withdraw so you can maintain your position. You recently learned an important lesson and now you can teach others how to achieve success. Integrate your feelings into your social interactions by sharing what's in your heart. Don't miss this opportunity to let down your guard and open up to someone you trust."
libra,2012-02-04,"You could face a stressful emotional dilemma as the cautious Cancer Moon creates anxious aspects with several planets today. Your unexpressed negativity intensifies if you try to make light of what you are enduring. Although your defenses are probably strong enough to keep others out now, you'll feel better if you let someone special into your heart instead of just trying to pretend you are okay on your own."
scorpio,2012-02-04,"It may feel as if relief is on the way now, but there aren't any angels coming to your rescue just yet. Therefore, you would be wise to take care of yourself as best as you can. Luckily, following your instincts won't likely steer you wrong today if you don't waste energy worrying about something you can't control. Take each event as it comes by responding from your gut and not your head."
sagittarius,2012-02-04,"You may need to face your disappointment today if you want a logical reason for everything that happens to you. Unfortunately, quick explanations aren't forthcoming now, turning up the intensity of your frustrations. However, you aren't really worried about what you didn't receive. The real source of your discontent is about being coerced into saying more than you want to reveal. Remember, you're not required to explain your feelings until you're ready."
capricorn,2012-02-04,"The emotional Moon's current visit to your 7th House of Relationships kindles the flames of romance, especially if you are attracted to someone special now. Nevertheless, you may become annoyed if your partner withdraws just as you're ready to engage the enticing energy. Instead of overcompensating by demanding more attention today, chill out and relax. Your sense of urgency isn't quite as pressing as it currently seems."
aquarius,2012-02-04,"You might not be able to make it through the entire day without encountering a relationship meltdown. Spontaneously jumping in to help someone handle their emotional crisis might be unavoidable since you cannot stop the inevitable. Nevertheless, don't waste too much time on other people's dramas; instead, work quietly and finish as many of your chores as possible."
pisces,2012-02-04,"You may be ready for a day of fun, but you cannot just go off and amuse yourself until you have met your obligations. You could even feel a bit of peer pressure from others to keep working. Don't give up on the idea of partaking in pleasurable activities today because you might be able to sneak out for a break -- as long as you return to finish your responsibilities with replenished vitality."
aries,2012-02-05,"You can often catch others off guard with your assertive behavior, but today you might prefer taking time by yourself to recharge your batteries. Although you aren't eager to turn your life upside down for a bit of excitement, you want to be ready for a new round of activity next week. Don't worry about what anyone else thinks; if you're feeling like a kinder and gentler version of yourself now, just let it shine."
taurus,2012-02-05,"You aren't interested in getting involved with a group of people today, especially if you have things to do on your own. Although you can happily become lost in nearly any activity you start now, it may not be so easy to completely isolate yourself from those close to you. Spending too much energy resisting the demands of friends and family can be a self-defeating proposition. Be creative with your schedule so you can claim your personal time and connect socially, too."
gemini,2012-02-05,"You must follow through on what you promised because others may be depending on you. Thankfully, you're more tenacious now that the Moon is visiting your 2nd House of Values and you won't let go of a task that's important to you until you have done your best. Nevertheless, it's helpful to take a risk; trying an original approach can help you break out of a rut. Trust your instincts; if a plan feels right today, it will probably work out fine."
cancer,2012-02-05,"You won't need to be overly flashy as you go about your business today; your actions will speak louder than anything you can say. Still, you deserve a bit of time for celebration later in the evening once you have quietly met your obligations. Even if you're not interested in being in the spotlight, it will feel great to be acknowledged for your accomplishments."
leo,2012-02-05,"It's a smart idea to complete unfinished chores today as the Moon moves through your 12th House of Endings. Whatever happens tomorrow after the Moon enters your sign, it's crucial to be ready for a new round of action. Although you are tempted to look ahead to the future with anticipation, tying up loose ends now is more of a guarantee of success than making new plans. Be patient; your wait will soon be over."
virgo,2012-02-05,"It's easy to get distracted with someone's big plans today, yet you aren't sure that it's such a good idea. Fortunately, you don't have to jump on board; all you need to do now is be a good listener. You are like a sounding board; allowing your friends to share their ideas without the need to defend their positions enables them to take a radical new strategy to the next level."
libra,2012-02-05,"The best thing you can do now is to focus on your own creative process and pay careful attention to what you're doing each and every moment of the day. Unfortunately, this isn't a simple task because your fantasies are flowing and you would rather dream of your ideal future while leaving the practical considerations to someone else. Rather than complicating your life, establish clear priorities so you can get your plan off the ground right away."
scorpio,2012-02-05,"You may be on a brilliant creative streak now as long as you don't worry about what someone else thinks of your work. You're at the mercy of your own self-criticism; if you question your ability to do something, then you will be limited by your doubts. Thankfully, the power of your positive thinking can turn things around in a flash. It's your choice; believing in your own strength makes all the difference in the world."
sagittarius,2012-02-05,"You have been impatiently looking out toward the horizon because you long for the next phase of your journey to begin. Unfortunately, your impulsive behavior could get the best of you and maybe even delay your progress. Your fear of failure can provoke you to overcompensate and push even harder today. You might not realize how much you have accomplished until everything starts to happen all at once."
capricorn,2012-02-05,A family member or friend may be too sentimental for your taste today as the emotional Cancer Moon visits your 7th House of Others. It isn't that you're unable to be soft and gentle; it's just that you believe that showing vulnerability could slow down your progress. Don't worry if you're distracted from your goals now; your worldly ambitions will return soon and your talents will shine in the days ahead.
aquarius,2012-02-05,"You are eager to be of service to someone you love because it makes you feel warm and fuzzy when you do something nice. You're not interested in following an old routine now, and you might even attempt to avoid responsibilities if they don't excite you. However, it's wise to proceed with caution today because your frustrations may prompt you to lose your temper. Steering clear of conflict enables you to express your altruistic intentions without causing any drama."
pisces,2012-02-05,"Your elevated need for fantasy today can be a mixed blessing. Although you enjoy enriching your imagination with music, movies or books, it's not easy to live up to your real world obligations. Unfortunately, you may disappoint others by not meeting their practical expectations. Ironically, you could appear to be more of an outsider now the harder you try to fit in. There's no need to judge yourself too harshly; just dance to the beat of your own drum, even if no one else can hear it."
aries,2012-02-06,"You may feel frustrated today because you know what you want, yet others expect you to bury your feelings and go along with the group's consensus. Unfortunately, your optimism can turn to anger if you believe that your freedom is being curtailed. Calm yourself down by putting your desires in perspective. It's smarter to cooperate now instead of trying to get everyone to agree with you. Chill out and don't take yourself so seriously. Talk less and listen more."
taurus,2012-02-06,"Although you may be heading back to work today, you might wish you could retreat into your personal world now that the Moon is visiting your 4th House of Home and Family. However, a busy day of interactions with others won't likely leave you much time for nostalgia. Instead of escaping into sentimental fantasies, take care of your responsibilities and save your dreams for another day."
gemini,2012-02-06,"You may not be happy with constraints that prevent you from exploring all the exciting options you see in front of you. You might be overwhelmed with work deadlines along with a few surprises that require your immediate attention. Although you wish you had enough time to make plans for the future, it's not wise to shirk your responsibilities or complain about your situation. Fortunately, you can turn your day into a productive one if you maintain a positive attitude and focus on the present moment."
cancer,2012-02-06,"Your high anxiety fuels a stream of communication today that enables you to express what's most important to you. However, you may feel frustrated if your job doesn't give you some room to be creative in how you go about your work. Thankfully, you can maintain control over your imagination; in your fantasies you could travel anywhere you desire. Struggling to manifest your dreams is unnecessary; just enjoy them for what they are."
leo,2012-02-06,"Your energy is switched on now that the Moon is back in your lively sign, but your high-frequency buzz can be overwhelming to someone else. While you have a tough time settling down, others may not share in your current enthusiasm. Be patient and accept the more laid-back approach of your partners and friends. Keep your judgments to a minimum; you probably won't realize the strong impact your words have today on those around you."
virgo,2012-02-06,"Your schedule may be more hectic than you wish today, especially if you're trying to keep a project from falling behind. You might even feel as if you're performing on stage with everyone watching you juggle one too many balls. Thankfully, your focused concentration works in your favor. Don't let your attention waver; you'll have time to dream later in the week after the Moon returns to your sign."
libra,2012-02-06,"Your mind may be on the future, but current responsibilities also demand your attention. Although others might think that you're being flaky as you focus on things that don't matter to them, you're actually able to balance your dreams with your obligations. Make sure you clearly show everyone that you're taking care of business, but give yourself a bit of room to be inventive as you explore the potential paths in front of you."
scorpio,2012-02-06,"You may believe that someone has unrealistic expectations of you at work today, especially since you normally execute your job duties in an exemplary manner. Unfortunately, a misunderstanding could develop out of the blue unless you take time to clearly express what you need. Thankfully, a peaceful resolution is possible, but you need to practice patience while you're waiting for the erratic energy to settle down."
sagittarius,2012-02-06,"Your hopes may fall like a house of cards today once you recognize what is actually happening. If you were previously caught up in a dreamworld, an epiphany could contain a seed for a more realistic future. But there's no need for drama; just make the necessary adjustments to your plans and try again. A small setback or a minor disappointment may be exactly what you need now to fuel your drive to success."
capricorn,2012-02-06,"It's hard to know if it's more appropriate to be happy or sad today if you're confronted with an extreme situation that requires your immediate decision. Unfortunately, the pressure may be very real, but choosing a direction is the best thing that could happen now. Don't worry about what might have been; just pay attention to the facts and move on. Your objectivity will enable you to come out on top, if you can focus on the future and not the past."
aquarius,2012-02-06,"A fear of change could kick in if things seem to be running out of control today. Someone in your immediate environment may be argumentative, but your know-it-all attitude adds to the tension. Instead of trying to demonstrate your superiority, it's smarter now to practice flexibility. In fact, encouraging others toward independent behavior will ultimately increase your sense of freedom, too."
pisces,2012-02-06,"Your concern about what someone thinks of your work performance could reach a crescendo today as an ongoing disagreement is exacerbated. Although it may come as a surprise, it's probably the result of recently buried tensions. A minor emotional crisis will likely bring relief once everyone's feelings are finally out in the open. Keep in mind that you're taking steps toward a positive resolution even if things seem awkward for a little while along the way."
aries,2012-02-07,"You may think that the strength of your conviction is sufficient to power your way through a challenging relationship issue now. The Leo Full Moon in your 5th House of Self-Expression indicates that an emotional demonstration can help your cause as long as you remain reasonable. Don't ride roughshod over anyone's feelings; if you inadvertently offend someone, graciously apologize as soon as you realize what you've done. Instead of drawing more attention to the situation, move on to what's next."
taurus,2012-02-07,Your patience with a domestic matter may be stretched to the limit now as the Leo Full Moon activates your 4th House of Home and Family. Circumstances are complicated by pressures that force you to juggle your public responsibilities with more private aspects of your life. But don't allow laziness to get in the way of what you need to do. Start as early as possible and work steadily until you have taken care of all your personal and professional obligations.
gemini,2012-02-07,"The energetic Leo Full Moon brightens your 3rd House of Immediate Environment, indicating that your life is very busy now. However, planning for the future is just as important today as keeping up with your current commitments. Consider where you want to go from here and make proactive plans to reach your goals. But don't fall prey to frustration; achieving success may take longer than you think."
cancer,2012-02-07,"You're very sensitive to the lunar cycles and today's Leo Full Moon in your 2nd House of Values urges you to hold on to what you have. However, a project that hasn't reached fruition could lose appeal, making it wiser to let it go. Take decisive action and, if feasible, build on something you already started, rather than initiating a new plan. It's more productive now to push your current work ahead as long as it's still relevant."
leo,2012-02-07,"You could seem very intense to others now because the expressive Leo Full Moon illuminates your 1st House of Self. Her opposition to communicator Mercury in your 7th House of Relationships suggests that you may be argumentative if you expect communication to solve a difference of opinion today. In fact, you might even scare someone away with your certainty. Instead of acting like a know-it-all, just explain your thought process and then settle down and listen to everyone else."
virgo,2012-02-07,"You are facing an emotional dilemma as today's extroverted Leo Full Moon lands in your 12th House of Secrets. You must figure out how to express yourself while also maintaining silence on certain aspects of your life. Partially sharing information can be tricky because you may find it tough to stop talking once you start. Set your limits before you open your mouth, so there's no question as to how far you will go in your disclosure."
libra,2012-02-07,"The outgoing Leo Full Moon in your 11th House of Friends encourages you to let others know what you need. But you may inadvertently squelch the fun in a social gathering as the warmth of your key planet Venus is constrained by somber Saturn. Fortunately, if your intentions are good, others will take you seriously without misunderstanding your concern. You can be part of the group while also acting in a responsible manner."
scorpio,2012-02-07,"You are able to express yourself passionately about your work today as the Leo Full Moon shines in your 10th House of Career. Thankfully, you can maintain a sense of objectivity even if your feelings are part of the equation. But don't wait for anyone else to create your reality now; instead of sitting on the sidelines or playing the role of a cheerleader, go out there and make something happen. Just keep in mind visible progress may take longer than you expect."
sagittarius,2012-02-07,"The melodramatic Leo Full Moon energizes your 9th House of Adventure today, motivating you to set aside your current plans in favor of bigger goal. But keeping things in balance is a smarter strategy; you could miss the real opportunity if you aim too high. Instead of jeopardizing your security, follow a practical course of action now. You can always do what's required in the present moment while holding on to your dreams for the future."
capricorn,2012-02-07,"The lively Leo Full Moon falls in your 8th House of Deep Sharing today, raising fears if you're feeling emotionally vulnerable. Sobering Saturn's retrograde turn might tempt you to overcompensate by hiding your feelings. Although you may worry that others will judge you harshly, your authority won't likely slip as long as you are honest about your concerns. Your attitude will lighten once you take a risk and share what's in your heart. Laughter, combined with the truth, is the best medicine."
aquarius,2012-02-07,"The playful Leo Full Moon activates your 7th House of Relationships, provoking you to express your attraction to someone you like. Keep in mind that your words have greater significance today as messenger Mercury joins the Sun in your sign. Being openhearted is advisable as long as you don't go overboard. If you come on too strong, people may worry that you expect something in return. Just casually say what's on your mind and let the rest of the story develop on its own."
pisces,2012-02-07,"The frisky Leo Full Moon brightens your 6th House of Work, creating tension between your playful desires and your current responsibilities. Thankfully, you can reduce the stress by expending some of your excess physical energy engaging in physical labor or sweating at the gym. Although any exercise should help you feel better, you will be much happier if you actually accomplish something useful while exerting yourself."
aries,2012-02-08,"Love may be in the air with sweet Venus visiting your impulsive sign until March 5. You're optimistic about your chances, whether or not something actually happens. Just remember not to come on too strong or you might overwhelm someone with your exuberance. Express what's in your heart, but make sure to allow enough room for others to be themselves."
taurus,2012-02-08,"Your key planet Venus enters your 12th House of Escapism today, stirring up fantasies of romance. Although daydreaming is enjoyable, you still want something real. You hope to find someone to share in your imaginative explorations. Don't be too much of a pragmatist now; you might be pleasantly surprised if you can keep an open mind and trust with an open heart."
gemini,2012-02-08,"It's not easy to concentrate on work when there are so many other things you want to do today. However, you'll have to manage your calendar carefully or you might find yourself running around from one exciting distraction to the next. So much activity may be fun for a while, but your other responsibilities will only pile up if you don't handle them, too. Take some time to consider the practical side of your life, even if your impulse is to say yes to everything and everyone."
cancer,2012-02-08,"You could frighten yourself now because you feel bold enough to do things that you might normally pass by. Your uncharacteristic courage has others taking notice of your new sense of optimism, which inspires them to have more confidence in you. Your positive attitude can open doors that were previously closed, so be receptive to the support that comes your way today."
leo,2012-02-08,"Your excitement about an upcoming adventure is growing now that Venus is in your 9th House of Big Ideas. But even if things are looking good, you may feel a temporary sense of disappointment when the Moon slips out of your sign and into fussy Virgo. Thankfully, you can turn things around by keeping your schedule flexible. Taking advantage of an unexpected opportunity could add some fun to your day."
virgo,2012-02-08,"You may be worried that time is slipping away and you're not making enough progress. Your desire to get things done now prompts you to take an unnecessary risk. It's not like you to overlook important details, but the Moon's return to your sign can shift your attention out of the practical world into more subjective realms. There's nothing wrong with being adventurous as long as you don't jeopardize what you've already gained in the process."
libra,2012-02-08,"Sultry Venus sashays into your 7th House of Relationships and approaches wild Uranus, giving you the ability to surprise someone with your affection and work your way into his or her heart. You're quite likely to get what you want, even if it takes a few days, so carefully consider your desires before giving voice to your intentions. Remember, there's no reason to get discouraged, even if you don't gain satisfaction right away; Lady Luck is still on your side."
scorpio,2012-02-08,"Your optimism is based on real facts and your communication is quite clear as you express your feelings today. It's to your advantage that your upbeat attitude is contagious, but you still must be cautious. You could be so convincing now that others might make important choices based upon what you say. There's no need to dampen your enthusiasm; just make sure you're not overselling your point of view."
sagittarius,2012-02-08,"You know where you stand in the world today now that the Moon is in your 10th House of Public Responsibility. You have more confidence about what you're doing at work, but this doesn't mean you should hide any feelings of uncertainty. In fact, sharing your vulnerability now might open a doorway to a beautiful experience with someone very special. Don't let an opportunity get away from you; tell a friend or loved one how important he or she is to you when you have the chance."
capricorn,2012-02-08,"You might not want to make plans today because you can see the advantage to taking things as they occur and deciding what to do next as each opportunity comes along. It feels more natural to relax and enjoy yourself, especially if you already know that your schedule will get busier as time moves on. Keeping a healthy perspective is important. Pay attention to your previous obligations, even if you wish you could take more time off now."
aquarius,2012-02-08,"You may be tempted to ask for something you don't really need today. It's not a matter of whether or not you can afford taking an emotional risk or spending more money than you should; it's healthier now to reduce your reliance on material possessions and put more stock in personal experiences. You don't have to purchase anything to feel good about yourself. In fact, a heart-to-heart connection is more important than whatever money can buy."
pisces,2012-02-08,"Although you're interested in improving your health through diet and exercise, a bit of self-indulgence is tempting now. Thankfully, your friends may not let you get away with much today; they are quick to criticize your undisciplined ways. Don't waste energy with defensive posturing; accept the feedback you receive with appreciation. Turn your dreams into powerful action as you establish your routine for the next several weeks."
aries,2012-02-09,"Your attachment to wanting an adrenaline rush doesn't save you from the potential trouble caused by your mischievous activities. You may be so enthused about what could happen today that you lose track of your common sense. Serious problems can arise if you don't think before you act. However, a calculated risk might prove to be a lot of fun if you remember to take precautions along the way."
taurus,2012-02-09,"You might think that you have a ""Get Out of Jail Free"" card up your sleeve, but, unfortunately, it only works in your dreams. As important as it is for you to break out of someone's control now, you don't seem to be able to exert your authority over others. Still, today's message is clear: no one can keep you locked up if you believe that you are free. The key to your happiness is to consider which rules you're willing to accept and then adhere to them happily."
gemini,2012-02-09,"Following your instincts can lead you into an exciting but unstable situation today. Normally, you would gather information in advance prior to participating in a group activity. However, now you're delighted with the idea of jumping into the unknown on a whim. Don't fight the impulse; enjoy the thrills while they last. You have an opportunity to create a magical memory that will bring a smile to your face for a long time to come."
cancer,2012-02-09,"You are tired of waiting for the right opportunity at work. You want results right away and may be ready to gamble on your future. However, your sense of urgency could provoke a hasty decision that doesn't go according to your plans. Practicing a little more patience would be wise while you explore your options in the safety of your own mind. Think twice before impulsively trying a radical solution when a more conservative one will do the trick."
leo,2012-02-09,"Even if you had to readjust your timeline and cool your jets recently, taking the wait-and-see approach won't work for you today. Something unexpected may occur that forces you to react quickly now. Although you still want to consider all of the circumstances, you might not want to pass by an opportunity to explore something you are eager to learn more about. Take a chance and go for it; you can always work out the necessary details later on."
virgo,2012-02-09,"You might be pulled into an emotional melodrama today that reactivates old fears. Paradoxically, you're eagerly anticipating this chance to face your demons and overcome them once and for all. You have skirted around the edges of this scary feeling long enough; it's time to dive directly into the heart of the matter and release the past. The potential rewards are great and will last forever."
libra,2012-02-09,"Although you've experienced many unusual things lately, your partner or a friend might do something today that's totally unexpected. Ironically, you may secretly wish that you were the one daring enough to break the rules and behave outrageously. But even if nothing weird happens now, it's wise to think about what risks you could take to make your unrealized dreams come true. Fortunately, you really don't have to rely on someone else to act out your suppressed desires."
scorpio,2012-02-09,"The comfortable pattern of your daily routine is often very reassuring and helps you feel secure about your life. However, you may be itching to bust out of your regular grind and try something totally different today. But putting a plan into motion is challenging because you don't know how much effort to exert. Pushing too hard can stir up more trouble than it's worth. But letting this moment pass without doing anything radical will leave you feeling flat. It's better now to err on the side of risk than caution."
sagittarius,2012-02-09,"You may feel as if you're climbing the walls today, especially if your creativity is being restrained in any way. You are so eager for action that you could overlook your responsibilities in order to pursue your original ideas. Unfortunately, you are still expected to perform according to the rules; if you don't measure up, your brilliant efforts won't have a chance to shine. Don't quit; your persistence enables you to meet your obligations while also expressing your unique perspective."
capricorn,2012-02-09,"You might be worried about keeping your feelings to yourself today, especially if you have something wild or unconventional in your background that others don't know anything about. However, your fears may be unwarranted; it's time to risk judgment and share your story with someone you trust. Once you start talking, your resistance could transform into giddy exhilaration. Opening a door to vulnerability can be scary at first, but now it's worth taking the chance."
aquarius,2012-02-09,"An unexpected interaction with a co-worker or close friend can rattle your nerves today because you are surprised where the conversation goes. Thankfully, this isn't about getting bad news; it's more about having your basic assumptions questioned. Don't waste energy holding on to an old or useless position; instead, imagine the freedom that a new perspective might bring. Do what you do best: embrace innovation and look to the future with an open mind."
pisces,2012-02-09,"You want to do something today that's totally out of the ordinary, and acquiring something beautiful might bring the emotional satisfaction you seek. The possibilities are exciting, but it's wise to exercise some caution or you might spend too much money on an item you don't really need. However, if you can rein in your impulses, you could find a real bargain on a work of art that will make you smile for a long time to come."
aries,2012-02-10,"Relationship dynamics can be tricky today as you try to establish new boundaries with a friend or workmate. You may feel as if you're losing ground as you rehash issues that you thought were already resolved. However, whether or not you've actually been here before, it's time now to discuss your goals with someone you respect and figure out the role that others will play on your journey. It may take time, but an honest dialogue will lead to progress."
taurus,2012-02-10,"You may feel isolated today as you go about your work. Your concern for others is admirable, but putting too much attention on everyone else can create a separation between your head and your heart. Your co-workers won't be able to make meaningful connections with you if you're not in touch with your own needs. Taking some personal time enables you to re-establish your center and helps you to bridge the gap with others."
gemini,2012-02-10,"You might seem irritable today but that's just because you want something your way and you don't think it's going to happen. Your goals seem elusive now, putting you in a serious frame of mind. It's challenging to be witty if you're preoccupied with significant issues, yet your contemplative mood leads to a positive outcome if you are willing to stick with the process. Finding a fast fix isn't likely; acknowledge your uneasiness and concentrate on long-term solutions, instead."
cancer,2012-02-10,"You don't have a lot of patience today, especially if someone who is supposed to be an ally is giving you a hard time. But even if you don't always receive unconditional support from your associates, it's not too much to expect them to be kind. Don't just go off and sulk if a friend hurts your feelings as you will only widen the gulf between you. Taking a chance by honestly expressing your feelings can clear the path to understanding and healing."
leo,2012-02-10,"You may get a song and dance instead of payment today if someone owes you money. Your friend or partner might withhold affection if relationship issues are creating stress. Either way, you're not happy about having to wait for what you want. Unfortunately, you will just make matters worse if you press your position. However, you may be pleasantly surprised at how quickly everything changes if you can simply state your case and let it go."
virgo,2012-02-10,"You may not be happy about your situation at work today, but you can still be very productive once you accept what you cannot change. You're probably not feeling very enthusiastic about your job or, perhaps, you're insecure about a current relationship. Thankfully, this is a temporary condition, so take the medicine, learn the lesson from the situation and then move on. One day you'll discover the silver lining to today's clouds."
libra,2012-02-10,"This may be a stressful day because the Moon in socially astute Libra opposes independent Uranus and needy Venus. You are in the middle of an emotional tug-of-war now, and you won't likely get what you want, no matter which side wins. Although the Moon returns to your sign today, it's hard to relax and let your feelings come to the surface. Self-doubt is your enemy, but asking tough questions can prompt further exploration of your heart."
scorpio,2012-02-10,"Although the notion of love may sound thrilling now, it might not work out as well as it does in your dreams. You don't want anyone to know that you're hiding secrets in your emotional fortress because you are enjoying the peace and quiet and prefer no interruptions. Nevertheless, you have an important lesson to learn from your spiritual pursuit. Ultimately, contemplation prepares you for what comes next."
sagittarius,2012-02-10,"Even if you're very upbeat today, you don't seem able to get a handle on what's directly ahead. It's especially challenging if your friends appear to resist your progress instead of encouraging you along. Keep in mind that their real motivation may be to help you get your life together. Listening to the advice you receive now can be just what you need to get your plans back on track."
capricorn,2012-02-10,"You may have a difficult time today if you don't have a clear sense of what to do. Naturally, you want answers as quickly as possible, but they are not necessarily forthcoming. Fortunately, patience is your special friend now, enabling you to create an effective strategy rather than reacting impulsively to achieve your ambitions. Success can be yours if you're willing to wait a while longer."
aquarius,2012-02-10,"The Moon's shift into your 9th House of Adventure can stimulate a lot of dreaming, but her opposition to unpredictable Uranus adds uncertainty. You may not know the best way to make your fantasies real, even if your thinking is sharp now. If you can't find what you are currently seeking, remember not to panic. There's no reason to settle for less than what you need. Don't compromise, even if you're tempted. Good things come to those who wait."
pisces,2012-02-10,"You are enamored with the lovely magic that comes from your fantasies now, but your current objectivity may have you rethinking your relationship goals. It's not enough to experience mutual pleasure; you'll feel empty unless you can share spiritual pursuits, too. Honoring your values, even when they're different from your partner's, might add stress to an otherwise pleasant situation. However, being true to yourself is essential to creating the life you want."
aries,2012-02-11,"You have had something important on your mind for a few days and may feel as if you can't put off addressing it any longer. But be careful about taking the easy way out and stopping short of making your point. The Moon's visit to your 7th House of Companions tempts you to be more concerned about someone else's feelings than you are about your own. Instead of pushing for resolution, just make sure that you say what needs to be said as clearly as possible."
taurus,2012-02-11,"It may feel as if your interactions with others are beyond your control today. Something odd is happening and you cannot quite put your finger on it. The more you try to focus on specific issues, the less certain things become. Although there could be unknown factors influencing your day, don't give up. Your positive attitude is still enough to sway circumstances in your favor."
gemini,2012-02-11,"A playful interaction could turn tricky today, especially if everyone tries to hold on to his or her position without being open to negotiation. A discussion that appears to be heading somewhere productive will quickly bog down as soon as you think that your perspective is the best one. However, when you accept that individuals can have differing points of view, your resistance will begin to fade. Entertain the potential of each alternative instead of worrying about what might go wrong."
cancer,2012-02-11,"You're able to appear even-tempered today, even if your feelings are very intense. A power struggle at home could generate an emotional tidal wave, yet you might not let on how much you're stressing out. Projecting objectivity is a sensible strategy that could ultimately get you what you want. But letting go of your attachment to any one outcome is even better because then you won't have to hide your feelings when all is said and done."
leo,2012-02-11,"It's tempting to go along with other people's plans today even if you don't think they are perfect. You're more easygoing now and are willing to make allowances for someone else's shortcomings. However, it's not wise to just say yes to everyone. It's wonderful to support your friends by getting involved in their projects as long as you don't set aside your own goals along the way."
virgo,2012-02-11,"You might think that a straightforward approach to your chores makes the most sense, but today your intensity could be bothersome to those around you. You're quick to turn a complex set of tasks into a concrete plan that makes things simple. Nevertheless, you're still likely to cause trouble now by stepping on someone's toes as you proceed. Being efficient is a worthy goal, but it isn't worth the risk of upsetting friends and family."
libra,2012-02-11,"You may sound more easygoing today than you actually feel. Someone might even believe you're so ambivalent that you can't make a simple choice. However, the gracious Libra Moon gives you the wisdom to go along with others for the sake of establishing a stronger bond. You're prepared to express your opinions once you're comfortable with the changing situation. Instead of getting caught up in an unimportant squabble, you'll have a better chance of getting your way if you only speak up when it really matters."
scorpio,2012-02-11,"You might feel as if a window of opportunity is closing today, yet you're not quite ready to make the leap. Although you're usually capable of asserting your will when necessary, today you're reticent to express what you need. Fortunately, an encouraging friend may provide a spark of encouragement that enables you to move past your own resistance and reach for the stars."
sagittarius,2012-02-11,"Yesterday's uncertainty gives way to a new wave of confidence today that is bolstered by your friends. Instead of struggling to justify your choices now, all you need to do is show up and others seem to approve. The positive feedback may seem puzzling at first, but don't waste energy wondering what's going on. Instead, be grateful for your support network and focus on your plans for the future."
capricorn,2012-02-11,"You have the strategic objectivity of a master chess player today, which can be very useful when making plans. In fact, you have an excellent chance of getting what you want. Although your cool logic may be appropriate at work, it could seem cold and unfeeling to family members or friends. There is another side to success; taking time to connect heart-to-heart with those you love brings satisfaction now that's beyond measure."
aquarius,2012-02-11,"It's as if you're being lifted above the humdrum worries of the world as your imagination soars. But you may be hesitant to let go of your earthy attachment because you're afraid that you might not be able to return to ground level. Nevertheless, it's senseless to worry about being practical today; your responsibilities will still be there tomorrow. In the meantime, explore the amazing possibilities that lay dormant in your dreams."
pisces,2012-02-11,"Something is shifting in your world and it's hard to put your finger on exactly what it is. On one hand, your dreams seem more vibrant as they put you in touch with the supernatural realm. On the other hand, they also seem more real than ever. Don't worry; your common sense will keep your feet on the ground now even when your thoughts drift off into space."
aries,2012-02-12,"You get along well with others today because you're willing to compromise, but you can become a tough opponent if others push you too far. Standing up to someone who is overly critical is worth the effort, but be careful that you don't escalate a minor issue into a major battle. Nevertheless, it's useful to bring your feelings out in the open as long as you do so without malice. Engaging in a profound discussion about those things that truly matter can deepen an important relationship."
taurus,2012-02-12,"Allies who appear to be supportive of your work may not be as helpful as you prefer today. In fact, throughout the day their actions could be very different from their words. However, you tend to oversimplify things, and you might mistake their constructive criticism for resistance. Assuming that others really do have your best interest at heart enables you to remain open to what they have to say."
gemini,2012-02-12,"You think you know the best way to finish your chores today, but you could frivolously fritter away your time. Instead of listening to the feedback you receive from friends, you're likely to continue with your strategy just to make your point. But it's not worth taking things too far; don't resist changing your methods if it becomes obvious that you're not making enough progress. There's nothing wrong with shifting your approach if it makes sense."
cancer,2012-02-12,"You may be attracted to an emotional drama today because the expression of feelings resonates with something buried very deep inside you. You're reminded of an early childhood experience that has relevance to the present moment. But don't get lost in nostalgia; what happened previously is not as important as what's going on right now. Fortunately, the current intensity will settle down as your memories widen your perspective."
leo,2012-02-12,"Everything seems to be going along fine, but family dynamics can turn problematic today. You might feel as if you've been here before, and you're growing tired of being pushed into a corner. This time you're ready to stand your ground. Thankfully, your unflappable determination won't let you down now. Once you make up your mind to get to the bottom of a difficult situation, you could be pleasantly surprised with your quick results."
virgo,2012-02-12,"Other people may be acting evasively today, but your persistence enables you to get to the truth and convince them to commit or move on. You don't want to pressure anyone into doing what you want, but the power of your words can have a very persuasive effect now. Fortunately, you don't need anyone to give you a lot of details; all you really want is for everyone to be honest."
libra,2012-02-12,"A close relationship may be a bit stressed these days, yet your innate desire to re-establish equilibrium can come to the rescue. You have a wonderful knack for making everything seem okay and you're ready to apply your diplomatic skills to repair hurt feelings. However, you might expect something in return and could begin to withdraw your love later in the day if you don't see results. But don't just assume that others know what you want; state your expectations clearly and then let them go."
scorpio,2012-02-12,"If you have isolated yourself by keeping a secret, the Moon's return to your sign today enables you say what's on your mind, even if a part of you still wants to stay silent and invisible. Unfortunately, you can't have it both ways. If you've retreated too far, it's harder to express yourself, even if you know that you're safe. Nevertheless, showing your vulnerability ultimately allows others to be more supportive of your dreams."
sagittarius,2012-02-12,"Social activities are fun, but you may grow bored with shallow communication today. Fortunately, this is a great day for spiritual renewal and your beliefs can guide you through a complex situation. You could even remember something from your past that deepens your convictions. However, you aren't required to share your inner experience with anyone now; there's no need to explain where your inspiration comes from. Simply aim the arrow of your intentions high without settling for less."
capricorn,2012-02-12,"You may have big plans for today as you seek ways to stand out in your community. But your need for personal success becomes less important than your desire to be a part of a group of like-minded people. However, it's hard to suppress your drive; even a social event seems like an opportunity for networking instead of a chance to just enjoy your friends. Remember, you can get carried away with your ambitions. Sometimes a day of rest is just what the doctor ordered."
aquarius,2012-02-12,"You're not willing to let someone else take control because you are sure that your plan will work just fine. It may seem as if you want your way because your ego is involved, but it's not likely that you're seeking any recognition for your contribution. Fortunately, if you truly want what's best for everyone involved, things should turn out OK no matter who runs the show."
pisces,2012-02-12,"Other people might think that your compassion weakens your resolve, but it's actually the source of your strength now. You are motivated by good intentions, yet it's your empathic ability to feel someone else's emotions that enables you to be an effective healer. Don't get sidetracked by anyone's fears today; trust your intuition, for it will lead you in the right direction."
aries,2012-02-13,"You want more out of life now, and are willing to do whatever is necessary to get it. Luckily, your perceptions are keen and you're able to manage your time better than usual today. Don't waste time talking about your plans. The early bird gets the worm; make sure you know where you're heading and get started before the day slips away."
taurus,2012-02-13,"You're not sure why other people are making things so complicated today. It's easier for you to function when you can concentrate on your work, tempting you to avoid someone's emotional melodrama. You may not have a lot to say now, but you still can find the right words to explain why you need to withdraw from social interaction without offending those you love."
gemini,2012-02-13,"Your key planet Mercury is stabilized by authoritative Saturn today, enabling you to take charge of a situation, even if things seem to be running out of control. It's not just that your words carry more weight; it's that you are able to quickly grasp the current complexities, make a plan and organize others to do their part. Fortunately, your practical approach enables your coworkers to trust you. Although getting the job done is important, don't close off your creativity from the magic of your imagination."
cancer,2012-02-13,"You would be a happy camper if you could stay at home today, but, thankfully, you'll feel better once you're out the door. In fact, you might be highly productive if you're willing to temporarily set aside your need for your own space. Don't worry; you'll have some private time this evening to indulge in your fantasies. Taking care of business first gives you a sense of accomplishment, enabling you to enjoy yourself even more later on."
leo,2012-02-13,"It's time to set aside your playful ways, put away the crayons and take yourself seriously today. You may not have your feet as firmly planted on the ground tomorrow, so you would be wise to take advantage of your pragmatic attitude while it lasts. Set a concrete goal and then focus everything you have on turning it into reality. Encountering an obstacle doesn't mean you're doing anything wrong; you just need to work smarter now, not harder."
virgo,2012-02-13,"Although you may have many things to do now, it's important to set priorities and eliminate all but the most essential tasks. Thankfully, you receive sensible assistance from Saturn's stabilizing trine to your ruling planet Mercury, enabling you to sort through the noise and hone in on the critical pieces of the puzzle. You don't have to finish everything today; once you've figured out what's important, the rest will easily fall into place."
libra,2012-02-13,"You may have stepped out of line recently or had to deal with someone letting you down. Either way, it's time to get to work and put things back together today, with or without help from anyone else. You're not interested in achieving lofty goals now; accomplishing something that has a direct impact on your life is more important. It's better to take a small step in the right direction than dreaming about a destination that's out of reach."
scorpio,2012-02-13,"Others would be wise to leave you alone today, unless they have something constructive to offer that's directly related to what you're doing. But you probably won't take the time to inform anyone of your plans because that would only disperse your energy. Relentless concentration is your greatest strength now; choose your goals wisely and then do whatever is necessary to reach them."
sagittarius,2012-02-13,"A well-meaning colleague may ask you what's wrong today because he or she thinks you're acting out of character. Although you might not express the warmth that people expect from you, it's just because you're occupied with important matters. You can tell that there's a narrow margin for error now and your disinterest in trivial pursuits stems from your acute desire to do everything correctly. Follow your instincts and you'll be back to your regular self tomorrow."
capricorn,2012-02-13,"Your key planet Saturn is activated by intelligent Mercury today, giving you a mind like a steel trap. Sloppy thinking won't survive your intense analysis now. Although the upside of thinking logically is your ability to avoid making errors in judgment, you could unintentionally come across harsh in your delivery. Just remember that others might not share your ambition, so they may draw different conclusions from the same data. Honoring every point of view as valid is the best way to keep the peace."
aquarius,2012-02-13,"You may not be interested in abstract thinking today, even if you usually like to push the edges of the intellectual envelope. Instead of getting lost in lofty concepts, you want to bring every idea back to the present moment with the question, ""How can this be applied?"" Fortunately, your current penchant for practicality is great for making concrete plans that can be executed later on. Don't worry about what anyone thinks of your approach. Time will prove you right."
pisces,2012-02-13,"You are looking forward to indulging your fantasies by watching a movie, listening to music or just chilling out. However, impatience can get the best of you today because you have responsibilities to fulfill before you're allowed to escape. Accepting the order of things graciously can make the difference between happiness and frustration. A rational and methodical approach to your work early in the day ensures that you will be able to enjoy yourself later on."
aries,2012-02-14,"Pay extra attention to your thoughts today because nearly anything you can visualize has the possibility of actually coming true. Although this sounds like good news, it's tempting to squander your luck on transient pleasures. Instead of seeking satisfaction through the senses, elevate your goals by making someone you love the beneficiary of your dreams."
taurus,2012-02-14,"Think twice about what you intend to share with your friends because they are listening carefully to everything you say today. You may not realize how important your words are now, but your ideas can be quite inspiring. Being practical need not be your main concern; it's not your job to lead by example. Your current role is to assist others by dreaming out loud. If you take a risk and reach further, a loved one might just follow."
gemini,2012-02-14,"It's not easy for you to be confined by your job especially since you're feeling very creative now. Even if you can focus your mind for short periods of time, it's tough staying on a straight and narrow path. Follow your thoughts as they roam through your imagination, but don't be too concerned if you're not very productive in your work. It's more important to entertain a variety of possibilities today than it is to pick one route and stick to it."
cancer,2012-02-14,"You may be pleased at how creative you can be if you simply give yourself time to daydream. You're enchanted by the messages you are receiving from the depths of your own subconscious now, but it can be confusing if the veil between reality and fantasy grows too thin. Don't worry; your intuition won't let you down if you're willing to take a magic carpet ride without worrying about your destination."
leo,2012-02-14,"It's hard to tell whether you're really growing more intimate with someone special or if the whole thing is a figment of your imagination. Although the dividing line between truth and illusion is fuzzy now, you still want to know what's going on. However, it may not be a smart idea to push too deep too fast or you could upset the current magic. Instead, enjoy yourself in the present moment because your positive attitude today improves things for tomorrow."
virgo,2012-02-14,"You may feel as if everyone is living in a dream world except for you as your key planet Mercury contacts elusive Neptune in your 7th House of Partners. However, even if you believe that someone is misleading you today, it's important to consider your contribution to encouraging the fantasy. Try to find a deeper lesson in this experience rather than worrying about what might go wrong. When you understand the recurring patterns in your life, you'll be free from falling victim to your own emotional trap."
libra,2012-02-14,"You may have an unrealistic view of yourself today, especially if you're experiencing any physical symptoms that elude diagnosis. You are hypersensitive now, enabling subtle stresses in a relationship to manifest as inflammation or pain. Don't hide the discomfort; find its source and eliminate it, instead. Once you've acknowledged the reality of the situation, it will be easier to relax and connect with someone on a more romantic level."
scorpio,2012-02-14,"You may set yourself up for disappointment by idealizing love and romance. It's all too easy to be blinded by the bright light of possibilities and lose touch with what's actually occurring. However, if you're willing to face the truth, your special gift is your natural ability to see beauty where someone else would get distracted by the imperfections. Just acknowledging the potential now could be sufficient to make something magical happen."
sagittarius,2012-02-14,"You may be viewing a family situation through rose-colored glasses, making it nearly impossible to know what's truly going on. It's difficult to separate the current circumstances from a similar event in the past, but drawing distinctions is critical today. You can improve your outlook on the day by contrasting the differences between then and now. Recognizing the truth is the first step toward resolution."
capricorn,2012-02-14,"You can avoid trouble today by going out of your way to honor your commitments. Although it's not your usual pattern, you might mix up an appointment or forget to confirm a date. But even the simplest misunderstanding could mess up your day, so take time to manage your schedule before it runs away from you. Fortunately, once you've handled the more mundane aspects of your life, you'll be able to loosen up and enjoy the company of someone special."
aquarius,2012-02-14,"An error in your personal finances could create a problem today, and avoiding the situation will just make it worse. Fortunately, a simple solution is possible if you're willing to think outside of the box. But don't hide your head in the sand; directly facing the issue is your smartest course of action, whether it's a judgment error or just an unexpected expense. Clean up your mistake before it turns into a mess."
pisces,2012-02-14,"You can spend the entire day in Fantasyland as trickster Mercury's hook-up with your key planet Neptune warps your perceptions. Your logic isn't limited by reality now; instead your thinking is colored by your subconscious desires. Although this surreal feeling can make it harder to wend your way through the real world, it also gives you the ability to charm others with your words. Use today's magic to spread love rather than confusion."
aries,2012-02-15,"You make everything look easy on the surface, but you're probably having a tough time expressing your needs today, especially if you cannot even acknowledge them to yourself. In fact, your emotional denial could turn an easygoing relationship into a tangle of complications. Luckily, your positive attitude helps you work through a difficult situation if you're willing to be vulnerable and explore your feelings with someone you trust."
taurus,2012-02-15,"Your ruling planet Venus raises concerns today as she crosses paths with uncompromising Pluto. Your unwavering determination is usually a strength, but stubborn resistance to an obvious truth could escalate a little misunderstanding into a major conflict. Ultimately the choice is yours. You can avoid an unpleasant situation if you demonstrate your flexibility by cooperating with others."
gemini,2012-02-15,"The sheer power of your reactions makes you uncomfortable today, and to complicate matters, you might not understand why you're so agitated now. However, pretending that nothing's bothering you isn't the best way to handle interpersonal dynamics because your denial strengthens your emotions rather than dissipating them. Acknowledging your anxiety is a smarter strategy as long as you don't attempt to control the conversation. Talking about your discomfort with a supportive friend will help to settle your nerves."
cancer,2012-02-15,"It's not easy for you to remain true to your feelings, especially if someone tries to make you moderate your position. Remaining open to a co-worker's point of view is an admirable goal, but not at the risk of denying your own needs. Although it isn't much fun if your opinions differ from another person's, avoiding conflict now comes with a cost. Don't overstate your cause; however, it pays to be very clear about what you want right from the start."
leo,2012-02-15,"A relationship at work becomes more complicated today because it's hard to maintain objectivity when your emotions are involved. You might think that the awkwardness will pass quickly, but there isn't a simple solution to the current situation. Nevertheless, minimizing your desires won't work; you need to express them even if it temporarily upsets the applecart. Don't try to take the easy way out. A small change of perspective is better than none at all."
virgo,2012-02-15,"You may struggle to do the right thing in a relationship today, even if you don't understand your partner's position. As hard as you listen to each and every word, you still might not be able to grasp the meaning of what's being said. Unfortunately, logic won't help now; you're better off responding from your heart without wasting time over-analyzing your feelings."
libra,2012-02-15,"Someone's behavior may seem very abrupt today, stirring up feelings of abandonment. But your sense of rejection might be more connected to your past than to the current reality. It's possible that others are as emotionally overwhelmed as you are and they are frustrated because they cannot express what's going on. Words should not be trusted to communicate what's important now; however, actions will clearly tell your story."
scorpio,2012-02-15,"Vulnerable Venus squares ruthless Pluto today, challenging you to face feelings that are buried in the depths of your subconscious. Your reactions may be darker and more intense than what anyone prefers, but it isn't your responsibility to make others comfortable by hiding your needs. Express your emotions, but do it kindly without blaming anyone else. You can always take the high road while still remaining true to your inner experience."
sagittarius,2012-02-15,"The Moon's visit to your sign makes it tougher to separate your personal needs from a situation that demands objectivity. You might not even realize that your feelings are coloring your perceptions. But you can tell that interactions with others are complicated by powerful emotions that make calm conversation difficult. Everything seems more stressful now, yet diving into the complexities will get you closer to the truth and teach you something important about yourself in the process."
capricorn,2012-02-15,"There doesn't seem to be a straightforward path to your goals today. Nevertheless, you have a specific agenda and aren't interested in changing it to make others feel more secure. But your eagerness to accomplish something special now can prompt you to overlook what someone else wants. Make time to give those you love your shoulder to lean on in their time of need."
aquarius,2012-02-15,"You have something that's been on your mind recently and this is a good day to begin the conversation. Although you're ready to talk about a deeply rooted emotional problem, your casual style could make it sound less important than it really is. Be wise and slow down to sink into your feelings now. You may be resistant at first, but everyone will feel lighter once the air has been cleared of unspoken agendas."
pisces,2012-02-15,"You're at your wit's end because each time you share your feelings today, the words slip away before you finish expressing what's on your mind. Ironically, you know exactly what you want to say until you open your mouth. But even if you believe that you're falling short of an adequate explanation, don't retreat until you've given it your absolute best shot. Initiating a conversation about your emotions is enough for now; you can fill in more details as times goes on."
aries,2012-02-16,"Although this is a great day to catch up on unfinished business, completing any one task might take a lot longer than you expect. Instead of racing ahead on a new project today, you would be wiser to think about your strategy for the weeks ahead without initiating action. Just remember that it's crucial to remain realistic in your expectations. Scale back your ambitions now to make solid progress."
taurus,2012-02-16,"You might think that you recently missed an awesome opportunity, but now you have another chance to make your dreams come true. You're inspired to stretch a bit further than normal today, and, luckily, you could actually reach your goal. However, it's a mistake to inflate your hopes so much that you cannot possibly fulfill your fantasies. Keeping your goals down to earth prevents you from having to face disappointment later on."
gemini,2012-02-16,"You may be in for a treat today, even if you have lowered your expectations because everything is taking longer than it should. Be ready to receive good news or an invitation to do something out of the ordinary. You might grow so intrigued that you're willing to take a detour from your scheduled agenda. Just don't jump into something new too quickly. You may be pleasantly surprised at how things unfold if you act with caution and an open mind."
cancer,2012-02-16,"You are eager to wrap your mind around the big picture today, making you less interested in untangling the details of a project. Unfortunately, practical responsibilities may prevent you from entertaining idle philosophical speculation. Each time you're ready to drift off, someone reminds you about your next task, making it nearly impossible to ignore your obligations. Finish your work and save your daydreaming for another day."
leo,2012-02-16,"You have big plans at work now, but your self-confidence may be overstated with several aspects to pompous Jupiter in your 10th House of Public Status. Instead of spending your time imagining all the ways you could express yourself creatively on the job, just take care of your current obligations. No one will support your dreams if you don't impress them by doing what's expected of you first. Attending to your less-than-glamorous chores today could open the door to something special when the right moment arrives."
virgo,2012-02-16,"You may feel uncomfortable today when you realize no one is holding you back any longer. Ironically, it was reassuring when there were reasons to maintain the status quo. But now it can be disconcerting if you're free to explore new avenues of partnerships. Don't be afraid to consider alternative paths at work, either. In order to define your true limits, it may be necessary to consider taking a calculated risk. The results should be positive as long as you have a workable plan in place."
libra,2012-02-16,"You are in an awkward position today because you're heading into a serious phase, yet you're not quite ready to settle down. You would prefer to enjoy the lighter moments while you still can, but avoiding your work now makes it harder to partake in the fun later on. Luckily, you understand how to balance the extremes. Just remember that remaining responsible is the key to unlocking the gates to the playground."
scorpio,2012-02-16,"Instead of getting sidetracked by what may happen in your future, concentrate on those things that are on your plate right now. Unfortunately, it's difficult to ignore the larger view today, yet attempts to map out the months ahead will only lead to frustration. Have faith and trust that your chances of reaching your goals are better if you can limit your thinking and focus your efforts strictly on the present moment."
sagittarius,2012-02-16,"You might believe that your time is running out, which can provoke you to take an unnecessary risk. You may be concerned that anything you do now is too little or too late. Although your fears could be unfounded, consciously moving in the right direction is a smart idea while the Moon is still in your sign. You would be wise to begin your new journey today and build on your current actions over the weeks ahead."
capricorn,2012-02-16,"You are probably in a positive mood, but as you think about your future you can see warning signs for what might happen next week. Although you're tempted to lose yourself in dreams today, there's no time to waste. Do anything you can to get a head start on the unavoidable hard work in front of you. The more you accomplish now, the easier it will be tomorrow."
aquarius,2012-02-16,"You may believe that nearly anything is possible now because you're not likely to acknowledge your limitations. On the plus side, this is exciting territory because your positive attitude could transform an impossible task into one that can be done. However, it's not wise to waste your energy trying to prove your superiority. Ask for what you want and work toward your goals, but give yourself extra time to turn your hopes into reality."
pisces,2012-02-16,"Your career objectives may be quite admirable, but something crucial might be missing from your current strategy. You're so optimistic now that you could jump to a wrong conclusion or misinterpret a message that you receive. Staying open to change is a good idea today, but doggedly sticking to your plan may not be so smart. Fortunately, you have more time than you realize to figure things out. Hopefully, you should have a clearer picture of what to do tomorrow."
aries,2012-02-17,"It's time to stop wasting your energy by expressing each and every idea you have out loud. Although your intentions may be good, it's not useful to involve others in your process, especially if they aren't supportive of your plan. Instead of furthering your agenda, you might be dragged into defending it. Re-evaluate your goals and then quietly work toward them instead of worrying about what you should have done earlier in the day."
taurus,2012-02-17,"It won't be easy for anyone to change your mind today once you've chosen your path. Unfortunately, a logical appeal won't work any better than an emotional one. However, you would be wise to keep an open mind because an ally may have information for you that's key to altering your perspective. You could have a fantastic plan, but there might be someone who knows more than you. Listening to others is a smart idea because there's always room for improvement."
gemini,2012-02-17,"Although you may be convinced that you need to do your own thing today, it won't hurt to try to meet other people's expectations. Don't waste too much energy resisting someone else's agenda, even if your natural inclination is to stay uncommitted. It's currently more important to be practical than to remain independent. Thankfully, doing what's best is easy now because your judgment is stabilized by your common sense."
cancer,2012-02-17,"The Moon's visit to your 7th House of Partners highlights your relationships today. But rather than responding to the current circumstances based on your needs, it's smarter to take other people's desires into consideration, too. Even if it's difficult to understand another person's point of view, compromise is a better choice now than just going off on your own."
leo,2012-02-17,"You know what you need to do at work today, although it might seem overwhelming at first. It's a surprise when you realize that your initial plans may be different from what's actually required. Nevertheless, avoiding your basic responsibilities is not a viable option. You still must fulfill your obligations sooner or later, so get them out of the way as quickly as possible to leave time for yourself later on."
virgo,2012-02-17,"Surprisingly, your approach to your job isn't currently based on being efficient or even completing what you start. Instead, you are thinking about what makes you happy. Even if you're usually satisfied with narrowing your focus to complete your work, you are more effective if you're also having fun now. Ironically, being too serious can actually be counterproductive today. Listen to your heart and you might learn something new."
libra,2012-02-17,"Domestic responsibilities could be very demanding today, especially if someone's expectations are different from what you're willing to do. However, you might not be able to escape your current obligations, so there's no point in resisting the inevitable. Fortunately, you won't have to deny your desire for pleasure; instead, just delay the good times until you have taken care of your personal business."
scorpio,2012-02-17,"Today's hectic schedule might not give you time for idle daydreaming. You're likely to be drawn into an intense emotional drama, even if you wish that you could have more unstructured time for contemplation. Being with others may feel like a real challenge now, but you can learn a lot by processing your feelings through constructive dialogue with a close friend or trusted associate."
sagittarius,2012-02-17,"You might have to stand up to a powerful adversary today because your plan is contrary to the accepted one. Unfortunately, your friends or co-workers may be too quick to take the easy way out of a difficult situation. However, they don't understand how stubborn you can be now as you adhere to your values over convenience. Although your unwavering idealism is admirable, you can take things too far. Don't be so obstinate that you cannot see the goals you already have in common."
capricorn,2012-02-17,"The Moon's return to your ambitious sign can prompt you to turn an easy task into a big project without realizing what happened. You might get so carried away with accomplishing your goals that you could lose track of your pragmatism and make a bad decision. Don't create extra work for yourself by committing to an unrealistic strategy; maintain your practical approach to success, instead."
aquarius,2012-02-17,"Your daydreams can seem as if they came right out of a science fiction movie and might have no basis in reality. However, it's just as likely that your fantasies reveal something special about your future because they're inspired by your everyday experiences. Instead of trying to control your thoughts, patiently allow them to wander. Be flexible; an easygoing approach enables you to find undiscovered treasures within your subconscious mind."
pisces,2012-02-17,"You could be so confident about what happens next that you staunchly defend your plans today. You may think you have to harden your position if other people are overly aggressive. The thought of facing an uncertain future is scary, but it's better than sticking to a story that's wrong. If you realize that you've jumped to an incorrect conclusion, acknowledge your mistake right away. Don't avoid the facts just because you fear the truth may be inconvenient."
aries,2012-02-18,"You may feel sluggish in the morning which creates more delays on a project. You might feel a lack of motivation if everything doesn't go your way now, but this can be a test to determine if you're able to overcome your discouragement. Fortunately, you can gain momentum throughout the day. Don't quit too soon; work extra hard to achieve your dreams."
taurus,2012-02-18,"Today could prove to be quite gratifying as long as you set realistic expectations. If you have reached too far, you might need to scale back your plans, especially if it feels as if time is running out. Luckily, there shouldn't be any significant surprises so you can simply follow your agenda. You know exactly what you must do to be successful, so get started before you waste any more time."
gemini,2012-02-18,"You think it's better to withhold your true intentions today because you're worried that others won't give you the support you need if they know what you're really doing. However, there aren't any valid reasons to keep a secret now because everything will find its way out into the open, anyhow. Ask for help and you'll reach your goals in a timely manner."
cancer,2012-02-18,"You might not get exactly what you want now, but your ultimate fate is still undecided. What happens next will be determined by your response to your disappointment. Complaining isn't useful; it will only move you further away from satisfaction. However, accepting each current moment without harshly judging anyone can free you to make a significant breakthrough today. Don't get stuck in a previous failure; instead, look forward with confidence."
leo,2012-02-18,"You might believe that you let someone down now, but you're probably judging yourself without even having all the facts. Imagine what you are able to do immediately, instead of worrying about what you should have already done. It's time to set your old dreams aside and create meaningful new ones that are built on a solid foundation, rather than on shifting sands. Others will admire your courage if you do the right thing and follow your heart."
virgo,2012-02-18,"It's often easier to be open and honest when there's something to criticize, rather than when everything is cruising along. However, your goals become more attainable if you get down to business and handle your chores one at a time. Don't worry about what anyone else thinks; just continue to remove the barriers to your own success; actions speak louder than words."
libra,2012-02-18,"Even if pleasure seems elusive today, you can still see the big difference that your attitude makes as you process your frustration. It's very rewarding when you commit to live out your dreams in the real world, but you'll need to work harder than you imagined in order to make much progress at all. What happens is up to you; the power of your positive thinking enables you to manifest your vision."
scorpio,2012-02-18,"You have a very realistic approach to domestic issues now, and it will take a lot of convincing to get you to change your view. Although you're not likely to shift your opinion today, you're able to tell the difference between what you want and what you currently have. Balancing reality and fantasy inspires you to make the best of both worlds."
sagittarius,2012-02-18,"You would like to step off the emotional roller-coaster today, but ending your ride prematurely isn't wise because your life is about to get a lot less difficult. Holding on through all the ups and downs earns you success now as things begin to smooth out. But if you miss all the excitement, just remind yourself that it's only a distraction. Your perseverance goes a long way to bringing you what you want."
capricorn,2012-02-18,"Your ruling planet Saturn is in the spotlight now as it changes from being a harsh naysayer to a caring taskmaster. Thankfully, tough love is exactly what you need now, yet it will soften into support once you demonstrate your willingness to work diligently to make your dreams come true. However, stern Saturn will ignore anything less than a total commitment, so focus on the tasks at hand and get started as soon as possible."
aquarius,2012-02-18,"It may feel as if you're running out of time. If you haven't delivered on a promise, someone might seem to be retreating on an emotional level today. However, it's not too late to turn the tables in your favor. Instead of finding fault with others now, take responsibility for your role in the situation. Working to rebuild trust is wiser than continuing to test the boundaries of a relationship."
pisces,2012-02-18,"Your illusions have run up against reality and you don't know what to think now that you have seen the truth. You're no longer blindly optimistic, but you would be wise to make sure you don't become cynical. Ultimately, a middle-of-the-road approach is best when managing your daily routine. But don't get lost in worries about the future. Taking one step at a time is the way to realize your dreams."
aries,2012-02-19,"Although you're not ready to relinquish your attachment to the excitement of an upcoming experience, you still long for a more easygoing day. You might not even see the irony of being attracted to the adrenaline rush of the unknown while also wanting to take a gentler approach to life. Don't bother explaining your motives; others won't likely understand you now. Creating balance enables you to make the best possible choices today."
taurus,2012-02-19,"You have your work cut out for you today, but you might not be sure how your present activities fit into your long-term goals. It's easy to believe that things will go your way, but it's challenging to make a plan when your sense of the future is so fuzzy. Fortunately, your social life should improve if you don't try to accomplish too much on the job."
gemini,2012-02-19,"You might believe that this is a good time to reinvent your life by setting new goals because you can imagine so many alternatives today. Although your creativity may be running strong, you currently possess more self-confidence than clarity. Instead of making concrete plans, give yourself permission to dream. Don't worry about being practical now; you can turn your fantasies into action on another day."
cancer,2012-02-19,"Your desires to go on an adventure or pursue an educational program are very convincing today, but your dreams won't manifest unless you take action. Others might be critical of your ideas because they think you're being too idealistic, but their harsh judgments of your impracticality are not in your best interest. Stick to your current plans; just don't exhaust yourself by trying too hard to prove your point."
leo,2012-02-19,"It might seem as if your circumstances are changing as an opportunity for a friendship or romance becomes less practical. Thankfully, there's still a good chance to make it work, but it may not be wise to assert yourself too strongly now. Curb your impatience; instead of trying to force an issue, keep your dreams alive for the time being by imagining your relationships just the way you want them to be."
virgo,2012-02-19,It's nearly impossible to see your partner or a co-worker in a rational light now because your subjectivity is spilling on to others as the Sun joins nebulous Neptune in your 7th House of Relationships. Your intentions carry a strong emotional charge that rises from deep within your subconscious mind; you might not even realize what's motivating you today. But paying close attention to your feelings can help you gain a new perspective as long as you don't project your desires on to anyone else.
libra,2012-02-19,"The Sun joins imaginative Neptune in your 6th House of Work today, improving your attitude about your current responsibilities. Complaining about your plight won't help your cause; instead, share your vision of what things will be like once you finally finish your chores. However, talking about your plans isn't enough, so roll up your sleeves now and get busy right away. The sooner you start, the sooner you can move on."
scorpio,2012-02-19,"Sharing your romantic fantasies with someone you like isn't all that simple today, for there is much more happening than meets the eye. The idealist Sun-Neptune conjunction in your 5th House of Love and Creativity indicates that you're in for pleasurable times. However, you must be cautious because you're working with increased magnetism, enabling you to be quite persuasive. Don't get overly greedy; asking for more than you need only complicates your life."
sagittarius,2012-02-19,"You're feeling pretty good about skipping the minor details and heading for the big ideas without any additional planning. Although you're quick to grasp the general concepts, you might not have much interest for all the little things that have to be in order before your project can be successful. Don't try to micromanage today. Take a few deep breaths and allow a few more days to pass before you return to the drawing board."
capricorn,2012-02-19,"You might have to manage several small emergencies that crop up today. Fortunately, you can produce a positive effect on your immediate environment while smoothing out bumps in the road. Nevertheless, something unexpected reveals a whole new dimension to a current situation. Things are more complicated than you think. Even if you don't know all the facts now, don't be afraid to fill in the details with your imagination."
aquarius,2012-02-19,"Your natural intelligence comes in handy today with the Moon back in your sign. However, beautiful daydreams could sidetrack you, delaying your resolution of a complex problem. Don't run off in pursuit of a perfect fantasy; instead of beginning anew, improve on something you already started. Just make sure that your current work is fully aligned with your core values to achieve the best results."
pisces,2012-02-19,"Your dreams are so close you feel as if you can reach out and touch them, but it's difficult to bring your visions all the way down to earth. Although your preoccupation with your thoughts isn't obvious to others, you're spinning wheels in your mind and working overtime to analyze illogical scenarios. Ironically, once you stop the unnecessary struggling, the complexity of your current situation will resolve on its own."
aries,2012-02-20,"Your visions of the future may have been revived last month as the Sun traveled through your 11th House of Goals. However, now that the Sun is in your 12th House of Spirituality, your objectives are changing as you search for deeper meaning to the current circumstances of your life. Naturally, your aspirations still motivate you, but taking some time for yourself in the weeks ahead enables your past accomplishments to reverberate into the future without extra effort on your part."
taurus,2012-02-20,"Your progress at work was emphasized as the Sun moved through your 10th House of Career last month. Now you could grow more interested in deepening your involvement in a community or political cause as the Sun brightens your 11th House of Groups. But there is no need to take immediate action because this transit remains active for the next several weeks. Nevertheless, it is still a smart idea to start making plans today if you want your social network to expand in the near future."
gemini,2012-02-20,"Your career is in the spotlight now, even if you prefer to embark on a great adventure as the Moon visits your 9th House of Journeys. But you may be feeling pressure to make the most out of a special opportunity at work. Unfortunately, you might not feel very grounded today, and you need to become more pragmatic in order to meet your objectives. Do what's necessary to fulfill your responsibilities, but don't ignore your intuition in the process; your dreams will ultimately keep you on track."
cancer,2012-02-20,"The radiant Sun's shift into your 9th House of Big Ideas helps to jumpstart a new wave of planning. Although it could feel out of character, you're not willing to wait for your dreams to come true now. In fact, you're ready to go out and make something happen, even if it means taking a risk. But don't move too quickly; your patience is your secret weapon. Allow your imagination to run wild for a bit prior to doing anything you might later regret."
leo,2012-02-20,"The Sun has joined a pack of planets in your 8th House of Shared Resources, enabling you to be vulnerable enough to accept spiritual guidance or financial help from a caring friend. You might have a chance to make a sound investment in your future or even receive an inheritance. Knowing what you want isn't usually a problem for you; however, accepting a gift with no strings attached may not be so easy. Be sure to open the door wide if opportunity knocks."
virgo,2012-02-20,"A new partnership may be in the works or an old one could be revitalized as the Sun moves through your 7th House of Relationships for the next several weeks. Unfortunately, you might face discouragement today if you put too much emphasis on everyone else or if your expectations are unrealistic. In order to maintain a healthy perspective now, balance your dependence on others by focusing on the most immediate tasks on your plate. Reconnecting with those you love will be easier in a few days."
libra,2012-02-20,"It can be difficult to pursue an opportunity today if you already know exactly what you want. Reality may not conform to your hopes, yet things could turn out better than you expect if you remain flexible in your thinking. However, your current belief that you must do things your way could sour a perfectly good day. Fortunately, your innate willingness to meet others halfway could be just what's needed to tilt a difficult situation back in your favor."
scorpio,2012-02-20,"If you have grown too comfortable with your current living situation, it's time to consider ways to reach out beyond the security of your comfort zone. Pursuing new avenues of self-expression can bring spontaneity and fun back into your life as the willful Sun spends a month playing around in your 5th House of Creativity. Instead of staying home and dreaming about all the things you want to do, get out and start doing them now."
sagittarius,2012-02-20,"The Sun is illuminating your 4th House of Roots for the next several weeks, stimulating your personal growth through domestic activities. Instead of setting ambitious professional goals, it's time to retreat and focus on family-oriented issues. However, a bit of dreaming is in order if you want to imagine what's possible. Building a strong foundation now increases your self-confidence and empowers you to reach for your goals."
capricorn,2012-02-20,"You are working hard to stabilize your assets or increase your income with the evocative Moon visiting your 2nd House of Possessions. However, you are seeing more value now in raising your self-esteem than your bank account balance. Step out beyond your old boundaries and try new ways of interacting with others. You may have a lot to offer, but it's still up to you to take the initiative."
aquarius,2012-02-20,"You have a chance to review recent events now that the Moon is visiting your sign. Although you may have already started a new cycle, the Sun's shift into your 2nd House of Money continues to offer you opportunities throughout the next month to increase your material wealth. However, you must temper your tendency to fantasize about all the possibilities by relying on your common sense. Keep your feet on the ground if you are serious about reaching your goals."
pisces,2012-02-20,"You are at the threshold of a dream as the Sun spotlights your sign during the next few weeks. Although changes won't happen overnight, your horizons may already be expanding. But the Moon's visit to your 12th House of Secrets today reminds you that you don't have to talk about your vision for the future just yet. Wait until after tomorrow's New Moon in Pisces before risking your security to begin the next phase of your incredible journey."
aries,2012-02-21,"You may feel as if you're in an imaginative bubble and time is standing still today as the Pisces New Moon falls in your 12th House of Escapism. You know that big changes are on the way, but temporarily everything seems to be moving in slow motion. Don't ignore what's happening now because you have to finish a current project while you still have time. Once you tie up loose ends, you'll be able to move into the next phase of your life."
taurus,2012-02-21,"Today's Pisces New Moon triggers your need to be with like-minded people as it brings to life your 11th House of Friends. However, you can be so overwhelmed by your imagination now that your cohorts may think you've lost touch with reality. Thankfully, they'll begin to take you more seriously if you don't ramble on endlessly about your visions. Share your hopes, but stop talking once you've said what's on your mind."
gemini,2012-02-21,"Getting a handle on what's happening at work today can be challenging, but don't just throw your hands up in frustration and walk away. Although you might not be able to make sense out of the instructions you're given now, simply follow your intuition and take the most sensible course of action. Whatever you do, the rules are likely to be changed. Shift gears as necessary or take a whole new approach if your current methods no longer do the trick."
cancer,2012-02-21,"You may be obsessed with dreams of an exotic vacation, yet it would be a shame to waste the current opportunity without at least making a plan. At this point it really doesn't matter if you cannot afford taking time off from work or if the costs are beyond your budget. What does matter is that you actually attempt to make your fantasy come true. Your preliminary explorations won't require additional resources now, and you can always focus on the details later if you decide to embark on your escapade."
leo,2012-02-21,"You are often so self-sufficient that it may be difficult now to get the help you need. Your co-workers might be hesitant to offer assistance, even if you would appreciate a little support. Although you could be in over your head, you don't want to appear as if you're desperate. Thankfully, it isn't too late; ask for what you need, even if it means revealing your vulnerability. You don't have to be perfect; others will rally to your defense if you're willing to meet them halfway."
virgo,2012-02-21,"Everyone seems a bit unreliable today as the Pisces New Moon confuses your 7th House of Partners. You may expect one thing to occur, but something else comes out of left field. You could quickly become anxious if you are overly rigid in your approach to the day. However, being less self-critical now also enables you to loosen your judgment of others. Being flexible is a smart strategy to get you through these uncertain times."
libra,2012-02-21,"The imaginative Pisces New Moon lands in your 6th House of Habits, prompting you to start a new regimen to improve your well-being. A healthier diet and more effective exercise program usually sounds like a good idea, but you often lack the serious commitment required to make it work. Thankfully, your intentions go a long way today, and starting a new routine can have a lasting positive impact. An enduring little change makes more sense now than a big one that doesn't last."
scorpio,2012-02-21,"The magical Pisces New Moon smiles on your 5th House of Love and Creativity today. A romantic fantasy might be exactly what you need, even if you don't actually do anything about it. Yet a wonderful experience that takes place only within your imagination can still have real implications if you choose to act on your feelings now or later on. Whether you tell anyone or not, give yourself permission to feel the current attraction without worrying about where it may lead you."
sagittarius,2012-02-21,"You would be wise to keep your feelings to yourself today as the confusing Pisces New Moon lands in your 4th House of Roots. Your emotions are best left at home now; sharing your private life at work might not be the smartest move. However, don't slip into denial about what's happening. Instead of shutting yourself off from your heart, it's healthier to write in a journal or talk about your personal issues with a trusted friend."
capricorn,2012-02-21,"A close friend or family member might do something that confuses you today, but don't let this become the main focus of your day. You have important things to do and shouldn't waste time trying to figure out someone else's motives. If you're really curious, be direct and ask them what's going on. However, if satisfactory answers aren't readily forthcoming, let it go for now; you can return to the conundrum another time."
aquarius,2012-02-21,"Today's Pisces New Moon activates your 2nd House of Money, inspiring visionary ideas about increasing your income. But your thoughts won't necessarily lead to financial rewards because you might be misled by your own idealism now. Be smart and consider everything that comes to mind, but don't put all your eggs in one basket."
pisces,2012-02-21,"Today's New Moon falls in your creative sign, offering you a new lease on life. There's no limit to what you can dream up in your mind now, but there's also nothing to be gained by rushing into anything just yet. You are at the edge of an imaginative journey, but your thoughts will eventually solidify into reality. Move cautiously and consider all your options prior to focusing on any one path."
aries,2012-02-22,"Reacting impulsively often works in your favor, but today your key planet Mars can stir up more trouble than answers. Stepping back from a situation to review your options is a much smarter strategy than jumping in with your very first thought. What seems like a good idea may be more of a problem than a solution, so be wise, be patient and play it safe."
taurus,2012-02-22,"Your key planet Venus attracts you to someone who looks good or to an idea that sounds convincing, but satisfaction becomes more elusive the closer you get. Your actions might not convey your true intentions today; however, the fog that obscures the truth also stimulates your imagination. Temporarily retreating into your own thoughts may be sufficient to alleviate any misunderstanding while empowering you to successfully try again later."
gemini,2012-02-22,"Your current confusion might get you into trouble today because you can see many different paths that all lead to your goal. Unfortunately, the alternatives begin to look more interesting than your final destination. There's no reason to be overly concerned by your lack of focus now as long as you don't attempt to convince anyone that you know the way. Instead of trying to force an answer when there isn't one yet, enjoy exploring all the scenic routes until the best one becomes obvious."
cancer,2012-02-22,"You may misinterpret someone's actions today and could complicate things if you make a firm commitment based upon your incorrect assumption. Fortunately, it's easy to verify your perceptions by just asking others for a reality check. It takes courage to show your uncertainty, but no one will fault you for seeking clarification. Luckily, you can prevent problems from developing later on by taking time to correct your game plan early in the day."
leo,2012-02-22,"You receive mixed messages today from someone you love, yet you may be somewhat confused all on your own. Your idealism could get the best of you, leading to discouragement when others fall short of your expectations. Although you might be tempted to share your frustration, drawing attention to your vulnerability places you at a disadvantage. Don't turn your disappointment into a drama; maintaining a positive attitude now can turn an uncomfortable situation to your advantage."
virgo,2012-02-22,"It's challenging to stick to your agenda today because everyone seems to be making demands on your time. You may have to change your schedule as you get new information about what's expected of you. But instead of hopelessly struggling to complete all your tasks, be clear and let others know your limits. Don't give up your power by automatically saying yes. You'll come through with flying colors if you face your discomfort and say no to anything that's beyond your abilities."
libra,2012-02-22,"Your ruling planet Venus can draw you into a new partnership today, but you might end up being at odds with someone if you expect too much too soon. Although unexpressed emotions might add to the gulf between you and others, sharing your concerns will also complicate matters. It may feel as if you're in a no-win situation, but holding off a conversation for a couple of days can defuse the conflict. Continue your discussions after the intensity begins to dissipate."
scorpio,2012-02-22,"Your key planet Mars can activate unresolved social tensions today, especially as co-workers blur the boundaries and become friends. When someone acts in an irritating manner now, it's not easy for you to be quiet, even if expressing your feelings won't likely bring positive change. There's no reason to force an issue now, so restrain your impulsive temptations and return to the issue in a few days, if necessary."
sagittarius,2012-02-22,"You want to be sure that you have all your ducks in a row today so you can accomplish your objectives at work. Your frustration could run exceptionally high if you discover that you're not as prepared as you thought you were. However, you could set yourself up for failure if you reach too far now. On the other hand, there's no reason to give up as long as you exercise a bit of common sense when establishing your agenda."
capricorn,2012-02-22,"You may be pretty sure about your goals today, but faulty logic could have your desires leading you in the wrong direction. It's challenging for you to see what's actually happening now if someone or something stimulates an unfulfilled fantasy. Don't talk yourself into reacting quickly because you believe that you'll miss your chance if you wait too long. Patience is your friend; see how you feel in a day or two before doing something silly, instead."
aquarius,2012-02-22,"There's no reason to try and fake your way through a tricky situation today, because most everyone can see through your bravado and won't follow your lead. Ironically, your logic may be sounder than you realize; the actual problem might be in your lack of self-confidence. Nevertheless, your smartest strategy now is to acknowledge your uncertainty. Once you admit what you don't know, others will begin to trust you again."
pisces,2012-02-22,"Your overactive imagination amplifies your creativity today and makes you quite convincing. But it can also stir up problems if others misinterpret your words. You're eager to share a dream or fantasy, yet someone could actually mistake it for the truth. Unfortunately, your integrity may be called into question for the wrong reason. Thankfully, avoiding misunderstandings is easy if you simply clarify your sources."
aries,2012-02-23,"This is a fateful period in your life, yet you may not know where the changes ahead will take you. You could spend a lot of time attempting to figure everything out today, but the more effort you put into untangling all the possibilities, the less you know. Instead of trying to plan ahead, just be honest with yourself and act kindly toward everyone else. Your path may start to clear this evening, but real clarity remains elusive until Mars turns direct in April."
taurus,2012-02-23,"It seems as if your friends don't understand your needs now which makes you feel like withdrawing socially. To confuse matters more, other people may be uncharacteristically critical of your behavior. Although retreating into your work routine might make you feel safe, it doesn't address the underlying issues. Thankfully, your simple act of forgiveness can bridge the gulf that isolates you from your support network."
gemini,2012-02-23,"You are restless enough to stir up trouble today as mischievous Mercury opposes action-hero Mars, but previous commitments could prevent you from rocking the boat. Don't worry; you're not going to miss your chance. Changes are happening out of sight and progress is occurring even if you cannot see it now. Keep your eyes on your destination and don't overreact. Maintaining your cool is your best strategy for the time being."
cancer,2012-02-23,"Even if you are often self-protective, you may have big ideas about breaking out and doing something exciting now. Still, you won't likely override your primary need for emotional security. Thinking about going on an adventure is very different from actually setting out on your own. Nevertheless, it makes sense to get the ball rolling by dreaming about it. As you become more comfortable with the idea in your fantasies, you might just take a risk and live out your great escape."
leo,2012-02-23,"Something may not feel quite right today as your core beliefs clash with your current path. Even if you already know what you should do, logically it's not the right time yet. Thankfully, you can question your current direction without necessarily making any changes. Talking about your concerns helps to alleviate the tension. Although expressing your emotions might seem counterproductive now, it's a great way to clear the stress out of the air."
virgo,2012-02-23,"Your ruling planet Mercury could bring someone into your life today with an annoying message. You might think that avoiding conflict is a good idea, even if you must ignore what you're told. But it's not wise to overlook the facts, however inconvenient they may be now. Don't put yourself in a position where you can miss an important opportunity just because you're scared of the unknown. Nearly anything is possible if you embrace uncertainty rather than resist it."
libra,2012-02-23,"You might be unclear about something that has recently happened at work. If your week isn't going where you thought it would, you may need to change your plans instead of just burying your head in the sand and working harder. But it could be difficult to get all the facts, even if you choose to face the current circumstances head-on. Controlling your emotions is crucial or you might choose the wrong target for your frustration. Just do the best you can for now; you will feel more positive tomorrow."
scorpio,2012-02-23,"You're in a very creative mood today, but you may end up frustrated when someone's nitpicking criticism dampens your enthusiasm. You might feel as if you were cut short before you had a chance to show your stuff. Your lack of progress could provoke anger, which increases your malaise. Fortunately, trying a totally different approach might be the solution you need. Instead of doing business as usual, don't be afraid to think outside of the box."
sagittarius,2012-02-23,"It's difficult to stick to your current agenda today because it's apparent that circumstances are unfolding differently than you expected. But you're hardpressed to come up with a new plan if you cannot see where you're heading. There's a shift coming in the next few days, so give yourself time before deciding what to do. Instead of pushing ahead while the future is still foggy, wait for better visibility before making your move."
capricorn,2012-02-23,"Be careful what you tell your friends today because you may sound angrier than you feel. Even your most casual comments could have a strong impact now, affecting others more than you realize. Think about the consequences of your message -- not only what you say but also how you say it. If you can't express yourself in a kind manner, then keep your thoughts to yourself."
aquarius,2012-02-23,"You could get all worked up about a financial glitch today as a simple problem stirs deeper issues. Even if it's just a minor billing error, it may feel like a major money crisis. Whatever the problem is, handling it objectively is crucial because your behavior sets the tone for the next few days. Remember, it's not about what happened that brought you to this point; it's about how you manage things in the present moment. Don't let your emotions lead your decisions; a common sense approach is what's needed now."
pisces,2012-02-23,"You have something on your mind and it's important to say it to your friends today. You're not sure how they will react, yet you're willing to take the risk. However, others are open to receiving your message only if the information is useful and your delivery is concise. Don't beat around the bush; if you ramble on, you'll lose their interest. Be direct as possible when speaking from your heart."
aries,2012-02-24,"You should be accustomed to the repetitive waves of energy that periodically surge through your life these days. But the Moon's current visit to your sign is another reminder of the big changes ahead. You are quite excitable today and are easily overwhelmed by your emotions. Opening your heart to a friend will probably make you feel uncomfortable at first, but it could ultimately deepen your relationship."
taurus,2012-02-24,"Social commitments have piled up enough to make you realize that you don't have much time to spare. You may need to clarify your boundaries by saying no if you've spread yourself too thin. But it isn't that you want to be unsociable; it's simply that you have too much on your plate. Avoiding unproductive distractions makes sense now, even if you are feeling restless; concentrate on your job and you'll be through this crunch sooner than you expect."
gemini,2012-02-24,"You want others to believe that you're eagerly embracing the future. You may pretend that all is well today, but you're afraid of being judged if you hold on to the past. Although you're usually pretty good at steering clear of unnecessary emotional drama, your impulsive actions could inadvertently stir up an uncomfortable level of intensity now. Being honest about your fears is the first step to healing your insecurities."
cancer,2012-02-24,"You were recently swimming in the waters of your own emotions, but now it seems as if you're being pulled onto dry land. Instead of just experiencing your feelings, it's time to act on them. Unfortunately, your actions could be constrained by memories of a past rejection that arises when you swing into motion. Take time to honor your past before pushing through the resistance. No matter what happens, you will feel positive about taking a chance and revealing what you want."
leo,2012-02-24,"You feel a surge of confidence as the Moon visits your extroverted 9th House of Big Ideas. The fiery Aries Moon provides you with enough momentum to make new plans for the future, even if you haven't yet processed what's happening in the present moment. Fortunately, you don't have to figure out everything all at once; release your current concerns gradually while time works its own magic."
virgo,2012-02-24,"You may be frustrated with your lack of productivity today because you're itching for new experiences, even if you're constrained by promises you made in a relationship. Nevertheless, something happens that reawakens your desires and concentrates your attention on the excitement of living. However, you cannot just let go of your commitments. Be wise and observe your dilemma without taking action; it's best to make changes on another day rather than turning your life upside down now."
libra,2012-02-24,"The Moon's current visit to your 7th House of Relationships is a reminder of how difficult it is to be completely yourself when someone else is part of your life. Unfortunately, it's challenging to define the line between love and codependency, especially because making other people happy comes so naturally to you. Although fulfilling your own needs might create stress, it also makes you a better partner in the long run."
scorpio,2012-02-24,"You are walking close to an emotional edge today, but it's best to keep your feelings to yourself. Your patience has run out and you are almost ready to do something that you'll probably regret. It's your choice; you don't have to do it. There may be too much at stake to take an unnecessary risk now, so try working off your anxiety through exercise or hard work. You'll feel much better if you channel your nervous tension into something positive."
sagittarius,2012-02-24,"You're feeling lucky today which could tempt you to take an unnecessary risk. Maintaining a positive attitude is usually a wise decision, but it might be too much of a good thing now. A gamble won't automatically lead to loss, but choosing a proven path improves your chances for success even more. Don't be greedy and reach too far; set a realistic goal and then apply yourself diligently to reach it."
capricorn,2012-02-24,"Although you can see into the distance now and have an ambitious plan to reach your goals, your foundation may be weak if you don't trust your perceptions. You might be so self-critical that you think you won't be able to sustain your productivity as you move into unfamiliar territory. You could exhaust yourself before you reach your destination if you are pushing too hard. Paradoxically, slowing down today can actually help you achieve success quicker than you think."
aquarius,2012-02-24,"You may be running around in circles today, distracted by every little thing that comes along. However, instant karma gets you each time you wander and immediately puts you back on track. You don't have a lot of time to waste if you want to complete the tasks that are on your plate. Thankfully, you could surprise yourself by how much you accomplish if you have clear intentions and stay focused on your goals."
pisces,2012-02-24,"This is a critical phase, for you recently embarked on an exciting new path. But you could run into problems today as someone blocks your way. You might even wonder if you're heading in the right direction. However, there's no reason to get discouraged; the current obstacles are meant to help you get serious about your work rather than stopping your progress. Don't quit now; your follow-through is required to bring your project into the future."
aries,2012-02-25,"You are ready to make your escape today because you think you may lose your opportunity if you don't act right away. However, you could climb out too far on the edge if you don't stop to think first. Even if you feel as if you cannot go wrong; this is not a good time to test your limits. Be wise and begin slowly; accruing experience is more reliable than acting on false confidence."
taurus,2012-02-25,"You may look at your life through a spiritual filter today, enabling you to reframe a problem in a healthier perspective. Although it's likely that nothing much has changed, your improved attitude can make a huge difference. You might be tempted to share your new outlook with others, but that might only dissipate your energy. Instead, maximize your current potential by channeling your intentions through constructive action."
gemini,2012-02-25,"Although you may be doing the exact same things as yesterday, now you feel like you are actually making progress. You still have your fair share of work ahead of you, but you can tell that something has already shifted. Be wary about distracting yourself from your critical objectives. Even if friends tempt you to participate in fun activities today, this is not the best time to slack off in order to have a good time."
cancer,2012-02-25,"You may be feeling a sense of relief now that you aren't as concerned about being stuck. Your world seems to be more supportive of your plan today, giving you interesting choices that didn't even exist yesterday. However, your current optimism won't last unless you take decisive action to stabilize whatever you have already gained. Thankfully, carefully calculated risks could bring you the success you seek."
leo,2012-02-25,"Your future is looking brighter today since the resistance you were previously facing is beginning to ease. You might feel as if you spent too much time trying to overcome an obstacle, but nothing is to be gained now by looking back. It's more important to focus on cooperating with others to accomplish your objectives. The potential to succeed is greater than usual if you follow up on a current opportunity before you lose your chance."
virgo,2012-02-25,"You're not quite home free yet, but at least you're able to slow down today and catch your breath. Although your ambitions haven't disappeared, you're not so rushed now because you're feeling more confident about reaching your goals. Enjoying some time off can be rejuvenating, but don't let the hours slip away; you still have a job to do, and dreaming about life won't help you get your work done any faster."
libra,2012-02-25,"Others may inspire you with their sense of beauty and their creative ideas now that the Moon joins lovely Venus in your 7th House of Companions. Or, perhaps, an associate becomes overly enthusiastic about a project, encouraging you to become more involved. Nearly anything that occurs today might seem like a distraction, but that's not what's happening. Stay flexible enough to head off in a new direction; whatever you start continues to gain significance in your life in the weeks ahead."
scorpio,2012-02-25,"Follow your gut instincts today if you're struck with an idea about doing a repetitive job in an entirely new way. You are not as restrained by your old habits now, empowering you to analyze your work methods in a different light. Your plan might not produce tangible results, but you won't ever know unless you give it a try. Even if you're not immediately successful, don't give up; success may require multiple attempts before you get it just right."
sagittarius,2012-02-25,"Nothing will hold you back today because you can see the sunny side of every street. However, you may be so sure of yourself that you forget to take the time to consider the consequences of your actions. Luckily, your key planet Jupiter is your guardian angel now, preventing you from making a bad decision. Nevertheless, analyze all your options before committing to one path. Proper planning increases the long-term positive impact that your current efforts will have on your life."
capricorn,2012-02-25,"You might need to stay home and deal with a family matter today, even if you're itching to get out and do something different. But this is an excellent time to take care of personal business, whether you have to do some chores around the house, pay a few bills or resolve a domestic squabble. Just don't turn a simple task into a major deal. If you are working on a bigger project, extra attention to the details will improve your chances for success."
aquarius,2012-02-25,"You might be very busy with a variety of chores today; however, the separate tasks fit together into a larger goal. Even if you're just tying up loose ends, they will be easier to put away once and for all. But don't misread the signals you're receiving from a close friend or family member. Although blind optimism can tempt you to overlook an important detail, a realistic outlook prevents you from having to start all over again."
pisces,2012-02-25,"Your strategy may not be the best one now, but you're likely to succeed anyhow because of your self-confidence. You could even think that your positive attitude is more important than hard work. Unfortunately, believing that you're invincible can be dangerous if it encourages reckless behavior. Reaching for the stars is a good idea, but make certain that your plan is sound and you have sufficient fuel to get to your destination."
aries,2012-02-26,"You may grow restless today if your desires aren't being completely satisfied. Although it would be wise to relax while you have the chance, you prefer some excitement rather than the peace and quiet you're being offered. Undoubtedly, life would be simpler for everyone involved if you could settle your energy, but denying your feelings only makes matters worse. Do yourself a favor and let others know what you want now without shifting the blame to anyone else for your current dilemma."
taurus,2012-02-26,"You might feel better when your friends and family acknowledge what you say as you express your feelings. However, they may not be listening carefully enough now to fully understand your message. Even if it seems as if you're being heard, others will barely scratch the surface of your ideas. Being patient works to your advantage, for you can inadvertently push someone away by sharing too much, too fast."
gemini,2012-02-26,"Instead of relying on your quick wit and clever responses, you are better off saying less today because your words might end up misrepresenting you. Open your senses to direct impressions and act on your perceptions now rather than just talking about them. Don't bother rationalizing your choices or justifying your gut feeling that leads you toward a particular destination. Follow your instincts; you can always fill in the details afterward."
cancer,2012-02-26,"Your social network can be the source of great stability and inspiration today, so listen closely to what others say. Although you're not required to follow anyone's lead, your friends offer a practical approach that could help you handle a sticky situation. But residual self-doubt won't magically disappear, so be gentle now when judging yourself against your expectations. Contrary to your worries, there's no hurry when it comes to untangling the mystery that is you."
leo,2012-02-26,"You may be uncertain about a choice you must make now, but rest assured that there isn't any one path that's clearly right or wrong. Whatever you currently decide, your route will be a circuitous one and the detours will teach you lessons that you might have missed by zipping along unimpeded. Don't judge your performance negatively; you will have a very different perspective on what happened when you look back in a couple of months."
virgo,2012-02-26,"You may feel relieved because you see a friend or partner in a more realistic light today. You're comforted by the realization that you can make concrete decisions based on what you know, rather than flying by the seat of your pants. However, it's still wise to act with caution because you could miss crucial information now that catches you off guard if you become too complacent. It never hurts to pay extra attention."
libra,2012-02-26,"Trusting others helps to ameliorate your current confusion about your work plans for next week. Thankfully, you're in an excellent position to turn an uncertainty in your favor if you're not too eager to change everything all at once. Your current lesson is about letting go of control, so roll with the incoming waves without resistance. Having a flexible agenda is more important now than dramatically proving the strength of your will power."
scorpio,2012-02-26,"The Moon's current visit to your 7th House of Partners, combined with the Sun's illumination of your 5th House of Love, is a powerful energetic mix that can blast open your heart or increase your awareness of your desires. However, intense karmic forces are at work behind the scenes, making or breaking a potential romance. There's no need to force resolution of an issue now; instead, allow the current events to unfold without adding pressure to the situation."
sagittarius,2012-02-26,"Your ruling planet, Jupiter, offers you new options today, preventing you from settling into your regular Sunday routine. You're not likely to do your chores the same way you've done them in the past. However, there's no need to stir up resentment from others; acknowledge those who are in charge and work with them rather than against them. You will accomplish more with greater ease if you quietly do things your own way while saving your battles for another day."
capricorn,2012-02-26,"Hard-nosed Saturn is your ruling planet and its influence is strong today, making it difficult for you to accomplish your goals. Fortunately, you can work with Saturn by progressing deliberately, even if overconfident Jupiter convinces you that everything is easier now than it actually is. You can reach your destination if you don't take any shortcuts. Act conservatively; stick to the most tried and true methods rather than outsmarting yourself by trying to be too clever."
aquarius,2012-02-26,"You could circumvent unnecessary trouble today by remembering that you can't possibly know everything. Although this warning may sound unnecessary, a momentary glimpse of awareness might be dangerous if it tricks you into believing that you understand more than you really do. Nevertheless, you should be able to make good progress if you pay attention to the facts and avoid acting on your assumptions."
pisces,2012-02-26,"There is magic following you around, yet this intangible buzz can grow annoying if you try to establish obvious correlations between your actions and your goals. Unfortunately, relying on your common sense lures you down a path of elusive expectations that may create disappointment rather than satisfaction. However, nearly anything is possible now once you accept that reality is not playing by your rules today."
aries,2012-02-27,"You are very realistic about your goals today, enabling you to feel satisfied with your accomplishments. However, you may be quick to entertain an unrealistic idea if it sounds exciting. Thinking about your fantasies is fine as long as you don't impulsively do something about them now. Although you might feel as if you've lost your edge, there's no need for any concern. Just enjoy the calmer pace of life while it lasts."
taurus,2012-02-27,"You could feel lazy today because self-motivation is challenging if you think that your work might not be appreciated. Unfortunately, this kind of logic can create a vicious cycle that becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy because your lack of effort might be frowned upon by others. However, the Moon's visit to your sign is your chance to overcome your own resistance and surprise someone by finishing whatever is expected of you now. Don't miss this opportunity to show everyone what you can do."
gemini,2012-02-27,"You're known for your cleverness, but today's emphasis on being pragmatic can prevent you from expressing yourself in your usual witty manner. Unfortunately, thoughts just won't come to you as rapidly as you wish, which makes it difficult to talk your way out of an unpleasant situation. Deal with any uncomfortable issues that surface now, instead of trying to avoid them. Finding resolution might be easier than you think."
cancer,2012-02-27,"Expressing yourself eloquently today is not enough; you also must steer clear of an emotional outbreak, especially if it doesn't directly concern you. Getting involved in someone's drama diverts your precious time and energy without increasing your chances for success. Demonstrate your support by being the strong and silent type. Encourage a weary friend to lean on your shoulder, but don't lose yourself in the overly complicated dynamics of other people's business."
leo,2012-02-27,"Pressing concerns that affect your career right now are more important than the long-term decisions that you've been wrestling with lately. Although you might have recently allowed your thoughts about the distant future to grow out of hand, it's now time to re-evaluate your priorities. If your previous plans were unrealistic, tune out the extraneous noise and consider what's most critical to the present moment."
virgo,2012-02-27,"You may feel as if you're running into insurmountable resistance, but you're able to hold your ground today, rather than retreating. Although you won't likely be pleased if you cannot freely do what you intended, you might feel relief once you clarify your limits. Don't think that your trials are a sign of defeat; instead, look at the current circumstances as an opportunity to re-establish a strong foundation to carry you forward."
libra,2012-02-27,"You aren't usually the one who says no, but you recently learned how to set a boundary and defend your position, if necessary. Your tough-love policy may have felt good because you helped someone who needed to have some limits established. If you're called on again to be the practical one, don't hold back because you're afraid of being perceived as negative. Your passion could surprise others, but your kindness will be obvious as long as your intentions are good."
scorpio,2012-02-27,"An existing relationship can be strengthened now if you're able to let go of unnecessary fear. You might be afraid that you'll lose control once you give in to someone else's demands. However, the opposite is true; responding intelligently to sound logic demonstrates your willingness to compromise. Luckily, there's no right and wrong in the realm of emotions, so keep an open mind when considering points of view other than your own."
sagittarius,2012-02-27,"You might grow discouraged today if political pressure on the job prevents you from doing what you think is most important. It's particularly demoralizing if you are anticipating success, only to discover that you have additional tasks to complete before calling it quits. However, it's not wise to let any setbacks bother you now. Maintain a positive attitude so you can meet any problems head-on. Don't give up; you're closer to your goals than you think."
capricorn,2012-02-27,"You may need to take on an authoritative role today, complicating your interactions with people who believe that you're the source of the problem. You cannot just out-talk your opponents with logic; verbal sparring only widens the gap between you and your adversary. Instead of employing words to demonstrate your superiority, let your sensible behavior speak for you. Direct action is the best way to make your case."
aquarius,2012-02-27,"Instead of just assuming that you know all the answers, try softening your approach by acknowledging everyone else's expertise. Being receptive to new information is more important than proving how smart you are now. However, you must be secure in what you do know in order to comfortably admit what you don't. You have an opportunity to impress others with your wisdom today, instead of just showing off your intelligence."
pisces,2012-02-27,"You are able to take constructive criticism today without low self-esteem kicking in. Normally, you might grow anxious if you believe that someone is questioning the validity of your core beliefs. But don't hide behind your convictions if you're just trying to avoid hearing the truth. Reconsider your opinions when you receive new data that is contrary to what you previously knew. Adjusting your position makes sense, especially when it works in everyone's favor."
aries,2012-02-28,"You would like to slow down, take a few deep breaths and regroup now, especially if you feel as if you've been on the go for too long. It does seem as if the pace of life is a bit more manageable today, but it won't likely last. Instead of taking it easy, go over your plans and make certain that you have everything in place. Take care of the most important tasks while you have the time and leave the rest for another day."
taurus,2012-02-28,"Your life may be moving along fine now, but you might wish that there wasn't so much to do. You realize that your co-workers aren't contributing as much as you would like, yet they appear to be unfazed by your gentle coaxing. Naturally, you want to have fun, but it's best to pay attention to your responsibilities today and wait until later in the week before taking extra time for yourself."
gemini,2012-02-28,"You don't have to tell others what you know because it's better to keep some things to yourself for now. Choosing when to share your perspective and when to remain quiet may be an ongoing struggle, and this is a perfect opportunity to work on this persistent issue. Your current secrecy might be unsettling to someone else, but this isn't your concern. Practice discretion today and let people deal with their own insecurities. There's no hurry; you'll know when it's time to express what's on your mind."
cancer,2012-02-28,"You may be feeling very social as you seek ways to be more involved with others at work. But acting spontaneously might not be your smartest strategy; check in with your friends and associates to make plans in advance. Scheduling your time with others offers you the additional security you need, but leave room to change your mind if you want to pull out at the last minute."
leo,2012-02-28,You're more interested in making steady progress to accomplish your goals today than being acknowledged by your peers for what you contribute to the group. You want to see the results of your work and it's okay if it takes more time for others to recognize your efforts. There's no need to be impatient; drawing attention to your achievements won't help your cause. You'll feel better when appreciation comes on its own volition.
virgo,2012-02-28,"Refining plans for the future seems easy today because you can see more possibilities than usual. Fortunately, you won't likely get lost in an unrealistic fantasy, even with your expanded vision. It's safe to trust your instincts over the ideas of anyone else because others could encourage you to risk more than is sensible at this time. But you're the one who knows your limits, making you your own best advisor for now."
libra,2012-02-28,"You are quite persistent today and could even get on people's nerves. Your current stubbornness may surprise your friends and associates who are more accustomed to your cooperative style. However, it's time to push back against someone's ambiguity, so don't settle for less than you want. Just don't get carried away with your sense of power; be certain that you know what you are doing and be willing, if necessary, to take no for an answer now."
scorpio,2012-02-28,"You can get worked up into a state of anxiety if someone asks you to do something that rubs you the wrong way. Even if you let others know your limits now, they still might not respond to your needs, especially if they are determined to have things go their way. Naturally, this could create a difficult situation, but ultimately you will be better off by being clear about your boundaries and holding firm to your integrity."
sagittarius,2012-02-28,"It doesn't matter how many fantastic ideas you come up with today; you still have to keep your feet on the ground and take care of the business at hand. Although you have a wonderful ability to see the big picture in all that you do, it's critical now to demonstrate your reliability rather than your indefatigable optimism. Don't be distracted by anything that isn't actively contributing to your most pressing matters."
capricorn,2012-02-28,"Your anxiety may motivate you to express yourself creatively today. Even if you cannot enjoy peace and quiet, you might find a groove that enables you to be highly productive while also giving you satisfaction. Don't worry about long-term goals for now; it's more important to stay focused and work steadily on meeting your current commitments."
aquarius,2012-02-28,"Your mind may be lingering on personal concerns, even if you have job-related responsibilities that take precedence today. You might even try to get out of work early, but it's crucial to thoroughly tie up as many loose ends as you can before making your escape. Patience doesn't come easy to you now, but attending to things in the proper order is more efficient and satisfying in the final analysis."
pisces,2012-02-28,"It's often tempting to float along with the currents, letting them take you wherever they flow. However, you are wiser to make concrete plans and then stick to them today. Just be aware that this strategy could lead to frustration if you become overly rigid in your thinking. It's better to modify your agenda when circumstances warrant. Being practical makes more sense than stubbornly trying to do everything your way."
aries,2012-02-29,"You may have a tough time remaining focused today because you're distracted by one interesting thing after another. For just an instant everything seems clear, yet only a few moments later you are no longer sure what to do. Your current indecisiveness could lead to anxious feelings if you think that others are pressuring you to make a choice. Thankfully, consciously postponing your final answer for a couple of days might be sufficient to help you coast easily through these tricky times."
taurus,2012-02-29,"Even if your life recently settled down, something could happen today to end the calm and make you realize that reality isn't going to conform to your agenda. Your initial reaction may be to attempt to regain control over your day, but holding on to your previous plan will only increase your frustration. Instead, ease your grip and allow the instability to play on through. Take the reins again only after you have your feet back on solid ground."
gemini,2012-02-29,"Although you might seek excitement today, you're tempted to withdraw from the action if it actually arrives. You may have grown more accustomed to the peaceful atmosphere than you realize, and begin missing it as soon as the pace quickens. However, the Moon's visit to your sign encourages you to grasp for something that's just out of reach. Be grateful for what you have now because satisfaction is attainable only in the present moment."
cancer,2012-02-29,"You're not as calm as you appear today, since others tend to notice only your hard outer shell that prevents them from seeing your unsettled emotions. You may be very anxious as you analyze whether or not something is important enough to fight for now. You have to choose between continuing on your way toward your previous destination and setting new goals. Even if you're uncertain, deciding one way or the other frees you up so you can move forward."
leo,2012-02-29,"You're ready for whatever comes next, but circumstances may not be as forgiving as you wish. Someone's unexpressed feelings can create a drag, as if you are a boat that's pulling a heavy anchor along behind it. Once you realize that you cannot find the source of the weight, your first impulse might be to get angry. However, misplaced emotions won't help your cause. Instead, think about all your options and, for now, take the course of least resistance. You can set yourself back on track more easily in a few days."
virgo,2012-02-29,"Your analytical powers are usually strong as long as you're not overwhelmed by lots of details. Unfortunately, you might find it difficult to follow through on whatever you start today because it's challenging to differentiate useful information from background noise. But you don't have to obsess about filtering out all the irrelevant data. Simply work with what you know and concentrate on your goal until you're finished."
libra,2012-02-29,"You may experience relief when you realize how many options are available today. Ironically, your newly found freedom of choice can stabilize your current situation because you don't feel as trapped as you thought you were. However, you really don't need to make any major decisions now. Keeping multiple paths open as long as possible enables you to be better informed before making a commitment."
scorpio,2012-02-29,"You are being challenged to let go of your need for intensity, and, thankfully, you can see the value of a more casual approach to life today. Being flexible now enables you to go along with someone else's plan, even if you know that yours is better. Just remember that acting in a halfhearted manner won't work. If you hold on to any of your previous desires, anger or resentment could surface. Fortunately, being honest right from the start ensures smooth sailing."
sagittarius,2012-02-29,"Someone could float into your life today and have you chasing a whimsical idea as if it were the most important thing in the world. It may be a pipedream, but you're sure that you can grab this illusion and create something tangible. Unfortunately, you could waste a lot of energy running down a dream that might not be as good once it's caught. Think twice before you pursue something you might soon regret."
capricorn,2012-02-29,"You have a lot of good ideas at work today, but your mind is going so fast now that you could be off to the next inspiring thought before you do anything about the current one. Unfortunately, a really useful concept might slip away forever if you don't take the time to write it down as it's unfolding. You shouldn't rely on your memory now if you want to remember something important."
aquarius,2012-02-29,"You feel refreshed by waves of enthusiasm, but any new ideas that surface today might not be as good as they seem. You could grow discouraged if you think a plan is a viable one and then it quickly loses its luster. Don't try to hold any single thought above all the others; allow each one to rise and fall at its own pace. Instead of focusing on the winning scheme that got away, remain detached about the outcome."
pisces,2012-02-29,"It's difficult to trust your natural psychic powers today because your logic leads you to a very different conclusion than your intuition. It doesn't matter how many times you run through the steps in your mind; your rational analysis is still at odds with the meaning you get directly from your heart. Fortunately, you gain a wider perspective when you don't force conflicting points of view into a single answer."
aries,2012-03-01,"You may think that you fixed a problem at work, but your belief doesn't mean that you actually handled it in the real world. You might assume that changing your attitude is enough to take care of the current stress, but there's more yet for you to do. However, you won't be able to move on until you admit that you have an important lesson to learn now. Once you acknowledge that you don't have all the answers, opportunities will start to open up all around you."
taurus,2012-03-01,"Completing tasks that have immediate consequences reduces the pressure of the larger issues you are wrestling with now, but diverting your attention isn't the permanent answer. Nevertheless, you can accomplish a lot today by narrowing your focus. However, once you finish some of the chores on your to-do list, it's wise to review your long-term goals, even if you don't reach any lasting conclusions."
gemini,2012-03-01,"You should be able to deal with nearly anything that arises today as long as you understand that it could take a while for positive results to manifest. Thankfully, the current situation won't spin out of control if you apply consistent attention to what's going on. Although persistence might be your secret weapon now, it won't be easy to stay focused. Nevertheless, putting your personal needs on hold is your smartest strategy while you demonstrate your dedication to your job."
cancer,2012-03-01,"An unresolved family matter takes more of your attention today than you prefer, but it's wise to do whatever you can to smooth over the rough spots at home. You may believe that avoiding your domestic concerns is enough to make them go away. However, this kind of mind game won't be helpful; be smart and talk about what's happening with those who are also involved in your drama. Even if nothing is fixed immediately, a good discussion gets the energy moving in the right direction."
leo,2012-03-01,"It's hard to shake the high level of emotional intensity today, but you're ready to swing into action to re-establish stability in your environment. Developing a concrete plan to reduce your anxiety is one thing, while actually putting your ideas into motion is something else. The complexity of the situation might make you feel ready to give up. But don't be discouraged; you can turn the tide in your favor, even if everything takes more time than you wish."
virgo,2012-03-01,"You're ready to try every trick in the book to eliminate the current stress in a relationship. Unfortunately, the harder you attempt to make someone else feel good today, the more awkward the situation becomes. Ironically, your most effective strategy might be to simply acknowledge the issue without doing anything about it. Let the tension settle on its own. It may take a few days for things to play out, but you can expect calmer times ahead."
libra,2012-03-01,"Whatever you're thinking today won't likely be your final solution to a stressful situation on the job. Your co-workers may be waiting for you to weigh in with your answer, but you're not happy with any of the available plans. Although you would prefer to add a few extra alternatives to the mix, more options will only complicate matters. Even if you think there's a better way to make things work now, no one will fault you for going along with the consensus of the group."
scorpio,2012-03-01,"You're concerned about issues of integrity today, yet the current circumstances may be more complex than they seem. Someone might ask you to do something that you think could reflect negatively on you. Instead of turning a minor concern into a major problem, acknowledge your feelings and then let them go. It's important that others know exactly where you stand. Speak up for your beliefs to gain the respect you deserve."
sagittarius,2012-03-01,"You may take a circuitous route to let someone know how you feel today. Although you are very serious about your feelings now, the Moon's presence in your 7th House of Partners could lead others to think you're being evasive. In fact, you could be acting more defensively than you realize. Pay attention to the differences between the actual conversation you're engaged in with another person and the one you're having with yourself."
capricorn,2012-03-01,"Your ruling planet Saturn is agitated by mental Mercury today, encouraging you to think carefully about what you deserve. However, your karma may seem muddled now as your thoughts bump into reality. Even if you cannot see the relationship between cause and effect now, don't let your uncertainty prevent you from doing the right thing. If you stay on course, you will be closer to your destination when the mist begins to clear."
aquarius,2012-03-01,"It's not easy to separate your idealistic fantasies from workable solutions to the real issues that are bothering you now. Thankfully, you can have the most positive impact on your life by simply concentrating on the facts and putting away your hopes and dreams for another day. Avoid the temptation to drift off into your imagination. The real magic today comes from honestly dealing with the current situation."
pisces,2012-03-01,"It may be worrisome if you can't tell the difference between the reality of a relationship and your dreams. However, the current problem stems from your overactive imagination and not anything else. Although your mind may be active with wonderful ideas and amazing possibilities, it can be frustrating if they seem real when they're not. Instead of acting on them today, write your thoughts down to reconsider later; you can choose which ones to develop further when you are thinking more rationally."
aries,2012-03-02,"You like the idea of telling everyone what's on your mind today as communicator Mercury enters your spontaneous sign. But it feels as if your intentions are thwarted over and over again. Ironically, the more determined you are to speak your piece, the more frustrated you become. Perhaps you would be smart to take your cues from the current circumstances and keep your thoughts to yourself for now instead of fighting against the tide. Your delivery will be more convincing if you wait."
taurus,2012-03-02,"You know what your responsibilities are today, but you could get so entangled with all the details that you don't have a clue where to start. Each time you revise your plan of attack, you bump into another problem that needs to be resolved before you can make any progress. You may be tempted to throw your hands up in the air and walk away from the whole thing. However, what's happening is more like a test than a setback. Don't panic or give up; just keep calm and stay focused on the final destination."
gemini,2012-03-02,"Having patience isn't your strongest suit, yet there's no way to escape the fact that you must play the waiting game today. However, your desire for immediate resolution to an ongoing problem only heightens your frustration now. You have a tough lesson to learn. Concentrate on the long-term solution rather than a quick fix, so the resistance will dissipate and things can start to move in your direction."
cancer,2012-03-02,"You may be deeply involved in a political or social power play today, yet your family and co-workers might not even realize what's going on. You have a plan to get your way, but can go about your business in a rather sneaky manner now. Working toward a specific goal is admirable, but don't get tangled up in complicated schemes. Find enough courage to open up and simply tell others what you're doing and why. You may be pleasantly surprised by the support you receive once you're honest."
leo,2012-03-02,"You are usually quite direct in your approach to working with other people. Now, however, you may be more secretive than others realize. You appear to be very outgoing when you tell everyone what's on your mind, but your spoken words may be different from your desires. Don't be too hard on yourself; you're under no obligation to disclose your emotional needs as long as you're meeting your current obligations. Share your personal story with your associates next week when you feel like it."
virgo,2012-03-02,"You want to be more involved with everyone at work, but your integrity prevents you from acting friendly unless you really like the person. Nevertheless, you still might find yourself in a social situation where you need to interact with someone who isn't in your close circle of friends. There's no need to be overly critical now, so save your judgments for another time. Getting along with others is easier when you first accept yourself just as you are."
libra,2012-03-02,"It's natural for you to fall back on your role as peacemaker by listening to everyone's stories at work today. Even if others expect you to hold a centrist position that validates each person involved, you aren't nearly as neutral as anyone thinks. Nevertheless, the pressure is on you to keep your opinion to yourself for now. Although your frustration may increase throughout the day, rest assured things will settle down and it will be a whole new ballgame next week."
scorpio,2012-03-02,"There are certain rules at work that seem to be very rigid, but you want them to change anyhow. You're tempted to unilaterally break out of the old routine, but sudden action on your part today could destabilize the whole system. Instead of expecting everything to suddenly shift right away, keep up the pressure. Although nothing seems to moves fast enough, your steady force will ultimately bend reality in your favor."
sagittarius,2012-03-02,"Something dramatic has shifted in your attitude, empowering you to think outside of the box. Although your thoughts may be unrestrained, complex emotional needs can prevent you from openly sharing them with others. Perhaps your ingenious idea would work, but with the high cost of upsetting the stability of your relationships at work. Fortunately, you can continue to develop a sensible solution before telling others about it next week when the timing is better."
capricorn,2012-03-02,"You might feel like a military leader today, preparing to initiate your next campaign. But warrior Mars is harshly aspecting authoritative Saturn, making it difficult for you to see the difference between assertive action and aggression. You could get so worked up about accomplishing a specific task for the benefit of the group that you temporarily forget that not everyone may share the same goal. Step back and ask what others want before assuming that they are there to help you."
aquarius,2012-03-02,"The pace of your life seems faster today and you enjoy the buzz of energy. However, it's more difficult now to stick to your daily routine and accomplish your goals for the day. You may feel torn between talking about all the exciting things that are happening and doing the same old job in the same old way. You know what's possible today, but it seems a step away no matter how quickly you walk. Instead of working harder, work smarter; you'll be able to catch up with your intentions next week."
pisces,2012-03-02,"It's one thing to feel good about what you're doing; it's something entirely different to be able to communicate your experience to someone else. Although you are satisfied that things are going your way, you're not receiving the support that you expect today. Confronting others won't help; in fact, it only heightens the tension. Just get along doing the best you can on your own; your friends and associates will come around when they see the results of your productivity."
aries,2012-03-03,"Although you're ready to take on the world today, it might be smarter to retreat. Think about what you want and how best to get it instead of just going on the offensive now. Considering the consequences of your actions first saves you the need for apologizing later. But before you withdraw to make a new battle plan, remember that finding a middle-of-the-road approach may be best. If you quit without trying, you could end up resenting someone who can be a powerful ally."
taurus,2012-03-03,"You might prefer to remain quiet today, but may feel pressured by friends or family into responding to a situation you would rather avoid. You can tell that engaging in a conflict won't lead to a solution, so you don't want to waste your time on a course of action that just makes matters worse. Even if you're annoyed, hold your ground and stay on the sidelines of the developing drama. Wait until the tension settles on its own a bit before jumping in with your advice."
gemini,2012-03-03,"You can get so caught up in the drama of the present moment that you temporarily forget what you're doing. Unfortunately, your current sense of insecurity might provoke you to argue with someone just so you can prove that you're right. Be smart and take several deep breaths to reconnect with your center of gravity before you find yourself involved in an emotional matter that doesn't even concern you."
cancer,2012-03-03,"The Moon's visit to your nurturing sign today can bring your tenderness right up to the surface. But you're not happy about feeling so vulnerable, prompting you to go on the attack to fend off an unpleasant interaction before it happens. However, your sharp words and unnecessary criticism can precipitate the very situation you are trying to avoid. Instead of letting your fear motivate manipulative behavior, confide in someone you trust before you hide behind your wall of defenses."
leo,2012-03-03,It feels as if your time for strategizing is ending and you must do something right away. But acting too quickly now can reveal your weakness instead of demonstrating your strength. It's better to keep working toward your goals at a steady pace than to panic and blame someone else for your lack of progress. Don't get dragged into an argument over something that's not ultimately significant. Adjust your priorities while still following your intuition.
virgo,2012-03-03,"You may have a detailed strategy that involves others now, yet coordinating all the people can become too much to handle. You aren't happy about encountering the same issues again as retrograde Mars in Virgo opposes the willful Sun in your 7th House of Relationships. Address everyone's concerns the best you can to prevent angry words from being spoken for the wrong reasons. Don't worry if your plans fall apart; it's the interpersonal dynamics that matter most at this time."
libra,2012-03-03,"Maintaining peace in relationships can be a struggle today if you have the urge to fight or take flight. You want to stand up for your truth, but you can't help wondering if a confrontation will solve anything. Running away from a potential conflict seems like the smarter solution, but nothing will change if you just try to escape. Instead of attempting to fix the problem now, just open your heart and listen to what others are saying. Ultimately, you will find common ground through understanding and compromise."
scorpio,2012-03-03,"You're riding a powerful emotional surge today as your key planet Mars engages in a tug of war with the immutable Sun. Although you may believe that your passions are worth fighting for now, your current subjectivity can warp your perspective so you don't see what's actually happening in a close relationship. Instead of raising the stakes in a conflict, it's smarter to agree to disagree. Revisit the issue in a few days when your feelings are not clouding reality."
sagittarius,2012-03-03,"You may not feel very optimistic today if you have been pushed too far, enabling you to see through the veneer that was covering the facts. But getting to the source of a problem doesn't necessarily make things easier, because if you let others know what you discovered they might not like what you have to say. Your intentions are honorable, but you could stir up trouble anyhow. Being honest works best if you act kindly in the process."
capricorn,2012-03-03,"Your personal relationships may be stressful today, especially if you think that you have been forced into an untenable situation. You're not interested in a quick fix now; you want to get to the source of the problem and initiate change that can lead to permanent results. Unfortunately, resolution is more difficult if you believe that you're in the right. Tension requires two sides to an issue; transformation is possible only when both perspectives are taken equally into consideration."
aquarius,2012-03-03,"You might take your point of view so far today that you upset someone who disagrees with you. Hopefully, you are wise enough to understand that two people can react differently to the same situation. There's nothing to be gained by engaging in a fight to the finish. If you take an all-or-nothing position, everyone will end up a loser. Respecting someone else's perspective requires flexibility on your part, especially if you think that you know what's best for others. Establishing common ground is a better strategy than you think."
pisces,2012-03-03,"You don't understand why others need to be so vocal about their feelings today. Even if a close friend or family member is shouting, you may prefer to keep your anger to yourself or share your emotions quietly with someone you trust. Nevertheless, your judgment may be just a little off now, so be smart and don't reveal too much. You can always say more later on, but you won't be able to hit the delete key to take back what you already said."
aries,2012-03-04,"Circumstances may not leave you much time for fun and games until later in the evening today. Unfortunately, it seems as if you have little choice but to do what's expected of you now, although you might push back a bit to test how far you can bend the rules. Your inability to escape current responsibilities could provoke you to question if other people's approval is worth your extra effort. The choice is yours, but remember that your negativity won't last as long if you just get busy and do the right thing."
taurus,2012-03-04,"Your ruling planet Venus is locked in an anxious tug-of-war with unforgiving Saturn now, but thankfully the love planet can soften even a very tough opponent. It may seem as if your warm and caring feelings are being constrained, yet your determination can overcome nearly any obstacle today if you maintain a positive attitude. Deal with any negativity immediately so it doesn't have a chance to spread."
gemini,2012-03-04,"Your idealistic hopes may be dashed today if you have set your sights too high. Even if you are acting with common sense, you still need to overcome your natural resistance to being methodical and persistent. Forget about living in the moment and making it up as you go; you'll make more progress now by sticking to a concrete plan and finishing whatever you start. Chasing after a pipedream wastes energy that could be applied to more practical goals."
cancer,2012-03-04,"You may want to retreat today because spending time alone can feed your soul. Unfortunately, you won't like it when others make demands on your time now, especially if you don't feel like they truly appreciate what you do. You might have something special in mind for your day, but close friends or family members insist that you spend more of your time with them. There's no need to overreact because the emotional distance you're feeling is temporary. Find a comfortable balance between being social and being on your own."
leo,2012-03-04,"You are looking forward to rest and relaxation today, but you might not have time after handling your domestic obligations. You may not even realize that you made so many commitments until it's too late to get out of them. You really don't want to let others down now. Stop complaining about the good times you're missing; instead, let your current activities morph into memorable experiences by doing the most extraordinary job you can possibly do."
virgo,2012-03-04,"You may be fully aware of a romantic opportunity today, but you're likely frustrated with your efforts to make it real. You might even feel as if someone is purposefully raining on your parade. Thankfully, the silver lining to the dark clouds lights up your day enough to remind you that the truth is more powerful than an unrealistic fantasy. Don't quit now; love others the way you want to be loved without expecting anything in return."
libra,2012-03-04,"You might not be sure how to react if someone special acts particularly sweet to you today. Initially, you could enjoy the idea of a romantic liaison with your key planet Venus in your 7th House of Others. But her opposition to austere Saturn encourages you to see the wisdom of retreating emotionally to prevent any possible complications. However, rushing into a relationship now is not a smart tactic, either. Honoring people's boundaries is not just a good idea; it's a must."
scorpio,2012-03-04,"Taking a relationship to the next level is like setting out to sea on a great journey. At first, the wide open waters appear boundless, but eventually you may feel trapped on your tiny boat by the ocean's containment of your space. Assuming responsibility for your current situation helps you to move beyond your frustration. The limitations being placed on you are quite real, but you can still be happy if you remember to keep your destination in sight at all times."
sagittarius,2012-03-04,"You aren't thrilled if your confidence has waned, and you might wish that you pushed harder yesterday to get what you want. However, your perspective is still in flux and your pent-up energy won't begin to release until next week. But meanwhile, there's no need to worry about a setback or a rejection; use the current circumstances to step back and reconsider how to proceed before taking the next step."
capricorn,2012-03-04,"You could feel hurt today by someone's harsh criticism as your key planet Saturn runs into stressful aspects. You might even want to pack your bags and head for the hills. Or, maybe, you just want to stay home where you feel safer. However, the current situation isn't signaling you to quit. Rather, you must hone your skills so you can overcome obstacles -- physical and emotional -- that pop up in your path. Don't retreat; work smarter, not harder."
aquarius,2012-03-04,"You may not receive the financial support that you were expecting, prompting you to cut back on your plans. The lack of funds you currently face might be part of a more complex emotional issue that relates to your self-esteem. You can't just go out and fix the situation, especially if others are involved in your project. Instead of delivering ultimatums, combine patience with steady persuasion. Being kind is a more successful strategy now than looking for a fight."
pisces,2012-03-04,"You may be feeling very weary today, especially if you have put a lot of time and energy into reaching your goals. However, it seems as if the air has been let out of your helium balloon, and you don't know what to do to keep it afloat. Unfortunately, you're tempted to stop trying and allow it to fall to the ground. But anything positive you can do is helpful because a second wind is on the way. You'll receive the support you need if you can hang on just a little while longer."
aries,2012-03-05,"You want to slow down today, but your restless mind fires off one thought after another. You can jump from one extreme point of view to the next without even wondering how you got there so quickly. Although you think you're pretty smart now, impulsive ideas can lead you into trouble. Before jumping into anything new, count to ten. Giving yourself time to reconsider your actions may be enough to save you from yourself."
taurus,2012-03-05,"Alluring Venus returns to your sensual sign today, encouraging you to ply your charms in order to get what you want. Although you don't feel focused, you still can convince others to go along with your wishes. However, you could easily work yourself into a state of anxiety if you're too excited. Slow down and balance your enthusiasm with steady determination. Scattering your energy will only lead you astray."
gemini,2012-03-05,"Although you may not be finished with your last project, you're already thinking about what you can do next. You are intrigued by nearly everything you encounter now, making it difficult to follow through on what you already started. However, your restlessness puts you in touch with some intriguing people who are involved in fascinating endeavors. Thankfully, if you take the time to clean up your previous business, nothing can hold you back from exploring the new possibilities."
cancer,2012-03-05,"You could say something at work today that slips off your tongue before you realize it. Your words might be shocking to your own ears, but probably won't surprise your co-workers. Ironically, one of your ideas might sound so ingenious now that an associate takes your thought and runs with it. Don't worry about who gets credit for the inspiration; do what's best for the good of everyone involved. You will receive acknowledgment for your contribution and your spirit of generosity soon enough."
leo,2012-03-05,"You would prefer a simpler solution to your current dilemma, but today is a day when the best and worst of things are wrapped up in the same complicated package. Aiming for the middle ground won't help as your feelings change quickly, bouncing back and forth between the extremes. Letting go of control can relieve a lot of the tension. Rest assured that the stress will resolve quickly and you'll be on a smoother path by tomorrow."
virgo,2012-03-05,"Normally, you can get to the core of the matter by analyzing the available facts. Unfortunately, your key planet Mercury is conjunct erratic Uranus today, making it nearly impossible to discern what's most important. Your perspective changes as you uncover new information throughout the day, prompting you to alter your course. Don't worry about the reactions of others; just maintain your integrity while adapting to what you learn along the way."
libra,2012-03-05,"You can't rely on anyone else today, even if you are surrounded by people who are usually quite dependable. A close friend or workmate may be very persuasive, convincing you that you'll have the support you need. Unfortunately, everyone appears to be more concerned with being independent now than with being cooperative. Don't waste energy feeling discouraged or abandoned. Even if you prefer working with a partner, you could surprise yourself with how much you accomplish on your own."
scorpio,2012-03-05,"You are perplexed today because you truly want to be nice to those you love, but your words might not convey compassion or patience. You might even be defensive at first if someone suggests that your behavior is abrupt. However, remaining receptive to feedback increases your self-awareness, enabling you to improve your attitude. Your mind is operating so fast now that it could take a while to catch up with your thoughts."
sagittarius,2012-03-05,"You may feel as if you're riding an intense wave of ingenuity today that empowers you to express yourself. However, sharing your talents isn't only fun and games; it could leave you emotionally exhausted after a frenetic period of heightened productivity. Allow time for resting between the outbursts of energy so you can sustain your creative streak."
capricorn,2012-03-05,"You run the risk of overextending your luck today, so it's wise to moderate your extreme emotional reactions with cool logic. Unfortunately, being objective isn't as simple as it sounds because you don't want to miss an exciting opportunity now. Don't let self-doubt hijack your day if things are looking good. But keep in mind that the situation is not as urgent as you think; wait until you can respond in a calm and collected manner."
aquarius,2012-03-05,"You may think that throwing caution to the wind is a brilliant move today as your excitement overwhelms old fears. But you cannot get away with taking any shortcuts now, and you could face a hard lesson if you don't follow the rules. Adhering to the proper procedures seems like it will only slow you down; however, you will reach your goals quicker than expected if you take a conservative approach."
pisces,2012-03-05,"Watch your finances today or you may end up buying something you don't really need. Unfortunately, you might not even realize how much you spent until after the deal is finalized. However, unpredictable Uranus in your 2nd House of Money could also bring an unexpected windfall. Whether it's rags or riches now, you have a casual relationship with things of value, making it very important to think about what you're doing with your money before it's too late."
aries,2012-03-06,"Think before you act because the brash Leo Moon amplifies your impulsive tendencies. Your instincts are usually good, but your irrepressible need for independence today might lead you astray. If a friend or co-worker is critical of your shortsightedness, listen to what is being said instead of immediately going on the defense. Steering clear of an argument now could open the path to learning a very useful lesson."
taurus,2012-03-06,"Your stubbornness might be helpful today if someone attempts to pull you off course; however, your inflexibility can also complicate circumstances. You could unwittingly dig yourself into a hole now if you overstate your position and then try to defend it, anyhow. Be smart by finding problems before they become critical issues. If everything seems perfect, you're probably not looking hard enough."
gemini,2012-03-06,"You are usually clever enough to divert someone's attention away from a problem. But the tables are turned today and you're the one who wants to share a troublesome issue that's weighing on your mind. However, the conversation won't automatically go well just because you're able to initiate a discussion on a delicate subject. If you choose to keep your feet on the ground, the path may be a difficult one at first. Nevertheless, you will feel a great sense of relief when everything is finally out in the open."
cancer,2012-03-06,"Although it seems like a good day to come out of your shell, it won't be as easy as you expect. You may have to cut through a thick emotional blanket that has descended over you. Your life is further complicated today by your heightened sensitivity to other people's feelings, and worrying about their reactions now makes it harder to remain true to yourself. Nevertheless, it's more important to maintain healthy boundaries than monitoring every word you say. Don't mix up other people's fears with your own."
leo,2012-03-06,"You may allow your feelings to surface without resisting today, leading you to be very expressive, especially if you have recently withheld any anger. But your co-workers don't want to hear your negativity and they might not allow you to ramble on. Their responses to your emotional disclosure can upset you even more. However, you may be agitated now because of a hurtful memory; the present moment isn't as intense as it seems. Be gentle with your judgments before you say something you might regret."
virgo,2012-03-06,"It's not that easy to trust your logic today, even though that is what you usually prefer. Your subjective impressions are strong now and you're easily provoked to express an irrational opinion. You may believe that someone is intimidating you into engaging in a battle of words, but struggling too hard can precipitate a conflict that turns everyone into a loser. Strive for a sensible solution that's built on cooperation rather than competition."
libra,2012-03-06,"You have been pulled in two conflicting directions for a while, but today it appears that you're beginning to gain the clarity you need. Your preferences may be different from those around you now, and you cannot easily share your intentions because you're afraid of letting someone down. Unfortunately, excessive self-restraint can lead to disappointment in yourself, so find the strength to say what's on your mind. Getting your feelings out in the open will be therapeutic for your self-esteem."
scorpio,2012-03-06,"You're not in the mood to put on a show at work just to make someone else feel good. However, if you're able to tap into your creativity today, anything is possible. Although you cannot fake optimism or enthusiasm, you might get so lost in your fantasies now that they seem completely real. Dramatizing a true belief can turn your performance into a stellar one that everyone will remember for a long time to come."
sagittarius,2012-03-06,"A resurgence of confidence may inspire risky behavior today, especially if you think you're running out of time. Although you're able to express your opinions without restraint, it's helpful to be sensible in your approach because you might appear pushier than you realize. Don't get so caught up in your inner world that you think everything you do is okay. Take a few steps back to give others a little breathing room. You have a better chance of accomplishing your goals now if you're not in such a hurry."
capricorn,2012-03-06,"Being enthusiastic about starting a new project helps motivate you to work harder, but your ambition may seem overwhelming to others today. Fortunately, you're usually able to meter out your excitement in a methodical manner in order to be most effective. However, your feelings might get in the way of your calculated success now unless you temper your drive with a bit of common sense."
aquarius,2012-03-06,"You might think that other people's expectations are so high now that you cannot deliver on the demands being placed on you. Although you'll probably come through with flying colors, you're afraid of disappointing your co-workers. Someone in particular could be pushing you too hard and your natural response is to push back. Although a defensive attitude won't help, cooperating with your workmates as much as possible can turn you into a hero."
pisces,2012-03-06,"You may inadvertently create problems for yourself today if you decide early on that you know what's best for everyone else. Even if you are clear about the current situation, you could put too much significance on a minor detail instead of considering the whole picture. Changing your strategy isn't easy, but incorporating other people's ideas brings much better results now than obstinately sticking to your previous plan."
aries,2012-03-07,"You may say something that is very obvious to you, yet someone could be caught off guard by your unconventional perspective. Unfortunately, there might be a real difference between your intentions and what others think you mean. Even if you carefully pick your words today, you still may be misunderstood. Patience and persistence are your allies now. There's no need to overreact; take the time to thoroughly discuss your ideas so they are communicated with precision."
taurus,2012-03-07,"You are pretty sure of yourself today, and may grow tired of having to explain your intentions one more time. You don't understand why you need to go over all the details again, but your recent actions might have conveyed a different message. Instead of being annoyed that you must review plans that you thought were already good to go, grab this opportunity to take a good idea and make it even better."
gemini,2012-03-07,"You're growing tired of how much effort it takes to get anything accomplished, but you're determined to handle any concerns that arise from your recent decisions. However, you need to be careful that you don't spend too much time focusing on details that are relatively unimportant. Having everything perfectly in place would be nice, but not if it prevents you from progressing with your plans."
cancer,2012-03-07,"If a friend or co-worker has something to tell you today, be smart and take the time to listen. It may seem as if others are on your case and their criticism might elicit feelings of remorse on your part. But too much guilt isn't useful now, so process any negative emotions right away. Instead, courageously address the underlying issue that's standing in your way of success. Once you face your own music, you can change your tune and move on."
leo,2012-03-07,"You could try to resist the inevitable today, but the more you fight against your responsibilities, the more difficult it is to fulfill them. Instead of over-analyzing the situation and fantasizing about something fun you would rather be doing now, just make the best of what's on your plate. But don't try to placate others with your words; once you know what you have to do, inform everyone of your intentions as matter-of-factly as you can."
virgo,2012-03-07,"Sometimes being creative is a playful interpretation of your ideas, but at other times it's simply hard work. Thankfully, you get the best of both worlds today as your pragmatic approach to a project empowers you to be inspired without sacrificing productivity. Don't attempt to push your vision along in order to be more efficient. Just stick with what you already know and express what you feel as succinctly as possible."
libra,2012-03-07,"You can take whatever you start too far today because your creative approach feels exhilarating and you're inclined to run with it. But expressing yourself artistically to raise your self-esteem is not the wisest application of your passing inspiration. Rather than trying to grandstand for personal gain, just pay attention to your imagination and follow its lead wherever it takes you."
scorpio,2012-03-07,"Your co-workers think that you can do nearly anything now as you juggle schedules and make impossible tasks disappear as if by magic. Meanwhile, you may be worried that you won't be able to meet the unrealistic expectations that continue to balloon out of control. However, don't underestimate your abilities today; you might be pleasantly surprised by your accomplishments."
sagittarius,2012-03-07,"Narrowing your scope of operations today enables you to make the most of your limited energy. Thankfully, your willpower is strong now; whatever you believe can actually come true if you're willing to remain vigilant throughout the day. Your first inclination is to say yes when someone asks for a favor, but take a few deep breaths before responding. Think about the consequences of assuming more obligations prior to fulfilling your previous commitments."
capricorn,2012-03-07,"This is a very significant time, even if everything seems to be moving along smoothly. Instead of simply going with the flow and responding to events as they surface, assume control over your life by making your own waves and then surfing on them to your destination. Don't wait for something to happen; tune up your plan and put it into motion. Naturally, you may have to make some adjustments later on, but it's still better to start now before it's too late."
aquarius,2012-03-07,"Although you might be tempted to keep your thoughts to yourself today, your impact at work is minimal if you remain silent. Your rational outlook makes sense to those around you, enabling you to change people's minds. Don't worry about what others might think; just let them know what you're planning. Your positive influence will be greater as long as you can detach yourself from the immediate outcome."
pisces,2012-03-07,"Although you might believe that others are resisting your efforts, you're probably receiving more support than you realize. Instead of acting defensively, listen carefully to what everyone is saying. This is not the best time to start a project by yourself, so don't exclude possible allies just because they disagree with part of your plan. Flexibility makes the difference between failure and success. Be willing to modify your strategy instead of attempting to do it all on your own."
aries,2012-03-08,"You can't figure out what is making you anxious now, so you might as well stop trying. It's as if someone keeps changing the prescription for the lenses of your glasses, making it nearly impossible to trust your eyes. Even if you believe you know what's happening, the facts might not add up quite right. Your best bet is to temporarily give up trying to understand the big picture. Instead of knowing a bit about everything, you will be better off if you attend directly to the tasks at hand."
taurus,2012-03-08,"You have a fun-loving approach to your life today because you can see things in new ways. Although your perspective is still changing, you're not afraid to experiment now -- and you probably won't have regrets when it's all done. Nevertheless, it can be problematic if you skip over important details because they could impact a work-related decision. Ultimately, ignorance isn't bliss; pursue the truth rather than only seeking pleasure."
gemini,2012-03-08,"Today's picky Virgo Full Moon tensely squares your not-so-picky Sun sign, emphasizing conflict that may not be productive. However, you could actually benefit from the stress because it motivates you to make a decision. You're at a fork in the road; choose one path and live with the consequences of your choice -- but don't wait any longer. The moment is now."
cancer,2012-03-08,"You wish that other people could be as responsible as you are, but you're not in a position to pick on them for their shortcomings. The critical Virgo Full Moon helps you understand that your judgment might actually be about yourself. Consider why you are tempted now to just walk away from all your obligations. There's no need to rationalize your emotions. Just don't be so hard on someone who is simply doing what you wish you could do yourself."
leo,2012-03-08,"The Virgo Full Moon in your 2nd House of Core Beliefs tests your values by confronting you with uncertainty. You are spinning in circles because there may be hidden influences that are destabilizing your world. However, you can't fight if you're unable to see your enemy or the source of a problem. Don't try to control something that's beyond your reach. Remember, happiness may be a temporary reward for practicing flexibility."
virgo,2012-03-08,"Today's Full Moon in your sign heightens your emotional sensitivity, even if you wish you could be more rational. Your feelings may not be very stable now, especially if you are trying to build a relationship on a false assumption. Current changes aren't necessarily long-lasting, but you would be wise to pay attention to what is falling apart. Don't allow yourself to get pulled off track; demonstrate your strength by focusing on what needs to be fixed."
libra,2012-03-08,"Your emotions might not conform to other people's expectations, and this can create both excitement and frustration. Don't be overly concerned if today's Full Moon in your 12th House of Imagination means that you cannot neatly fit into a compartment that someone has created for you. Your unconventional energy will eventually settle back down, but it could take a few more days. Give yourself sufficient time to do things your own way and your closest friends will support you."
scorpio,2012-03-08,"The sensible Virgo Full Moon in your 11th House of Long-Term Goals could activate dreams of future times and distant lands. Your friends may not understand what's happening when you close your eyes and check out of a conversation for a brief moment. Contrary to their assumptions, you're not escaping; instead, you're engaging in important creative work. But even if you are drifting in and out of your imagination, be practical as you set the stage for what's ahead."
sagittarius,2012-03-08,"Today's concentrating Virgo Full Moon squares your expansive sign, adding stress to an already tricky situation. There isn't much that you can do now to bridge the gulf between the practical details and your broad scope of thinking. Thankfully, the simple act of consciously paying attention to your feelings as they occur can help you navigate through the turmoil. But don't try to force dramatic change; it's enough to just acknowledge your needs to someone you trust."
capricorn,2012-03-08,It's not easy to keep things in perspective today because the narrowing Virgo Full Moon shines in your 9th House of Big Ideas. A tiny detail may suddenly become your primary concern while a project you have been working on morphs into something different. Your leadership role is changing in ways you didn't expect. But there's no need to get bent out of shape because radical action isn't going to help you in the long run. Staying calm while continuing to work methodically is your best strategy now.
aquarius,2012-03-08,"You could be struggling with fundamental questions about reality as the Virgo Full Moon falls in your 8th House of Transformation. A current situation may become unmanageable now, and profound changes make it impossible to figure out what to do. However, this is not a result of your lack of competence, so push away any self-doubt. Rather, it's difficult to act with confidence in such unstable times. Postpone important decisions until next week when clarity returns."
pisces,2012-03-08,"You may be feeling the full effects of this Virgo Full Moon that is engaging in a tug of war with the willful Sun in your sensitive sign. A friend or partner might be very demanding now. Even if an emotional interaction seems overwhelming, remember that you can retreat if you want a bit of breathing room. Take care of yourself first today and then you will have more compassion for others."
aries,2012-03-09,"Someone you know may be sitting on the fence today and nothing you do or say seems to be enough to push him or her one way or the other. Instead of working yourself into a state of anxiety, stop and think about your part in creating this uncomfortable position. Your insecurity might be more of a problem than another person's ambivalence. There's nothing to be gained now by forcing a decision prematurely. Give others the chance to make their own choices at their own pace."
taurus,2012-03-09,"You may be concerned that you will lose an exciting opportunity if you don't share what's on your mind immediately. However, your current sense of urgency might not be supported by the facts. Although you are prone to overreact today, time still could be running out -- just not as quickly as you think. Your enthusiasm is contagious, yet slowing down your delivery gets your message across more effectively."
gemini,2012-03-09,"Your ruling planet Mercury continues to bombard you with a stream of thoughts. Normally, you like mental activity, but you could grow anxious now if you can't process your ideas as fast as they pop up. Instead of attempting to integrate every notion that surfaces, let go of the less important ones. It's more crucial to set sensible priorities today than trying to follow every whim."
cancer,2012-03-09,"Your uncertainty about a family matter is easily misinterpreted today by someone who thinks you don't care. But the nurturing Moon's current visit to your 4th House of Domestic Conditions indicates that nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, you may be overly sympathetic to both sides of the issue. Tell those you love how you feel to avoid any misunderstandings. There is no rush to make a decision as long as you're being perfectly honest."
leo,2012-03-09,"You might play the role of a diplomat or peacemaker today if you find yourself in the middle of a conflict. Currently, your job is to act as a go-between for the disagreeing parties. Even if you have your own opinion, keep it to yourself. Don't let anyone trick you into taking sides or you could lose your neutrality, along with your ability to assist others in establishing common ground."
virgo,2012-03-09,"You're not overly concerned about holding on to a long-held belief today, but this doesn't suggest that you're a pushover if someone tries to persuade you to support a different point of view. However, you might surprise a friend or associate by how quickly you can shut down in order to defend your core values if you're feeling cornered. Ultimately, maintaining healthy boundaries right from the start is a better strategy than overcompensating after the fact."
libra,2012-03-09,"You may believe everything is copasetic with a co-worker or friend, only to realize that you missed an essential fact. Meanwhile, others might lose patience with you because they assumed you already knew the truth. However, it really doesn't matter whether the error was yours or if information was purposefully withheld. What's most important now is that you learn from your experience and then move on."
scorpio,2012-03-09,"You usually have more going on than others realize, and today you can take this complexity to an entirely new level. Presenting a smile to cover deeper concerns may not feel comfortable, yet it could be an effective way now to make it through the day. You will have an opportunity to clear the air of hidden emotions soon enough, but there's no need to rush the moment."
sagittarius,2012-03-09,"Looking ahead to the future is enjoyable if you already have exciting plans. However, the Moon's current visit to your 11th House of Long-Term Goals indicates there are multiple possibilities on the horizon. You're not tied to one specific outcome now, so feel free to create a variety of adventures in your mind before choosing one to make real. Fantasizing about your great escape is the first step to making it a reality."
capricorn,2012-03-09,"Playing it cool at work may not convey what you're really feeling today. Although you would prefer to show others your objectivity and detachment, they could misunderstand your understated approach, assuming that you don't care enough to engage passionately. Thankfully, you can remain fully involved without necessarily having to be overly emotional about your goals. Just be sure to let others know that what they're doing truly matters."
aquarius,2012-03-09,"A trusted friend or family member might say something that strikes you as rather odd today. Although you may try to let it go, you could become stuck on this moment until you figure out what's upsetting you. Keep in mind that you don't have to wait until a question grows into a full-blown problem before you deal with it. Express your concerns as they arise, instead of walking away from a potentially uncomfortable discussion."
pisces,2012-03-09,"It's nearly impossible to understand other people's motives now, for they are probably only presenting part of the picture in their interactions with you. Although an abundance of useful information may be lurking beneath the surface, you're not likely interested in spending your time unwrapping layers of the onion to get to the center. Instead of looking for answers you don't have, just work with what you already know."
aries,2012-03-10,"You can sense that your relationships are evolving, but you may feel that your forward progress is coming to a halt as interactive Mercury in your sign slows down to begin its retrograde period on Monday. Perhaps you are feeling differently than normal, as if you've remembered something from a dream. However, the image sticks with you now, even when you're awake. Schedule time to meditate because your subconscious has important messages to reveal to you."
taurus,2012-03-10,"You know that there's still work to do, but the long-term prognosis is looking so good that you could get lackadaisical about your obligations. Don't wait until it's too late to energize your determination. It's fine to listen to your favorite music, eat delicious food and have other pleasurable experiences, but attend to your current responsibilities first or you won't be able to fully enjoy yourself."
gemini,2012-03-10,"You may be concerned that your recent surge of energy won't last as your key planet Mercury begins its retrograde phase on Monday. Instead of trying to start new projects this weekend, consider completing as many unfinished tasks as possible. Although you might be frustrated that you cannot do everything that you want, it will be easier to tie up loose ends now than in the weeks to follow."
cancer,2012-03-10,"The hectic pace at work might have become too much to handle recently; thankfully, the busyness could begin to settle down next week. Nevertheless, it would be helpful to take time over the weekend to think about ways in which you could explore new avenues for growth, rather than just showing up at your job every day and doing what's expected. Having a good strategy in place prepares you to meet the challenges ahead while also enabling you to pursue a new opportunity."
leo,2012-03-10,"You aren't very motivated to attend to your chores today, yet there are so many things to do that you cannot justify taking the day off. Complaining won't help; it will only shift your attitude into a more negative place. Instead of talking about what is preventing you from having fun, imagine fulfilling your obligations effortlessly and then actually being free to enjoy yourself. If you can visualize the results of your hard work, it will be easier to accomplish what is most important now."
virgo,2012-03-10,"On one hand, you're not feeling very practical now and you can imagine relaxing with a special friend. On the other hand, you can clearly see the positive consequences of methodically checking off items on your to-do list one at a time. Although you may be in an imaginative phase, dreaming about your secret life as a rock star, dancer or artist, it's not wise to abandon your responsibilities. Take care of business today and follow your heart tomorrow."
libra,2012-03-10,"The Moon's visit to your sign leaves you feeling moodier than usual. It may seem as if you are being pushed and pulled between extreme likes and dislikes, and you cannot anchor yourself in the real world. There's no need to try to hide your emotions because they are too close to the surface. Even if you pretend that everything is okay, others will see both sides now. Stop resisting; those who matter will accept you just as you are."
scorpio,2012-03-10,"This can be a rather dreamy day for you with the Moon's presence in your 12th House of Fantasy. Although you're not normally the type to avoid work, you are tempted to make a quick escape now. Listening to your favorite music or getting lost in a movie seems like a wonderful idea. Fortunately, the solution is to set aside time during the day to refresh your imaginative energies by doing whatever sounds best. Just don't ignore your basic responsibilities or you'll be in hot water tomorrow."
sagittarius,2012-03-10,"Today is perfect for spending time with friends to catch up on the past and talk about the future. Although you like the variety of such interesting communication, discussions can suddenly take you into totally unexpected directions. Don't try to control the outcome of a conversation now; you might be pleasantly surprised by what comes up and where it leads."
capricorn,2012-03-10,"You often seem as steady as a rock, which encourages others to rely on you. Although you try to do what you promise, your promises can be much bigger now than your ability to fulfill them. Consider your motives; if you're accepting new responsibilities so someone will like you, think again before saying yes. However, if your commitment is truly for the benefit of all involved, you might just be able to muster up enough stamina to realize your dreams."
aquarius,2012-03-10,"The more you try to explain yourself today, the less clear your message becomes. Instead of wasting time struggling with this dilemma, let it pass naturally. Others might see you as a dreamer, but it's only a temporary phase. By this evening, you'll likely be back to your rational self and once again everyone will know where you stand."
pisces,2012-03-10,"You're ready to enjoy the day relaxing and daydreaming, but everyone else seems annoyingly serious. You could grow frustrated if a friend or partner wants you to be more practical about how you prioritize your time now. Although you understand their feelings, you still may resist their efforts to change your plans. Reassure others that once you take some time for yourself you will return to your work with renewed enthusiasm."
aries,2012-03-11,"Managing your time is complicated today. It's hard to tell where your self-assuredness is coming from, but you don't have the time or energy to pursue answers through endless analysis. It really doesn't matter whether or not you even have a long-term plan; just set your goals high and do your best to reach them. Do something productive right now; it's more useful than thinking about what you could do sometime in the future."
taurus,2012-03-11,"It may seem as if other people are giving you a hard time, but, surprisingly, they come to your rescue when you need their support. However, you must be open-minded to receive what others have to offer now, or you could miss your opportunity to be helped over a rough spot. There's no need to show your superiority; don't let your pride get in the way of accepting the love that's around you."
gemini,2012-03-11,"No matter how determined you are to enjoy yourself today, you're still likely to feel overwhelmed by all you have to do. Although you may have a plan, it's hard to stick to it. It's easier to just do whatever seems most important along the way. Unfortunately, time is running out and you'll have even less of it later on. You can have fun another day; put your best foot forward now by finishing one small task at a time."
cancer,2012-03-11,"Although it's difficult to take your mind off work these days, you may be distracted by strong desires now, whether or not they are convenient. However, ignoring your feelings isn't a viable option, since they'll remain persistent if you do. Surrendering to the inevitable is more sensible than resisting it. Letting go of control allows your fears to transform into trust, which, in turn, opens the door to more productive courses of action."
leo,2012-03-11,"You might not have an obvious reason to be more self-confident today, yet it feels as if you're being guided by some mysterious force. Nothing will be gained by questioning if this assistance is real; just listen to your intuition. No matter how you choose to rationalize your current experience, rest assured that acting on a hunch that's good for everyone involved is the right thing to do."
virgo,2012-03-11,"You might not be ready to trust your choices today, but gathering more facts isn't the answer. Nevertheless, you still may want additional training or other people's advice. Even if you're concerned about the conflict between your head and your heart, it's time to let your passion guide you. Forget about finding logical justifications for something you already want to do. Listen to your instincts now; they will reveal what you need to know."
libra,2012-03-11,"Sharing your vision for the future can be a powerful catalyst today for your entire family. However, no one is interested in more data now, so reciting facts and figures to back up your ideas is a waste of energy. If you try to coerce others to support your plan, they may end up making empty promises just to placate you. Don't rely on anyone else to make your dreams come true."
scorpio,2012-03-11,"Your intensity can be tough for someone to handle, yet you don't want to add more stress to an already tricky situation. On one hand, everything might seem more difficult than it has to be today. On the other hand, you're still willing to follow an over-complicated plan because you have a very clear, but unpopular, perspective. Fortunately, you have the power to raise the overall mood by simply choosing to acknowledge the good in everything and everyone."
sagittarius,2012-03-11,"You want others to see you shining in the best possible light today because you believe that your actions will inspire them. Thankfully, you can stay far enough ahead of everyone else now that it seems as if you're a natural born leader. Fortunately, you don't have to do anything differently from what you've done in the past. You can have a positive impact if you just act on your feelings honestly and with integrity."
capricorn,2012-03-11,"You have been calculating your options and weighing the pros and cons to your ambitious plans. You still want to do the right thing, but the most sensible course of progress is becoming more muddled with crosscurrents from other people's ideas. Your closest friends and allies support you, but they may withdraw once they realize how little there is for them to do. Fortunately, your stability is growing stronger, enabling you to wait out the confusion. Allow a couple of days before making a significant move."
aquarius,2012-03-11,"You are ready to take charge today because you intuitively know what has to happen next. However, close friends and family members are not so quick to relinquish their power to you. Caution is advised; don't assume an authoritative role just so you can demonstrate your competence. It's wise to avoid direct confrontation now. Meanwhile, make sure you're smiling if you are caught in the spotlight."
pisces,2012-03-11,"You may be anticipating something special today, but a miracle isn't likely. Even still, serious healing magic can unfold right before your eyes as long as you don't attempt to force anything to happen. Stand back so others have a bit of breathing room. Above all, don't push your perspective on anyone else. Swim like a Fish in a school and, for now, take the course of least resistance."
aries,2012-03-12,"Today's retrograde turn of Mercury is all about you because the trickster is back-stepping in your sign. Routines that you recently established may start to fall apart. But try to avoid the trap of thinking that everything has to be fixed right away. Prevent frustration by doing what is needed while cutting yourself some slack along the way. Practicing patience isn't always easy for you, but it certainly can help now."
taurus,2012-03-12,"Your thoughts may be out of step with what you're doing today. Although you can see some progress, the logical part of your mind is analyzing your current situation and re-evaluating your plans for the next few weeks. Don't make any changes yet; the underlying stability could outlast your temporary uncertainty. Nevertheless, be prepared to change your mind a few times in the days ahead."
gemini,2012-03-12,"You are already thinking about your friends and associates these days because Mercury is visiting your 11th House of the Future. Now, however, as your key planet turns retrograde, you are reconsidering your strategy and want to share your revised ideas with others. Discussing your dreams isn't about wasting time; it's a prelude to the practical planning that will follow as you imagine the possibilities ahead."
cancer,2012-03-12,"Your role in the family or in the community may be integrally connected with your career now. Perhaps these last weeks have been busy as you've tried to finish a complicated job. Now, however, you realize that there's more work to do as others point out the missing pieces of the puzzle. There's no reason to get defensive; simply make plans to redo whatever is necessary."
leo,2012-03-12,"Your goals have expanded beyond your original plans, yet now you begin to realize that you need to scale back your vision and bring your expectations back down to earth. Clever Mercury's retrograde turn in your 9th House of Big Ideas helps you to see where your strategy is not supported by reality. Maintain a positive attitude about your aspirations while reviewing the steps that are required to successfully reach your destination."
virgo,2012-03-12,"You are hypersensitive when the winged messenger turns backward because Mercury is your ruling planet. It becomes challenging to complete your sentences because the right words seem just out of reach. But you cannot move forward now without including others in your plans, even if they slow you down. If the heightened buzz starts to exhaust you, ease up on the caffeine, get more exercise and do whatever helps you to relax. There's no need to let your nerves get the best of you."
libra,2012-03-12,"Mischievous Mercury has slammed on the brakes and is backing up while visiting your 7th House of Relationships. You may feel as if things are stagnating in a partnership until you address important issues through honest communication. Getting started isn't easy, but keep in mind that this is an opportunity to revitalize the excitement that has become subdued. Interpersonal dynamics can change quickly, even if they are currently stuck in a difficult place."
scorpio,2012-03-12,"It's challenging to know how best to improve the quality of your life now that Mercury is turning retrograde in your 6th House of Habits. Normally, you're quite adept at managing the complexities of modern living, but you may be preoccupied these days by the practical demands of your everyday routine. Without your attention, the daily grind could quickly unwind. Thankfully, if you remain vigilant to the details for the next few weeks, the bigger decisions will likely fall into place on their own."
sagittarius,2012-03-12,"This Mercury Retrograde phase can be very beneficial, but you might need to revisit old issues, which makes you feel like you're running in circles. Fortunately, the messenger planet is backtracking in your 5th House of Play, so this period of review could bring more fun and creativity into your life. However, you may have to go with the flow, even if it's pulling you in the wrong direction. Don't worry about reaching your destination now; just practice acknowledging the power of the present moment."
capricorn,2012-03-12,"You can be a champion at overcoming obstacles, especially when they stand between you and your goals. Although you are usually cautious and calculating when it comes to dealing with resistance, your current impatience may get the best of you now. There's a part of you that's ready to bulldoze your way through whatever is standing in your way. Unfortunately, impulsive aggression won't work. Don't do anything drastic today; just rethink your options and act only when the time is right."
aquarius,2012-03-12,"You may be your own biggest enemy today as you inadvertently work against your success. Although you feel quite resistant to change, the pressure to reconsider your current direction is building all around you. However, it's not sensible to dig in your heels so you can prove to everyone that you know what is right. Proceed slowly if that makes you feel better, but remember that being flexible now will make your life less frustrating in the days ahead."
pisces,2012-03-12,"If you've been concerned about your fiscal instability recently, you probably have more work to do in order to shore up your finances. But don't try to make too many changes too quickly, because you could become so excited now that you act carelessly in a way that negatively affects your bank account. Take your time before making any major decisions; a methodical approach and consistent effort over the next few weeks all but ensures that you'll emerge in better shape."
aries,2012-03-13,"You may be pulled into an emotional drama today, even if you try to keep things light and breezy. You might use a philosophical approach to maintain a positive attitude, but this strategy can often be a way to deny your own feelings. It's sensible to walk on the sunny side of the street; however, treasures are waiting to be discovered if only you're courageous enough to step into the shadows."
taurus,2012-03-13,"You aren't interested in idle chatter today, because you're eager to enjoy yourself and you don't want to waste your precious time. However, you want your pleasurable moments to also be meaningful as your key planet Venus harmonizes with opinionated Jupiter and perceptive Pluto. In fact, you may be so driven on your quest that you unintentionally open Pandora's Box. Your exploration might release more than you want to deal with now, but digging into a sensitive topic can bring emotional rewards beyond your expectations."
gemini,2012-03-13,"You may choose to hide certain uncomfortable feelings today because you believe that it will be easier to enjoy yourself if you do. Although others may support your efforts to have fun at first, they could grow tired of your evasive tactics as the day wears on. Instead of waiting for someone to ask you what's wrong, take the lead by sharing your heart's desires. Being proactive enables you to strengthen a significant relationship."
cancer,2012-03-13,"Your friends and co-workers might think you are more flexible about your future than you actually are now. In fact, you have a fixed agenda and may not be willing to make changes to adapt to someone else's needs. Fortunately, you'll probably receive the support you want as long as you don't become arrogant or demanding. Although the outcome will likely meet your expectations, reaching your goals could take more time than you imagined."
leo,2012-03-13,"Your high level of integrity can garner the respect of your peers as they acknowledge that you are fully walking your talk today. Your intentions are honorable and are clearly reflected in your actions as you hold yourself to the same impeccable standards you expect from everyone else. However, you could quickly fall from grace if you allow self-righteousness to creep into your attitude. Humility keeps the energy moving in a positive direction."
virgo,2012-03-13,"Contrary to the beliefs of others, your practical approach to life doesn't make you any less passionate about your goals. Your desires may be so intense today that you become overly obsessive about what you want and how you're going to get it. Ironically, your natural pragmatism reveals ways to put your extreme emotions to good use. Self-motivation gives you the boost you need now, but it's up to you to take action and make something special happen."
libra,2012-03-13,"Your key planet Venus is blessed today and brings you sweet pleasure. But enjoyment is a double-edged sword because Venus is under the spell of ruthless Pluto, raising the emotional ante of the game. Although there's no stopping you if you know what you want, your desires may be so strong now that you don't know when to quit. Before overstepping someone's boundaries, take a few minutes to consider if your preferred outcome is actually worth the cost."
scorpio,2012-03-13,"No one can persuade you to change your mind today because you are so determined about what you want, whether or not it is what you actually need. Insatiable Venus aligns with your key planet Pluto, driving your desires even deeper than usual. Venus also joins overindulgent Jupiter, encouraging you to take a good thing too far. Finding a healthy outlet for your current passion is an admirable goal as long as you remain aware of other people's feelings, too."
sagittarius,2012-03-13,"Feelings of confidence continue to amplify today, overpowering any residual self-doubt. Even if you have overextended your reach, somehow you're able to magically put it all together and make things work as if you were in complete control the entire time. Your overstated optimism may drive others mad now, but they will forgive you once you start pulling rabbits out of every hat you touch."
capricorn,2012-03-13,"You are likely to bite off more than you can possibly chew today, yet you might need to scale back your expectations, even if you're sure you can manage it all. Fortunately, you are a powerhouse now and your energy reserves run deep. Nevertheless, it's still wise to eliminate unnecessary activities so you don't end up exhausted. Exercising a little self-discipline early in the day assures your ability to pursue sweet pleasures later in the evening."
aquarius,2012-03-13,You don't necessarily like the idea of having to cross over into unknown emotional realms today. You might try to keep your interpersonal interactions on an intellectual level because that's where you feel the most confident. But unspoken desires complicate relationship dynamics. Don't be too concerned if you're unsure of yourself. Revealing your softer side now can open the door to deeper friendships or more intimate love.
pisces,2012-03-13,"You can create a new level of stability in an important relationship today, but you may have to make a serious decision along with a commitment. It's tempting to avoid the real issues by just nodding yes or no at the appropriate times, without actually putting your feelings on the line. But if you go the extra distance now and share your dreams, your friend or partner will appreciate your effort and meet you on higher ground."
aries,2012-03-14,"Although you might try to maintain a practical approach to life today, it won't prevent you from impulsively saying yes to a special invitation. Thankfully, you are getting along fabulously with others now that your key planet Mars is harmonizing with lovely Venus. All kinds of relationships are favored as long as your expectations are realistic. Instead of using the current situation as an opportunity to escape from what you should be doing, consider ways to enjoy yourself while furthering your goals."
taurus,2012-03-14,"Your key planet Venus is receiving significant support from assertive Mars now, enabling you to pursue what you want without offending anyone in the process. You don't have to go to war to achieve a victory today; you only need to be honest and speak from your heart. However, prepare to back up your request with action, if needed."
gemini,2012-03-14,"You are more motivated to get ahead these days, and it appears as if your efforts will be rewarded. However, your outward accomplishments may not be as important now as your change of attitude. Even if reaching your goal takes longer than you wish, your self-confidence allows you to shine like a star. Your friends and co-workers support you on your path because they respect you. Don't abuse the trust that is being placed in you; be consistent and follow through with constructive action."
cancer,2012-03-14,"Although you can be a very nurturing friend, you might have a hard time balancing your tender feelings with deeper ones that are working their way to the surface. It's as if there are two sides to your personality now and neither wants to recognize the other. This may be just as confusing to you as it is to others. Nevertheless, you can avoid problems that might arise from a misunderstanding if you're sincere about your complicated intentions right from the start. Honesty will not steer you wrong."
leo,2012-03-14,"Everything appears to be coming up roses today, but there may be problems with those things that are not coming up at all. Instead of concentrating all your attention on the approval you're receiving from others and the good fortune that's coming your way, don't forget to also look within yourself. Reconsider your basic values, review your recent assumptions and uncover hidden issues, even if there are more thorns than flowers. Everything is less scary in the light of awareness."
virgo,2012-03-14,"You are very capable of managing your own life now, but a knight in shining armor may still ride in to save your day. Assistance from a good friend or advice from a co-worker could make your day a lot easier. Naturally, you can be your own superhero, but today's transit is so positive for relationships, it's not wise to go off and do something important on your own. Involving others in your activities allows camaraderie to develop, enabling you to enjoy yourself throughout the day."
libra,2012-03-14,"Your planetary ruler Venus is associated with creativity and beauty. Venus is highly energized by red-hot Mars now, making you feel like jumping right out of your skin. Thankfully, this is much more pleasant than it sounds, for you can express your desires with an assertive flair, especially through direct action and artistic creation. Unfortunately, words might fail you today, so don't bother trying to talk about your emotions; instead, follow your instincts and demonstrate your feelings."
scorpio,2012-03-14,"You are highly attuned to your key planets sexy Mars and passionate Pluto. Luckily, they are receiving harmonious trines from lovely Venus and exuberant Jupiter. You don't have to tone down your intensity today; your powerful emotions are compelling and your friends and acquaintances will probably want more of you rather than less. Just remember to think about your desires before getting someone else involved. Otherwise, you might receive what you wished for, even if it's not in your best interests."
sagittarius,2012-03-14,"This is a big day for you with the Moon still in your optimistic sign, lifting your spirits above the mundane circumstances of your life. Your key planet Jupiter is positively aligned with sensual Venus and energetic Mars, encouraging you to turn your heart's desires into tangible action. Thankfully, expressing your emotions can move you closer to someone you really like. Although love is favored now, don't become so sure of yourself that you miss the obvious signals right in front of your face."
capricorn,2012-03-14,"Sometimes you're not the best communicator when it involves demonstrating emotions that make you feel vulnerable. You tend to do better when you can stay in more rational realms. Today, however, you're ready to take action that clearly expresses your feelings, even if you don't know where the other person stands. It's not time to be shy when it comes to revealing what's in your heart. Softening your boundaries opens up the possibility to love."
aquarius,2012-03-14,"You may feel as if you are sliding down a slippery slope of emotions now as you share your vision of what's ahead. But this isn't about furthering your career goals or finding your purpose in life. This is more about an illogical attraction, a warm and fuzzy feeling that you often steer clear of, especially when you mean business. There's no reason to keep your dreams to yourself; take a risk and tell someone special how much you really care."
pisces,2012-03-14,"Your love buttons may be pushed today, or, perhaps, you are pushing someone else's. In both cases, there's more happening than meets the eye, and, fortunately, what comes to the surface now can be quite pleasant. Don't try to hide your feelings, even if you're worried that things could turn out badly. Be courageous and put your wishes out in the open. If you don't take the chance you'll never know what might have happened."
aries,2012-03-15,"Although you have decided that practicing patience is a wise strategy now, you still may feel like you're jumping out of your skin. You are excited about the future yet you don't know whether to laugh joyfully at the possibilities or scream out of frustration. Your co-workers might be worried about you, but their concerns will probably turn into respect as you pick up steam over the next several weeks."
taurus,2012-03-15,"You may be somewhat subdued today, settling into a calm but steady pace at work. You aren't very concerned with receiving recognition for your personal contributions now; you're more interested in just getting things done right. Your workmates see you as an ideal team player because you're happy to trade anonymity for the overall success of a group project. Don't worry; acknowledgment will come later when you least expect it."
gemini,2012-03-15,"You wish that being observed by others didn't make you feel uncomfortable now, and you may think that you would be happier if you could escape public scrutiny. Whatever you do, you seem to garner more than your fair share of attention; however, you might end up growing more accustomed to the spotlight. Unfortunately, your expressiveness can make someone uneasy. Downplay your starring role in the current project and share the recognition with your co-workers so that everyone feels appreciated."
cancer,2012-03-15,"Although following the rules might not make sense to you now, it's not smart to bite the hand that feeds you. Pay your respects and work within the existing constraints even if they seem illogical. You can always question authority later, especially because rebellious behavior today probably won't make you any friends or influence those who matter. Think about your words before you say anything; a slip of the tongue can start a verbal battle that you would be wise to avoid."
leo,2012-03-15,"You may know better, but it's tempting to say what's on your mind today, especially if you're able to balance the score by uttering a few proper words at exactly the right time. But you might have already decided that some things are better left unsaid. Don't waste your energy by holding a grudge if you have unexpressed anger that needs clearing. Just remember to be kind in your delivery. You'll receive more support than you expect if you steer clear of blaming anyone else for your feelings."
virgo,2012-03-15,"You're usually quite rational in your approach to problem solving; however, a friend or partner could confuse you now, even if your logic is sound. At first, you might doubt your ability to accurately interpret what you hear, but as you listen carefully you realize that you're not the cause of the current misunderstanding. Don't wait until you feel trapped by the little drama; avoid conflict, even if it means walking away without resolution."
libra,2012-03-15,"You may be at odds with a friend or co-worker today, yet you don't understand how things could have cooled off so quickly. Thankfully, a lover's quarrel or a business conflict won't last long if you can maintain respect for each other, no matter how strongly you disagree. Don't force the issue now because tempers might flare without warning. Instead, return to the discussion tomorrow after everyone's emotions have settled down."
scorpio,2012-03-15,"A heated debate with someone at work can rattle your nerves today and pull you off track. Although it seems like you need to settle the score, it's difficult because there's actually no single right answer. You might accept the difference of opinions if you felt that your words were being heard. Don't fight to win;  just be certain that your ideas are acknowledged before letting go and moving on."
sagittarius,2012-03-15,"You may believe that cooling your jets now will help you stabilize your position at work, but new opportunities spark your interest before you slow down enough to matter. If you are wise, you won't take off with an intriguing project until you give the idea time to develop. However, you could become obsessed with your scheme very quickly and try to launch it prematurely. Be smart and downplay your plan until next week."
capricorn,2012-03-15,"Now that the Moon has returned to your pragmatic sign, you might decide that being patient is more sensible than running in circles, trying to achieve impossible results. You could exhaust yourself if you attempt to force a river to flow uphill. It's pointless to fight the powerful currents today, even if they are carrying you away from your destination. The tides will change again; bide your time and let them take you in the right direction."
aquarius,2012-03-15,"You may be more certain about your feelings now, even if a close friend or workmate thinks you're on the wrong track. Luckily, you are wise enough to recognize that it's possible to have differing methods to handle a current issue. Establish common ground and then agree to disagree on the specifics. Instead of arguing about the divergent approaches, focus on your similar core values and build from there."
pisces,2012-03-15,"You feel as if you're in an agreeable state of mind today, but a conflict could heat up if you say more than is necessary. Ironically, attempting to avoid an argument seems to foment it. Unfortunately, you may be more uncertain than you realize about an important issue, and your lack of clarity can fog your communication. If you're not sure about something, simply admit it; being honest prevents headaches and invites intimacy."
aries,2012-03-16,"You might feel as if you're being attacked today by someone who is simply trying to improve your efficiency. But don't be too quick to compromise yourself by changing your behavior to accommodate others. There's no need to pretend that you're willing to modify your approach just to avoid a confrontation. Fortunately, if you're honest about your motives right from the beginning, you will be less likely to provoke any trouble."
taurus,2012-03-16,"Although problems may arise at work today, they will probably be minor ones. Still, you don't need to feed them with your insecurities. Instead, use the down-to-earth Capricorn Moon to plant your best ideas, allowing them to slowly take root for future growth. You might think that you have to disclose all your ideas now, but this assumption can get you into trouble. Patience is one of your innate virtues, so slow down and let everything develop naturally."
gemini,2012-03-16,"You are usually at your best when your world is buzzing with lots of mental stimulation. However, you can get so excited today that you say something that's best kept to yourself. You intuitively recognize that plans may change several times before the day is done. Practicing meditation or breathing techniques can help settle your busy mind."
cancer,2012-03-16,"Someone may come to you with a sensible idea today, but it doesn't fit into your tight schedule. Analyzing all the facts might not help you decide what to do. You could listen to other people's stories yet still resist helping them out. Or you could just jump in, even if it means putting your own issues on the back burner. Go for the assist; it won't be as time consuming as you think and the intangible rewards make it worthwhile."
leo,2012-03-16,"If you come up with a good idea today, you will have to make the effort to see it through. That might seem fair, but why is it that if someone else suggests a plan now, you are still the one who has more work to do? Unfortunately, changing these inequitable dynamics appears to be beyond your reach. Although you want more control of your own life, it's better to do what's expected of you now. You'll have a chance to put things back in balance soon enough."
virgo,2012-03-16,"You may be thankful today because your common sense is keeping you in line. Although one part of you is bored with the regular routine, you might not be ready to break free just yet. Even if you're raring to go, others are counting on your stability, so bolting isn't necessarily a wise move. Hold on to your horses; waiting for the right time to initiate action is always a smart idea."
libra,2012-03-16,"It may be difficult to understand how your own fears influence your judgments and push you toward one decision or another. Just remember that your integrity is ultimately more important than what others think of you. Don't get distracted by the intellectual noise. Enjoy the quiet while you can find it; your thoughts speed up tomorrow, making it harder to reclaim the peace of knowing what's true."
scorpio,2012-03-16,"You have set your heart on a bigger prize today, an emotional treasure that's buried deep beneath the surface. A minor irritation at work can provoke you to withdraw and escape into your imagination, but turning inward now stirs old fears that only get in the way of progress. Unquestionably, it's smarter to deal directly with an annoyance before it turns into something bigger that becomes unmanageable."
sagittarius,2012-03-16,"Make the most of your authority today by sharing your experiences instead of just bossing someone around. You have recently returned to Earth from a journey to the outer limits of possibilities. Thankfully, you can finally hear the voice of common sense, even though it has taken away your wings. Keep both feet on the ground until you see tangible results from your heartfelt efforts."
capricorn,2012-03-16,"Although you may think that time has run out, the game isn't over. Don't trust your senses now, for a trick of light can warp your perceptions to match your desires. There is more going on than meets the eye as the Moon in your sign reminds you that simple logic can't always override an intense feeling. Denial is not a viable strategy, so keep an open mind until your head and your heart are in agreement."
aquarius,2012-03-16,"You might not want others to see how serious you are today because you think their assumptions will paint you into a corner. You're afraid of being stuck in a role you don't want to play. It's important to keep your options open as mischievous Mercury backs into your key planet Uranus over the next couple of days, throwing a few unexpected curve balls and playing tricks on your mind. Don't be overly concerned by what anyone else thinks; you don't need to conform to their expectations."
pisces,2012-03-16,"You may be the conscientious person who holds everyone's interests together today, even if you sacrifice your own point of view in the process. The responsible Capricorn Moon's visit to your 11th House of Teamwork enables you to keep your preferences to yourself in the name of community spirit. Just remember that your feelings are important, too, even if they are temporarily subsumed by the needs of the larger group."
aries,2012-03-17,"You can breathe a sigh of relief today because it seems like tensions are beginning to subside. You might not get the full resolution you want, yet there are positive signs that can't help but make you smile. You may not be in a position to make significant progress yet, but, at least, you're more confident now about what's ahead. Don't be too ambitious; hold your ground and wait for a clear signal before making your move."
taurus,2012-03-17,"You're surprised by how quickly things change today as you are blasted out of your regular routine and shot into a new orbit. Although the quirky Aquarius Moon may not feel comfortable, it sounds a wake-up call that reminds you of radical ideas you might have set aside. Entertain all possibilities now since one of them will be instrumental to your future."
gemini,2012-03-17,"Your growing sense of freedom now may prevent you from having to rebel against the status quo. You might not feel as independent as you ultimately want, but at least some restrictions appear to be lifting. But don't spoil the opportunity to be productive by frittering away the time. Stay as focused as you were under pressure and you could accomplish more than you think possible."
cancer,2012-03-17,"The slow pace of change may not be fast enough for you. You can see how far you have already come on your journey, but there is still a wide gulf between where you are now and where you want to be in the future. However, nothing is to be gained by dwelling on your limitations. Instead of comparing your progress to your dreams, just concentrate on what you're going to do next."
leo,2012-03-17,"Unexpressed feelings continue to bring up unrest in your life, but you don't seem to be able to reach the source of the problem. Paradoxically, the closer you get, the more hidden the answer becomes now. Although it may be wise to dig deep on other occasions, this isn't one of them. Leave the mysteries alone while you focus your attention on those things that are most obvious."
virgo,2012-03-17,"So much has happened in your life over the past couple of months, yet you might not be able to see the changes yet. Although progress continues to be slower than you wish, your life is undergoing a subtle transformation. Instead of thinking about what has gone wrong, direct your energy toward small tasks that you can finish. Instead of working harder, use your brain and work smarter. You have more time than you realize, so don't let self-criticism get in the way of your ultimate success."
libra,2012-03-17,"Instead of worrying about a recent lost opportunity, try a more radical approach like relaxing. Ironically, taking it easy now may take you further toward success than becoming more frustrated by pushing ahead. It's more important now to revitalize your creativity and find some peace of mind. Don't be concerned if you aren't very productive; it could be a few more days before you see the results you want."
scorpio,2012-03-17,"You may choose to disconnect from your emotional roots today because you don't want others to perceive you as being needy. You can outwardly demonstrate an apparent aloofness so no one will suspect that you're really feeling quite vulnerable. However, your strategy might backfire by increasing your sense of isolation. Be courageous; opening your heart to someone you trust helps to resolve your dilemma."
sagittarius,2012-03-17,"Unfinished chores continue to pile up, yet you could find time today for a bit of catching up. You might even be able to relax if you can stay on task. But don't be tempted to take the day off; you have too much going on to check out completely. It may be challenging, but you would be wise to find a healthy balance between work and play. What you do now will have significant consequences in the days ahead."
capricorn,2012-03-17,"A very productive morning goes a long way to easing the current pressure. But if you slack off before you do your chores, you could regret your behavior all too soon. Get busy instead of wasting time thinking about your recent accomplishments or worrying about what you should have already done. Just tie up as many loose ends as possible over the weekend to prepare for the busy week ahead."
aquarius,2012-03-17,"You may feel very tired today, especially if your recent hard work hasn't yet paid off. Even if you haven't reached your goals, you probably have made more headway than you realize, since the moody Moon in your sign might color your perceptions with doubt. But don't shut down your awareness even if you want to escape. Your negativity will fade if you continue to pay careful attention to your emotions so you can put them into a healthy perspective."
pisces,2012-03-17,"Although this may be a time of exciting new beginnings, the Moon's presence in your 12th House of Endings can also bring good fortune if you're willing to look back and finish up old business. But don't get too hooked by the mundane world or you could miss the inspiration that's bubbling up from your subconscious. There are unseen forces at work now and your subtle impressions can be instrumental to guide you through the days ahead."
aries,2012-03-18,"You like the action on a day like this, even if your previous plans fall apart. You might not even care what ultimately happens, because the change is exhilarating and you're up for nearly anything. However, it's a smart strategy to consider a gentler style today because you could scare others away with your overbearing approach. Thankfully, you can still get what you need without offending anyone along the way."
taurus,2012-03-18,"You're bursting with fresh ideas today and, naturally, you want to share them with your best friends. You might even need to arrange an impromptu gathering just so you can kick your plans around with others. Nevertheless, it's not easy to express your thoughts and then let go of them; you may prefer to stick to one and follow it to its logical conclusion. Don't try to slow down your process; just let your mind take you on a thrilling ride without worrying about where it will end."
gemini,2012-03-18,You won't need to drink any extra coffee today because staying awake is not your problem; your current challenge is to stabilize your thinking so you don't exhaust yourself trying to keep pace with your own thoughts. You will accomplish more if you can slow down your delivery enough so everyone can understand what you are saying. Choose each word carefully and you will impress others with your sharp wit and clever originality.
cancer,2012-03-18,"You may consider excusing yourself from a social setting today so you can retreat into your imagination. But you're not trying to escape since you have important issues on your mind now. Your thoughts might be focused on an upcoming trip or you're thinking about learning something entirely new. Thankfully, you'll feel good about going off on your own if you come back with something concrete to share with your friends."
leo,2012-03-18,"You might need to pay an emotional price for intimacy and you're resistant to come up with the entrance fee. However, you're in for a surprise now, because the cost isn't what you expect. You won't have to sacrifice anything, nor will you have to let someone else control your destiny. All you need to do is to express your feelings. If you let others know your concerns sooner than later, they should be more than willing to meet you halfway."
virgo,2012-03-18,"You could feel anxious and high-strung today, with each thought echoing in your head. Unfortunately, your mental reverberations aren't necessarily in tune with a friend or lover who thinks differently than you do. Ultimately, you'll be happier now by spontaneously responding without trying to make sense of everything. Blending rational ideas with irrational feelings will push you to find new ways of interacting."
libra,2012-03-18,"It seems as if nearly everyone has something of interest to distract you from your chores today. Your mind is more receptive than usual to radical ideas and unconventional experiences. You are so eager to express yourself in a nonconformist way that even joining the circus could sound like a good idea. You may believe that you can catch up on fulfilling your obligations later, however, that's more complicated than you might think. Take care of some of your responsibilities along the way to prevent suffering headaches tomorrow."
scorpio,2012-03-18,"Your thoughts are all over the map today and you could work yourself into a state of anxiety if you cannot settle down enough to pick one path. You may feel as if you're wired for sound, and with all channels open, you're tempted to play several songs all at once. Instead of making yourself crazy trying to focus on one data stream at a time, just enjoy listening to the complex mix. Although it might not make sense now, you should be able to untangle all the information next week."
sagittarius,2012-03-18,"Your nervous energy provokes you to spontaneously express yourself before you fully develop an idea. You might begin talking with a specific thought in mind, only to shift direction in the middle of a sentence. Although this extemporaneous communication style often works well for you, it's challenging today to just let your words flow naturally without holding anything back. Stop trying so hard to say the right thing. You may be pleasantly surprised where your free association leads you."
capricorn,2012-03-18,"A close friend or family member might say something totally unexpected today, revealing information that quickly alters your perspective. You may have grown overly comfortable with your particular point of view about a domestic issue only to suddenly realize that you have been wrong. Interactions grow very intense now because your security is at stake. Fortunately, the drama will dissipate tomorrow and you'll have more clarity about what to do next."
aquarius,2012-03-18,"The emotional seas grow a bit choppy now, but you should still sail through the day with flying colors. The Moon in your sign brings your vulnerability right to the surface, and you might not like it at first. But mischievous Mercury's conjunction with your ruling planet Uranus disrupts a simple chore or a quick trip with unexpected delays. Don't struggle too much if you're blown off course for a while; you can reset your bearings when the energy is calmer tomorrow. You have something special to learn about your heart today."
pisces,2012-03-18,"It's difficult to make sense of your thoughts today because they may take you into new and unfamiliar territory. You might feel disconnected from reality and out of touch with your feelings. If others are puzzled because they can't understand you, don't let on that you're mystified, too. Instead, take lots of deep breaths and try to keep your feet on the ground, even if it seems like you're floating into space. Be gentle with yourself; it could take a few days before your imagination returns to Earth."
aries,2012-03-19,"It's difficult to say what you're feeling because your thoughts are so fleeting today. Original ideas are blowing through the caverns of your mind, but you might not be able to actually catch one in flight. You can prevent needless frustration by just sitting back and enjoying the show. Don't worry; you will be able to express yourself more clearly once the Sun enters your sign tomorrow."
taurus,2012-03-19,"It's challenging to see the big picture today as you keep trying to understand something that's just beyond your reach. Your inability to grasp the meaning of recent events could raise issues of trust, since it's hard to be receptive to someone else's perspective when you aren't clear about your own. Fortunately, your persistence should ultimately reveal what you need to know to make a decision now. Don't give up; your determination will be rewarded later on."
gemini,2012-03-19,"You continue to move through tricky communication territory, making it important to watch your words. Luckily, you're more empathic now, which enables you to hear things before they are spoken aloud. Your intuition will likely steer you in the right direction, but it's still confusing if you cannot describe how you know what you know. Keep in mind that a logical explanation is not required at this time. Trust your instincts and speak from your heart."
cancer,2012-03-19,"You may appear lucky today; your hunches are on the money, prompting you to react to your gut feelings in nearly any situation. Instead of taking extra time to explore more alternatives, take advantage of your current ability to know what to do without further analysis. You can always rationalize your response retroactively, but your logic will only get in the way of your intuition now."
leo,2012-03-19,"It's nearly impossible to ignore your feelings in the moment, even if you realize that they don't apply to the current situation. However, your five senses can lead you on a wild goose chase now. If your perceptions are giving you one picture and your subconscious mind is saying something else, it's usually wise to rely on the facts. Nevertheless, listen to your inner voice today; it will lead you in the right direction."
virgo,2012-03-19,"Although your brain is buzzing with original ideas, you might not be at ease with the lack of clarity because of the current planetary emphasis on fuzzy Pisces. Naturally, you prefer accurate communication, but today you have to be satisfied with dreamy images that are shrouded in fog. Don't resist what enters your awareness now. Express your creativity spontaneously without judgment or doubt."
libra,2012-03-19,"You might be so concerned with what others expect from you now that you could pack your schedule with more than you can possibly do. However, you would benefit from giving yourself more time to go with the flow today rather than making too many commitments. Promising too much will only cause you to scatter your energy. You will be pleasantly surprised if you let the currents carry you without too much resistance on your part."
scorpio,2012-03-19,"Your intellectual creativity enables you to express yourself in a positive manner today. Although the possibilities are endless, it still may be challenging for you to shift into gear and get going. It's not that you lack motivation; it's just difficult to stay focused. Breaking out of your regular routine might help. Experiment by doing things differently and you'll be amazed by how easy it is to find your groove."
sagittarius,2012-03-19,"Although you may still struggle with exercising self-restraint, it should be easier today to find a healthy balance between work and play. Your personal life is looking good, but don't just assume that everything will turn out fine on its own. Your view of the world might be a bit distorted now because you're looking at things through rose-colored glasses. Having a positive attitude is empowering, but blind optimism could lead you astray."
capricorn,2012-03-19,"You're not feeling very motivated today because it seems as if your dreams have overtaken the real world. This surreal outlook challenges you to get a handle on what you need to do, and the harder you try, the worse it gets. Happily, this is a great day to lose yourself in a fantasy or visualize an alternative future for yourself. Don't worry about the lack of tangible results now; you will be able to make up for lost time later on."
aquarius,2012-03-19,"You would like to integrate more of your beliefs into the fabric of your everyday life, but someone might question your assumptions now. However, don't waste your energy trying to defend your point of view. You aren't required to find more facts in order to support your position. Instead of justifying your opinions to anyone else today, decide what's most important to you and make your decisions accordingly."
pisces,2012-03-19,"Avoiding the serious issues now won't help you resolve any of the underlying problems. But there's also little value in becoming too somber today. It's tricky business to balance the levity of your feelings with the gravity of your concerns. Obviously, it's not appropriate to escape your responsibilities so you can have fun. However, a bit of lighthearted enjoyment is revitalizing and helps you manage the challenges ahead."
aries,2012-03-20,"Your week is beginning to cook like a stew that continues to get better and better as it simmers. The Sun's visit to your sign inspires you to be at the top of your game for the next four weeks. The energetic buzz of spring is in the air, even if the weather is still cool. You can feel the excitement as you imagine the possibilities that lie ahead. Even if the current situation isn't all you want, be courageous and take a few bold steps in the direction of your dreams."
taurus,2012-03-20,"Something may be drawing to an end, yet this isn't necessarily bad news. Perhaps you have been working with others on a project that is coming to completion. However, you might dig in your heels and hold on to the recent past, especially if you have grown to enjoy the camaraderie. You can still share common goals, so don't be afraid of heading off to a destination that is more consistent with your own individual needs."
gemini,2012-03-20,"The overall emphasis in your life is changing and you must change with it. You have been very involved recently with your career or activities in your community. However, your drive for success may be replaced now with more emphasis on your own personal dreams. Tie up loose ends at work so you have time to re-establish significant friendships that might have fallen to the wayside. Share your visions and hopes for the future with those you trust over the weeks ahead."
cancer,2012-03-20,"You may need to face an old fear about moving into the future, or memories of the past could hold you back. Dynamics at work are changing quickly now and you can shift gears with ease when the timing is right. You know what you need to do, so summon up enough courage to ride these powerful tides with awareness and intention, instead of being pulled under by doubt. If you believe in yourself, nothing can stop you in your pursuit of success."
leo,2012-03-20,"You may feel as if you're in a delicate position because your heightened sense of vulnerability now can pull you one way or another. You could react to the current pressures by protecting yourself and not sharing your softer side. Unfortunately, this defense mechanism can isolate you from loved ones and push your closest allies away. On the other hand, you can set the stage for real intimacy by opening up your heart, even if it hurts. The choice is all yours, whether you realize it or not."
virgo,2012-03-20,"You can tell that you're on the edge of something new today, yet it's too soon to see how everything is going to fall into place. Instead of being frightened by the intensity of your emotions, you're intrigued by the possibilities and excited about exploring new territory now. Although you excel at knowing how to apply your analytical skills, you may also need to trust your intuition. Logic is a useful tool, but it might not be sufficient to get you through these illogical times."
libra,2012-03-20,"Managing relationships is an important part of being a Libra, and now the Sun's visit to your 7th House of Partners shines additional light on the most significant people in your life. Although you may feel as if things are shaky, honest communication can help you regain stability. Thankfully, you won't have to bring up new topics for discussion; instead, revisit a recent conversation with an open mind. It might be easier now to find the common ground that was elusive during your last talk."
scorpio,2012-03-20,"The Sun's shift into your 6th House of Daily Routine can bring the details of your life into sharp focus. However, this may be problematic if others find your desire to fine tune reality a bit too obsessive. But you aren't very concerned with any difficulties someone may have with your feelings because you're preoccupied with the decisions you need to make now. Just remember that there are multiple ways to look at a situation, even if you feel extremely sure about your current perspective. It doesn't hurt to listen to different opinions before making up your mind."
sagittarius,2012-03-20,"Even if you have been feeling creative lately, it hasn't been that easy to get your plans off the ground. Mental Mercury is moving retrograde in your 5th House of Self-Expression, requiring you to review your ideas and edit your words before speaking them out loud. However, the willful Sun's entry into your playful 5th house boosts your confidence. You might be inclined to avoid responsibilities today, but you'll probably have fun once you get yourself moving in the right direction."
capricorn,2012-03-20,"You can tell the tide is changing and you want to make the most of it. You're not one to shift plans on a whim, but now you're ready to head off in a new direction if you believe there's potential for growth. Nevertheless, you're not interested in a temporary distraction or a quick fix; instead you're drawn toward long-term solutions that can stand the test of time. Move slowly and with determination to maximize your chances of success."
aquarius,2012-03-20,"A high level of activity is putting extra demands on your life now. If you feel pressured to respond to a developing situation at home or work, remember that you can't force events to conform to your preferences. You can, however, change how you react to the evolving circumstances. Try a radical strategy, especially if the old one isn't really working anymore."
pisces,2012-03-20,"Although you may think you're ready to make your move today, you would be wise to wait until after Thursday's New Moon. You might already know what you want to do, but you will continue to gain confidence over the next few days. Be prepared to reveal your motives because you'll be more effective if your co-workers understand your intentions. If you fully believe in what you're doing, others will be hard-pressed to withhold their support."
aries,2012-03-21,"Your daydreams follow you everywhere today, making it difficult to answer a question with a simple yes or no. Instead, you can ramble on poetically about nearly anything. This is wonderful if you're a storyteller, but it's not helpful if you have to be precise in your communication. The more you attempt to see through the veil of your fantasies, the harder it is to say what you mean. Be careful with your words now; the most honorable intentions can still provoke an argument if you don't pay attention."
taurus,2012-03-21,"Although common sense is usually very important to your survival, you gain more inspiration now by drifting off into your imagination. You are being invited to step beyond the real world and into the illusory realms of fantasyland. Escape isn't as easy as it sounds for you down-to-earth Bulls, yet it's not as difficult as it might be on another day. Don't be overly concerned if you experience a loss of direction. It's more important to get in touch with your inner artist today than to act rationally. Seek meaning instead of success."
gemini,2012-03-21,"Sharing your goals with friends and associates may feel safe, but it can lead you into a bit of trouble today. Be careful of saying more than you intend. Remember, once something is out of the bag, you won't be able to hide it again. Accept the new reality and move ahead with what others now know about you. It's a waste of energy to stress about what's already out in the open."
cancer,2012-03-21,"You may discover something new at work today that can change your mind about an important issue, even if it doesn't fit into your preconceived beliefs. You might not be able to make much sense of the information, but that doesn't make it any less valid. Often, your initial reaction is to resist acknowledging what you don't want to know. However, you're able to soak it all in now and take it to heart. Strive to integrate what you learn into a cohesive point of view."
leo,2012-03-21,"You can overextend your reach today, especially when sharing new ideas with others. You may be attempting to say too much and expressing thoughts that aren't fully developed in order to sound more confident than you are feeling now. Step into new territory carefully or you could confuse those around you. You might even feel a bit lost yourself. Either way, hiding your insecurity won't help; admit what you don't know. You can breathe a sigh of relief since you don't need to have an answer for everything."
virgo,2012-03-21,"You want to understand the dynamics of a significant relationship now, but you might have to satisfy your curiosity elsewhere. You will eventually discover the truth, but it's not likely to happen today because the cosmic fog is shrouding reality. If your need for accurate data is challenged, you might panic without your usual analytical clarity to rely on. Face your fear of the unknown and move ahead anyhow; you could be in for a lovely surprise."
libra,2012-03-21,"Although you would like to delve into your dreams today, you might not have time for this kind of self-indulgence. You have chores to do, even if you're uncertain about what they are. You're convinced you can finish your tasks, but may be confused about where to begin. In light of your current fuzzy thinking, you would be smart to fall back on your regular routine to get you through the day. There's no need to further complicate your life; you can explore new ground later in the week."
scorpio,2012-03-21,"You're all set to be spontaneous and creative, but something is missing today. You wish you had a better plan of attack because you would feel more self-assured about your work. However, real growth now comes from not knowing where you're heading. Don't try to avoid the tension of uncertainty; instead, lean into it. Put away the map and fly by the seat of your pants. Once you move through your fear, the exhilaration will motivate you to new heights."
sagittarius,2012-03-21,"You're feeling good about your communication with others today and believe that your words are expressing what's in your heart. However, you could be so quick on the uptake that you start a conversation that goes nowhere. Although you can probably get away with saying whatever comes into your mind now, you could blow an exciting opportunity if you don't stick to the subject at hand. Don't stop your mind from wandering; just wait until you know where your thoughts are leading before you open your mouth."
capricorn,2012-03-21,"You like the idea of doing something new and different now, but your fear of failure may override your ambition. You might even want to crawl behind a rock where you don't need to risk your safety. However, even if you do retreat today, you won't be able to hide for long. Trust your intuition without trying to explain your behavior to anyone else. When you're ready to pursue your objectives, your actions will speak louder than your words."
aquarius,2012-03-21,"It's challenging to put your finger on what is bothering you today, but the truth will present itself in due time. It's a waste of energy trying to get answers that are just beyond your reach. But even if you're lacking your usual mental clarity, don't withdraw or give up. Rely on your vision rather than the facts. If you act on good faith now, others will follow your lead and you might just end up saving the day."
pisces,2012-03-21,"Today can feel like a whirlwind of energy because a cycle is coming to an end and you may still have unfinished business to complete. You might be scared of losing what you've gained, especially if there are loose ends that need tying up, but your fears are probably exaggerated. Actually, whatever you finish now is just making room for what's next. Don't retreat; leaning into your discomfort may be enough to precipitate an amazing breakthrough."
aries,2012-03-22,"Today's New Moon falls in your sign, marking a turning point in your year. You are already preparing to make important changes, but have probably experienced a few false starts or setbacks in recent months. Although it might require another month or so to see significant progress, the intentions you set now confirm that the ball is rolling in the right direction. Be ready to start the next part of your journey because there's no going back."
taurus,2012-03-22,"You have so many ideas now that you don't know which way to go as the Aries New Moon plants innovative seeds in your 12th House of Imagination. However, turning an original thought into a tangible plan requires a serious commitment. Fortunately, the Moon's return to your sign this weekend can give you the determination you need to make your dreams come true."

But the Aries New Moon in your 11th House of Long-Term Goals offers you a comprehensive view of the big picture, empowering you to keep returning to your work. Ultimately, your future is up to you. Succumbing to temptations now can make your life more difficult. However, reminding yourself to concentrate will move you consistently closer to your ultimate destination."
cancer,2012-03-22,"The enterprising Aries New Moon invigorates your 10th House of Career today, emboldening you to further your ambitions. You might feel as if you can do anything, but your goals are actually still far away. Nevertheless, dreaming big is a good idea now and you would be shortsighted to hold yourself back. It's better to believe in yourself than to place unnecessary restrictions on your aspirations."
leo,2012-03-22,"Today may be buzzing with excitement because the fiery Aries New Moon is activating your 9th House of Adventure. Even if you have been working too hard, you're currently beginning to see the results of your labor. You might even be confident enough to take some time off to do something enjoyable. If you are thinking about a short vacation, make your plans now. The window of opportunity might close before you climb through it."
virgo,2012-03-22,"Today's enthusiastic Aries New Moon encourages you to involve others in your pet project, yet it's wise to slow down and think about what you're doing first. You are normally practical enough to take sufficient time to attend to details, yet you might be surprised now if your impromptu plan doesn't work out as expected. Avoid the temptation to bolt ahead before you are ready; practicing patience can prevent an unnecessary headache."

You may believe that you're ready to take a risk, but it's still smarter to exercise caution and be considerate along the way."
scorpio,2012-03-22,"Today's Aries New Moon rattles your 6th House of Work, suggesting that you should forget about the big picture for a while and just focus on the details of the day. This strategy may seem counterintuitive, yet it's the most reliable way to accomplish your long-term goals now. After you catch up with your most pressing commitments, you should be able to concentrate more clearly on your dreams for the future."
sagittarius,2012-03-22,"Today's impulsive Aries New Moon buzzes your 5th House of Love and Creativity. You are feeling enthusiastic about the potential for fun in your life, so you might not play your hand too cautiously. But even if you're eager to rush forward and seize the day, you probably won't reach your goals as easily as you expect. Luckily, if you are mentally prepared for a real endurance test, discouragement won't likely take the wind out of your sails."
capricorn,2012-03-22,"Your close friends and family may be urging you to take a risk, even if you're not quite ready to move ahead as fast as they think you should. The Aries New Moon emphasizes your 4th House of Security today, encouraging you to defend your emotional territory and protect your possessions, rather than trying to accumulate anything more. However, you worry that your current lack of ambition could place you at a disadvantage. Keep in mind that there are many kinds of success -- and not all of them are about getting ahead."
aquarius,2012-03-22,"The enthusiastic Aries New Moon can bring so much information that you might not know how to handle it. This noisy lunation occurs in your 3rd House of Communication, increasing the flow of data and challenging you to utilize what you already know. It's great when you have plenty of facts at your disposal, but it's something else to know what to do with them. Slow down and stay in touch with your common sense."
pisces,2012-03-22,"Today's irrepressible Aries New Moon falls in your 2nd House of Personal Resources, possibly misleading you into thinking that your finances are stable enough to spend money that you don't have. Unfortunately, you might not even realize there's a problem until it's too late. Don't pretend that everything's okay if it's not; avoid an unpleasant situation by recognizing the truth before you're in too deep."
aries,2012-03-23,"You may be feeling nervous today because things seem to be simultaneously speeding up and slowing down. Naturally, you like the excitement of so much going on, which encourages you to move faster than the legal limit. Even if you enjoy the pace, give your adrenals an opportunity to replenish your energy. Don't overdraw on your reserves. Breathe deeply and stop what you're doing for a moment. You'll feel better once you relax."
taurus,2012-03-23,"Today you may wish you were on a fishing boat, in a monastery or off on a long hike in the wilderness. In fact, you might prefer to be anywhere that relieves you of having to interact with too many people. It's not that you don't enjoy being with close friends and family; it's just that you have been tugged in too many directions lately and you need a chance to regroup your thoughts. If you are able to engineer some down time, avoid the temptation to fill it with noise. Unplug and listen to your heart."
gemini,2012-03-23,"You are thinking strange thoughts today and you cannot easily get these extra-terrestrial visions out of your mind. What you learn now could play a significant role in your life, and even though you don't know the initial source, you can still trust the message. Your new perspective helps you to explain something in a down-to-earth manner. Stop trying to justify your ideas; just follow your intuition instead."
cancer,2012-03-23,"Mercury's shift into watery Pisces is reassuring and reminds you that your feelings are just as important as what you do now. Unfortunately, you may still need to extend yourself physically beyond your usual comfort zone. If the current situation requires you to stretch your boundaries, just push past your fears and do it. Your self-esteem will grow if you take responsibility for your role in setting up the current circumstances."
leo,2012-03-23,"Normally, others can't stop you when you have a strong notion about what you're going to do. However, someone may be working behind the scenes today to stymie your efforts. But don't take the interference personally; it really doesn't matter whether anyone likes you or not. Turn the tables in your favor by focusing your thinking and improving your ideas."
virgo,2012-03-23,"You may be oversensitive today and someone's criticism might send you on a downward spiral of self-doubt. Fortunately, if you toughen up a bit, you should be able to apply the feedback you receive in a positive manner. You're extremely connected to the source of your own creativity now if you can avoid judging yourself. Don't get in your own way; you'll be happily amazed if you don't waste time editing yourself."
libra,2012-03-23,"You respond to a flash of inspiration today by wondering how you came up with such a brilliant idea. However, you are quite pleased to acknowledge that the stroke of brilliance is actually yours. Don't overreact with too much excitement to your own epiphany now; relax and wait until someone else comes forward with his or her thoughts on the subject. You shine best when collaborating with others."
scorpio,2012-03-23,"Mercury's backward dance into magical Pisces inspires a creative streak, but you might believe that something is holding you back from your unbridled expression. Thankfully, the dam will begin to crumble as you grant yourself permission to bask in your own feelings. Remember the goal that you initially set out to accomplish, or you may lose focus and find that you completed a different job than you started."
sagittarius,2012-03-23,"You have been riding a wave of positive energy recently, and the entire world seems to be part of your little adventure story. Unfortunately, the picture isn't as rosy today, but it gives you an opportunity to relax for a moment. Leaving the party early isn't something you like to do, but taming your thoughts is a worthwhile exercise with mental Mercury backing into dreamy Pisces. Let yourself down gently and you'll be feeling fine again in a day or two."
capricorn,2012-03-23,"You may feel as if you must work things out, but it's really not important to reach any kind of conclusion now. Actually, it's less about what you say than it is about the wonderful camaraderie that is created with a close friend as you reveal your true character. Practicing patience plays out in your favor because there will be plenty of time to talk about deeper issues later on."
aquarius,2012-03-23,"You might find it nearly impossible to concentrate on the tasks at hand today. Instead, you may cruise the water cooler, the Internet or your contact list, looking for someone to distract you with a bit of gossip. Above all, hold firm to the core values in your awareness now. Ultimately, your beliefs can keep you on track so you don't get into trouble for your lack of productivity."
pisces,2012-03-23,"Your emotions are very close to the surface with messenger Mercury backing into your sign today. You are eager to share your thoughts about what's going on, but the words may not come easily now. As your frustration builds, you might question other people's motives, but it's not wise to shift blame to anyone else. Staying focused on your own issues makes it easier to talk about your feelings when the time is right."
aries,2012-03-24,"You may suddenly arrive at an entirely new conclusion today as the Sun, currently in your sign, receives a zap from electric and brilliant Uranus. You could still be floating around in the fuzzy realm of dreams, but the sparks are crackling as the fog dissipates. Even if you have lost your bearings, just use your intuition to reset your compass and chart new territory."
taurus,2012-03-24,"Even without an extra cup of coffee, you're buzzing at a very high frequency today. Unfortunately, your logic might not be as accurate as you think.

Take your time responding because this could be a wake-up call to refocus your attention. Your current happiness depends on your ability to create harmony, not destroy it."
cancer,2012-03-24,"Your reaction to someone who tries to constrain you may distract you from what you really should be doing. Fortunately, you can quickly shift your perspective and see the current situation in a different light now. If you suddenly feel inspired, set aside your common sense and take a risk. Although you don't have to defy authority in order to be happy, today it could certainly help."
leo,2012-03-24,"You have little interest in taking a safer course of action, especially if you are excited about something you learn today. Although you don't want to hear anything negative, you realize that knowing the truth is much better than remaining in ignorance, even if the facts are inconvenient. You might not have an easy path to walk, but you're eager to experience what's around the next corner. Remember, the clues you receive now can help you find peace during the days ahead."
virgo,2012-03-24,"You may be caught in a conflict between your emotional needs and the expectations of others. It's challenging because the smoothest path might require you to keep your desires to yourself today, while living up to your social obligations.

Ultimately, you'll feel a sense of joy if everyone else is happy."

Thankfully, you are able to look beyond the excitement of the present moment and use your visionary powers to guide you. Don't let logic get in your way; you can be brilliant and creative by trusting your imagination now. Following your instincts allows you to arrive at original solutions to the mundane problems at hand."
scorpio,2012-03-24,"Although you want to be sensible, a sudden attraction draws you toward something mysterious and exciting. It's as if a gigantic magnet is pulling you off your current course and into the unknown. Don't stick to the tried and true methods today; express yourself differently and get ready for a pleasant surprise."
sagittarius,2012-03-24,"You are eager for a radical shift so you will probably enjoy the verbal fireworks today. A sudden emotional outburst or unexpected personal disclosure has the potential to change everything, however, everyone will likely feel better once buried feelings are out in the open. If tensions are already at unacceptable levels, this is your chance to finally clear the air."
capricorn,2012-03-24,"You may be able to do your most original work or have the most fun without leaving home today. Or, perhaps, you make your biggest breakthrough when you feel the most secure. Whatever happens now, the tension between safety and adventure ensures that you'll have a wild ride. Don't be afraid to shake things up; the exhilaration you end up feeling makes up for any anxiety and uncertainty you experience along the way."
aquarius,2012-03-24,"The willful Sun conjuncts your key planet Uranus today, cracking anything that has grown too brittle in your life. But the focus is not on the breaking of the egg; it is on the emerging little chick. Don't bother trying to repair the problems in your life. Instead, concentrate on the possibilities you will have once the shell is no longer holding you back."
pisces,2012-03-24,"If your finances have been a bit shaky recently, you may have extra work to do today as you try to put things back together. However, you might impulsively spend more than you should on something you don't really need. Either way, keep a watchful eye on your cash flow because a stressful situation could grow out of hand very quickly if you don't pay attention."
aries,2012-03-25,"You may be content to simply float through the day, accepting whatever happens along the way. But your easygoing attitude could border on laziness and you might miss something special that's brewing today. Paradoxically, you don't need to try too hard to discover the secret or you could spoil a surprise. It's sufficient to make choices that simplify your life now instead of complicating it."
taurus,2012-03-25,"You are feeling a bit complacent today because you believe your needs will be met as the easygoing Taurus Moon harmonizes with other planets in practical Earth signs. You are attracted to the idea of simple pleasures, yet satisfaction may be short-lived as you realize there's more going on than you thought. Nevertheless, don't be too concerned about the future now; whatever happens can bring a unique opportunity for your enjoyment."
gemini,2012-03-25,"You might be content to stay home and do as little as possible today. Although you may actually deserve a real day of rest, someone could give you a hard time for your apparent lack of motivation. Instead of worrying about anyone else's unfulfilled expectations, take a bit of time to prioritize what you still have left to do. Running around in circles won't help matters, so use the day for planning and relaxation; you'll feel rejuvenated enough to jump back into action tomorrow."
cancer,2012-03-25,"You can make progress on a project on the home front today. Although you may be far behind your initial schedule, meeting a deadline is less important now than it was when you set your goals. Even if the scope of your plan has grown, it might be wise now to reconsider your goals and pare back where necessary. It won't matter how much you have learned through your network of friends and relatives unless you put your newly acquired knowledge to work in a practical manner."
leo,2012-03-25,"You may be fully resigned to follow through on your commitments today, yet you're also thinking about turning everything upside down and making a quick escape. Unfortunately, it's unlikely that acting on your fantasies now will bring you lasting happiness. Instead of possibly jeopardizing your reputation, do something pleasurable for yourself that doesn't throw your life into further turmoil."
virgo,2012-03-25,"It feels as if most of your plans are in order today and that it won't be difficult to stay on the straight and narrow path ahead. However, an exciting person or idea may catch you off guard and draw you into a world that doesn't fit into your previous expectations. Try not to judge others who are being sincere; hearing the truth is worth more than staying in your comfort zone."
libra,2012-03-25,"Although your fantasies may not be too unusual, you're not required to act on every impulse today; nor do you have to tell anyone what you are thinking. Instead, explore the impossible by exercising the art of imagination. You can go anywhere within the private spaces of your dreams while still keeping up with your responsibilities in the real world."
scorpio,2012-03-25,"A good friend might pleasantly surprise you by sharing his or her feelings of admiration or love. Although too much personal disclosure might make you uncomfortable, it's not healthy to isolate yourself from the positive emotions surrounding you. If necessary, admit your uneasiness with the conversation and acknowledge your fears about being vulnerable, but don't try to control the outcome. This is an opportunity to open a new channel of communication, so give yourself the chance to enjoy it."
sagittarius,2012-03-25,"Your cavalier attitude encourages you to minimize the importance of a generalized strategy as you uncharacteristically focus on the details, instead. Don't try to control things too tightly; you don't need to know how each individual chore fits into the big picture. Thankfully, you're able to pull a rabbit out of a hat today; not only can you tie up lots of loose ends, you're able to make it look like you never lost sight of the larger goals."
capricorn,2012-03-25,"Even your closest friends might not realize how easy it is for you to have a good time when everything is in order. They might believe that you remain serious, no matter what. But you can get as crazy as anyone else today. Nevertheless, you'll enjoy yourself even more if you meet your previous obligations prior to starting your day of rebellious recreation."
aquarius,2012-03-25,"Unpredictable Uranus is still playing a significant role in your life by preventing you from becoming overly rigid. Even if you are absolutely determined to have your way, something can snap, forcing you to radically shift your expectations. Remember, the greater the buried tension, the more forceful the release. Instead of fighting against change, it's much healthier now to embrace it."
pisces,2012-03-25,"You're fully capable of expressing rebellious feelings today in a way that doesn't make others angry. You are an agent of change, even if you appear to be defending the status quo. However, your current optimism can lull others into a false sense of security now. Don't be afraid to take a step on the wild side by expressing exactly what's in your heart, without trying to navigate through the tricky waters in advance."
aries,2012-03-26,"After a hectic burst of activity, your days of enthusiastic creativity draw to a temporary close. You could feel let down as the buzz of excitement fades, tempting you to fill in the lull with new activities. However, this break is just a sign that it's time to take a long-term view of your work. Build incrementally onto your current accomplishments rather than trying to leap forward with a quantum jump. Pushing ahead too quickly only sets you back."
taurus,2012-03-26,"You feel frazzled from the frenetic energy of the past few days. Fortunately, you can take time to assimilate your recent experiences now that the Moon is back in your sign. Even if you still have a lot of work in front of you, don't be too eager to finish it all right away. It's more useful to relax today and prepare for the next round of intensity before it arrives."
gemini,2012-03-26,"It seems as if you're being pulled away from social interactions and toward your own private world. You might not say yes so quickly if invited to join your friends or workmates for a social outing today. Don't worry; there's nothing wrong with wanting to spend some time by yourself. Your fantasies can reveal images rich with symbolism now, but you must be quiet long enough to hear what they are telling you."
cancer,2012-03-26,"You may be overly possessive of your friends today, especially if you are concerned that they won't be there when you need them. But your current worries probably aren't based on reality; instead old memories could haunt you by reminding you of a time when you felt abandoned. Be careful; acting out of fear could backfire and inadvertently bring about the loneliness you are attempting to avoid."
leo,2012-03-26,"You might feel better today if you thought a trustworthy ally was looking out for you. However, you're willing to take care of yourself rather than facing possible disappointment. You don't need to overcompensate and act like a superhero just because you're afraid of being let down by others. It takes courage to admit that you can't do everything; nevertheless, showing your vulnerability can actually bring you closer to someone special."
virgo,2012-03-26,"You're thinking about taking a well-deserved vacation or enrolling in an educational program, but it's difficult to pull it all together. Fortunately, your vision might finally fall into place now, but that doesn't mean your work is done. You still must fine-tune the details before actually executing your plan. Allow plenty of time for everything to happen; things could fall apart if you try to do too much all at once."
libra,2012-03-26,"Your good intentions are often enough to help you successfully navigate through tricky negotiations, but today you may be up against more resistance than you expect. Your direct approach now could be disarming to some, yet it also can make you an easy target for others. Instead of revealing all your cards immediately, unfold your strategy slowly and only on a need-to-know basis to those you trust."
scorpio,2012-03-26,"Tension between you and a loved one may come to the surface today, yet there might not be any one particular problem. It's more about how you approach conflict resolution in general that causes trouble. It is difficult for you to acknowledge that simplifying a complicated issue can be a sensible way to make it more manageable. Thankfully, you willingness to be open to someone else's perspective makes everything easier to handle."
sagittarius,2012-03-26,"Your co-workers may be surprised that you are so wrapped up in the details now, instead of thinking about ways to have more fun, as is your usual style. Fortunately, you can be very productive today by making a list of specific tasks and methodically completing each item in order. Don't worry about what others are saying; just concentrate on getting the job done right."
capricorn,2012-03-26,"You have a systematic approach to enjoying yourself today, and luckily this includes both work and play. Someone might rub you the wrong way by trying to interfere with your plans, but it's not wise to get involved in an unnecessary conflict. Instead, utilize your energy by expressing yourself as creatively as possible in all that you do. Your grounded way of turning a chore into a fun activity is contagious, causing others to smile and join in the cause."
aquarius,2012-03-26,"You have a clear idea of how you want everything to go today and you may find it nearly impossible to change your mind. Your emotions are pretty easy to read now and you're not interested in playing games to get what you want. Unfortunately, your unwillingness to negotiate can complicate your life. Thankfully, a little bit of flexibility on your part helps simplify your path toward happiness."
pisces,2012-03-26,"You are inclined to complicate things today, even with the Moon traveling through easygoing Taurus. However, you will be much happier if you can establish your schedule ahead of time, so you won't need to deal with too many surprises. Luckily, planning ahead works well for you now; nearly anything you put your mind to will unfold according to your vision. Making time at the beginning of the day assures that you will be able to coordinate your calendar before it's too late."
aries,2012-03-27,"Today may be more important than you think because there is more going on than just what appears on the surface. Thankfully, you can accomplish more than you expect now, even if you are feeling a bit scattered. Don't try too hard to focus your attention on any one thing; allowing your thoughts to meander could eventually enable you to find the most meaningful path."
taurus,2012-03-27,"You might feel weird today, as if you just walked onto the set of a science fiction movie. This quirky energy makes it difficult to separate your fantasies from what is actually true. The desire to explore uncharted territory could give you sufficient impetus to break out of a rut. Unfortunately, you can see that you're not in control of what's happening. Avoid the temptation to hold the reins too tightly; you receive greater benefits from the current situation if you simply relax and enjoy the ride."
gemini,2012-03-27,"You may have so much going on in your mind today that you're at a loss for words, even if you are known for your natural gift of gab. You think you know what needs to be said, but you still have a difficult time getting your message across. Instead of overreacting and trying to persuade others to follow your plan, let your thoughts develop for a day or two before saying much of anything at all."
cancer,2012-03-27,"It's challenging today to share your feelings with someone you love. But you also need to acknowledge the Moon's presence in your reclusive 12th house by keeping some of your secrets to yourself. Unfortunately, you might begin to grow unsatisfied with your current isolation. Keep in mind that you'll be happier once you reconnect with those you may have previously pushed away. Don't be afraid to take the first step and speak from your heart."
leo,2012-03-27,"It's hard to stay connected with your energy today because you could be receiving signals that aren't your own. You are so wired to what's going on around you that you might not have any space left over for your own ideas, and the cosmic noise can overpower you now. Acting with intention is a wise strategy, but don't forget there are other factors that also play into the mix of current events. Stay open to unexpected changes for the best results."
virgo,2012-03-27,"You could be tempted by the illusion that having more data gives you more choices today as the Moon visits versatile Gemini. Nevertheless, you know that it's better to have useful information at your fingertips than to be overwhelmed by too many facts. Make sure that you don't miss anything crucial to ensure you're operating at the highest efficiency."
libra,2012-03-27,"Your ruling planet Venus can take you into some very strange territory today as someone you like lures you off the beaten path. The unknown has a certain charm now, especially if you explore it with an adventurous ally. But previous commitments may prevent you from taking your current whims too far. Being responsible is the mature thing to do, but try not to shut the door on the possibility of a playful interaction."
scorpio,2012-03-27,"You may be tied up in a complex dance of the heart, leaving you feeling uncomfortably vulnerable. You can build a new relationship, but taking a big risk or moving too fast could ruin your chances. Watch your feelings carefully, but don't get too caught up in them for now. Fortunately, your emotions won't slow you down for long if you reconnect with your spiritual foundation."
sagittarius,2012-03-27,"You could find yourself in lots of trouble today if you judge a book by its cover. Jumping to conclusions often turns out OK, but it's better now to slow down, or you might miss an extraordinary opportunity by letting your assumptions get in the way. It may be tricky to recognize your cosmic message if it arrives in a plain brown wrapper, but it becomes obvious that it's something special once you begin to open it."
capricorn,2012-03-27,"Although you might not be as attached to a current drama as others think, you still appear overly intense today. A co-worker may get on your nerves now, and a difference of opinion that starts as a little disagreement could turn into a major conflict. Arguments suddenly flare up only to quickly settle down. Instead of simply following the course of least resistance, stand up for something you believe in while staying as flexible as you can."
aquarius,2012-03-27,"Your thinking is usually outside of the box, but now someone else may be playing the role of change agent. All you need to do is show up and respond from your heart. You may feel that you're being let off the hook, but it's a smart strategy to consider collaboration, anyhow. However, don't say yes to every single thing that comes your way. Setting boundaries can give you more freedom than going anywhere else."
pisces,2012-03-27,"You could talk yourself into believing your own logic now, especially if you see an easy opportunity to avoid a deep pit of unexplored emotions. However, you probably won't last long with this line of thinking because your feelings tempt you with rich symbols and metaphors. A methodical exploration of your imagination is a good idea and can help you delve further into the mysteries of your own heart."
aries,2012-03-28,"You may feel panicky today because you can tell that time is running out. Even if you have a plan to finish your work prior to the weekend, it still is a smart idea to limit your extracurricular activities so you'll be able to complete your work. It might not be easy to make the best choices now unless you stand back from the social whirlwind, set new priorities and follow through in a practical manner."
taurus,2012-03-28,"You have a lot to do today, and it's challenging to fit everything into your full schedule. But don't cut any one activity short if you really want to extract the most out of every single experience. Nevertheless, you're still tempted to squeeze in something else if it sounds like fun. Exercise caution; overbooking your day is currently not in your best interest."
gemini,2012-03-28,"It's almost impossible to stick to your schedule today, so you might as well save your energy. Thankfully, eliminating extraneous activities allows you to enjoy yourself. But the Moon's presence in your sign could turn you into a bit of a couch potato. Nevertheless, making fewer plans means that you will have the time to relax. But you cannot escape your need to respond to changing circumstances throughout the day. Keep in mind that flexibility is one your greatest strengths."
cancer,2012-03-28,"You are bouncing off the walls today, and may not be able to settle your feelings. Thankfully, others cannot see past your smokescreen of complacency; it's easier to manage your desires by temporarily keeping them to yourself. Unfortunately, as soon as you share what is on your mind, everything becomes more complicated -- so be careful of what topics you bring up on your own."
leo,2012-03-28,"Your high standards make for unrealistic expectations that are difficult to fulfill now. Although you can understand why your friends are acting as they do, rationalizations still don't diminish your disappointment. It's a mistake to give up on someone you love, even if you have to cut him or her some slack for being who they are rather than who you want them to be. Standing by an ally strengthens your relationship for the long haul."
virgo,2012-03-28,"You have set ambitious objectives and probably have a variety of interesting activities planned for the day. But the individual events don't unfold as expected, demonstrating early on that nothing is as certain as it seems. There's no need to frustrate yourself by trying to force your agenda on to the changing landscape. Instead, be smart and practice letting go of control now. Not only will you learn to enjoy yourself, you'll also accomplish more than you think."
libra,2012-03-28,"The rollercoaster ride continues as your emotions rise and fall and rise again, giving you a queasy feeling in the pit of your stomach. You could grow tired of all the excitement, yet you don't have a clue on how to stop it. Don't worry; things are about to slow down, even if they remain intense throughout the day. The key is to enjoy the present moment without being overly concerned about what happens next."
scorpio,2012-03-28,"Your emotions are raw today, yet you're still capable of moving through tricky territory very quickly. But the speed at which you can process negativity now is a direct result of your ability to do your own shadow work. Actually, you can benefit from your willingness to jump into the fire of experience and then let go once the metamorphosis is complete."
sagittarius,2012-03-28,"Although you feel as if you've been sidetracked today, you may still become involved in someone else's drama. Fortunately, you cannot stay serious for too long. Your absurd sense of humor is your saving grace now, as long as you're not too quick to use it to avoid an important issue. But a dose of wit and charm at the right time is a perfect antidote to a sticky situation."
capricorn,2012-03-28,"You're tempted to try a heavy-handed approach today, but your attempts fall short of pulling it off successfully. Thankfully, you aren't inclined to take yourself so seriously now because you can see exciting possibilities everywhere you look. Although you might not be able to decipher your future clearly yet, you don't have to push it away. There's no need to control everything once you realize that the sky will clear on its own."
aquarius,2012-03-28,"Your feelings are changing so fast now that it's hard to make any long-term decisions. Although your values remain constant, your moods shift as you continue to learn more about those close to you. Even if you're afraid of losing control in a significant relationship, your fear is probably worse than any possible outcome. Focusing on the best-case scenario is a smart strategy because it actually helps you to manifest your vision."
pisces,2012-03-28,"You cannot remain discouraged today, even if you are receiving resistance from someone at work. An old issue may rear its head again, making you feel insecure about your relationships with friends and associates. But realizing that the present circumstances are different from the previous ones enables you to see sweet potential rather than doom and gloom. Set positive intentions, but don't expect any miracles."
aries,2012-03-29,"You may seek an adrenaline rush today, but run into enough resistance that you're tempted to give up. Even if you clearly demonstrate what you need, the emphasis isn't about external events. You're focused on healing an old emotional wound now since the important work is inside your head. Pay attention to how you react to what's happening, because you can learn a lot about yourself in the process."
taurus,2012-03-29,"You want everyone to know exactly what you are feeling and are quite determined to express what's on your mind. You're ambitious in love and your current performance is animated because your actions resonate with your desires. Although you could choose stability and security over transient romance, just don't overdo it. Slow down and make the magic last."
gemini,2012-03-29,"When it comes to matters of the heart today, you may get hung up in a serious dilemma. You could even grow overly concerned about your possessions and how to make them last. Fortunately, you're not likely to negotiate away your core values. Direct your awareness toward sustaining pleasures instead of impulsively stirring up a conflict because you want to go off and do something different."
cancer,2012-03-29,"You may have to confront another round of self-doubt as you tend to be harder on yourself today than is necessary. Even if you're feeling confident, it's still difficult to share your vulnerability with another person if you are lost in your own concerns. A cooling-off period is healthy, but remember this isn't about going your separate ways. For now, it's just about learning to be comfortable with establishing your own boundaries."
leo,2012-03-29,"You may feel isolated today, but this is a temporary phase so don't spend too much time worrying about it. However, if current circumstances do turn into a big deal, your sense of loneliness could be exaggerated. Consider what you can do to better your chances of success. Ironically, in the long run, honoring your ambitions will also help strengthen your relationships."
virgo,2012-03-29,"Although you could be the most competent candidate for employee of the month, you might not feel appreciated for what you do today. Your need for recognition may motivate you to overcompensate and work even harder. Unfortunately, you could miss the boat in romantic matters now. Don't waste your time on feeling guilty. Instead, focus on the love that is real and right in front of you."
libra,2012-03-29,"It's hard to live up to your creative expectations today, but there's a deeper magic percolating now beneath the surface. However, you are less interested in making a sensation or stealing the spotlight. Your current task is to stabilize your current position. Hard work isn't very glamorous, but that's what can make you feel most worthy of love."
scorpio,2012-03-29,"You are concerned these days with the kind of love that really matters -- the important love that can sustain you through thick and thin. Save the flashy words and adrenaline-filled moments for another day. Cultivate the security, sustenance and loyalty of a love that will hang in there for a very long time."
sagittarius,2012-03-29,"You may have an uncontrollable urge to shout your message from the top of a mountain, but you would be better off just getting on with the work that needs to be done. Your efforts aren't necessarily in creating something new; instead, do whatever you can to heal your current situation. Build a solid foundation right where you are standing, even if opportunity opens a door to someplace else."
capricorn,2012-03-29,"The time for romantic ideals and impulsive desires is passing quickly. In order to experience the best part of the day, you must do the work, make the commitment and show up for real, even in the face of adversity. Your friends won't be of much help now because they may require more from you than you are willing to give today. Don't let your different points of view boil over into a feud. Instead, seek common ground for success."
aquarius,2012-03-29,"You may be in an antisocial mood, but it's not the right time to withdraw completely, even if you wish you could now. You're tempted to open the can of worms that has held your fears in check, but be ready for serious consequences and a difficult conversation if you decide to do it. However, it would be better to keep your feelings to yourself for a day or two while the energy continues to settle down."
pisces,2012-03-29,"Your spiritual outlook fuels compassion in those around you. Still, you may not trust the connection with someone you love, even if it's usually quite reliable. Don't turn your unsettled feelings into a big deal today, for they are transitory. If you believe that another person is trying to control you now, bring the facts right out into the open. Talking things through in a non-threatening manner is healthier than bottling up everything inside."
aries,2012-03-30,It may seem as if you need some time alone at home while the Moon is visiting your soulful 4th house. What recently appeared to be a sure thing might not look so good now. But your lack of clear thinking serves a deeper purpose if you've been in too much of a hurry for your own good. Be content with your current situation instead of trying to fix anything. Wait until your confidence returns before pushing forward again.
taurus,2012-03-30,"It's not fun running into obstacles, but you can overcome a setback if you're patient while taking the resistance you meet with a grain of salt. But if you continue to stubbornly stick to your original agenda in spite of the changing circumstances, you'll probably make everyone else as unhappy as you make yourself. Cooperation is more sensible today than competition."
gemini,2012-03-30,It feels as if others are distancing themselves from you today and your attempts to force close communication can actually make things worse. Your key planet Mercury could muddy the waters of understanding as it retrogrades in dreamy Pisces. Don't let your insecurities provoke you to ramble on about unimportant details just because you are afraid of the silence. Avoid unnecessary conflict by giving others the space they need.
cancer,2012-03-30,"Someone may act insensitively toward you, but it's difficult to express how you feel today. You wish that everyone was sufficiently aware to acknowledge their rude behavior, and you might grow angry if apologies aren't forthcoming. However, being silent about your emotions only complicates matters more. Unfortunately, sulking is not a wise course of action. Overcome your moodiness by saying what's on your mind and then be ready to let it go."
leo,2012-03-30,"Holding on to old feelings can fuel lingering conflicts today as the Moon in your 12th House of Secrets is pressurized by unrelenting Pluto. Fortunately, an attitude adjustment can change everything if only you allow compassion to rule, instead of judgment. It only takes a few words of heartfelt forgiveness to release yourself from a situation that you inadvertently created."
virgo,2012-03-30,"You may feel as if someone you like is pushing you into places you would rather avoid today. Unfortunately, you might not be able to turn off the stream of words that are coming at you or from within your own head. Thankfully, you can lighten the energy by moving beyond logic. Analysis could become a trap; shift from language into imaginative symbols to find a solution to your current dilemma."
libra,2012-03-30,"Although you're not interested in sacrificing your own happiness now just to help someone else, you still may feel as if you can't avoid the unspoken demands of your work. Unfortunately, you could exhaust yourself trying to make others feel good. It may seem selfish at first, but attending to your own needs today is a step in the right direction so you can be there for those you love."
scorpio,2012-03-30,An intense show of emotions could place a strain on a relationship with someone who stirs up your fears now. You don't need to avoid the situation completely as long as you remember not to waste so much time and energy that the interaction pulls you off track. It isn't easy to dance around the unspoken feelings because false sincerity only adds to the confusion. Focus on your vision instead and wait for another day to have a heart-to-heart discussion.
sagittarius,2012-03-30,"It's disconcerting when someone shows up with such intense feelings that you don't know how to respond. Ignoring the emotional tension only encourages the other person to push you harder. Fortunately, you don't have to resort to denial to navigate through these unfamiliar waters. Just say what's on your mind and let everyone know that you're not comfortable with the topic of conversation. Honesty really is the best policy, even if your words aren't what others want to hear."
capricorn,2012-03-30,"Your high level of concentration can be difficult for others to handle because they could perceive you as overly ambitious. But your focus is motivated by your passion now, and little will get in your way. Someone else might think you are overreacting today, but you're just trying to stick to your plan. Nevertheless, toning down your heightened sense of urgency helps you reach your goals with less resistance and more support."
aquarius,2012-03-30,"You can easily lose sight of your goals today, especially if you get caught in a power struggle at work that stirs up feelings of insecurity. A co-worker may criticize your performance or withhold any acknowledgment at all. But worrying about anyone else's judgment is a waste of time because other people's reactions might have more to do with their stress than anything you have done. Concentrate on doing the best job you can and let others think what they want."
pisces,2012-03-30,"Although you're very sensitive, sometimes it's a challenge to separate what you know from the messages you are receiving on a psychic level. Even if your intuition is accurate today, it's not easy to express your feelings in words. It may be wiser to acknowledge your current inability to communicate effectively than to struggle with unpleasant consequences of a misunderstanding."
aries,2012-03-31,"You may have a hard time today as retrograde Mars stirs anger and tempts you to be even more impulsive than usual. Someone's actions could provoke an instantaneous reaction on your part. Even if you believe that everything is good, you still might lose your temper. Blowing off steam is healthy, but it won't help you get to the bottom of what's currently happening. Nevertheless, you can make the best of a situation by letting others know how you feel in a caring manner."
taurus,2012-03-31,"You would like to enjoy the fruits of your labor today, but you may have to postpone the fun so you can take care of your chores first. You have a clear mental picture of what you currently want, but achieving results could remain elusive for a while longer. Don't panic about your lack of progress or struggle to realize your dreams immediately, or you may inadvertently push them away. Ironically, gently easing up on the gas will help you reach your destination faster."
gemini,2012-03-31,"You may be lost in ambitious dreams today as the sensitive Moon harmonizes with your key planet Mercury. But thinking about something doesn't actually make it real. Your friends and family can be the source of encouragement, but you still need to be careful. A bad decision can cause you to waste too much time if you're chasing an unreachable goal. Wait until you gain clarity before initiating action."
cancer,2012-03-31,"You're under pressure to figure out where you are going as your long-term goals gain importance. You enjoy talking about the variety of possibilities that lie ahead, even if you aren't ready to follow up on any of your ideas yet. Don't be too concerned about meeting anyone else's expectations today; just allow yourself the luxury of thoroughly exploring your hidden fantasies. You might be surprised by the undiscovered treasure buried within your imagination."
leo,2012-03-31,"Trust your intuition today, for your psychic powers are running at full force. Although you may believe that you're on the right track, a gnawing frustration grows and then dissipates. Don't stick to an old plan that isn't working, and don't hold on to someone who is no longer honoring his or her end of the agreement. If necessary, cut your losses and move on to what's next."
virgo,2012-03-31,"If you aren't vigilant when attending to fiscal matters, you could inadvertently make a poor financial decision today. Don't make any impulsive purchases because discretionary spending can quickly get out of hand now. Instead of putting yourself in a precarious situation, take action to stabilize your cash flow. Do what seems to make the most sense even if you're not sure that you have all the answers."
libra,2012-03-31,"As objectively as you try to act, your fantasies can still muddle your thought process today. You may realize that your logic isn't very sound, but it's best to go through the motions by visualizing exactly what you want. Once you have reached a decision, make a concrete plan of how you can get to where you're going. Don't wait for someone else to take the first step; starting out on your own now will work out better than you think."
scorpio,2012-03-31,"Just as you start to believe that everything is going well, you could run into a metaphysical crisis. It's absolutely crucial to understand that you're not in any sort of physical danger now even if you think that others are plotting against you. But it's easy to overcompensate by acting self-righteous; if you go too far, others might forget that your out-of-the-box thinking is such a positive attribute. Take the high road and the rest will follow."
sagittarius,2012-03-31,"You may be able to justify your position on an important matter today, yet your current decision could have larger consequences than you realize. Everything seems more complex than it should be, making it easy to become confused by conflicting information. Your lack of clarity increases the difficulty of choosing one path over another. It's okay to take your time; forcing a final answer now creates more problems than it's worth."
capricorn,2012-03-31,"You may see both sides of a relationship issue now, but you might not be willing to commit to either one. Thankfully, you can probably get through this tricky territory by moving toward the center. Unfortunately, something unexpected could happen that startles you and elicits your immediate reaction. Paying attention to your feelings helps you avoid an unnecessary meltdown. There's no need to make your move today."
aquarius,2012-03-31,"You take pride in your controversial points of view, but today you might not be able to justify your eccentricities. Furthermore, your rebellious opinions could create problems now because you aren't very clear about how you reach your conclusions. Be careful; if your ideas are upsetting to someone else, there isn't any logical reason to escalate the situation into an open conflict. Bide your time and keep the conversation friendly."
pisces,2012-03-31,"You can excel at spinning yarns today with talkative Mercury now retrograding back in your imaginative sign. Although you're able to find the right words to describe your feelings, your actions may be out of step with what you say. Consider a variety of options so your behavior is more in tune with your heartfelt message. It only takes a little self-awareness to put your life back in balance."
aries,2012-04-01,"Your energy soars today as the expressive Leo Moon dances through your 5th House of Fun and Games, but you could tire yourself out before fulfilling your responsibilities. Even if you think that working harder and faster is the answer to all your problems, this strategy of overcompensation won't likely work. Remember, you might still need to process lingering emotions left over from a recent melodrama, so don't overdo it. Being methodical is the most effective way to achieve your goals now."
taurus,2012-04-01,"The fixed Leo Moon's presence in your 4th House of Home and Family turns up the heat on a domestic issue. It's tricky to express your feelings today if they are contrary to what everyone else is experiencing, but denying them will only add to the tension. You may be tempted to avoid facing a difficult situation, but you will feel better if you confront it sooner than later."
gemini,2012-04-01,"The Moon's visit to your 3rd House of Communication speeds up the pace of events in your life, even if you were planning on a low-key day. However, changing your expectations enables you to appear as if you're more in control than you really are today. Thankfully, you can shift gears so smoothly that others don't even realize you're feeling stressed. Just make sure you don't expend too much energy now or you might run out of steam next week."
cancer,2012-04-01,"Financial issues are on your plate now that the Moon is visiting your 2nd House of Money. The current solution may be as simple as attending to your personal accounting, but deeper problems might also come to the surface today. Your good intentions might not be sufficient to make everything OK, so demonstrate your responsibility by following through with what you start. A little extra effort is all that's needed to turn things around in a positive direction."
leo,2012-04-01,"You may be thinking about doing something unusual today and sharing your ideas with someone special. However, you'll need to exercise caution because once you start talking it might not be all that easy to stop. Telling your friends about your dreams can lead to a wonderful interaction, even if your visions are not yet based in reality. Just keep in mind that saying too much too soon disperses the energy prematurely; develop your ideas further before going into great detail about them."
virgo,2012-04-01,"The Moon's current visit to your 12th House of Destiny increases the tension in your life because the stakes seem higher than they actually are today. Unfortunately, it's difficult to withdraw from a game that you started, so be clear about your intentions right from the beginning. Whatever happens now, don't be tricked into thinking that you must win. You don't have to come out on top; all you need to do is play the game the best you can."
libra,2012-04-01,"You could spend so much time hanging out with your friends now that your chores begin to suffer. However, whatever projects are still unfinished could see significant progress in the next few weeks if you choose to apply yourself. Meanwhile, enjoy the Moon's visit to your social 11th house; don't be too self-critical if your productivity isn't up to your expectations today. You can make up for lost time later on."
scorpio,2012-04-01,"The expressive Leo Moon shines in your 10th House of Public Responsibility today, prompting you to take charge of your life in a way that clearly demonstrates your intentions. Although your behavior reveals how you feel, others can misinterpret your actions if you don't take the time to explain your position. Don't expect immediate support; it may take until later in the week for everyone to be back on the same page."
sagittarius,2012-04-01,"You're inclined to discuss your feelings in a more personal manner today instead of the philosophical approach you often take. But your emotional disclosure might catch someone off guard, possibly even making him or her uneasy. Although you're able to moderate your intensity if you feel resistance, don't use other people's fear as a justification to withdraw. Instead, lean gently into an uncomfortable situation until the stress dissipates."
capricorn,2012-04-01,"Dealing with other people's feelings can be baffling today because their motives are probably very different from yours. Nevertheless, it would be simpler to smooth over the rough spots if you knew what they wanted. However, you're certain that you're missing some important information, even if everyone seems to be forthright. The more you push to uncover the mystery, the more complicated it grows. Back off for a while; the details will reveal themselves soon enough."
aquarius,2012-04-01,"A relationship requires your undivided attention today, but even if an apparent conflict is resolved, the background tension might not dissipate. The surface communication suggests that everything is back to normal, but you could still be left with a lingering feeling of confusion. However, try not to make too big of a deal about your uncertainty. Downplay the drama now and let the situation unfold naturally."
pisces,2012-04-01,"You want to be acknowledged for your ongoing participation around the home or in your community as the nurturing Moon visits your 6th House of Routine. It doesn't matter how large or small your contribution is; a little recognition goes a long way. But don't grandstand just for the sake of attention now; attempts to prolong your time in the spotlight will most likely backfire. Just do your job as effectively as you can and rest assured that others will notice, even if they don't have anything to say about it today."
aries,2012-04-02,"It's one thing to talk about all the things you're going to do and it's something else to actually follow through with your intentions. Although you're in a creative phase, it's challenging to turn your enthusiasm into production. Don't be too self-critical now; you'll be rocking and rolling by mid-month once your key planet Mars turns direct."
taurus,2012-04-02,"You want to do your work as efficiently as possible so you have extra time to retreat into the privacy of your own imagination today. However, you may not be ready to share what you're doing with anyone else just yet. If you don't have the ability to set boundaries at work, you might have to wait until you get home. Feeling safe and secure is the key to your creative self-expression now."
gemini,2012-04-02,"Even if you head back to work today, you're less interested in being productive than you are in socializing with your coworkers and telling them about your weekend activities. You may think that you can get by doing less than you should, but you might get into trouble if you take this strategy too far. Your key planet Mercury is still retrograde until Wednesday, so getting as much accomplished as you can now will prepare you for what you'll have to do later in the week."
cancer,2012-04-02,"Your confidence may be apparent to everyone else today, yet you aren't necessarily free from self-doubt. Even if you're pretty sure that your contribution to a project at work is worthwhile, you still might harbor uncertainty about your long-term goals. Try not to worry about anything that is outside of your control now. Just put your very best effort into what you're doing at the moment and be open to the positive feedback you receive from others."
leo,2012-04-02,"Although you may be quite demonstrative about your feelings today, your mood could shift rather suddenly. One minute you're overflowing with warm affection and just a few moments later you cool off. Others might even doubt your sincerity because of your mixed messages. However, the Moon's presence in your sign can create stormy emotional weather along with inconsistent thinking, so don't be too concerned with the twists and turns of the day. The clouds should clear by tomorrow and you'll feel more like your old self."
virgo,2012-04-02,"You can feel the winds of change blowing through your life, but you're not able to catch the right breeze just yet. It's as if the wind tries to pull you off course instead of pushing you toward your desired destination. However, trying to resist can wear you down quickly. Don't try to fight against the prevailing currents. Follow them until they settle down and then you'll be able to correct your course more easily."
libra,2012-04-02,"You're normally willing to go along with the group if it means keeping everyone happy, and today is no exception. However, you may have a hard time if people keep changing their minds about what they want to do. Ultimately, you might need to take a stand that is based upon your own personal preference rather than for the good of all. You could be happily surprised when others acknowledge your choice and support your plan."
scorpio,2012-04-02,"Instead of working behind the scenes performing your assignments in the same old way, try a new approach even if it means that others have to adapt to accommodate you. Fortunately, an experimental attitude could pay off by saving everyone time in the long run. But even if your idea doesn't work out as expected, no one will fault you for attempting to do your job more efficiently."
sagittarius,2012-04-02,"Although you have your regular work responsibilities to fulfill, things should progress smoothly enough that you have more time on your hands than you expected. Fortunately, you can make good use of a cancellation in your schedule by doing something fun. Squeezing a bit of enjoyment into your day can open the door to an exciting adventure that you hadn't even previously considered."
capricorn,2012-04-02,"It might be more important to set aside your objectives to explore your feelings today. Although everything seems in order at first glance, delving beneath the surface could reveal a layer of complex emotions. Shining the light of your awareness into the murky waters of relationship dynamics can bring a different perspective to a previously irresolvable situation. You are hopeful about the new direction, but it may take time to put your revised plan into motion."
aquarius,2012-04-02,"A friend or an associate may be rather dramatic today when asking for your help. Normally, you would go out of your way to be of assistance, but you might be so busy that it's difficult to fit anything else into your hectic schedule. Nevertheless, it's still a good idea to say yes to those in need without making a big deal about your unavailability. Making time to lend a hand is never a bad investment of your time."
pisces,2012-04-02,"It's challenging to stick to your work schedule today because you want to have fun while doing your job. Thankfully, you should be able to get away with adding some excitement to your daily routine without sacrificing productivity. Ultimately, you can accomplish plenty if you fall into the natural flow of the day. Less resistance on your part leads to more enjoyment and a higher level of efficiency."
aries,2012-04-03,"You might want some breathing room, and thankfully, today may offer you some time to yourself. The problem is that your thoughts are flying by so fast that you don't even realize that you can escape for a while. Don't pass up an opportunity to grab a bit of downtime when it's available because the pace is likely to pick up significantly in the days ahead."
taurus,2012-04-03,"You are receiving mixed messages from the cosmos today. On one hand, you are feeling more grounded; yet on the other hand, sensibility appears to fly out the window. As much as you try to listen to logic, you're not thinking clearly about your future now. Unfortunately, even an insignificant comment could be misconstrued, leading you astray. Think twice about how to respond before you get yourself into trouble. Silence speaks volumes in times of uncertainty."
gemini,2012-04-03,"Although you still have plenty to do, you should be able to accomplish a lot today if you don't get distracted. Your challenge is to tie up as many loose ends as possible prior to Mercury's direct turn tomorrow. However, concentration can be a problem with alluring Venus now in your inquisitive sign. Fortunately, you can do nearly anything if you simply put your mind to it."
cancer,2012-04-03,"You might end up feeling frustrated if you think you can manage everything that's on your agenda today. Even if you haven't overbooked your schedule with too much to do, each task takes more time and energy than you imagined. Controlling your emotions allows you to keep pace; reacting to every irritation only bogs down your efforts even further. Ultimately, if you focus on the finish line, you'll be able to get there in time."
leo,2012-04-03,"Issues about money can place bumps in the road of an otherwise smooth relationship now. Perhaps you need to act with authority as you establish responsible limits. However difficult it is to be the responsible one, setting rules because you are concerned about cash is easier in the long run than hiding your head in the sand. It's wiser to scale back today than to deal with the consequences of a shortfall tomorrow."
virgo,2012-04-03,"You are moving through very tricky territory as the Moon returns to your sign. You may feel spacey today, even if others perceive you with your feet firmly planted on the ground. Your key planet Mercury is in a mischievous mode as it readies to turn direct tomorrow, challenging you to keep your priorities straight and your facts separate from fantasy. Don't make any sudden moves; you have more time than you think to figure things out."
libra,2012-04-03,"It's especially hard to establish a steady work pace because your key planet Venus enters whimsical Gemini today. You might try to concentrate for a while and then take a short break. Don't be overly concerned if you don't appear to be making much progress. Ultimately, you'll accomplish more if you mix things up. Shifting back and forth between creative bursts of energy and short contemplative escapes becomes an efficient rhythm of its own."
scorpio,2012-04-03,"Even if you try to do your very best on the job today, you still might feel discouraged if everything doesn't fall into place. It's difficult to focus on the specific activities that are directly related to your productivity when there's so much happening around you. Temporarily scaling back your expectations can release you from frustration of your own making. Thankfully, a short break, a walk outside or a quick nap may be enough to revitalize you for an additional round of hard work."
sagittarius,2012-04-03,"Exciting ideas are popping into your head, but that doesn't mean you can apply them in a useful manner today. It's almost like you have a high-speed connection to your imagination yet you lack a printer and cannot remember what was previously on your screen. You're not known for being overly attentive to details and now it's even harder to keep everything in order. Just do what you can; you'll have time over the next few days to attend to anything you missed."
capricorn,2012-04-03,"You still may be finishing the tasks you recently started, but you might not get a lot done today. Even if you have a concrete plan, it's hard to stay focused now as your thoughts wander about. Instead of working methodically, you prefer to dream about taking some time off and doing something that brings you pleasure. Nevertheless, you'll have a better chance of turning your fantasies into reality if you hunker down and fulfill your current obligations first."
aquarius,2012-04-03,"You may grow irritated with a close friend or partner who asks for more than you are able to give today. You're eager to share your thoughts about things you want to do, but you're not as interested in talking about your feelings, even if that's what others expect. Nevertheless, don't brush off your emotions as if they don't matter; there's a delicate balance between pursuing your intellectual desires and meeting someone halfway by opening your heart."
pisces,2012-04-03,"You may feel pressured to take care of business today, even if tying up loose ends doesn't seem critical to you. Still, demands are being made that require you to handle so many details that you might grow anxious. Giving yourself permission to daydream now helps relieve some of the stress, even if putting off the inevitable means you'll have more work to do tomorrow."
aries,2012-04-04,"You have been operating your rational world based on old information ever since Mercury turned retrograde in your sign last month. Although you were trying to move forward, your thinking was stuck in the past. However, it's now time to let go of whatever has happened and move on with your plans. Don't look back, even if it takes a few days until you're certain that the previous restrictions are really loosening up."
taurus,2012-04-04,"You're able to speak from the heart now if you choose to share your feelings with others. Your key planet Venus just entered interactive Gemini yesterday, and with Mercury's direct turn today your words touch others with a sensitivity they cannot resist. However, don't get carried away with inflated expectations; it could take several days for whatever you say to have the positive effect you desire."
gemini,2012-04-04,"You can sense that change is in the air when Mercury the Messenger turns direct, especially since this is your ruling planet. You may even feel a bit like Mary Poppins who arrived on a change in the wind and then flew off when it shifted direction once again. However, your current situation is quite different if you can accept that the integration cycle of the past few weeks is coming to an end. Embrace the unknown; it's time to create new experiences."
cancer,2012-04-04,"You may receive a visit from a person tied to your past as mischievous Mercury turns direct and brings you a new adventure. But issues at work can spin around in your head as something that was being discussed weeks ago now returns to the forefront. Whatever surfaces today could prove to grow more important over the next week or so. Scan the events of the last few weeks to see if you still have unfinished business that should be completed. If you do, get busy before it's too late."
leo,2012-04-04,"Your mind is hypersensitive now, but your inner stress may not be apparent to others. You might not want to say everything that you're thinking, but you know what's going on and what to do about it. You are, however, being uncharacteristically cautious, for you intuitively understand how important these days are -- and you don't want to blow your chance. Trust your instincts and make your move only when you're ready."
virgo,2012-04-04,"Your reactions are strong today, yet it may be difficult to express what's going on in your heart. If you tell others what you're feeling, you could inadvertently change the game and things might intensify quickly. You really don't want to upset anyone, so keeping things quiet isn't a bad strategy now. Just be ready to share your desires with someone special as circumstances permit."
libra,2012-04-04,"Your key planet Venus is buzzing with anticipation as quicksilver Mercury turns direct today. Your ideas are innovative, but you can scatter your energy instead of using it wisely. Even if you're at the top of your mental game, sloppy thinking might prevent you from reaching your final destination. Remember, you can't push the river to make it go any faster. Take a few deep breaths and then get back to work; your current confidence will help you achieve your goals on time."
scorpio,2012-04-04,"It's a smart idea to use your mental prowess today to get to the bottom of a problem. Focusing your intentions heightens your senses; your fixed purpose allows you to see right into the eye of the hurricane. You have nothing to fear and can gain strength from the stillness in the center. However, when you're ready, jump back into the winds of change and reclaim your own inner confidence. Your contemplation period is over; it's time to move boldly into your future."
sagittarius,2012-04-04,"You can grow distracted from your daily chores today as you replay childhood fantasies. Perhaps you are dreaming of obtaining superhero powers, imagining what you might accomplish if you could defy gravity, stop time or eliminate evil. Although your human characteristics are obvious, you may be able to perform magic in all you set out to do. Just don't fritter away your time. Act spontaneously and use your creativity to express the passion in your heart."
capricorn,2012-04-04,"You know what you want today, but something is wrong and you are getting strong signals that you shouldn't trust your desires. Normally, you are an expert at downplaying your emotions when they interfere with progress; however, shutting down your feelings is not a smart idea now. Stay in close contact with your heart, no matter how inconvenient it may be. Balancing your ambitions with your more spiritual dreams helps you get the most from the days ahead."
aquarius,2012-04-04,"You might be worried about something that's not quite within your reach of understanding today. Unfortunately, you could waste precious resources spinning wheels in pursuit of some unknown key to your life. Sometimes it's wise to let go of an idea that hasn't reached fruition, instead of setting yourself up for discouragement. Review the past few weeks and make up your mind to push past anything that has been holding you back from following your destiny."
pisces,2012-04-04,"It's as if the world has stopped to give you time to think through a problem that's been bothering you. However, Mercury's direct turn in your sign today indicates a current change of direction. If you recently made an important decision, take one more look at the alternatives before heading down a new path. Reconsidering your options is wise now, but act decisively once you make up your mind."
aries,2012-04-05,"It appears that you're ready to take a risk to get something you want. But behind your optimistic veneer, you might be more calculating than anyone realizes. Fortunately, once you finally climb out on a precarious limb, you're confident that you won't fall. A concrete plan can make the difference between failure and success, so build your strategy on proven facts and not faulty assumptions based on unrealistic dreams."
taurus,2012-04-05,"Although the Moon's visit to your 5th House of Play boosts your desire for pleasure, her shift into your 6th House of Work reminds you of unfinished business. But your key planet Venus titillates you with visions of romance, tempting you to drop everything for the possibility of love. Nevertheless, don't act too quickly because clarity is elusive today and by tomorrow you might want something else. You don't need to give up on finding satisfaction if you can be patient and persistent."
gemini,2012-04-05,"You may be a bit anxious today because there are so many things you want to do, yet you have trouble prioritizing your projects. Normally, you are quite comfortable juggling several tasks at once, but now, the closer you get to making up your mind, the more unsure you become. Thankfully, your confusion should dissipate once you choose to postpone a big decision until tomorrow."
cancer,2012-04-05,"Your imagination is very active today, but even those closest to you might not realize how much you have going on behind your calm demeanor. Unfortunately, your current lack of clarity can get you into trouble if you jump to an incorrect conclusion. Don't trust your logic now since you're able to bend reality in your favor. Be smart and ask someone you trust to give you a different perspective; you'll have a more realistic outlook once you get another point of view."
leo,2012-04-05,"There's nothing wrong with your ability to make decisions now, yet you could mess things up if you act on an impulse instead of trusting your logic. If you are enamored with an idea or attracted to someone special, self-restraint is wise while you consider the consequences of immediately pursuing your desires. If your plan makes sense, waiting a little while won't lessen your chances to find satisfaction."
virgo,2012-04-05,"The analytical Virgo Moon is a reminder that you do your best work if you filter out extraneous data before making any important decisions. But the Moon's shift into objective Libra prompts you to do more research so you can see both sides of a current issue. Nevertheless, it's difficult to discern which information is valid and which is not. Once you accept that fantasies can appear as real now, you're more inclined to spend the time needed to adequately distinguish fact from fiction."
libra,2012-04-05,"Your desire for pleasure can lead you into a complicated set of circumstances with no clear way out as your key planet Venus squares inscrutable Pluto. However, you don't have any reason to avoid the complexity because the delicious possibilities are so sweet. Unfortunately, you may find yourself in deeper water than you expected. For now, err on the side of common sense rather than being disappointed by your lack of satisfaction."
scorpio,2012-04-05,"You are motivated by the notion of accomplishing something very concrete today with the Moon in pragmatic Virgo. However, it's nearly impossible to keep your mind from wandering once the Moon shifts into pleasure-seeking Libra midday. Although your fantasies may be lovely now, it's up to you whether or not to encourage them with your attention. You can enjoy the present moment more thoroughly if you understand how it contributes to the lasting satisfaction of reaching your goals."
sagittarius,2012-04-05,"Follow through with your promises today because others have taken your words at face value and are counting on your performance. You take your job quite seriously now, yet it's easy to misinterpret what is expected from you if you get the details mixed up. Pay careful attention to your instructions by writing them down and then double checking that you heard them correctly. This might seem like overcompensation to someone else, but your meticulous research can save you from wasting time and energy later on."
capricorn,2012-04-05,"Even with your current abundance of creative energy, it's still challenging to find an outlet for your more practical ideas. Your actions might not have the positive results you want, turning your enthusiasm into discouragement. But it's not wise to give up now, for your clouds of illusion are ready to dissipate, leaving you with clear vision. Thankfully, your unwavering determination and hard work eventually pay off if you stay focused on your goals."
aquarius,2012-04-05,"You may reconsider your travel or education plans today, especially if you discover an option that's potentially more enjoyable. However, you could make a foolish decision since you're viewing your future through Neptune's rose-colored glasses now. Although you might be quite sure about your desire to change direction, it's smarter to let things settle down overnight. Don't get caught up in chasing bright lights and heightened expectations. You can always take a more radical approach once you see things in the light of a new day."
pisces,2012-04-05,"The Moon's shift from your 7th House of Partners into your 8th House of Deep Sharing rekindles a relationship dilemma as you balance your innate need for security and your attraction to individual freedom. Although you can be quite obstinate now in your unwillingness to compromise, you don't want to be alone. If you choose your battles carefully, you won't need to sacrifice what is ultimately most important to you."
aries,2012-04-06,"You are eager to do what's best for a relationship today with the Libra Full Moon falling in your 7th House of Companions; however, it could be challenging to balance your needs with those of others. You may believe that a friend or partner is being overly demanding, leaving little room for negotiation. You might come dangerously close to walking away in frustration. But don't quit now; your dreams still can come true if you're willing to give them enough time to manifest."
taurus,2012-04-06,"You're overflowing with good ideas on the job today, but it's tough to turn any of them into something practical. However, you may be trying so hard that your obsessive determination prevents you from seeing the best path to success. Thankfully, the gentle Libra Full Moon illuminates your 6th House of Work, enabling you to widen your perspective and showing you a different way to reach your goals."
gemini,2012-04-06,"The Libra Full Moon brightens your 5th House of Creativity, encouraging you to demonstrate your artistic side today. Thankfully, if you can find your groove, your friends will be there to support your endeavors. But it's not wise to assume others will automatically offer to help you because jumping to conclusions now could lead to disappointment. Being clear in your communication increases your chances of success."
cancer,2012-04-06,"You are very sensitive to today's Libra Full Moon as it reflects your need for security in your 4th House of Home and Family. Unfortunately, your domestic responsibilities may clash with your professional obligations. Or, you might become entrenched in a dispute over who is in control. Although personal relationships are always important to you, focusing on your own career now should help to ease the pressure."
leo,2012-04-06,"The socially active Libra Full Moon occurs in your 3rd House of Immediate Environment, indicating that satisfaction may be found close at hand. But the Sun's presence in your 9th House of Adventure suggests that you're prepared to go the distance, if necessary, to experience pleasure. Fortunately, you don't have to choose one extreme over the other because your path will become obvious in the next few days."
virgo,2012-04-06,"Your concerns about money could grow today as the Libra Full Moon illuminates your 2nd House of Personal Resources. Unfortunately, managing the current situation may not be as simple as you wish. You're tempted to gloss over the complexities, especially if others are involved. But idealistic thinking will only land you in trouble. Pay attention to the facts and deal with the issue as quickly as possible."
libra,2012-04-06,"The Full Moon falls in your sign today, revealing the differences between you and someone else. You may want to make those you like feel better about themselves, but the self-centered Aries Sun is in your 7th House of Relationships, cautioning you against codependency. It's best when you can satisfy your own needs while still contributing to someone else's happiness, too."
scorpio,2012-04-06,"You're more serious about a relationship than others realize today, but they might lack awareness because you're not revealing all your feelings. In fact, today's Libra Full Moon highlights your 12th House of Privacy, encouraging you to put on a happy face while keeping your intensity to yourself. Your motives may be altruistic since you don't want anyone else to be burdened with your concerns, but it's healthier if you share your thoughts with someone you trust."
sagittarius,2012-04-06,"Your social life is in the spotlight today since the Libra Full Moon falls in your 11th House of Networking. But there's a limit to how much time you can spend with others, so it's wise to establish clear boundaries before you squander your energy on group activities that aren't aligned with your current goals. Although everyone benefits from your upbeat attitude, save some time for yourself. You will have more to contribute later if you take care of your needs now."
capricorn,2012-04-06,"Acting in a responsible manner isn't usually a problem for you, but the Libra Full Moon's presence in your 10th House of Career may prompt you to overstep your authority. You might even find yourself in a political struggle that threatens the current hierarchy of power. You could be missing an important piece of information now, so don't try to push your ideas on anyone else. For the best results, take a few deep breaths and slow down your drive to success."
aquarius,2012-04-06,"Knowing the truth is always important to you, but the Libra Full Moon's activation of your 9th House of Big Ideas motivates you to get your facts straight. However, you could become blinded by your own desires now when making your plans. Although you may realize that you're exaggerating, others still take what you say at face value. Carefully distinguishing the facts from the fantasies is a smart move for all involved."
pisces,2012-04-06,"The Libra Full Moon shines in your 8th House of Deep Sharing, prompting you to explore emotional issues with someone special. Additionally, your key planet Neptune is activated by the Sun and the Moon, stimulating your fantasies about romance. You could make significant progress in an intimate relationship, but Neptune can also be deceptive. The magic you're feeling may be all inside your head. Take time to make sure others are on the same page as you are before you do something foolish."
aries,2012-04-07,"It's not easy to remain silent, but withholding your feelings today may be a sensible strategy. Your key planet Mars is anxiously squaring sweet Venus, making it tough to get what you want. Even if you can keep quiet for a while, you're likely to let loose later in the day. However, the less you say now, the simpler your life is. Discretion is the better part of valor."
taurus,2012-04-07,"An unclear social commitment could get in the way of your personal fulfillment today. You might be invited to participate in a group activity that distracts you from something that's less fun yet more important. Your key planet Venus squares assertive Mars, possibly making you indecisive enough to just say yes. However, don't be hard on yourself later if you wish you had chosen differently. Simply resolve to enjoy yourself now and you could have the time of your life."
gemini,2012-04-07,"You may be unsure of what others expect from you today, but you're motivated to take action even if you don't know exactly where you're going. Part of the problem is that alluring Venus in your sign tempts you to take the easy way out of a current dilemma, while her square to warrior Mars indicates a conflict along the way. There's no free lunch; you will end up happier if you struggle with any resistance that crops up now, rather than later."
cancer,2012-04-07,"You may wake up on the wrong side of the bed because you don't think you will get your way today. However, early morning dissatisfaction can morph into midday hope, even if you don't have a concrete plan. Share your optimism while you're feeling it, since your positive attitude is contagious and increases your potential for success. Just remember that you will need to show your cards if you want to stay in the game."
leo,2012-04-07,"You normally hold up well under pressure, but today's challenges might not be easily dismissed. You are growing less certain about a decision you already made, but aren't eager to expose your vulnerability by sharing your fears. Don't waffle if you're involved in any sort of conflict now; it's simpler in the long run to take a strong position, even if it leads to conflict. At least others will know exactly where they stand once you say what's on your mind."
virgo,2012-04-07,"You would prefer to show everyone how flexible you can be today, but your patience may be running thin as aggressive Mars in your sign squares Venus in adaptable Gemini. You wish that others would communicate their needs more clearly, because you don't understand what they want. But instead of criticizing someone else for being indecisive, just go ahead and follow through with your plans. Putting your own life in order is more useful now than trying to manage anyone else's."
libra,2012-04-07,"You're extremely sensitive to unspoken feelings today and might try to ameliorate the tension by stepping directly into the middle of a conflict. However, the current situation may prove to be beyond your control as warrior Mars squares your key planet Venus. Rather than sticking your nose into someone else's affairs, pay attention to what's on your plate, instead. You will have a more positive impact by taking care of your own business."
scorpio,2012-04-07,"Your stubbornness may create problems if you are asked to entertain a variety of possibilities. You want to be more flexible, but too many choices make you crazy today. Nevertheless, it's wise to remain open to the needs of everyone involved. It's easier to get what you want if you demonstrate that you're willing to be a team player, rather than obstinately sticking to your original agenda. Everyone is more willing to compromise when there's cooperation rather than competition."
sagittarius,2012-04-07,"Although romance may be in the air today, it's difficult to make it last. You're so eager to engage your heart in an interaction with someone special that it's tricky to separate your fantasies from what's actually happening. Talking about your feelings helps, but don't expect a miracle because there could be very real differences of opinion between you and another person now. Nevertheless, you can respect an opposing point of view without having to agree with it."
capricorn,2012-04-07,"No matter how ambitious you are today, it's impossible to accomplish everything that is on your agenda. You're easily distracted now because your curiosity is aroused and every new idea that comes your way grabs your interest. Unfortunately, the diversions won't lead you to your destination and you may grow anxious if you're not making progress. However, what you learn now can be worthwhile later, even if you can't see the big picture yet."
aquarius,2012-04-07,"You may grow fearful today if you can't pin down the most reasonable course of action in your love life. Although romance can be exciting now as the cosmic lovers, Venus and Mars, form a dynamic square, it's also unsettling. You're not ready to jeopardize your peace of mind for a piece of the pleasure pie. Keep in mind that the current situation is in flux and the stress is strictly temporary."
pisces,2012-04-07,"It's hard to visualize the outcome of your present actions, so striving for clarity will only lead to frustration today. However, if you're willing to go with the flow now, you can have a fine time. Nevertheless, you're resistant to being led by someone else as magnetic Venus squares macho Mars in your 7th House of Others. Keeping your actions consistent with your desires goes a long way toward relieving tensions before they reach a critical point."
aries,2012-04-08,"You can act in a positive manner to gain the admiration of others, but your efforts will fail if you are avoiding an important issue. It's wiser to be honest now, instead of pretending that everything is fine, even when it's not. Denying the truth won't lead you where you want to go, so take a few deep breaths to center yourself and then simply speak from your heart."
taurus,2012-04-08,"You're feeling enthusiastic now with the Moon opposing optimistic Jupiter in your sign, and your upbeat mood may be contagious. Normally, you warm up to others slowly and steadily, but your loyalty is legendary once you establish a friendship. However, today you're eager to jump in and make something special happen without going through all your usual steps. Happily, your spontaneous affection can open the door to a memorable experience as long as you remain in the present moment."
gemini,2012-04-08,"You may be lost in contemplation now, dreaming about your day with great intensity and concern, yet others might not even notice. They don't see you struggle, even when something isn't going your way. Today, however, you could grow annoyed if someone doesn't acknowledge your feelings, even when you take the time to explain them. Don't dwell on what others think; things will shift back to normal by tomorrow."
cancer,2012-04-08,"When the tides of emotions rise, you ocean-friendly Crabs happily go about your business. Today, with the Moon visiting watery Scorpio, you're pleased to be back where you feel safe. Others might not even see any difference in your behavior because you excel at hiding your true feelings. Nevertheless, letting down your boundaries with a trusted friend enables you to take a significant relationship to the next level."
leo,2012-04-08,"You may be a bit moody today, especially if your emotions get in the way of your intentions. Others can mistakenly believe that your current irritability stems from a situation that isn't working out as you desire. However, the source of your stress now is the contradiction between your head and your heart. It might be time to retreat, and fortunately, spending time on your own helps you reclaim your center of balance."
virgo,2012-04-08,"Although you may be preoccupied today, others still see you as more upbeat than you actually are. Your optimism is clearly visible even if you're experiencing self-doubt. You're eager to move away from the vulnerability of your feelings and into analytical realms where you can gain control. Instead of avoiding the uncertainty, explore the full spectrum of your emotions. You will be richer in experience for having the courage to delve into your feelings."
libra,2012-04-08,"You can easily gloss over a difficult issue because you are an expert at turning an uncomfortable situation into one that's more pleasurable. Nevertheless, there may be mixed messages coming at you now, making it harder to know what to do. Ultimately, you want to be gracious, but some of your feelings are more intense than usual. Don't fake it; covering up your real emotions isn't necessary. In fact, you can free yourself from an old fear if you take a chance and say what's on your mind."
scorpio,2012-04-08,"You can make positive changes in a relationship today as the Moon in your sign opposes lucky Jupiter. Your current confidence makes others feel more at ease. You may even feel as if you are on top of the world now, which enables you to express the intensity of Scorpio without the negativity that often follows. Just pay attention so you know when others have had enough. Your passion is an admirable asset as long as you don't take it too far."
sagittarius,2012-04-08,"You know the score today, but the Moon's opposition to your key planet Jupiter encourages you to avoid anything that appears difficult. However, someone with a less carefree attitude may have something crucial to teach you. Consider volunteering at a hospital or a community event where you can interact with others who aren't as fortunate as you are. You will be rewarded with deep satisfaction if you take the time to connect with someone who can benefit from your positive outlook on life."
capricorn,2012-04-08,"Your day may be tightly scheduled without much breathing room. This structure might bother others, but it's welcome news for you because you like the security of knowing what you need to do. However, things don't necessarily unfold according to your plan, especially if you find something more interesting than what was on your original agenda. Cut yourself some slack and follow your heart's desire, even if it changes during the day. There will be time enough tomorrow to get serious once again."
aquarius,2012-04-08,"You may be feeling restless today, especially if you can't break free of your previous plans. However, getting annoyed with others is of no value at all, even if they seem to be the ones who are preventing you from doing what you prefer. Find a way to blow off some of your unexpressed negativity or your anger could turn to resentment. Thankfully, the resistance will begin to fade later in the day and you should be good to go by tomorrow."
pisces,2012-04-08,"There is a strong wave of emotions rising within you and you should be able to accomplish a lot if you can figure out a clever way to harness the energy. You have a unique opportunity to set things right today even if you are a bit confused by the uncertainties ahead. Don't get caught up in what you don't know. Instead, imagine your idealistic future and then behave as if your dreams are real."

Although you're usually open to someone else's ideas, you may be stuck on a brilliant one of your own now.

Create a new routine gradually; there's no reason to do everything all at once."
leo,2012-04-09,"You may be ready to deepen an existing relationship or head off to start a new one. Instead of interacting with your friends and co-workers in the same manner as you have in the past, explore unusual ways to add more excitement to your life.

Be wise and wait until this evening when the cosmic forces conspire with you in your quest for love."
scorpio,2012-04-09,"A competent sailor is the master of his or her own ship, yet it's challenging to set a course against the prevailing winds. Today you have an opportunity to demonstrate how masterful your navigational skills are, but don't waste your energy fighting the emotional tides for no reason at all. Instead, plan a route that enables you to avoid the tumultuous currents. Once you have a chance to relax and catch your breath, it will be easier to continue on your way with renewed enthusiasm."
sagittarius,2012-04-09,"It's still difficult to apply what you have learned during the past few weeks, but, luckily, you don't have a shortage of excellent ideas. Unfortunately, your thoughts are moving much faster than reality, and you could become frustrated as you're required to wait for events to catch up to you. However, the Moon's midday shift into uplifting Sagittarius rewards your patience. Make as much progress as you can during the next couple of days while the Moon is traveling through your sign."
capricorn,2012-04-09,"Anxieties might rise to the surface now as the pace of change increases in speed. You really don't mind having a lot to do, but you aren't as happy if each activity opens another can of worms. Your day reaches a point when there is too much happening all at once. Nevertheless, don't retreat; finding the humor in the situation helps you regain your perspective. Your confidence returns later in the day, allowing you to move forward once again."
aquarius,2012-04-09,"You have a lot of exciting things to do today and you love the variety of distractions. However, things can get a bit crazy as sweet Venus sextiles wild Uranus.

But it's difficult to wait for the most propitious moment because you are ready to execute your action plan right away. Fortunately, there's no harm in starting immediately; it's just that your efforts will have longer-lasting consequences if you build your momentum gradually through the end of the week."
aries,2012-04-10,"Although you might know exactly what you want, it's difficult to achieve satisfaction today. The problem is compounded if your goals are so unrealistic that there's little chance of ever reaching them. Thankfully, you can reduce the possibility of failure by maintaining your focus on the present moment. When you concentrate your attention on what's happening now, your perspective changes and the anticipation of future success becomes less important."
taurus,2012-04-10,"You may be feeling more assertive in your pursuit of happiness as your key planet Venus tensely aspects the Sun in action-packed Aries. Although you're able to reach past your normal limits now, personal fulfillment still remains elusive.

cancer,2012-04-10,"You may grow nervous when others seem to know too much about you, but there doesn't seem to be an easy way today of keeping your feelings hidden. Even if you go about your work in a quiet manner, somehow you still draw more attention than you want. Don't get angry with a friend or lover just because you are annoyed that your vulnerability is exposed. Be smart and remain silent until you feel safe enough to share what's on your mind."
leo,2012-04-10,"It's all too easy to let your supportive friends bail you out of a tricky situation today. Naturally, accepting help from allies is usually wise, but you have more to gain now by expressing your own truth than relying on others. Take advantage of the adventurous Sagittarius Moon as she visits your 5th House of Creativity. Don't be afraid to try a new approach to an old problem. If it doesn't work out as you expect, you can always resort to your backup plan later."
virgo,2012-04-10,"Even if you have compiled a list of those things you want to do today, it may be more useful to toss it out and start all over. Unfortunately, sticking to your previous plan can place unnecessary limits on you now. Staying alert to possibilities you haven't yet considered could lead to an exciting breakthrough.

Instead of unduly stressing your resources, have as much fun as you can within sensible limits."
sagittarius,2012-04-10,"You're so concerned with reaching your goals today that you might lose touch with your feelings. It appears that others are on your side and trying to help you succeed, but you're not seeing things objectively.

Even if you have specific professional objectives, it's wiser to wait a bit longer before exploring new territory."

Be ready to shift your direction in the next few days when the time is right."
scorpio,2012-04-11,"You are being challenged to accept that something is coming to an end, even if more emotional processing is required before you can move on.

You might feel as if you're being pulled one way and pushed another, but even if you're off-center now, an intense emotional encounter can prove much more fruitful than you think. It may be difficult to settle down enough to work through any one particular issue, but it's crucial to set priorities and follow through with your best intentions."
pisces,2012-04-11,"If personal politics entangle you in social games now, you might attempt to avoid the entire situation.

gemini,2012-04-12,"If someone comes to you with a very practical proposal today, you might be tempted to dismiss it before you even give it any real consideration. Unfortunately, being close-minded is a mistake, for your out-of-hand rejection could inadvertently stir up negativity. Your willingness to be a sounding board is more important than you realize.

cancer,2012-04-12,"Other people could be making demands upon you today that complicate your relationships and make you feel uncomfortable. Unfortunately, the issues raised cannot be easily dismissed. The stress factor is amplified because your instincts tell you to run while the situation holds your feet to the fire. You might as well resign yourself to processing your fears instead of avoiding them, because you can't escape easily. Thankfully, the tension will subside next week if you hang in there now."

You are up for the challenge, even if it presents a high level of difficulty. Although you may be running out of time, you're able to make a commitment to complete a project on schedule. If you do have a temporary bout with uncertainty along the way, don't give in to it. Your doubts will dissipate as you get closer to the finish line."
virgo,2012-04-12,"Paradoxically, you're quite serious about being playful today with the ambitious Capricorn Moon visiting your 5th House of Fun and Games. You look forward to the hard work and to the satisfaction that you can earn. Maintaining a positive attitude is easy if your job involves doing something that is exciting and different.

Keep your priorities straight by acknowledging the special feelings that you have for the ones you love."
scorpio,2012-04-12,"Today's Capricorn Moon lures you into your 3rd House of Information as she connects with passionate Pluto. Someone could have a very intense story to tell you, and you had better listen. There isn't a test for comprehension following the personal disclosure, so do your best to learn something from what is revealed during the discussion. However, communication is a two-way street, so you will need to say your piece, too."
sagittarius,2012-04-12,"Don't commit to more than you can deliver today, even if there's a lucrative idea floating around and exciting your interest. Rather than jumping into something new, finish up your previous responsibilities before you take on additional ones. The pace of your professional progress will increase next week, so keep your attention focused on tying up loose ends rather than dreaming about your next adventure."
capricorn,2012-04-12,"Your motives are complicated now as the Moon in your hardworking sign hooks up with emotionally intense Pluto. Your feelings are stronger than your logic today and your imagination is overflowing with big ideas. Your emotions are rising to the surface, whether you want them to or not.

Ironically, it may be a smart idea to let them remain just out of sight for a while longer, so you don't have to waste your time defending thoughts and emotions that are still in flux."
pisces,2012-04-12,"If you are dreaming about the distant future today, you may be viewing it through a set of very practical lenses. You're not going to be easily misled by your own basic needs, yet you could fall prey to the enthusiasm of someone you love.

Now, as action-planet Mars turns direct today in your 5th House of Love and Creativity, it's time to steady your aim and carefully release your arrow of intention.

sagittarius,2012-04-13,"You may have grown discouraged over these last couple of months with assertive Mars retrograding in your 10th House of Career. You had no idea that it would take so long to accomplish your career goals. Now, as things start to pop, you can see the wisdom in the long gestation process. Nevertheless, don't worry about what you might have accomplished if you were able to work harder or faster; just pay attention to the tasks in front of you and give it all you've got."
capricorn,2012-04-13,"You set your sights on the horizon months ago, but you still haven't been able to find the right path that would lead you to your destination. Now that action-hero Mars turns direct while visiting your 9th House of Adventure, your inspiration is burning brightly enough to blaze a trail straight to the top of the mountain. Taking time to define the fuzzier edges of your dreams enables you to make them real."
aquarius,2012-04-13,"You have been drawn deeper into emotional issues than you normally prefer, but the intensity of the past few months taught you a lot about your own feelings and human nature. Today, as Mars ends its retrograde cycle in your 8th House of Intimacy, you are ready to apply what you have learned.

You see changes on the horizon that can affect your pocketbook and you want to take corrective action before something stressful occurs. Just remember that even if your finances haven't turned out as expected, you made choices in the past that brought you to this point. Reconsider your direction now and make the appropriate adjustments before it's too late."
gemini,2012-04-14,"You would prefer to keep your interactions light and easy now as the Moon in your 9th House of Big Ideas teases you with thoughts of going on an adventure. Unfortunately, Venus in your sign aligns with obsessive Pluto, drawing your thoughts inward. Although you are curious about finding answers to questions about love, you may be frustrated by your lack of success today. Nevertheless, enjoy your inner exploration while it lasts because you'll be pulled back into the real world tomorrow."
cancer,2012-04-14,"You can inspire yourself with your fantasies about your future, but some dreams work in reverse, conjuring fears instead of encouraging success.

Your reasoning is sound; just don't allow your drive for independence stand between you and the love that could be staring you in the face."
aquarius,2012-04-14,"You would like to break free from the constraints that hold you back. You are more intense than usual now, and can even be relentless in your pursuit of happiness.

aries,2012-04-15,"It's important to behave responsibly rather than to ignore your commitments as stern Saturn opposes the willful Sun in your spontaneous sign. There aren't enough hours in the day for you to do everything that sounds good and meet your obligations, too. Although you want to have as much fun as possible today, it's less painful to acknowledge your limitations sooner than later. Take care of business before you run into trouble."
taurus,2012-04-15,"You may not want to play all your cards today and others won't likely notice if you hold some in reserve. Just the same, it might be wiser to overcome your fear and show your hand, or you could miss out on a big opportunity.

cancer,2012-04-15,"Domestic matters may require your attention today, even if you prefer to be doing something else. Unfortunately, your attempts to avoid a serious situation only make the problem worse. But don't be afraid to let others know your position on a delicate issue. You might have to play the role of the heavy hitter now and take a stand on what you know is true. Although there's room to negotiate, first everyone must know the score. Don't retreat until you know that you've been heard."
leo,2012-04-15,"You may have a few big ideas about what you want to do now, but first you must handle a difficult situation in your immediate environment. Don't waste energy fretting about the current restrictions. It's more important to take care of your commitments than to go off and have fun. There will be plenty of opportunities to party later on, but only if you do the responsible thing today."
virgo,2012-04-15,"It's time to pay the piper, especially if you waited until it's too late to do what you want to do. Fortunately, you can work wonders and make up for lost time if you put your mind to it. On the other hand, today could be a day of fruition as your recent hard work finally shows signs of paying off. Either way, you still have to complete unfinished business before you move on. Start early in the day and, perhaps, you will find time later to relax."
libra,2012-04-15,"You might wonder why someone else can take the day off while your responsibilities seem to have piled up to a crucial point. However, nothing is to be gained by comparing your plight to others. You are being tested and you have the opportunity to demonstrate your competence now by working extra hard, even under pressure. More importantly, you can prove to yourself that you're tough enough to do whatever must be done. This is your chance to banish any lingering self-doubt once and for all."
scorpio,2012-04-15,"You may know exactly what you want to do, yet there doesn't seem to be an obvious way to get there now. Your path is blocked, but, thankfully, the barrier is not permanent. It's just that your ideas are being challenged and they must stand up to the resistance that's coming from various parts of your life. Forget about the big picture for a while and focus on taking one tiny step at a time until your progress becomes readily apparent."
sagittarius,2012-04-15,"It seems as if your friends are being overly critical of you today, and you think their judgments are unfair. Perhaps they are expecting too much from you, and you might feel that they are an obstacle to your happiness. However, they are only protecting themselves from getting swept up into your next wild adventure. Get over your discouragement and follow your bliss."
capricorn,2012-04-15,"Others admire your stamina; your hard work and perseverance enables you to reach the goals you set. However, your patience is tested today as your key planet Saturn opposes the radiant Sun, requiring you to pull back on the reins of your life. Naturally, you would rather progress carefully toward your destination without having to slow down or stop. Nevertheless, the sooner you let go of your previous agenda, the easier it will be to create a new one."
aquarius,2012-04-15,"Your friends and family might not realize how much you are struggling to fulfill the commitments that you recently made. The pressure can be great enough that you're tempted to just walk away from your current predicament, but even that won't solve your problems. Fortunately, finding the ultimate solution now may not be necessary. It's sufficient to do the best you can while others adjust to new deadlines based on your ability to deliver on your promises."
pisces,2012-04-15,"Discouragement could set in now, dampening the fires of your inspiration. It's very challenging to be creative when your energy is pulled in more mundane directions. It's nearly impossible to feel upbeat if you are also constrained by your lack of time, money or energy. Don't succumb to your own negativity; instead, let your vision of a best-case scenario show you the way."
aries,2012-04-16,"You don't know what to make of today's events because you truly want reality to support your fantasies. But it is challenging to believe in your dreams if they're not supported by the people in your life. Nevertheless, it's not a good idea to give up. Although it isn't easy to be patient as messenger Mercury enters your sign, suppressing your restlessness now is more useful than quitting too soon. Keep working toward your goal and others will eventually understand your motives."
taurus,2012-04-16,"It's difficult to maintain your established boundaries today because the fluidity of your relationships requires you to be adaptable. You might start the day with a sensible agenda that becomes less helpful by the hour because sticking to it isolates you from others. But don't waste too much time trying to tweak your schedule to make it work. Instead, set it aside and follow your intuition. Save the logical analysis for some other day when you have time."
gemini,2012-04-16,"You might think that your fantasies are getting out of control, but you can quickly regain a healthy perspective once you understand that this temporary phase won't last forever. Don't be overly concerned about losing yourself to an illusion; following the road to success will be easier than you realize. Instead of trying to get your bearings now, enjoy the journey of your imagination while it lasts."
cancer,2012-04-16,"It may be nearly impossible to accurately describe your emotions to others today, yet your disconnection from words enables you to experience your feelings on a deeper level. Don't struggle to be understood; you really don't need to justify your position to anyone else right now. However, it's counterproductive to isolate yourself from those you love. Even if you are unsure of your relationship with your friends now, being in their company will lift your spirits."
leo,2012-04-16,"You may struggle to understand someone who seems to be a total enigma. But sticking to the facts now won't help you get to the elusive truth, no matter how hard you try. Unfortunately, you receive contradictory information today, making resolution even farther away. Instead of overanalyzing the data, step beyond the limits of logic and trust your intuition to guide you through these tricky times."
virgo,2012-04-16,"Although you have received your instructions for the day, you still aren't clear about what to do next. Often, you are very exacting in your work style, but it's a challenge to come up with a plan that will put you back on track today. Unfortunately, requesting assistance may not work now because no one else can tell you what you need to know. Even if you're uncertain, just jump in and get started; a pleasant surprise may be waiting for you."
libra,2012-04-16,"Your key planet Venus needs the safety of sound structure today. Just following your creative whim doesn't work well for you now, because it's not enough to have strains of pleasant melodies wafting through your imagination. You need to be able to discern each and every note clearly. Fortunately, you can make up new tunes to fill in the silence if you feel emotionally secure. Don't worry if you're on your own for a while; you'll be able to reconnect soon enough."
scorpio,2012-04-16,"Life seems even more like a mystery today than yesterday, and you're growing restless since there is no solution in sight. Instead of working harder and putting in longer hours to regain control over that which you lost, let go of your rational attempts to manage the current situation. Once you acknowledge that you aren't in charge, your intuition is free to kick in and reveal your next step."
sagittarius,2012-04-16,"You are usually capable of seeing the big picture, and it's no surprise when your horizons widen to increase your view of the future. But paradoxically, the wider your vision, the less clearly you can see. Your lens on reality is warping the truth, making it difficult to know what's really happening. Don't rely on your senses today; instead, take a risk and trust what appears within your imagination."
capricorn,2012-04-16,"You don't like to let go of control, but you might actually feel a sense of relief today if you stop pretending that you are the master of the universe. Thankfully, your dreams are powerful enough to carry you along for a while, even if they're not based on reality. But you don't have to worry about being practical now, as long as you continue to fulfill your obligations to others. Although you may be resistant at first, give yourself a little vacation from the stresses you deal with every day."
aquarius,2012-04-16,"Although you're often comfortable with your emotional detachment, the Moon's shift into compassionate Pisces this morning shifts your mood and raises the stakes in a relationship. A friend or partner may become confused with your sudden change in attitude, triggering you to feel less sure of yourself. Don't bother trying to figure out what's going on; simply roll with the incoming waves and wait to see where the currents are carrying you. Choose your next move only after your clarity returns."
pisces,2012-04-16,"You can surprise your co-workers with your high level of productivity today if you're able to apply your imagination. But frustration could get the best of you if you are required to perform repetitive tasks that don't leave any room for creativity. Nevertheless, you'll have time for more meaningful pursuits later if you handle your responsibilities right away."
aries,2012-04-17,"Even if it seems like things in your life are moving along according to your plan, the pace suddenly speeds up as if you just entered a time warp. It's gratifying that the future has finally arrived because you were quickly running out of patience. Fortunately, there are no convincing reasons to hold back from doing what makes you happy. Instead of waiting for a better moment, just be sure that your mind is clear before you start something new."
taurus,2012-04-17,"Your determination may help you work relentlessly toward reaching your goals now, but you need to be extra mindful so you don't offend someone by appearing too pushy. Usually, your pleasant attitude puts others at ease so you can get what you want, but it's not easy to fool anyone with your easygoing manner today. Don't try to hide your inflexibility; your real friends will come to your support if you're honest."
gemini,2012-04-17,"Fantastic thoughts are flooding your brain today, giving you rushes of adrenaline now that clever Mercury is in uncontainable Aries. It's easy to impress others with your charming personality, as long as you are considerate when aiming your humor. Unfortunately, you could be so scattered that you burn out before you get to the punch line. Thankfully, you can have a lot of fun for a while and still accomplish everything if you slow down and pace yourself for the long haul."
cancer,2012-04-17,"It's much easier to be more direct in your interactions with others now that chatty Mercury is in outgoing Aries. However, you still have to be careful not to spend too much energy justifying your feelings. You may be inclined to say more than is necessary once you start talking. Being understood is important, but don't be too eager to tell everyone your big plans. Mercury remains in Aries for three weeks, so there's more time than you realize to share your ideas."
leo,2012-04-17,"You are quite positive about life, but you could really take it too far today. Even if everything appears to be making sense, remember that you're not invincible. The signs are encouraging now, yet danger can accompany blind self-confidence. Forge ahead as long as it feels right, but don't be so overbearing that you inadvertently put others on the defensive."
virgo,2012-04-17,"You're naturally attuned to your key planet Mercury, and you may find it difficult to keep up with your own thoughts as it whizzes into fast-acting Aries. This rapid pace can make you uneasy, since you usually prefer to manage all the details yourself. There's no need to fret; your scattered mental buzz is only a passing phase. Initiate action now and deal with the consequences later, even if it's not your typical modus operandi."
libra,2012-04-17,"You could be coerced into choosing sides or taking a stand today -- something that can be tricky territory. Everything feels new and different now that you are reacting so quickly, even while holding on to your old perspective. You might think you are ready to leave your indecisive ways. Be strong, but don't be hard on yourself if you change your mind later; it's your right as a Libra to keep your options open as long as possible."
scorpio,2012-04-17,"Emotional spring cleaning may be your order of business today as rational Mercury activates your cool 11th House of Friends. But you might choose to remain silent because it's hard to be logical now when considering your potential gains. Sink deeply into your memories, recover buried secrets and eliminate the clutter that prevents you from thinking freely."
sagittarius,2012-04-17,"Your point of view is a bit warped by the effects of Mercury jumping into courageous Aries. On one hand, your thoughts continue to ascend into the expansive blue sky, making you eager to say yes. But, on the other hand, you're fully aware of the dangers of free falling. You wish you could deny your fear, but you honestly don't mind being in such a precarious position. Enjoy your current experience, but don't avoid a more serious conversation that allows you to express your darker feelings."
capricorn,2012-04-17,"The stable stones at the base of your foundation may be shaken today, and you must quickly figure out the best way to maintain stability. Thankfully, the damage isn't as bad as it first appears and you could become extremely excited about the possibilities. The greatest obstacle to success might be your resistance to uncertainty. You would prefer to build on solid ground, but may choose to go ahead with your plans, anyhow. Let your exhilaration override your fears and see where it takes you."
aquarius,2012-04-17,"You are a bundle of nerves today strained by the overeager anticipation of an exciting intellectual storm heading your way. Fortunately, you are ready for the action. You're in a mentally active phase and you're up for the challenge. Although you are quite clever in a very original way these days, remember that your innovative thinking is wasted if you don't complete what you start."
pisces,2012-04-17,"The barriers that have recently prevented you from moving ahead have fallen away, and you like the new ideas blowing through your imagination now. Luckily, you are confident enough to show your vulnerability and to talk about what is most important to you. This is a time when you want to make everything you touch better than it was. Nevertheless, you still need to apply your creative vision to the simple practicalities of everyday life."
aries,2012-04-18,"You're eager to start a new project today. Even if there are logical reasons to wait, one thing after another prompts you to hurry up and go for it right now. You are quick to push against any resistance and make something happen. But being overly assertive isn't necessary. Everything is about to change; just be ready to go along for the ride if you are invited."
taurus,2012-04-18,"Reaching your goals might seem difficult, but this is no time to quit. Even if you have been frustrated by difficult circumstances, your ideas are innovative and potentially very valuable. Recognize the recent setbacks as opportunities that enable you to strengthen your plans. But don't hold on to old expectations. Anything is possible if you're willing to shift gears quickly now."
gemini,2012-04-18,"You might wonder why you spend extra time looking into the future now that there is so much happening in the present moment. Actually, sensible planning for what comes next is nearly impossible today, since you cannot know where the current changes are taking you. Temporarily letting go of your desire to be distracted by the variety of so many possibilities can help you navigate your way through a major transition."
cancer,2012-04-18,"Today you may be expected to care for the same people who usually help you. But it might bother you if you aren't being appreciated for what you do; nevertheless, you still must deliver the goods as promised. Even if you like the idea of withdrawing so others notice your absence, a strategy based on passive resistance will likely backfire. Life's easier if you simply show up and tell the truth."
leo,2012-04-18,"You have many logical justifications for throwing caution to the wind today, but it's confusing when there are also significant indications that you may be on the wrong path. Although you could run into opposition to your ideas, it's smarter to slow down your forward movement rather than stopping progress altogether. You have nothing to gain by reaching your destination in a hurry."
virgo,2012-04-18,"Listen to your intuition today, instead of taking your cues from friends or trusted professionals. They might not see things the way you do and their well-meaning advice could lead you astray. Be willing to sacrifice your feelings of connection to others, because engaging in social activities may be less important now than reaching your personal goals. Focus on your own dreams for a while; self-direction can be the catalyst you need to get back on the right track."
libra,2012-04-18,"You are well known for your adept social skills, especially when circumstances are complicated. Now, however, it isn't easy to get others to settle down, especially if no one appears to be listening to you. You could be struggling with your role as a negotiator because you aren't patient enough to figure out everyone's different motives. Just remember that it pays to be kind, even if you cannot consider each person's possible individual reaction to what you might do."
scorpio,2012-04-18,"You're normally able to think strategically, but you may have reached the end of your rope today and are very close to tossing out your previous plans. However, impulsive actions won't likely benefit anyone in the long run. Acting without forethought puts you face to face with unnecessary resistance that will dissipate on its own if you don't push too hard at this time."
sagittarius,2012-04-18,"A weird mixture of positive intentions and negative encounters makes for a rather exciting day. You can't decide if you should take the obstacles you face at work as a sign that you need to change your direction. Or, maybe, someone's aloofness has you concerned about whether or not you did something wrong. Either way, turn the seeds of doubt into the fruits of your labor. You can accomplish nearly anything you put your mind to now."
capricorn,2012-04-18,"Although you know that your normally cautious approach to your goals usually works in your favor, your current excitement is making it difficult to hold yourself back. You're eager to let others know exactly how you feel now, but you don't think that they're going to like what they hear. Trust your inner voice; intuition will steer you in the right direction."
aquarius,2012-04-18,"You are even more independent in your thinking today and are inclined to express yourself spontaneously. Although your message stirs up unexpected emotional reactions, it's better to say what's on your mind instead of keeping your thoughts to yourself. You can always spend time contemplating life on another day; the Moon's conjunction with brilliant Uranus enables you to get your feelings out into the open right now."
pisces,2012-04-18,"You have a very high level of self-esteem today, and are ready to do something that you were avoiding. Although it's important to stick to your core values, be careful not to try to sell your point of view to others. It's not about convincing anyone else that you are right; it's more about acting from the center of your own heart with convictions that are unshakeable by someone else's judgment."
aries,2012-04-19,"You may be in for a treat today, since you actually get to enjoy the sweet comforts of what you already have created. Sometimes it seems as if life is challenging you to stand still even when you're itching to start something new. However, you are happy to build on what you have now, instead of trying to start over. Don't work so hard; take some time for yourself before getting involved with another project."
taurus,2012-04-19,"The Sun's return to your steadfast sign for its annual visit reminds you that it takes a lot to raise your anger level to the boiling point. However, if you're not happy, you could become very angry and turn into a raging Bull. Fortunately, you're a natural lover and not a fighter, so go out of your way to fill your senses with pleasant perceptions. This is your time of year to soak in the beauty of life so don't waste it on negative emotions."
gemini,2012-04-19,"Make an effort to analyze recurring issues that get set aside before they are completed, because it's easy to bury something important and forget about it completely. Instead of accepting what happens at face value, it's better to play detective so you can uncover hidden conflicts. Take care of the needs of others now so your schedule will be clear to begin new projects next month."
cancer,2012-04-19,"Make time over the next few weeks to think about your future, rather than just concentrating on the present. This isn't about the routine work you must do today or about office politics; instead, open your imagination to real long-term goals. Envision where you want to be in ten or twenty years, but be as practical as possible in the process. In the long run, it's more satisfying to sit back and watch your vision take lasting shape than to see it bloom quickly and then fade from the picture."
leo,2012-04-19,"Arguments can bring up stress today as you respond to a display of emotions that doesn't support your current actions. Your personal needs appear to be out of step with what's happening in your life. Manage your affairs with a positive attitude and do the absolute best you can. If you soften your stance now, you'll be recognized for your exemplary behavior soon enough."
virgo,2012-04-19,"You're intensely focused on the minute details of everything you do now as the astrological month of Taurus opens a door to your imagination. However, the Moon's current visit to your 10th House of Career makes it even more crucial to push harder, beyond your own self-limiting boundaries. Expand your heart and widen your vision so you can make the most of the potential when good fortune knocks on your door."
libra,2012-04-19,"Your curiosity may get the best of you today. You are driven to delve beneath the obvious appearances and seek the hidden component of what's going on. But this isn't just an idle wandering; it's more about a search to establish a healthier balance in your life. Thankfully, you should be able to positively impact your world if you can discover what causes are at play. Increasing your awareness may be all that's needed."
scorpio,2012-04-19,"There's no sensible reason to set yourself up for frustration as the illuminating Sun transits your 7th House of Partnerships through the weeks ahead. You are reminded of an apparently irreconcilable gulf between your attraction to complexity and someone's need for simplicity, especially as it impacts a current relationship. Even if you can't resolve these opposite approaches now, your recognition of both extremes can make interacting less of a struggle."
sagittarius,2012-04-19,"The annual journey of the Sun through Taurus makes your life busier, since it activates your 6th House of Daily Routine. You would prefer to be embarking on a great adventure, but first you must put your shoulder to the wheel and complete your chores. Don't be overly concerned; there will be plenty of time to play later. Currently, the real emphasis is on doing the small things that truly matter."
capricorn,2012-04-19,"You are entering into a more enjoyable period, now that the Sun is shining in your 5th House of Fun and Games. However, you could take your current desire for pleasure too seriously by filling up your calendar with a variety of activities. Unfortunately, when creative spontaneity is overly thought out and planned, it can be counterproductive. Put some zip back into your life, but don't go crazy and book yourself with so many diversions that you don't have time to relax."
aquarius,2012-04-19,You may be having a difficult time maintaining your freedom of movement without destabilizing your security. You might not want to give up your independence or your emotional attachments. Keep in mind that no one can solve your conflicts better than you. No drastic action is required now as long as you stay in touch with your feelings.
pisces,2012-04-19,Establishing reliable channels of communication is a high priority today because your thinking may be all over the map. It's not that you're slacking; it's just that you need to pick up the pace now that the planets give you the cosmic go-ahead. But you also need to be more down-to-earth and practical in your everyday interactions. Don't miss the opportunity to stabilize your life in the days ahead.
aries,2012-04-20,"You may push forward blindly if you mistakenly believe that your continued progress is more important now than anything else. But someone's feelings can catch you off guard if you don't take the time to consider the consequences of your current ambition. Although you want to believe that your actions don't concern others, there are many people affected by your choices. Slowing down to think about where you are going today makes more sense than waiting until tomorrow."
taurus,2012-04-20,"You could become obsessive about finishing up old business today with the Taurus New Moon occurring tomorrow morning. But your motives may not be so obvious to everyone else now, making this an opportune time to share what you're still hiding. The current emotional cycle is coming to completion, so let others know about the pressure you feel. Talking about your stress won't make it disappear but it should make your life a lot more manageable in many ways."
gemini,2012-04-20,"You might grow annoyed today, especially if you want to do something special with your seemingly uncooperative friends. Unfortunately, they may go ahead and make their own plans without you. At first, you could feel hurt or even rejected, but it's easy to snap out of your malaise once you remember that your newly found freedom is just what you need. Thankfully, you can always reconnect socially later in the week."
cancer,2012-04-20,"You may have a brilliant plan to reach your goals at work, but you're not very motivated now and might not work hard enough to make the progress you want. But the challenge is all yours; you will have no one to blame if you give up and take it easy today. However, if you decide to forge ahead, use your common sense and ease up for a bit if you receive resistance from your co-workers."
leo,2012-04-20,"Although everything seems to make sense to you at work now, don't think that you have it all in proper order. It's helpful if you acknowledge that you're probably missing some crucial piece of information. Your impulsive actions can throw your friends off guard if they believe that you have all the answers. You don't. Act wisely and take the slow route instead of assuming that doing something faster is better."
virgo,2012-04-20,"If you are thinking about entering into a partnership, read all the fine print in your agreement before signing anything today. Analytical Mercury can mess things up by encouraging you to be more aggressive. Your lack of objectivity is confusing to everyone else, but important things are happening now, anyway. Take your time to consider as many possibilities as you can prior to settling on any one course of action."
libra,2012-04-20,"You might behave in a casual or even disinterested manner today, but that's not really how you feel. In fact, you may be incredibly passionate about your desires. But you could be so wrapped up in what your acquaintances think of you that you withdraw in an attempt to alleviate uncomfortable pressure before it even builds. Fortunately, you're capable of carving out a middle path by honoring your wishes, as well as respecting everyone else's, too."
scorpio,2012-04-20,"You might grow increasingly concerned about your diet, especially if you're bothered by any physical symptoms or specific ailments. Remember it's better to eat smarter than to eat so much that you can't possibly assimilate what you ingest. You still need your nourishment, but quantity is not a substitute for quality. Be aware that proper nutrition fuels you with the energy you need to take on the world."
sagittarius,2012-04-20,"Your co-workers might misread your actions today if they don't understand your overriding philosophy of life. Unfortunately, you can contribute to the confusion if you don't take sufficient time to carefully explain yourself before you head off in a new direction. Let everyone know that you're not really abandoning them; you just need a little time to pursue some current interests on your own."
capricorn,2012-04-20,"You might try to hold your temper today, but something could happen at home that pushes you over the edge. You probably have heard many times that it's not healthy to deny your feelings. Even an emotionally packed conversation won't be of much use unless you can sustain your message. Seeking a creative outlet for your passion is better than taking your frustration out on someone who doesn't deserve it."
aquarius,2012-04-20,"You might think that everything will improve if you just reinvent your day by turning your entire schedule upside down. You may even grow giddy thinking about all the ways to shake things up today. Nevertheless, change isn't valuable now unless it serves a purpose. Save your rebellious actions and radical attitudes for another day when your unexpected behavior is exactly what the doctor ordered."
pisces,2012-04-20,"You are exploring a bit of challenging relationship territory today that's compounded when you don't say exactly what you mean. Although you don't intentionally mean to mislead anyone, you may not consider the effect of the language you're using. Remember, the more words you use now, the less everyone will understand your message. Avoid unnecessary complexity by simply letting your actions speak for you, instead."
aries,2012-04-21,"Conserve your energy to realize the potential of today's New Moon that falls in your 2nd House of Resources, even if you wish you could run off in a totally new direction. There is no benefit to changing your destination because that would only distract you from more important endeavors. It's better to carefully allocate your time and money so you can be more efficient. Instead of pushing harder now, work smarter."
taurus,2012-04-21,"You are at a significant turning point and you must decide what you want to do next. It's time to wipe the slate clean to free you from previous plans. The grounded Taurus New Moon activates your 1st House of Self, empowering you to exert a higher level of self-determination over the weeks ahead by making a decision today. However, choosing your path isn't helpful unless you also commit to giving one hundred percent until you reach your goals."
gemini,2012-04-21,"This is a very important day because the unwavering Taurus New Moon supercharges your 12th House of Destiny. In fact, a seemingly trivial decision could have unforeseen consequences. Although you are tempted to keep things light and easy, it's wiser to be serious as you consider the ramifications of your possible actions. If you are unsure of yourself, refrain from making any changes until you gain more clarity."
cancer,2012-04-21,"Although you may have unavoidable obligations that must be met today, you don't have to be overly concerned with concrete decisions that affect what's happening at work. Instead, it's crucial to acknowledge the trendsetting Taurus New Moon in your 11th House of Long-Term Goals by handling a difficult situation in the present moment while still leaving time to plan for your future. Be courageous in your approach, since your current ideas are more pragmatic than you realize."
leo,2012-04-21,"You might get caught up in your own stubbornness on the job, turning a simple disagreement into a major conflict. Thankfully, your willingness to share the responsibility of power may be enough to take the pressure off. The relentless Taurus New Moon emphasizes your 10th House of Career, empowering you to successfully accomplish a project that you begin today. Even if you don't actually initiate the work now, at least explore a variety of options and make a concrete plan for what's ahead."
virgo,2012-04-21,"If you are considering enrolling in a course to expand your career horizons, today's pragmatic Taurus New Moon in your 9th House of Higher Education could push you further along that track. However, some types of learning involve experiences outside of the classroom, so you might choose to take a working vacation that allows you to widen your vision. One way or another, open up your mind to alternatives that you haven't yet considered."
libra,2012-04-21,"Today's sensual Taurus New Moon in your 8th House of Intimacy is a gentle reminder that two work better than one. Of course, there are pros and cons to collaborating with someone else. You must give up some of your autonomy, but the right partner could make reaching your goal a valuable priority. Being objective and making a smart alliance just might be your best move."
scorpio,2012-04-21,"It's challenging to let go of hurtful memories now, but looking beyond a previously limited point of view enables you to reinvent your frame of reference. Your emotional intelligence is supplemented by your common sense today as the earthy Taurus New Moon activates your 7th House of Relationships. It doesn't really matter how much your life has changed; you still benefit from a supportive friendship if you are willing to entertain the possibilities."
sagittarius,2012-04-21,"You might not be able to easily jump into a new project today because the sensible Taurus New Moon activates your 6th House of Habits, prompting you to stick closely to your regular routine. It's not that you're lacking ambition now; it's just that it's more important to finish what you already started before beginning something else. Keep things as simple as possible until you know where your commitments will take you."
capricorn,2012-04-21,"You are moving into a highly creative phase with today's productive Taurus New Moon stimulating your 5th House of Love and Creativity. You don't want to build castles in the air, yet this is still a great time to do something that harnesses your current enthusiasm. Unfortunately, you're in for a stressful experience if you don't really enjoy your job. If you find yourself facing economic or political restrictions, express your ingenuity in another area of your life."
aquarius,2012-04-21,"There are many changes ahead, yet having stability in your life is crucial now as the Taurus New Moon falls in your 4th House of Security. If you feel safe and secure, you'll be able to build on what you have already gained. However, your future will be more uncertain if you are anxious about your present vulnerability. Either way, set a stake in the ground that can be used as a cornerstone for the foundation you are building."
pisces,2012-04-21,"Today's simplistic Taurus New Moon activates your 3rd House of Communication, encouraging you to stick to the most basic facts in all your interactions. Although you may be a dreamer, temporarily set aside your fantasies so you can focus on reality. Ask for the truth from others and give them the same in return. Meanwhile, don't worry about your current lack of imagination; your creativity will surely return over the next few days."
aries,2012-04-22,"Your world is more internally directed today, even if it's also filled with action. You might not feel very relaxed, yet the thought of withdrawing from your commitments and taking it easy is appealing. Whatever happens now originates as a thought, and you are relatively free to conjure up anything you choose. Use your fantasies to fill your days ahead with new possibilities that move your life forward in a positive direction."
taurus,2012-04-22,"Events happening in your immediate environment can shock you out of your sleepy reverie today. You may try to avoid all the commotion, but you might just waste a lot of energy doing so. The quicker you accept that you cannot escape from the action, the less stress you will feel. If you can let go of your previous plans you could enjoy yourself more than you expect."
gemini,2012-04-22,"Your current annoyance with any emotional restriction that is placed on you now is exacerbated by a strong rebellious streak. Others may be concerned because of your unpredictable behavior, but you're excited about the possibilities. Nearly anything that rescues you from your boredom seems like a fantastic opportunity. Go ahead and be original; have fun, but don't let your responsibilities go unfulfilled."
cancer,2012-04-22,"If you are worried that you haven't been such a good friend lately, you now have the chance to step up to the plate and be awesome in the eyes of others. Don't dwell on the past; guilt only gets in the way of the present. Instead, act with confidence; others will appreciate your presence in their lives if you do the right thing now. Imagine your ideal future and be ready to take a risk in order to co-create it."
leo,2012-04-22,"Exciting revelations about your life path are occurring faster than you can integrate them into your plans. But making sense of your flashes of brilliance now may not be as critical as you think. Even if you are committed to stay on the same course, give yourself permission to entertain any possibilities that cross your mind today. You will have plenty of time to prioritize them over the days ahead."
virgo,2012-04-22,"You may think that you're being tested today to see if you can be practical even if your thoughts seem a bit erratic. However, resistance is likely futile, for your mind is jumping all over the place. Other people might be the source of your fantastic ideas as conversations excite you with new schemes that don't fit in your pre-existing world. This is a time of growth; the exploration of uncharted territories can teach you something vital that you need to know."
libra,2012-04-22,"Don't throw your entire schedule out the window today, even if you cannot stick to it. Just make the changes you must, while maintaining the basic structure of your routine. Paradoxically, the attention you put on the tiniest of matters may be the ones that bring you the most knowledge. Practicing self-discipline isn't easy now, but it can lead to great rewards."
scorpio,2012-04-22,"Your big ideas about an upcoming adventure could suddenly fall apart now, yet this doesn't have to be the cause for disappointment. If one plan fails, it makes additional room for something even better. Unbeknownst to you, your free will is impacting the present moment and your current attitude determines the course of events to follow. Think outside of the box today because nearly anything is possible."
sagittarius,2012-04-22,"You may feel as if you're finally being freed from a difficult emotional situation that is weighing you down. There is great potential now for a real breakthrough. But don't waste energy mulling over what you should have done differently. Instead, put the past into a larger perspective and make a plan for what's next. Even if you don't act now, decide where you want to go and when you will start the new journey."
capricorn,2012-04-22,"A variety of new information is bombarding you now, but it may be difficult to take it all in. You naturally resist if others use their authority to put you in your place, inspiring you to rebel to re-establish your position. Don't worry about losing face today. Nothing will be gained by fortifying your ego or pretending that you know everything. You have a better chance of coming out on top if you can simply trust in the truth."
aquarius,2012-04-22,"Your pet plan may undergo an unexpected attack today from a friend. Or, perhaps, you might have to accept new information that requires you to rethink your previous position. Either way, stay open to what you learn now, for it can help you release emotional or intellectual restraints that have held you back. You will be free to move ahead once you re-examine your basic assumptions and update your perspective."
pisces,2012-04-22,"You may act erratically today as others push you to your limit, and you might react by breaking free from their control. However, your response is less surprising to you than it is to them, because you know your motives behind what you're doing. Don't waste your time and energy trying to justify your actions; you won't likely be understood now, anyhow. Fortunately, your unconventional behavior will make more sense to everyone over the days ahead."
aries,2012-04-23,"You're confident that your plan will be successful today as the radiant Sun harmonizes with your ruling planet Mars. You have plenty of energy and you're willing to pace yourself so you don't end up exhausted. Sticking to your usual routine should work in your favor as long as you don't get distracted by something that's ultimately not very important. Utilize the current connection between your head and your heart, but don't push yourself too hard."
taurus,2012-04-23,"You have a very high level of stamina today and are able to play at the top of your game. But you might grow restless if you're required to focus on one detail after another. You don't mind being practical as long as you are making progress. However, boredom quickly sets in if obstacles slow you down too much. Nevertheless, impulsive actions only bring trouble; follow your initial plan even if you think change will speed things up."
gemini,2012-04-23,"You might try to resist the temptation to become involved with other people's problems now, but listening to someone else's story is easier than dealing with your own issues. Actually, another person's dilemma may hit very close to home, leading you back to the very thing you were trying to avoid. If an interaction brings up something you would prefer to hide, push past your fear. Remain open to an uncomfortable experience if it allows you to learn something positive from it."
cancer,2012-04-23,"It is difficult to downplay your emotions now, since they seem to be spilling over into your actions. Thankfully, you really don't want to keep your feelings to yourself any longer. Nevertheless, whatever you do today might have a long-lasting impact on those close to you. Be careful about what you say; although you can express your perspective without much thought, others may treat your words as the ultimate truth."
leo,2012-04-23,"Sometimes you are so direct that everyone knows exactly what you're thinking. Even if your message creates conflict, you're usually open about who you are and what you feel. However, it may be wise to keep some things to yourself today. Although it's challenging to stay quiet, you'll benefit in the long run from exercising thoughtful disclosure rather than spilling the beans all at once."
virgo,2012-04-23,"Today's harmonious alignment between the willful Sun and action-hero Mars in your sign is a harbinger of good news. No matter what kind of complications are making your life difficult, the resistance is finally fading and you are at the edge of making significant progress. However, if everything has been going well, your life should only continue to improve. Don't worry about the past; it's time to turn the power of now into a strategy for a successful future."
libra,2012-04-23,"You might not know exactly what to do with your emotions today because it's challenging to narrow your feelings enough to connect them to a personal event. Your plan seems logical, yet you cannot fit your actions into a current social context. Recognizing that you don't understand the complex relationship issues at play helps you to maintain objectivity. It's better to settle down and continue working toward your goals than to waste time and energy overreacting to circumstances out of your control."
scorpio,2012-04-23,"You're quite confident that your perceptions are accurate today. Luckily, you are probably right, since your ability to keep things real in a relationship is your greatest strength now that your key planet Mars harmonizes with the Sun in your 7th House of Partners. You're not going to fly off into Fantasyland, but a little excursion into your imagination may be exactly what you need. Don't be afraid to visualize the most amazing possibilities to inspire you to grow beyond the current limitations."
sagittarius,2012-04-23,"You are easily convinced to take on an extra project now, since you are enthusiastic enough about your future that you think you can make nearly anything go your way. Fortunately, your unrelenting determination enables you to accomplish things that might be impossible on another day. You may as well aim as high as you can because your chances for success are great. Just make sure you're focused on the right target or you could end up reaching the wrong destination."
capricorn,2012-04-23,"You feel like a nurtured seedling today as four planets in stable Earth signs give you the support you need in order to grow. Thankfully, you should have enough energy to finish your chores efficiently and still have time left over to relax. However, it's advisable to get as much done in the morning because you might begin to lose focus as the day unfolds. If in doubt, push yourself to accomplish more; you'll be glad later that you did."
aquarius,2012-04-23,"Even if someone is trying to get you to make a commitment, you may have some very real concerns that you prefer to keep to yourself now. Although relationships have become quite complicated, clear communication today goes a long way toward re-establishing boundaries you can live with. Let others know what you want; this is your chance to regain stability as long as you don't promise too much."
pisces,2012-04-23,"You're filled with excess energy today and others are aware of it even if you aren't. Your friends and co-workers want to give you their unsolicited advice for your growth, happiness and wealth. However, you are better off listening to what's in your heart instead of following someone else's vision. Be grateful for what is offered to you, but maintain your perspective and stay on your own path."
aries,2012-04-24,"There's a tricky tension between what you want to do and what you're actually able to accomplish today. If you set your goals too high or try to pack too many things into the day, you may grow annoyed with yourself. It's no fun to realize that you have fallen short of your expectations. However, a more realistic approach could bring success, allowing you enough time to meet each challenge as it appears."
taurus,2012-04-24,"You can make real progress today by simply remaining true to your values instead of trying to reach arbitrary milestones throughout the day. It's easier to overcome your own inertia if you are passionate about your goals. You'll be able to accomplish each successive task on your list if they are part of a holistic approach, rather than just isolated chores. Nevertheless, it's smart to begin slowly and build momentum throughout the day."
gemini,2012-04-24,"Everything seems to magically fit into place today, but there could be so much happening that you don't have time to soak it all in. You might even become aware that something isn't quite right, but it's probably just the ebb and flow of your emotions with the Moon back in your changeable sign. Allow your shifting moods to determine when you should push ahead or withdraw throughout the day. Don't be concerned if your progress is uneven; just enjoy your interactions with others when it feels right."
cancer,2012-04-24,"Your confidence grows when you feel accepted by your peers. Thankfully, your high self-esteem enables you to expand your horizons because you're not afraid of getting into a debate now about something you believe in. Just remember that you can argue with others without having to feel as if they are attacking you personally. It's fine to acknowledge your emotions as long as you keep them separate from the facts that you're discussing."
leo,2012-04-24,"You are ready to laugh off a difficult situation today because you believe that your positive attitude will advance your cause more than taking things too seriously. However, your best strategy might be to adopt a more balanced approach. Although there's no point in worrying about something that's already happened, taking responsibility is more productive now than pretending that everything will turn out fine no matter what you do."
virgo,2012-04-24,"You may be so overloaded with information now that you actually feel a bit confused. You are drawn toward having good data at your fingertips, but it's difficult to separate all the noise from what's valid. The harder you try to get a handle on the facts, the less you seem to know. Leave your analytical thinking for another day; instead, just take it all in and make your assessments tomorrow when your clarity returns."
libra,2012-04-24,"Everything should be running along smoothly now that the easygoing Gemini Moon joins Venus, the planet of love. Nevertheless, a relationship may be the source of an unexpected surprise. Fortunately, you are able to roll with the incoming waves today, even if they are disruptive. But don't try to hold on to an agenda that no longer makes sense; emotional flexibility can transform a sudden change of plans into an exciting and joyful experience."
scorpio,2012-04-24,"Your life is still pretty intense, and, luckily, you have plenty of energy to handle whatever comes up today. Your I-can-do-anything attitude may be annoying to others, but they are quick to trust you to complete a difficult job. Don't let your confidence turn into cockiness or you might end up spreading your resources too thin. It's better to give yourself enough time to do a job right instead of trying to do everything all at once."
sagittarius,2012-04-24,"Today you're able to keep up with someone who was previously running circles around you. However, you may question if this chase is an intelligent use of your abundant energy. Keep in mind that other people's judgments shouldn't prevent you from following your bliss now, so enjoy yourself even if you aren't being very productive. Thankfully, if you have a good time you might surpass your own expectations without even trying."
capricorn,2012-04-24,"You might think that being less controlling could hinder your success, instead of helping you to reach your goals. But demonstrating more compassion is a good strategy today, even if it means keeping some of your best ideas to yourself for a while longer. You don't have to prove yourself at anyone else's expense. Luckily, you should be able to perform reliably once you get started, so set aside your concerns long enough to take a calculated risk. A casual approach at work may pay off more than you think."
aquarius,2012-04-24,"Allowing others to lead the way today could turn into a great relief for you. Your first reaction might be to resist anyone who tries to take charge, but you'll be able to completely relax once you finally relinquish control. Having more time to play now increases your self-esteem. A renewed sense of confidence brings a fresh wave of energy and encourages you to expend the additional effort that can make the difference between failure and success."
pisces,2012-04-24,"You might feel like a fish that's stranded on dry land today. Although there's a lot of mental activity to feed your brain, you long for the emotionally nutritious waters of the sea. But there's no need to waste any time complaining as long as your intentions are clear. Be sincere as you assert yourself to get what you want. If your actions are consistent with your message, others will be willing to support you in your quest."
aries,2012-04-25,"You're eager to share your ideas today and expect others to agree with you or just keep their opinions to themselves. But even if you are right on track, your know-it-all attitude may upset someone who is threatened by your lack of humility. Thankfully, you can easily smooth out potential bumps before you reach them by lightening up your tone. If you don't take yourself so seriously, everyone else will follow your lead."
taurus,2012-04-25,"It seems as if you're being coerced into taking on more work than you want now, but you may not be able to say no. If you resist, you will probably stir up more negativity than if you just swallow your pride and do what's expected of you. But don't be too hard on yourself if it's a struggle to shift into gear today. However, once you get going, keep up the pace and follow through on what you start."
gemini,2012-04-25,"It's easier to be open-minded today because the weight of responsibility is being lifted from your shoulders and taking your self-doubt with it. But reality gets in one last kick that could land you in a challenging situation if you inadvertently start a discussion that pushes someone's buttons. You may unleash more emotional drama than you intended. However, sticking with the process should lead to a quick resolution with the Moon in your adaptable sign."
cancer,2012-04-25,"There may be certain things you would prefer doing now and you don't want to wait for someone else's approval. However, your current impatience could reveal a fundamental disagreement between you and a loved one. Still, it can be healing to talk about issues that you have been avoiding. Remember, there's no need to shy away from a difficult topic as long as you don't blame anyone else for your feelings."
leo,2012-04-25,"You are on a roll today, but your intensity can get you into trouble. Even if it feels as if everything is falling into place, you may push harder than is necessary. If you try to make up for lost time, your eagerness could provoke others to resist your progress. Someone might even work to undermine your position just to bring you down a notch. Fortunately, a bit of conscious constraint on your part should ameliorate any bad feelings that surface."
virgo,2012-04-25,"You may want to keep your feelings quiet today, but someone could lure you into their personal drama anyhow. You could grow annoyed with the whole situation, provoking you to have an emotional outburst. Unfortunately, you can lose your temper so quickly that you don't realize it's happening until it's all over. Don't turn a difficult interaction into a major crisis by dwelling on your anger. Take the high road now; let it go and just move on."
libra,2012-04-25,"The spotlight appears to be on someone else now, but your feelings need to be acknowledged, too. You normally don't mind being supportive of a friend or co-worker, but you might realize that you must stand up for yourself today. Say whatever is necessary to make your needs known. Even if you don't reach satisfaction by being fully recognized, at least you'll feel good about trying to re-establish balance in a relationship."
scorpio,2012-04-25,"You could become agitated today because someone seems to be hurrying you along. You might prefer to halt your forward progress for a little while so you can assimilate how much has occurred in these past few weeks. However, it's difficult to postpone your current obligations. Others are counting on you to do your part, so you may have to wait for another day before you can escape without feeling guilty. Thankfully, letting go of control will grow easier throughout the day."
sagittarius,2012-04-25,"These are very exciting times, but you may be so steadfast in your beliefs that you waste energy defending your position, rather than experiencing the present moment. Fortunately, you can sidestep an unnecessary conflict today by toning down your rhetoric. A sweeping generalization or an unsubstantiated accusation could do more harm than good. You will be more productive in the long run by maintaining a flexible attitude."
capricorn,2012-04-25,"You may be overly concerned about a personal problem today, but the actual situation might not be as critical as you believe. Your emotional insecurity can unexpectedly overwhelm a more rational approach, tempting you to head home to hide. However, the real message is about standing your ground now, rather than calling it quits. It's time to write your own script instead of playing a part in someone else's."
aquarius,2012-04-25,"Consider tossing your previous plans out the window today and starting from scratch. Acting spontaneously enables you to be more creative and ultimately more productive than following a rigid agenda. Don't be too concerned about what someone else thinks of your unpredictable behavior now, even if you face serious objections to your new strategy. A discussion may grow intense for a while, but you'll be glad in the long run that you modified your schedule to suit your own needs."
pisces,2012-04-25,"Developing a good idea isn't enough today; you must also include others in your planning so you have the resources to reach your goals. If you don't involve your friends or co-workers, things could fall apart quicker than you expect. However, discussing the alternatives with your peers prior to making a final decision greatly improves your chances for success. Don't act impulsively now; listen to the feedback you receive before deciding how to proceed."
aries,2012-04-26,"You are intrigued about exploring your own fears that you normally keep hidden even from yourself. It's as if a door opens today, allowing you access to a special room in your subconscious that's usually inaccessible to the light of awareness. Tread cautiously because finding your way in might be easier than dealing with what you discover there. Nevertheless, it's better to know the truth than to fill in the facts with your own subjective worries."
taurus,2012-04-26,"You are a guiding light for your friends today because you can hold your ground in the face of distractions while also planning for your future. Your steady work style is a true inspiration to those around you, even if they can't duplicate your results. But this is no time for complacency, since the tides are continuing to shift and you could easily lose your sense of direction. If you become confused, bring your focus back to your immediate environment until you have re-established your bearings once again."
gemini,2012-04-26,"You must work extra hard today at paying attention to your emotions or you could miss a real opportunity for growth. Although you might think that you recently avoided a potential meltdown, feelings have a tendency to cycle back around now and could catch you off guard. Trust your intuition during a conflict because it will lead you to the higher spiritual ground of forgiveness rather than confrontation."
cancer,2012-04-26,"You may be required to work with someone today who is unpredictable or confrontational. Luckily, you can be sympathetic to other people's feelings without actually lowering your guard. Take a cautious approach to revealing your desires now, for your vulnerability could land you in an unpleasant predicament. Stay focused on your goals, even if you must temporarily separate your personal convictions from your actions."
leo,2012-04-26,"You're eager to approach your work from a different angle today, prompting you to challenge authority just to keep everyone on their toes. But you could run into problems unless you can demonstrate your sincerity. Others won't be impressed with your cleverness; instead, they need to know for sure that you are expressing what's in your heart."
virgo,2012-04-26,"It's not easy to settle down today, even if you're tired of being pulled all over the place by irrational feelings. Fortunately, your ability to look at the facts can put you ahead of the game. You're feeling the stress, even as you analyze the data that comes from your varied experiences. Don't be afraid to emotionally retreat in order to re-establish your own center. Instead of rushing the process now, be patient while you create a more workable plan."
libra,2012-04-26,"Although you appear to be focusing on your work, you may be spending more time lost in fantasies today than anyone realizes. Others assume that you're pitching in and helping everything to run smoother, but you might not feel much like a team player now. You have bigger fish to fry as you seek ways to integrate the day-to-day details into a much larger vision. Acknowledge what's most important to you and let everyone know what you really have to offer."
scorpio,2012-04-26,"If you have been acting scattered the past few days, it's time to pull in your energy and concentrate on exactly what you need. You may be able to get a lot done by eliminating extraneous distractions, but you still might not find enough time to make your dreams come true. Avoid holding on to old judgments about the value of your work. Just show up and do the best you can from moment to moment. Thankfully, a more positive perspective will emerge in the next few days."
sagittarius,2012-04-26,"Recent confusion may trigger open conflict today, yet a passionate discussion can clear the air of ill feelings and lead to an unexpected agreement. However, you might develop resentment if being stuck in a debate prevents you from reaching your goal. Trying to sell your solution now only widens the gulf. When you acknowledge the differences instead of avoiding them, antagonism will morph into cooperation and common ground can be established."
capricorn,2012-04-26,"You could be so single-minded about your beliefs today that getting along with others seems unimportant. You may feel as if everyone is taking an extreme position with no middle ground on which to stand. Unfortunately, the intensity with which you approach your ambitions can scare people away or coerce them to make harsh decisions. Moderating your passions with some kindness makes the day more pleasant for all involved."
aquarius,2012-04-26,"You're normally capable of managing your own feelings by keeping them to yourself. However, suppressed frustration is likely to boil over today and spill out of its safe container. Don't waste energy acting surprised about your negativity; it's much healthier to acknowledge what you have known for a while. Although your emotions can be quite inconvenient now, it's better for your friends and associates to know what's in your heart."
pisces,2012-04-26,"You may be more inclined to trust your instincts about love and friendship, even if they draw you into a confrontational situation today. Others might not agree with you now that your perspective has widened. The facts as you know them resonate with a larger-than-life worldview. But it's better to take it slow even if you are confident about your position because unnecessary conflict can undo the positive steps recently taken."
aries,2012-04-27,"You don't have to pretend that everything is under control today. In fact, trying to hide any self-doubt only increases your transparency. Thankfully, you can turn your lack of confidence to your advantage if you're willing to climb out on a limb and honestly talk about your fears. Instead of looking foolish by covering up what's obvious, get your worries out into the open. Others will come to your support if they believe that you're speaking from the heart."
taurus,2012-04-27,"You may feel as if your feet are finally back on the ground now. Thankfully, the path ahead of you appears to be clear, enabling you to see where you're going. However, rather than simply continuing in the same direction, take a bit of time to reconsider your priorities. If you are working too hard, be sure to schedule time for play and rest. Maintaining your overall health is possible when you give yourself permission to relax."
gemini,2012-04-27,"You may be curious about who is helping you if you receive support from a hidden benefactor today. However, it's not really important to get to the source; just accept whatever positive energy comes your way without trying to analyze everything. But your plans could backfire now if you attempt to attract additional assistance. Simply go about your work with a grateful attitude and release your attachment to whatever happens."
cancer,2012-04-27,"You might not be able to cover up your feelings today, even if you think that you can crawl into your shell and hide. But your worries could transform into your greatest strengths now if you embrace them. Unfortunately, your fears complicate your day even further if you pretend that everything is fine. Thankfully, you should be able to overcome nearly any obstacle by openly acknowledging your concerns to the right person."
leo,2012-04-27,"You're much more resilient than you realize today. Although you could be feeling residual anger from a recent disappointment, you can bounce back quicker than you expect if you don't spread yourself too thin. Cut back your activities so you have extra time to rest now. After all, once you're done with your first round of chores, you are free to do more later on. Meeting obligations in small increments allows you to regenerate your energy rather than depleting it."
virgo,2012-04-27,"You may be feeling a more down-to-earth energy today, which is very different from the past few days of idealistic dreaming. A methodical approach to your long-term projects gives you a much better chance to achieve success. But you don't have to worry about reaching your goals right away. If your targeted destination is worth your effort, it is also worth the wait."
libra,2012-04-27,"You want to take care of others today, but you may not stop with your closest friends and family members. You could choose to extend your loving and nurturing energy into the community or workplace. Just be careful not to take your wish to enhance the lives of those around you too far. Don't put your nose into business that isn't your direct concern or you might be perceived as a manipulative person rather than a helpful ally."
scorpio,2012-04-27,"You may be trying to achieve the impossible by pleasing everyone now. However, it's smarter to simplify your life rather than complicate it. Still, your friends and associates are relying on your participation today so you can't just disappear. Remember, you can still play a significant, positive role in someone's life without taking responsibility for anyone else's happiness."
sagittarius,2012-04-27,"Although you're on a positive roll, an uncomfortable feeling is surfacing today. You may be worried if you don't have a plan to overcome your current resistance to work. Even if you're pushing up against real deadlines now, they may not matter as much as you think. Fortunately, you can maintain your productivity by working hard without wasting energy panicking over things you cannot change."
capricorn,2012-04-27,"Remaining compassionate about other people's needs is the key to your current happiness. It's not that your feelings are totally dependent on someone else; it's just that you don't live in a vacuum and your life is intertwined with those closest to you. Although you might wish that you could avoid an emotional meltdown, a heartfelt discussion can lead to revitalizing a troubled relationship."
aquarius,2012-04-27,"There's a lot happening in your life that others cannot see today. The Sun is well into its month-long visit to your 4th House of Security, motivating you to take the emphasis off your career by strengthening the foundations of your home and family. In fact, establishing a strong personal base will ultimately empower you to go out and develop your community presence later on."
pisces,2012-04-27,"Your psychic sense is heightened now by the hypersensitive Cancer Moon. Sudden flashes of awareness break through the barrier between the present moment and the future, enabling you to see new possibilities. However, it can be tricky to distinguish true intuition from your desires today, so don't assume that every dream will automatically come true. Nevertheless, your imagination is still an indispensable tool in your decision-making process."
aries,2012-04-28,"You're in a creative mode today and are pleased that your projects are finally moving along. Even if you bump up against very real concerns, you know that the tide has shifted and things are going your way now. But don't let your excitement tempt you to spread your energy too thin or you could lose focus on what's most important. Pick one project and stick with it until you are happy with the results."
taurus,2012-04-28,"There's no quick and easy way to get your head and your heart working together now, since they are tugging in totally different directions. Even if you know what you feel, the present circumstances may require you to act in a certain way. Don't be too hard on yourself if the logical solution isn't the ideal one. What's most important is that you stay open to all the voices coming from within. The stress will resolve on its own accord, allowing you to feel good about the ultimate outcome."
gemini,2012-04-28,"You may have unexpressed ideas that are difficult to bring out into the open. Nevertheless, you feel the need to take a necessary risk in order to be heard now. Unfortunately, the current circumstances are more complicated than you prefer. Although you usually like having multiple choices, saying what's on your mind can be the catalyst that makes your life simpler now."
cancer,2012-04-28,"Trusting someone close to you isn't always easy, but you're willing to open your heart to gain intimacy now. However, you don't want to sacrifice your stability just to feel connected. Fortunately, you may have a chance to gain financial and emotional security without giving up on the priceless intangibles. Stand up for yourself and make a commitment to honor both your need for safety and your desire for love."
leo,2012-04-28,"You are sowing your oats now that the Moon is back in your sign for a visit. In fact, you're probably feeling everything -- the good and the bad -- at a louder volume than usual. Although it may be challenging to keep your emotions quiet, a fortunate outcome is indicated if you honestly share your heart's desires today. Just make sure that communication is a two-way street. Take the time to acknowledge the special gifts that others bring to the table."
virgo,2012-04-28,"Travel plans that you have been working on for a while are finally taking shape now. Or, perhaps, you're enrolling in an educational program, making your upcoming journey a mental one. Either way, you're at the threshold of a great adventure and previous resistance continues to fall away as Mars in your sign gains speed. Fortunately, you receive an extra boost of help today from the practical Sun-Pluto trine, so focus on a single goal and work to make your dreams come true."
libra,2012-04-28,"Your current concerns today may be about how to take your recent accomplishments and solidify your position. You don't want your past efforts to be for naught, yet circumstances are changing and you must change with them. Concentrate on the best parts of what you've already done and consider how to repackage your hard work for the future."
scorpio,2012-04-28,"Others are depending on you today, and you're ready to deliver on whatever you promised. However, your good intentions may fall to the wayside if you believe that someone is taking your contribution for granted. You're not interested in playing hard to get; you truly want to do your part. Instead of letting your feelings sour, be clear and let others know what you need from them, too. You might be pleasantly surprised when they respond in a way that meets your greatest expectations."
sagittarius,2012-04-28,"You are receiving a burst of positive energy now, but it's not without complications. You're ready to take a trip -- in the real world or within the realms of your own mind. Either way, you have something to learn and are eager to get started. But first, you must take care of your chores. You won't be able to step into the next adventure until you finish what's already on your plate."
capricorn,2012-04-28,"The next few weeks can be a very creative time, but it may take another day or two to find a pace that you can sustain. Fortunately, you have the capability and stamina to handle even the most complicated projects now. Even if someone else is pulling the strings, you still have enough latitude to move as you desire. Just remember that your determination is your greatest ally this weekend. But don't try to do too much at once; being patient leads to your best work."
aquarius,2012-04-28,"Relationships tend to be confusing for you Aquarians this weekend. Although you might have high expectations, clarity seems elusive. Paradoxically, the more data you gather the less certain you become about what you want. Move beyond the rational world of knowing and enter the illogical realm of feeling. Even if your emotions are less comfortable than your thoughts, this is an excellent opportunity to express what's in your heart in new ways."
pisces,2012-04-28,"Trying to separate your strong desires from what makes the most sense can be tricky business today. On one hand, you know that there are specific things you need to do, and you'll get what you want if you do them well. On the other hand, you may be unwilling to play the game and could lose an opportunity for fulfillment if you're unable to compromise. However, this is not about choosing one side or the other. There's plenty of room for several shades of gray between the black and the white."
aries,2012-04-29,"You are more persuasive than usual today because you're fully connected with the core purpose in your life. You have a strong positive impact on others if you remain true to yourself, so pay attention now to what you value most. Your integrity is non-negotiable; once you are clear about your priorities you can let circumstances influence your progress, but not your direction."
taurus,2012-04-29,"Others might not understand you today because the words to describe your emotions don't come easily. Since it's difficult to put your feelings into language, just work with whatever comes to mind. There's no reason to push the process. Your patient persistence produces the best outcome. Nevertheless, starting the discussion now still makes the most sense."
gemini,2012-04-29,"Your actions are aligned with your intentions today, making for an unbeatable combination. Your friends and family members are more inclined to listen to you because your behavior conveys the fire of your convictions. Choose your words carefully to express what you mean, but don't expect immediate results because it may still take a few days for your message to sink in."
cancer,2012-04-29,"You are tapping into a deep well of feelings today and are willing to tackle an important issue. You're in a wonderful position to learn something new about yourself, assuming that you have the courage to sink into your own emotions. Don't try to explain your motives for everything you do; others will just have to respect your choices and your need for space."
leo,2012-04-29,"You may spend a lot of time and effort tempering your extreme feelings today, but emotional moderation might be an elusive goal these days. You can become worked up over a situation if you think there are critical  issues at stake. As challenging as this conflict sounds, you just have to take a leap of faith and let go of control. Fortunately, you could be pleasantly surprised at everyone's willingness to jump in and do their part."
virgo,2012-04-29,"Your power of concentration is working well for you now, leaving little that can get in your way of success. Trust your intuition; you know what is happening, even if you can't yet put it into words. Meanwhile, create a concrete plan, but give yourself a few days before you share your current scheme with anyone else."
libra,2012-04-29,"Your creative juices are flowing, enabling you to express what's in the hidden recesses of your imagination. Nevertheless, it may be too soon to know where this inspiration will lead. But don't worry if you can't get far enough ahead to get some perspective, because you could exhaust yourself doing so. Just ride the powerful currents in order to reap the rewards later."
scorpio,2012-04-29,"The door to treasures within your subconscious is unlocked as the radiant Sun harmonizes with penetrating Pluto today. These gems are often unreachable, but now you have access to the mysterious secrets of the universe. Step confidently into the shadows, even if you're unsure of what you might discover. Pay careful attention to all the signs; your heightened awareness helps to dissolve your fears and reveal rich emotional rewards."
sagittarius,2012-04-29,"Your greatest growth may come from concentrating on your regular routine and simply doing your daily chores as powerful Pluto trines the Sun in your 6th House of Details. Fortunately, you could even enjoy crossing one item after another off your list of things to do. Fulfill your responsibilities before seeking additional excitement because you won't be able to indulge in recreational activities until your work is done."
capricorn,2012-04-29,"You may be obsessed with the possibility of love today, but it's not wise to fall victim to unrealistic fantasies now. Even if you want to escape reality, there is work that you must do first. Enjoying yourself in real life can minimize your dependence on your imagination, but don't run out on any promises you already made. Concentrate on fulfilling your obligations before you lose yourself to a dream."
aquarius,2012-04-29,"Someone may be trying to assist you from behind the scenes today, but it's difficult to tell who it is or why they are doing it. Ease up on your attempts to be in control and try to settle into the restricted flow for a while. Loosening the reins could bring unexpected benefits. You may be happily surprised when you set aside your irrefutable logic and place your trust in the wisdom of the changing circumstances."
pisces,2012-04-29,"You are being lured into unfamiliar waters of emotional intensity today, even if you are frightened by what you don't understand. Don't close yourself off to the possibility of having an incredible experience just because of your irrational fear. Instead of paying attention to the noise inside your head, sink into the feelings of your heart."
aries,2012-04-30,"Your romantic urges jiggle your imagination today, prompting you to act on your feelings even if they don't make sense. Unfortunately, you might not see the pitfalls of your advances until it's too late. There is wisdom in not expressing everything you feel right now, especially if your message elicits a response that makes your life more complicated. Consider other people's reactions before you say something that you will later regret."
taurus,2012-04-30,"You are often the one who is quite stubborn, especially if anyone tries to get you to do something that you think is off the wall. Your determination is strong, but rather than resisting the plans of others, the tables may be turned today. If you run into someone else's resistance now, take a hint from reality and try adding some flexibility to your approach."
gemini,2012-04-30,"Recent domestic stress may finally be settling down a bit now, enabling you to look forward to what's next. Thankfully, you're feeling optimistic today and others could turn to you for inspiration. However, your smartest strategy is to simply tell your admirers that you really don't have all the answers. Your lack of leadership might disappoint a few people at first, but your choice to remain objective empowers everyone to make their own choices."
cancer,2012-04-30,"Your self-confidence may be overinflated now, perhaps helping you disguise a past hurt. If you find yourself exaggerating your case, take a serious look at your motives. But don't just give up and withdraw; instead face the truth head-on. If you hide behind a false bravado, others won't be able to make contact with the real you. Sharing your fears creates an opportunity for love to blossom."
leo,2012-04-30,"Although there's not much holding you back today, this lack of resistance can work in one of two ways. On the upside, your cheerful attitude positively impacts those around you and they feel the warm and loving side of the Lion's power. However, on the downside, you might be overbearing without even realizing it, prompting others to see you as selfish. Roaring loudly won't prevent anyone from seeing your faults. A gentle approach allows others to engage your radiant nature with ease."
virgo,2012-04-30,"You have the natural ability to sense what ails those you love now. Fortunately, you can use this intuition in a way that allows you to be very gracious, and therefore emotionally accessible to your partner or friend. However, trying to cover up your fussier side is a mistake. Instead, just engage others with humility and compassion when discussing difficult issues. This isn't the time to be overly critical; show your magnanimity through acts of forgiveness, instead."
libra,2012-04-30,"You are typically adept at transforming your shortcomings into more positive traits, but it takes real courage to be open and vulnerable in front of others. This self-expression is not, however, about playing the role of a martyr or being passively aggressive. Stand your ground, even if it means disappointing someone else. Be yourself. There's nothing to be gained from trying to live up to anyone's expectations but your own."
scorpio,2012-04-30,"Your sensual needs can be the source of sadness now, but it is this very same emotional hurt that brings about spiritual transformation. Don't try to deny any feelings of inadequacy or disappointment. Instead, explore the idea that you may have set unrealistic expectations when it comes to love and relationships. However, accepting the irrefutable fact that to be human is to be imperfect enables you to enjoy yourself without worrying about what anyone else thinks."
sagittarius,2012-04-30,"You're all dressed up today and ready for the show. It feels as if your time has arrived and you need to swing into action to maximize your potential. You are riding a wave of positive planetary cycles that leads you to believe you can accomplish anything you desire. Obviously, you can get a lot done now, but it's still not a smart idea to bite off more than you can chew."
capricorn,2012-04-30,"You Goats excel at facing the facts, even if the truth isn't what you want to hear. You are such a professional that you can receive bad news and turn it to your advantage through hard work and pure determination. However today could be a good news day that inspires you to maintain the status quo. Be smart and take time to enjoy your current success, but don't let it lull you into dreaming that it will last forever. Keep an eye toward the future and consider what needs to be accomplished next."
aquarius,2012-04-30,"The idea of sudden change may be upsetting to you, unless, of course, you're the one initiating it. However, the best opportunities often enter your life through unexpected events. Even if you feel very strongly about your current position on an important matter today, remain open to modifying your opinion. The more flexible you are in your thinking, the better you can take advantage of these dynamic times. Don't pretend that you know everything now, even if you secretly believe you really do."
pisces,2012-04-30,"You may be feeling a bit weird today, as if someone changed the lenses on your glasses without bothering to tell you. Objects may be closer now than they appear on your viewing screen. The most sensible way to navigate through the day is to continually bring your focus back to what is most immediate. It's only when you look into the distance, either in time or in space, that you become confused. Concentrating on the details in the present moment is your key to staying on track."
aries,2012-05-01,"You can finally breathe a sigh of relief today, even if you're still feeling tired from a recent whirlwind of activity. However, the change of pace is partially an illusion, since you ultimately know what you're going to do. Just don't fall into the trap of believing what you see now because your current rose-colored glasses make nearly everything look better than it really is. Act on the facts and not on your idealistic dreams."
taurus,2012-05-01,You have an air of magic about you today and others will likely notice your sparkle. Don't make any sudden changes if things are already going your way. But stirring up the status quo in a relationship can be a smart move if you're feeling stuck romantically. Be certain that you know what you want before you make a move that cannot be undone.
gemini,2012-05-01,"You may be feeling restless today, but you need to balance your wanderlust with your domestic responsibilities. Make the most of your sensible outlook early in the day while you still can get some work done. You might even try to distract yourself by starting a creative project to avoid the chores you haven't yet finished. However, taking care of business first gives you time to play later without feeling guilty."
cancer,2012-05-01,"You wish this could be a day of rest, even if you have lots to do at work. Naturally, you need to be responsible by taking your job seriously, but overexerting yourself now doesn't make sense because you could end up exhausted. Nevertheless, you can successfully enlist others to help you finish in a timely manner. Ask for assistance, but don't expect everyone to drop what they're doing and save the day."
leo,2012-05-01,"Although this can be a very memorable day, it's up to you to make it special; the magic won't happen all by itself. Taking control of your career now is the best way to accomplish this transformation. Consider a practical project that's big enough for you to sink your teeth into, but don't wait for anyone to tell you what to do. Let your talent shine for everyone to see."
virgo,2012-05-01,"Don't waste time trying to figure out how to be more productive today. Thankfully, you have an opportunity now to take care of something that has been on your mind for a long time. But being successful is about more than just getting a job done. Procrastination isn't such a good idea; ultimately you'll feel a sense of relief once you've crossed the item off your list."
libra,2012-05-01,"Your imagination is hyperactive today, flooding your conscious with more fantasies than you can easily integrate. But as long as you discern the difference between reality and fantasy, you'll be able to thrive. Enjoy making magic within the misty depths of your own dream world. Just make sure that you also pay attention to what's actually going on around you so you don't miss the chance to make your creative mark."
scorpio,2012-05-01,"Although the same stresses are still following you around today, you have the tools to gain stability now from the rhythms you've established. If you think your life is chaotic, take time to smooth out the rough spots. Ironically, you're required to relinquish your tight grip of the controls, even if you're afraid your chores won't get completed. Nevertheless, relaxing with others revitalizes your energy and prepares you for what's ahead."
sagittarius,2012-05-01,"You may believe that you already analyzed every little detail in your new plan, but your associates might have a different view of things. Taking a shortcut will only get you into trouble today and you could be left holding the bag as you try to talk your way out of an awkward situation. Luckily, you're able to see the big picture if you are willing to go back over the data now and figure out how it all fits together."
capricorn,2012-05-01,"Feelings of uneasiness wash upon the shores of your consciousness for no apparent reason today. And when something does happen without an observable cause you might become restless, yet unsure of your next step. Your subconscious may be sending loud messages as a reminder that some things remain outside of your control. Don't reach too far now or you'll only end up frustrated trying to accomplish the impossible."
aquarius,2012-05-01,"You've been lured off the edge of the map of logic and nothing is exactly as it seems anymore. Unfortunately, you may feel more confused throughout the day, even if everything appears normal. If you're floating in the realm of feelings today, you still might believe that your feet are planted firmly on the ground. Act cautiously everywhere you go now because the boundaries between reality and fantasy will continue to grow hazier for a while longer."
pisces,2012-05-01,"Your affinity for fantasy may create unnecessary relationship drama today. On one hand, you're drawn into the elusive magic of your imagination as mental Mercury aspects supernatural Neptune. On the other hand, you're very pragmatic now as the Moon, Pluto and the Sun form a stabilizing Grand Earth Trine. If you attempt to evade someone's expectations, your life will only grow more complicated. Take the time to handle the real issues first and you might end up feeling free to dream afterwards."
aries,2012-05-02,"There's no need to waste words justifying what you are doing now, since the more you share your intentions, the less sure others become. It isn't that you are on the wrong track; it's just that you cannot explain yourself very well today. Save your energy for your work because it's critical that you live up to your commitments without further excuses."
taurus,2012-05-02,"You want to garner more support from your peers at work, but you might be feeling so confident today that you ask for too much. Your charming nature works in your favor now as long as you don't take someone for granted. Respect other people's limits and acknowledge the constraints of the current circumstances. Luckily, simply being yourself is your best strategy."
gemini,2012-05-02,"You realize that you must narrow your focus if you want to get anything accomplished at work today, but you're still eager to check out every new distraction that comes your way. You cannot help yourself because you are curious about other people and would choose an interesting conversation over a boring task any day. Unfortunately, you might have to bite the bullet and postpone expanding your mind for a little while. Don't complain; just do your job and return to your explorations tomorrow."
cancer,2012-05-02,Your co-workers or friends might make promises today that are well-intentioned but difficult to fulfill. No one is purposefully trying to mislead you; it's just that it's easy to get swept up in a moment of optimism now. It's wise to take commitments lightly without assuming that everyone will follow through on what they say. Be responsible for your own actions so you don't need to involve others and then feel disappointed if they let you down.
leo,2012-05-02,"You can make a boring chore sound like a load of fun today, but it will still be a drag, no matter how much you dress it up. Your ability to dramatize the facts might also be useful for creating an excuse if you want to avoid an unpleasant task now. Nevertheless, be careful that you don't stretch the truth so far that you get caught in your own web of deceit."
virgo,2012-05-02,"Although you're often quite exacting in how you put facts together, today you're tempted to bend reality in your favor. Ironically, you might not even be aware of your current biases. Luckily, you are intelligent enough to aim for a more objective approach. Don't exaggerate because the truth is more powerful than any story you could make up. Take the high road and simply be honest."
libra,2012-05-02,"Although all your senses may be stimulated today, it's your irrational fascination with a new idea that lands you into trouble. The attractions of your key planet Venus are pulling you all over the place because she is traveling through multifaceted Gemini. However, a challenging square from the single-minded Virgo Moon prevents you from fulfilling your fantasies. Reaching satisfaction will be more likely tomorrow when the Moon is back in your sign."
scorpio,2012-05-02,You're tempted to sweeten a bitter pill today because you think you'll have a better chance of being heard if you're extra nice to everyone. But this strategy of playing the perfect messenger can be tricky. Don't jeopardize your credibility by embellishing your story. It's better to be appreciated for telling a difficult truth rather than to be admired for sharing a work of fiction.
sagittarius,2012-05-02,"Your key planet Jupiter is traversing some strange territory today, making it impossible to know which path is best. On one hand, you can buy into someone's straightforward vision. But on the other hand, you might not even stop to consider the problems. Take a cold, hard look at the little details now prior to finding yourself in over your head."
capricorn,2012-05-02,"Your current enthusiasm about a new project might stir a lot of interest today. However, you must have real data to support your position or others will abandon you as quickly as they initially joined in. Do your routine chores first; if an opportunity is really as lucrative as it sounds, it will still be waiting for you later. Remember, it's the tortoise and not the hare that wins the race."
aquarius,2012-05-02,"Following a hunch often works in your favor, but today you might easily find yourself in trouble. You can imagine the potential in almost every opportunity now, but your radical idealism makes it hard to see things as they truly are. Don't forget to take a little extra time to objectively analyze the situation before signing on to be part of the team."
pisces,2012-05-02,"Your loyalty is a true gift to your closest friends, but your exuberance can grow out of hand. Although everyone appreciates your vote of confidence, things won't necessarily turn out according to your expectations. Give yourself a reality check now; recognizing the truth today can save you from unnecessary discouragement tomorrow."
aries,2012-05-03,"Your recent uncertainty about a relationship is fading and today you might actually know what you want to do. However, the problem is that you may still need to alter your plans, unless you are willing to go to the mat to defend your position. Unfortunately, the tone of your voice conveys more negativity than you actually feel because warrior Mars creates a cranky aspect with interactive Mercury. Pick your battles wisely or you could end up fighting for the wrong cause."
taurus,2012-05-03,"Be wary about getting lured into a disagreement today that doesn't really concern you. If it's too late before you realize what's happening, then do your best to act like a peacemaker. There's no need to be fearful and react with stubbornness. Instead of expressing your anger, convert it into something positive now and use your creativity for the good of all."
gemini,2012-05-03,"You could find yourself embroiled in a war of words today, only to quickly realize that you don't even know why you're fighting. Everything seems to happen so fast that you just jump right in to defend what you think is right. Take a few deep breaths and count slowly to ten before you respond with an inflammatory remark. This simple act of self-restraint allows you to avoid an unpleasant scene and maintain a healthy perspective."
cancer,2012-05-03,"You might be able to see a way through a complicated maze today, but reaching your destination isn't as simple as it seems. Talk about your plans with your associates before you make your move because it may be hard to untangle yourself from the mess after the fact. But sharing your perspective isn't enough; make sure you listen to what others say now if you really want to make progress."
leo,2012-05-03,"You often enjoy being the center of attention, but today there is a price to pay for standing in the spotlight. If things don't go as smoothly as you expected, you may become overly defensive about your recent decisions. Instead of blindly holding your position, prepare to change your mind if given a sensible reason. Working behind the scenes gives you the chance to direct the show."
virgo,2012-05-03,"If you can get in touch with what's really important today, you just may avoid a conflict that's brewing around you now. This hot-button issue probably isn't a big deal, but words can be thrown back and forth as fast as lightning, wounding your self-esteem or injuring someone else's feelings. Take the process one step at a time and keep bringing the conversation back to the real message at hand."
libra,2012-05-03,"Even if you think you are acting in an objective manner today, the Moon's presence in your sign has others seeing you as more moody than usual. This perception can work to your advantage, but you still need to be honest about your emotions. If you try to hide your feelings, you might find yourself in the middle of a shouting match that you didn't expect. However, starting off with a quiet conversation in the first place could prevent things from getting out of hand."
scorpio,2012-05-03,"You might feel as if time is running out with the Moon traveling through your 12th House of Endings. But rather than attending to your unfinished business, you may instigate an argument just to get something out in the open for discussion. Unfortunately, this plan can backfire, especially if you are trying to manipulate the situation to your advantage. There's no need to control everything now; you'll be happier if you temporarily allow others to be in charge for a change."
sagittarius,2012-05-03,"You can inadvertently make a mountain out of a molehill today without even trying. You may be feeling on-edge, ready to turn something that is said into a major conflict. Thankfully, a sweet friend or partner could come to your rescue, offering you kind words and helpful support. Everything seems very urgent now, so cut yourself some slack and think twice before shooting off at the mouth."
capricorn,2012-05-03,"A friend needs you to come through for them, either at work or in your community. Although you excel at being objective, it's not as easy for you to stand up and be judged. It may be more important now to be a diplomat rather than a superhero. Consider the various points of view before you intervene so you can help others avoid an unnecessary ego dispute. Cultivating peace is an admirable way to spend your day."
aquarius,2012-05-03,"A conflict at home may get a bit worse before it starts to improve. Fortunately, you have reached a critical point on your own path, and lingering tensions can be resolved now if you handle things correctly. Avoid arguing just to hear the sound of your own voice. Listen to the silence and speak only when you have something positive to say. Choose your words cautiously and remember that practicing forgiveness is healthier for your heart than holding a grudge."
pisces,2012-05-03,"The confusion theme is probably getting somewhat tiresome for you now, but rest assured that you are just about done with this phase of heightened uncertainty. Naturally, this doesn't mean that all will be clear as a bell in the future. The universe doesn't work that way, for it always holds some secrets in reserve. You will sleep easier once you accept the fact that some of life's greatest mysteries will always remain unexplained."
aries,2012-05-04,"It's difficult to maintain objectivity because you already know what you want. However, your feelings continue to intensify throughout the day. The graceful Libra Moon assists in your process of re-establishing equilibrium, but you are unable to hold on to a detached point of view once she shifts into subjective Scorpio. Let go of your previous expectations to make room for something new and exciting to enter your life."
taurus,2012-05-04,"The Moon's current visit to your 6th House of Daily Routine signals a return to normalcy. Although you may notice the big changes unfolding at work, your smartest strategy is to simply do your job today without getting caught up in endless possibilities. You don't know how everything will play out in the long run, so concentrate on keeping your life as stable as you can for now."
gemini,2012-05-04,"You have conflicting emotions today when it comes to someone you like. On one hand, you can see the positive benefits of pursuing a friendship or a romantic connection. But on the other hand, it's less complicated to keep your feelings private. Instead of spending so much time analyzing what your next relationship move should be now, just follow your instincts and listen to your heart."
cancer,2012-05-04,"You may think that someone's working behind the scenes to convince you to do something that benefits others more than you. Unfortunately, your resistance to making concrete plans might appear selfish, even if you know that you're doing the right thing. Don't be afraid to stand up for your beliefs. Even if your choice is unpopular, you'll gain respect in the long run for acting in a responsible manner instead of just trying to please others."
leo,2012-05-04,"Your creative powers are extremely strong today, emboldening you to express your long-term intentions. Nevertheless, your current ambitions require a fair amount of personal effort. This isn't about putting on a show for others; instead, make a commitment to only work for what is important to you. Determination and followthrough are the key ingredients to your recipe for success."
virgo,2012-05-04,"You may think that you have a balanced approach to your finances now, but you could be misled by your own ideals. Even if storm clouds are obscuring your vision, you can still see a bright blue sky in your mind's eye. Positive thinking is usually helpful, but it's more important to acknowledge things as they are today and not as you wish them to be. Remember that there's power in simply knowing the truth."
libra,2012-05-04,"Although you're obviously capable of understanding both sides of a complex disagreement, your friends and associates might see you as more ambivalent today than you actually are. Ironically, you may have a distinct opinion about what's happening, but you recognize the wisdom in keeping your perspective private until everyone has a chance to speak. An open dialogue is essential for clearing the air before you tell others exactly what you think."
scorpio,2012-05-04,"You have a lot happening within your imagination now -- more than anyone might guess. Thankfully, you can hide your fantasies from everyone else without much effort. However, keeping your secrets becomes more challenging as the day unfolds. Ultimately, your behavior reveals your true feelings, especially if you've grown tired of pretending everything is OK when it's not. Telling the truth little by little is wiser now than blurting it out all at once."
sagittarius,2012-05-04,"Share your plans early in the day or it might become too much of a battle to say anything at all. You know where you want a conversation to go and are tempted to manipulate the circumstances to reach your destination. It's simple when you're just telling a friend about an abstract idea. However, life gets complicated if you're overly attached to the outcome. Remain open to whatever happens today, but don't be so compliant that you sacrifice your self-esteem in the process."
capricorn,2012-05-04,"You are very strategic in your planning since your professional objectives are clear and you'll do whatever it takes to reach your goals. Unfortunately, nothing is as straightforward as it initially seems; as the day progresses you must balance your own needs with those of your friends and associates. Don't assume that your secret dreams are the same as anyone else's now. Just continue to clarify your ambitions and work steadily toward success."
aquarius,2012-05-04,"You clearly understand both the useful benefits and the possible pitfalls of your current plan. Unfortunately, positive thinking remains elusive until midday. But then, the plot thickens as others realize how important your goals are to you now. Nothing is gained by backing down just because you're worried about what anyone else thinks. Your persistence is the best guarantee of success."
pisces,2012-05-04,"Your outstanding performance enables others to see how determined you are now, yet you have more happening beneath the surface than meets the eye. Even if a powerful friend accuses you of trying to impress others, the truth is that you're just pushing to accomplish a lot while you still feel in control. Although everything seems to be very intense today, you actually have a couple of weeks to put your life in order before this window of opportunity closes."
aries,2012-05-05,"You must stick close to the facts today because any deviation from the truth elicits a quick reality check. Witty Mercury is in your impulsive sign, prompting you to speak before you think about the impact of your words. Unfortunately, you're not going to get away with shallow communication now because the Scorpio Full Moon shines in your 8th House of Deep Sharing. Creating common ground in a relationship requires that you meet others halfway."
taurus,2012-05-05,"You may have big ideas about how much you want to accomplish today, only to discover that you underestimated the time needed to finish your work. If you promised more than you can deliver, someone might show his or her displeasure with your lack of productivity. It's tempting to ignore criticism with the Scorpio Full Moon's presence in your 7th House of Others. However, you'll be happier in the long run if you put in the effort to keep the communication channels open without becoming overly defensive."
gemini,2012-05-05,"You aren't willing to accept criticism about something you consider trivial as the Scorpio Full Moon illuminates your 6th House of Minutiae. Your sharp tongue can be quite cutting today if someone gets on your case. Just remember that your sarcasm might be a product of your unexpressed hurt feelings. Instead of using humor to mask the truth, take a deep breath and acknowledge your vulnerability. Your willingness to sink beneath the surface could lead to a new level of intimacy with a trusted friend."
cancer,2012-05-05,"Nostalgically dreaming of a time in the past when your love life seemed less complicated won't help your current situation today. The passionate Scorpio Full Moon in your 5th House of Romance bends your social life a bit out of shape, but the perceptual warping is just a sign that change is inevitable. Don't retreat from a serious conflict that needs to be addressed now. Facing a tough relationship issue can bring your emotions back into harmony."
leo,2012-05-05,"Your unexpressed emotions are being stretched like a rubber band today, and the tension makes you feel extremely uncomfortable. Unfortunately, there are no quick and easy answers to the complex situation that has developed in your personal life with the Scorpio Full Moon lighting up your 4th House of Foundations. If current circumstances are creating stress, rest assured that things are about to change for the better. The upcoming shift will be easier on everyone if you schedule enough time for home and family."
virgo,2012-05-05,"You know that things in your immediate environment need to change soon, but you don't know exactly how. Even if you choose to maintain the status quo in your daily routine, you still feel the pressure of the current dynamics. The intense Scorpio Full Moon illuminates your 3rd House of Communication today, motivating you to say something that isn't easy to bring out into the open. However, sharing your emotions is a catalyst for the improvements you are now desperately seeking."
libra,2012-05-05,"Sometimes you really do have a tough time making up your mind, but this doesn't mean you are wishy-washy. In fact, you tend to go out of your way to be fair and objective when choosing one direction over another. Now, however, you must decide while all your options are still available. The Scorpio Full Moon falls in your 2nd House of Core Beliefs, prompting you to hold on to your position even if you are uncertain. Be strong; don't compromise your values for the sake of temporary convenience."
scorpio,2012-05-05,"Today's emotionally charged Full Moon is in your sign, making you very sensitive to the energies around you. However, you could inadvertently lessen your effectiveness by expressing your feelings immediately. The smartest thing you can do now is to carefully observe your inner process rather than just being controlled by your reactions. Waiting for the right moment to share what's on your mind enables you to gain power rather than lose it."
sagittarius,2012-05-05,"Something important is happening today, even if you don't yet understand what it all means. The provocative Scorpio Full Moon brightens your 12th House of Destiny as powerful unconscious forces pull you in directions that aren't yet apparent. If your life seems to be out of control now, it's wise to just roll with the waves for a few days. Meeting reality halfway is a much better strategy than trying to resist changes that are inevitable."
capricorn,2012-05-05,"Your plans may be up in the air today with the mysterious Scorpio Full Moon in your 11th House of Long-Term Goals. Nevertheless, it's not that you're lost in the dark because you have probably struggled long enough to figure things out. But now that you clearly understand the dynamics, you still don't know how to make it all work. Relinquishing control doesn't mean that you have failed. To the contrary, letting go at the right time is a true act of courage and grace."
aquarius,2012-05-05,"Although other people are depending on you today with the Scorpio Full Moon in your 10th House of Public Responsibility, you aren't even sure that you can rely on yourself. It isn't that you lack confidence in your skills; it's just that you may feel as if you're in over your head now and the pressure to get it right is overwhelming. Don't let your fears work against you. Breathe deeply and do your best; no one can ask for anything more."
pisces,2012-05-05,"Your vivid imagination enables you to see things more clearly than others. Today, this paradoxical approach to reality may be a burden, for it isn't a simple task to explain your intuitive process to anyone else. Nevertheless, the Scorpio Full Moon's presence in your 9th House of Future Vision helps you to positively impact the unfolding changes by visualizing them just before they occur. Trust your intuition now, for your feelings are probably more in tune with the big picture than you think."
aries,2012-05-06,"It's difficult to tell what others want today because their motives are a mystery to you. Even when people take the time to explain themselves, your anger could get in the way of understanding them. Instead of being so combative, just be receptive to what's said without thinking about your response. Acknowledge that you truly heard the message and then remain quiet, rather than creating unnecessary conflict. There will be time for working out your differences after the tension settles."
taurus,2012-05-06,"Everything feels complicated today, tiring you out before you even start your day. The passionate Scorpio Moon in your 7th House of Partners can place so much stress on a relationship that you're tempted to withdraw as a defensive tactic. Unfortunately, the resulting emotional detachment might send the wrong message, prompting others to question your intentions. Instead, stay present with your feelings now, even if they cause temporary anxiety. The stress won't last once your clarity begins to return."
gemini,2012-05-06,"Your friends and family may be an endless source of annoyance today because they want to turn simple conversations into dramatic emotional encounters. You, on the other hand, aren't interested in such distractions, even if that's not how others see it. The Scorpio Moon's visit to your 6th House of Routine is an ideal time to examine how you tend to avoid your feelings when they don't easily fit into your plans. Investigating your own motives can be a very powerful experience now."
cancer,2012-05-06,"You don't like it when someone uses his or her position of authority to persuade you to change your mind. But you might be inclined to hold your tongue and revisit that familiar place where you internalize strong feelings instead of expressing them. Unfortunately, suppressed anger can taint an otherwise fulfilling relationship. Seek creative ways to get your feelings out into the open without antagonizing anyone else in the process."
leo,2012-05-06,"You may be agitated today because none of the alternatives in front of you are exactly what you want. Unfortunately, it's difficult to find the right option if your mind is already made up. It's easy to suggest that you should be more flexible; but it's not simple to set aside what you know is right. Putting the current dilemma into proper perspective can ease your mind. Ironically, whatever choices you make now may not be of great consequence down the road."
virgo,2012-05-06,"You may be shocked by how quickly a simple discussion can turn into an open disagreement -- even if you're on the same side as your opponent. Usually, you can still work closely with someone, even if your opinions differ, especially while focusing on a common goal. Now, however, the Scorpio Moon magnifies the gulf between you as it moves through your 3rd House of Communication. Calling for a truce is the diplomatic way of handling things, but you must be willing to step back from the conflict first."
libra,2012-05-06,"You're more certain of yourself now, and you may attempt to explain your position to others. Paradoxically, the same people that were previously intimidating seem to be less ominous today. You're no longer willing to take a submissive role just to placate someone else. Nevertheless, you can do your part by avoiding open conflict, as long as you don't sacrifice your values in the process."
scorpio,2012-05-06,"The unrelenting Scorpio Moon pulls you deeper and deeper into the hidden recesses of your own subconscious. This might feel like a familiar process, but you sometimes prefer to avoid the intensity because it can be an exhausting experience. Although there may be an energetic price to pay for full-spectrum living, the potential of this enlightening transformation is quite alluring. Keep in mind that this is your own journey and you can take it anywhere you want."
sagittarius,2012-05-06,"You like to find the good in everything -- even in a difficult situation -- yet the extreme power of today's Scorpio Moon convinces you to steer clear of anything that you don't understand. Your rational mind is not in charge now; the more you attempt to avoid the mysteries of your dreams, the more they draw you in. Don't waste energy resisting the inevitable; you will emerge stronger in a few days once you submit to the magic of emotional metamorphosis."
capricorn,2012-05-06,"Your emotions are quite intense now and you wish you could handle your internal journeying alone, but meddling friends only make things more complicated. Unfortunately, there is no simple way to cut others out of your current process unless you are willing to face their overly dramatic reactions to your rejection. Remember, your true allies offer you a crucial perspective, even if it's one based on information you really don't want to hear. Be grateful that you have people in your life who care about your happiness."
aquarius,2012-05-06,"You are caught between a complex need to be recognized at work and a wish for a simpler life that seems elusive now. Unfortunately, if you decide to withdraw from your professional world, you may not feel completely fulfilled. Yet if you don't give yourself enough time at home, you might remain personally dissatisfied. There's no quick solution to this temporary dilemma, so just play it out in your fantasies until your clarity returns."
pisces,2012-05-06,"Your desire to stretch your mind beyond the mundane day-to-day reality meets resistance from your friends and family who think you're better off focusing on your personal life. Thankfully, other people's fears aren't enough to prevent you from thinking about going on an adventure or embarking on an educational journey of discovery. Although you might not be able to leave today, don't let anyone stop you from dreaming. Your future reality begins as a seed in your imagination, water it and watch it grow."
aries,2012-05-07,"You may be bored with an aspect of your work and are tempted to do something drastic about it now. However, if you really want to make changes that matter, don't act impulsively today or you might see a current opportunity slip through your fingers. It's smarter to establish long-term goals instead of pushing too hard for short-term gratification."
taurus,2012-05-07,"Although aiming high is usually a good idea, you may be too idealistic for your own good today. If you set yourself up for failure you could lose sight of what you can actually accomplish. If you fall short of your goals, don't try to shift the blame to anyone else. Remember, there probably isn't anything wrong with your execution; it's just that you might have reached too far."
gemini,2012-05-07,"The Moon is traveling through your 7th House of Others, shining her emotional spotlight on everyone except you. But don't lose sight of the fact that the real lessons come from confronting your feelings, and not from unconsciously projecting them on to those around you. Acknowledge your reactions as your own; your response to what happens is ultimately more significant than what someone else might say or do."
cancer,2012-05-07,"You usually err on the side of caution, but now you're likely to say you can do something before you even think about the actual steps. Be careful or you might have to backtrack on your commitment. But don't be overly concerned if you need to renegotiate a promise made earlier in the day. It is better to be straightforward and let everyone know what's going on as soon as you realize you won't reach your goals. No one will fault you as long as you're honest and try as hard as you can to fulfill your obligations."
leo,2012-05-07,"You have a lot of extra energy that has nowhere to go today. Unfortunately, if you can't find a way to express it in a healthy manner, you might suddenly lose your temper. However, participating in sports, going on a hike or exercising at the gym may be enough to take the edge off the tension."
virgo,2012-05-07,"Normally, you have plenty of common sense at your disposal, but you seem to have lost your sound judgment today. You're striving for a more unconventional approach to a solution, but you may not be able to logically justify your radical ideas now. Unfortunately, others probably won't support your efforts if your plan isn't practical, so examine your strategy once again before disclosing any details."
libra,2012-05-07,"It's challenging to relax now because you are eager to catch up on all the little things that you've recently let slide. But your good intentions may not be enough to shift you into gear right now. Although you know what you must do to reach your destination, you might resent having to be productive at this time. If you decide to postpone your chores, at least make smart use of your time by allowing yourself to get the rest you need."
scorpio,2012-05-07,"You may be considering an adventurous plan to purchase something you've wanted for a while. Now that the acquisition date is getting closer, it's time for you to do another round of research. You probably set very high expectations, yet you might be surprised at how much everything costs. Don't needlessly stress about money now because practicality will win out over fantasy soon enough."
sagittarius,2012-05-07,"You are feeling emotionally vulnerable today because everyone seems to know how you are doing before you say a word. The cavalier Sagittarius Moon is in your 1st House of Personality, setting your emotions right out in the open for all to see. Instead of worrying about what others may be thinking of you, just enjoy being recognized for who you truly are. There is no need to hide; your fearless heart is your greatest strength."
capricorn,2012-05-07,"You want to escape today and, fortunately, a bit of rest and recreation is a great idea. You spend a lot of time taking care of business and must act responsibly in your daily life. Now, if you dream about taking some personal time or going off to play with friends, don't judge yourself harshly. Working too much isn't healthy; it's better to embrace your desires and give yourself permission to unwind sometimes."
aquarius,2012-05-07,"You might wish for a bit of quiet relaxation at home today, but social activities make it tough to take the time off. The friendly Sagittarius Moon illuminates your 11th House of Friends while the steadfast Taurus Sun radiates in your 4th House of Security. Finding the right balance is challenging now, but it's crucial not to overdo either extreme. Don't push your limits even if you're eager to have fun. If you go too far, you may have to back off your commitments tomorrow so you can recuperate. Moderation is key to keeping everything afloat."
pisces,2012-05-07,"You naturally take charge today because it seems that you intuitively know what needs to happen next. Although you may not understand why things are unfolding so smoothly, circumstances fall in your favor now. However, if you grow too confident, you might assume more authority than is necessary. You could even wear yourself out trying to keep up with your commitments. To avoid disappointment, make sure to leave plenty of time for fun."
aries,2012-05-08,"You are ready to make your move today, but you may be totally perplexed if your enthusiasm is dampened by insignificant events as your ruling planet Mars forms an uncomfortable aspect to erratic Uranus. It is challenging to know exactly how much self-restraint works best so you don't overwhelm anyone with your irrepressible intensity. Maintaining a healthy sense of perspective will guide you in the right direction."
taurus,2012-05-08,"You may be impatient today, latching on to anything that makes sense. Although industrious Mars in logical Virgo continues to offer you an effective solution to your dilemma, it's tricky putting your knowledge to work. It's challenging to contain the energy that's currently being released. You don't need to rush ahead now; you will have a better chance of reaching your destination if you slow down to establish a steady pace that you can sustain."
gemini,2012-05-08,"You typically like being in transition because the lack of structure enables you to feel free. But you might struggle as you try to find your rhythm today because the speed of change shifts between too slow and too fast. Unfortunately, the more you think you can control the direction of the day, the greater your level of frustration. Let go of your established agenda now and go along for the ride."
cancer,2012-05-08,"Your resistance to sudden change may pay off today, but your current victory is a short-lived solution to a complicated problem. You might be able to stop yourself from blindly jumping ahead because you realize that it's smarter to take your time. However, you can't prevent the wheels of progress from turning. Eventually, you must lift your foot from the brake and adjust to the faster pace of life."
leo,2012-05-08,"You may think that you'll be able to break out of your rut today, but something unexpected could happen to thwart your efforts. Thankfully, your discouragement won't last because it's hard to feel disappointed when so many positive things seem to be right around the next corner. Your penchant for excitement will be rewarded if you can keep things low key for just a while longer."
virgo,2012-05-08,"You can feel a surge of energy today as feisty Mars in your sign aligns with shocking Uranus, adding to the recent buildup of intensity. However, you must be careful to take care of your needs or you could end up depleting your reserves. Don't waste energy chasing every enticing idea or object that pops up. Make a sensible plan of attack and stick to it until you see tangible results."
libra,2012-05-08,"Although you might be swept up by someone's enthusiasm today, don't give up on your own dreams in the process. It can be difficult to establish a healthy balance between the boundless adventure awaiting you in a relationship and your personal drive toward success. Don't just agree with your friends because it's easiest to take the course of least resistance. Listen carefully to your heart now before making any significant decisions that you might later regret."
scorpio,2012-05-08,"You can envision the end goal of your professional trajectory, encouraging you to work hard on a project today so you can gain success down the line. But current circumstances may be beyond your control, so avoid additional stress by concentrating on one small step at a time. Instead of visualizing the big picture, focus your mind on manageable milestones along the way. Remember, inch by inch it's a cinch."
sagittarius,2012-05-08,"A familiar dilemma may return now that the Moon is back in your sign. You are ready to choose between boldly charging ahead with what you have and waiting until you're completely ready for the next step. You understand the wisdom of patience, but you would rather move quickly today. Your current drive for self-expression is powerful, so make sure that you don't ignore the needs of those you love."
capricorn,2012-05-08,"Your co-workers seem to have lost touch with reality today as they get caught up in a flurry of impatience. You may feel as if you're the only one left with any common sense because you're willing to slow down and actually think about the consequences of your actions. Still, it's tricky being cautious without sounding negative. Don't worry if someone criticizes your need for a more reliable approach to success; they will come around to appreciate your good advice in due time."
aquarius,2012-05-08,"You cannot settle into a steady rhythm at work today, which makes you feel a bit awkward. One moment you are bombarding everyone with your crazy ideas, but suddenly your embarrassment has you overcompensating by keeping your thoughts quiet. Don't put too much effort into following the middle path between these two extremes or you could end up being disheartened by your lack of success. Let the instability settle down on its own and then you'll know what to do."
pisces,2012-05-08,"Accepting criticism is the wisest thing you can do today, for your erratic behavior may truly be all over the map. Thankfully, an acquaintance's accurate perceptions and clear feedback give you just the advice you need to turn your scattered initiatives into a highly effective action plan. But don't take what you're told too personally; just listen very carefully and be patient while deciding your next move."
aries,2012-05-09,"You may have grown quite comfortable with the speed of your thoughts, but you still must slow down your mental processing today. A fast response isn't as critical in conversations now, for others are already aware of how quickly your mind works. Don't speak just to demonstrate your cleverness. If an issue is important enough, take your time and make your point clearly for the maximum impact before moving on to the next subject."
taurus,2012-05-09,"Mischievous Mercury is in your pragmatic sign for the next two weeks, adding a high-frequency buzz to your usual air of practicality. Instead of doing what makes the most sense now, it's tempting to just talk about it. Unfortunately, it might be challenging to tangibly apply what you know at this time. Even if you don't get a lot accomplished today, you can still put your overactive mind to work by reading a book or learning something new."
gemini,2012-05-09,"Your outlook on life is changing as rational Mercury shifts into pragmatic Taurus. You might even feel like your choices are more limited now that the communicator planet slips into your hidden 12th House of Privacy. But you may grow bored if you're not interacting socially, so it's crucial to figure out how to stay mentally engaged. Take advantage of the slower pace to plan your next move."
cancer,2012-05-09,"You may suddenly remember a previous emotional situation that can assist you in your current work with others. You prefer to lead by example while being strong for your friends. However, your real strength doesn't come from doing anything today; instead, it's all about the power of your convictions. Stick to your truth and you will receive the respect that you deserve."
leo,2012-05-09,"Your current practical approach to communication works well for you today, but you may experience an inner conflict between your personal and professional goals. Fortunately, you can accomplish nearly anything you put your mind to now, even if you wish you were doing something else. Just remember to think your plans through all the way to the end before you head out in the wrong direction."
virgo,2012-05-09,"You may think that sharing your plans for the future with a close friend or lover is a smart idea today. However, you could lose precious time explaining your thoughts instead of just putting them into action. Preparation time is over; express yourself by working toward your long-range goals now rather than dispersing your energy by talking about them."
libra,2012-05-09,"True grit and sheer determination push your thoughts into action today, even if you might normally wait for a more convenient time to start a new project. But it's not a fear of failure that scares you, it's the fear of success. Discovering buried treasures or revealing great insights comes with a hidden price to pay. Nevertheless, ignorance is a much worse fate. What you learn now can help you handle the upcoming changes, so be courageous and plunge into the unknown."
scorpio,2012-05-09,"You may need to tone down your intensity over the next two weeks as intelligent Mercury moves through your 7th House of Partnerships. No matter how profound your deep emotions are now, others just won't relate to you unless you keep it simple. Even if you're totally frustrated by the process, you can still enjoy yourself today if you focus primarily on fulfilling your basic needs."
sagittarius,2012-05-09,"You may decide that you're going to make up your own rules today, yet you still must color within the lines. Nevertheless, you're itching to break free from the restrictions and are searching for ways to make your escape. Normally, you might avoid too many details, but your concentration pays off now. If you are willing to swap a bit of independence for emotional security, you'll be better equipped to sail through the next couple of weeks."
capricorn,2012-05-09,"You are edging closer and closer to a confrontation with your lover or partner, and today you may be standing at the edge of a significant precipice. You might not want to talk about an important issue yet, for you sense that your position is strengthening now that verbal Mercury is traveling through your 5th House of Self-Expression. Don't worry if you have nothing to say yet; the right words will come to you at the perfect time."
aquarius,2012-05-09,"The thought of talking about your feelings is enough to make you want to go into hiding, but avoiding issues is not a viable option now. An old emotional wound might drag painful memories back into awareness. You could realize how tough it is to let go, and how your past hurts can stand in the way of your present happiness. Being fearless and pushing past the discomfort empowers you to reclaim your emotional center."
pisces,2012-05-09,"Love may feel overly restrictive today, but don't succumb to the temptations of emotional security. If you are strongly attracted to something or someone, you would be wise to bring your feelings out into the open. You might be treading on dangerous territory because it's not a relationship that can hold you back now -- it's your beliefs. Stay open to learning something new because expanding your perspective gives you viable alternatives to your current choices."
aries,2012-05-10,"You may be overly self-critical today as you think about what you would rather be doing with your time. However, it's helpful to consider your part in creating your agenda. Unfortunately, unwanted responsibilities come to the forefront; even if no one else realizes what you are currently sacrificing, you know all too well. Silent suffering isn't your style, so you won't be able to stay quiet for long. Get busy and apply your efforts in a tangible manner before you lose the chance."
taurus,2012-05-10,"Although you are standing with your feet planted firmly on the ground, you may still believe that nearly anything is possible. However, you might find yourself faced with more obstacles today than you expect. Before you get discouraged, consider that the resistance you face now only makes you more determined than ever to accomplish your goals. Hard work will help you reach the stars if that's what you truly want."
gemini,2012-05-10,"It's a bit unsettling as you contemplate all the possibilities that are now in front of you. Unfortunately, you may feel frustrated because you cannot pursue every opportunity that knocks at your door. But even with the current limitations, you still should be able to find your way. Narrow your focus and set one goal above the others. Once you prioritize your intentions, your chances for success will greatly improve."
cancer,2012-05-10,"You may be uncertain about your next move because the relationship between cause and effect is not as apparent as usual. Your actions don't seem to elicit the expected responses, making you even more hesitant to try again. Even if reality throws you a few curve balls today, your faith in the final outcome is crucial. If you continue to act with integrity and believe in yourself, you will probably reach your original goal, whether or not you're surprised by a few twists of fate along the way."
leo,2012-05-10,"Although you can hold your position with the appearance of confidence, you may not be as positive as others think. It's as if you need to be acknowledged for your performance -- and you might feel awkward if you aren't. You must make some adjustments in your methodology in order to get a job done right. Don't make a big deal about changing your work style. Just modify your approach as necessary and any lingering insecurities will dissipate as your success is recognized."
virgo,2012-05-10,"Your hardworking sign is supported today by the determined Taurus Sun and the ambitious Capricorn Moon. But this temporary cosmic encouragement won't last, so you better act now while success is likely. Aim for tangible results because this isn't the time for pie-in-the-sky thinking. Taking practical steps allows you to make the most from the current opportunities."
libra,2012-05-10,"You have a wonderful opportunity to catch up at home now that the Moon is visiting your 4th House of Domestic Conditions. Unfortunately, you may have too much work to finish in one day. Don't worry; things have been stacking up gradually, so it could take time to get to the bottom of your list. A slow and steady approach is ultimately more productive today than trying to accomplish everything all at once."
scorpio,2012-05-10,"Even if you believe that you are right today, remain open-minded and make allowances for someone else's perspective, too. No matter how certain you are feeling, it's not useful to act self-righteously. Instead of alienating yourself from everyone by assuming you have a superior position, try to see things from a different point of view. The more you listen to others now, the more they will listen to you."
sagittarius,2012-05-10,"If you started a project over the past week or so, it's now time to eliminate anything that is unnecessary so you can take your work to the next level. Although you understand the logic of focusing your efforts, it's still tempting to be distracted by someone's invitation for fun. Fortunately, you can quickly get back on track by reminding yourself that every wasted action delays the deeper satisfaction of reaching your goal. Once your job is done, you can play all you want."
capricorn,2012-05-10,"You may be uncertain how to honor your changing feelings without threatening the integrity of the structures you have already created. You need enduring relationships in your life, but don't want them to deteriorate into comfortable arrangements. Fortunately, you don't have to sacrifice your security to reinvigorate a partnership. Nevertheless, you might have to take a calculated risk and share your heart's desire to revitalize the emotional connection you have with someone you love."
aquarius,2012-05-10,"Being of service to others can be a meaningful spiritual practice, but selfless work has its limitations. You may benefit by pulling back and not working so hard today. However, this is not the best time to take a vacation; it's just smart to strive for a healthy balance. Stay ahead of the curve now by taking care of your needs first."
pisces,2012-05-10,"Maintaining clarity in communication is easier to achieve now if you only say what's absolutely necessary. Using fewer words enables you to keep your conversations succinct, but your more imaginative ideas may be lost in the process. Although you have the capability to be pragmatic in social interactions today, don't forget to honor your dreams. Share your visions for the future with friends who might not be so judgmental if your thoughts wander."
aries,2012-05-11,"A recent event may have unexpectedly stirred up issues that affect what you want from your friends. However, something is happening that isn't obvious and you, in the typical style of the Ram, just run right into the situation without even stopping to think. Thankfully, a sudden change of plans could have a win-win outcome if you're able to place the good of the group ahead of your own personal needs."
taurus,2012-05-11,"You might feel as if you're caught in a difficult situation at work today and speaking the truth won't make it any easier to escape. Even if there's a wide gulf between your desires and the most logical solution now, you may ultimately feel better if you suppress your feelings and do what's practical. Don't be overly concerned about getting what you want; you could be pleasantly surprised if you have enough sense to let go of your expectations."
gemini,2012-05-11,"The Aquarius Moon's visit to your 9th House of Adventure may give you an irrepressible case of restlessness for a couple of days. Fortunately, you could effectively use this period to plan a quick getaway or a fabulous journey to a distant place. Your dreams can become real, so don't waste this opportunity by fantasizing about something totally impossible. Seriously consider where you want to go because you might just find yourself there before you even know what happened."
cancer,2012-05-11,"You might like the idea of being amidst your peers, even if you want to be alone today. Ironically, this paradoxical thinking could grow annoying. On one hand, you feel the need to sink into your feelings and wallow around in the private world of your own imagination. However, you also would like to receive more feedback from your friends. Don't try to resolve the contradiction now. Your current emotional detachment will reward you with clarity over the weekend."
leo,2012-05-11,"Your conflict between the desire to get ahead professionally and your attachment to a personal relationship creates a minor dilemma today. You may find yourself in a situation where too many demands are being placed on you, but an emotional response could be inappropriate. Instead of overreacting, keep your feelings to yourself. Maintaining a stable outward appearance now brings peace of mind and puts you on the path to resolution."
virgo,2012-05-11,"Normally, you're adept at analyzing a situation to determine the best way to respond to what's happening. However, organizing your thoughts seems more difficult now than usual, for your perspective is totally distorted. First, you think you know the solution and act accordingly; but then you may realize you overreacted. Don't declare your final answer yet; instead, allow the process to work out on its own."
libra,2012-05-11,"You could be anxious over the apparent imbalance between your current experience and what you thought to be true. However real this stress feels today, rest assured that it's a temporary condition. Your head and your heart are pulled in different directions as you logically perceive a reality that's different from your ideal situation. Simply acknowledging that there are multiple ways to view your world increases your options. Don't force a decision; it will appear when you least expect it."
scorpio,2012-05-11,"The opportunities in your career are luring you down one path, but following your calling can place stress on your personal life. The Aquarius Moon's current visit to your 4th House of Family is a reminder that strong emotional roots give you enough security to pursue greater ambitions. Don't set idealistic goals until you know that your feet are on the ground. Reconnecting with those closest to you gives you the support you need."
sagittarius,2012-05-11,"You prefer to be a straight shooter when sharing information, but your penchant for speaking the truth has unexpected consequences. You may have recently upset a co-worker by expressing what was on your mind and now you have to clean up the mess that you inadvertently created. The problem is that you meant exactly what you said and you're annoyed that you have to apologize. Honesty is still the best policy, but remember to be considerate of other people's feelings along the way."
capricorn,2012-05-11,"If you are working on a creative project, it's a good idea to slow down now to avoid a snag in your plans. Fortunately, you can see the potential trouble before it manifests and a more deliberate approach gives you additional time to solve the problem in advance. Don't quit; just regroup and reorient yourself to the new situation before pushing forward next week."
aquarius,2012-05-11,"Although you might have an excellent plan now, acting stubbornly won't help your progress. Unfortunately, you may be tempted to dig in your heels; however, the current situation is really begging for a new approach. Ironically, greater flexibility in your thinking ultimately strengthens your position rather than weakening it. Being willing to modify your agenda doesn't necessarily mean changing your goals."
pisces,2012-05-11,"It appears that you can effectively communicate your needs today, but there is more happening within your subconscious than reaches the surface. You may experience conflicting desires that are lurking just beneath the outward expression of your words. You could benefit from a bit of quiet time to sit with your own thoughts. You can turn them into the right words once you get in touch with your feelings."
aries,2012-05-12,"There's no reason to let your anger distract you from what you need to say today. Even if an uncomfortable situation seems to be approaching a flash point, you don't have to toss a lit match into the tinder. The current circumstances are crazy enough without you adding to the volatility. Bite your tongue, take a deep breath and wear a friendly smile. Then, state what you must as gently as you can. A bit of diplomacy and tact will go a long way now."
taurus,2012-05-12,"The steadfast Taurus Sun is at odds with unstable Uranus today, making it nearly impossible to relax and enjoy yourself. You are uncharacteristically restless and might be on the prowl for mischief. You're tempted to take risks that you would normally pass by. Acknowledging your desires enables you to work with them; suppression only causes them to grow stronger. Find ways to be more unconventional now without turning your life upside down in the process."
gemini,2012-05-12,"You may be in for quite a lovely surprise today as something totally unexpected grabs your attention. However, keep your eyes open if someone tugs at your heartstrings, for you might find yourself in over your head unless you stay aware of your feelings. Ultimately, it's not a good idea to bite the bait unless you are really ready to be emotionally hooked. Luckily, everything should turn out great if you stop and listen to your heart."
cancer,2012-05-12,"You are aware of what you want today and already have a plan in mind to ensure your satisfaction. However, expressing your needs may be out of character for you. Even if you tend to be shy, you currently have the potential to surprise yourself and others by acting impulsively. Don't resist too much if your emotions are carrying you into new territory because a wonderful experience might be just around the next bend."
leo,2012-05-12,"Think twice before jumping in to a new friendship or partnership. From your current vantage point, it may be difficult to see how deep the water actually is. Even if you're a strong swimmer, the emotional currents can shift quickly, making it impossible to predict which way you're going. However, you could build a strong foundation for a relationship if you just remember to proceed with caution when sharing your heart."
virgo,2012-05-12,"You want to express yourself creatively today, but it can be difficult if you feel threatened by someone's challenging words. You may think you're being unnecessarily criticized, yet your swift reaction might be over the top. Fortunately, you are in a much stronger position than you realize and there's really no reason to defend your motives or fight back. Simply do what you originally planned; others will come around when they see you in action."
libra,2012-05-12,"Although you may be on-edge today, you have a natural ability to cope gracefully as the Moon harmonizes with sweet Venus and steady Saturn. Other people might act irresponsibly, yet you're able to re-establish your balance with ease. Don't be afraid to make an important decision now, even if you think you should keep your options open. Whether or not you have enough confidence, your instincts will lead you in the right direction."
scorpio,2012-05-12,"You might wish that you could fast forward reality to get through this rocky part of your journey. However, your life is in better shape than you think, even if you're having trouble shaking your current free-floating anxiety. It's just that you want more stability, yet today's uncertainty could trigger unusual feelings of helplessness or fear. Thankfully, focusing on the possibilities ahead enables you to be more positive in the present."
sagittarius,2012-05-12,"Everything might seem pretty crazy today, but your inner voice keeps telling you that it's going to be okay. Unfortunately, you may not know if you should listen to your optimistic instincts now. However, things can spiral out of control if you allow yourself to lose hope. Have faith; the strength of your convictions can lead you through the current confusion and on to better days ahead."
capricorn,2012-05-12,"You are more committed than ever to the long haul. Obstacles that appear in your path only increase your resolve to succeed. But you may wonder if you made a bad decision along the way, especially if you don't have all that you want now. Nevertheless, continue to go through your daily routine without making major changes; your sincere efforts will begin to bear fruit very soon."
aquarius,2012-05-12,"It feels as if lightning is striking all around you, yet you aren't in any immediate danger since there isn't anywhere safer for you to be now. Remain open and loving even if you feel like isolating yourself from others. Ultimately, your emotional security comes from facing your fears about being alone. Accept the current uncertainty along with your newfound independence. There's no need to change anything today; just enjoy the electricity in the air and try to stay out of trouble."
pisces,2012-05-12,"You might want to shirk off the responsibility for your current instability, but you shouldn't try to blame everything on the crisis of the moment. You have more going for you now than you realize; it's just that you may not know which feelings to trust. Instead of looking to others for the answer, find your way by searching within. Let your emotions come and go without attachment. When you can be the calm eye of the hurricane, the storm will quickly pass."
aries,2012-05-13,"You feel as if everything is going your way today, but you might end up spending more resources than you expect. It's as if you're ready to pay the price to have a good time, but you might underestimate the cost. Thankfully, you can rely on your analytical skills to help you navigate through a day of potential excess. Have fun; just remember that the bill will come due once the party is over."
taurus,2012-05-13,"You are feeling quite positive now with the Sun-Jupiter conjunction expanding your horizons and empowering you to soar on the wings of your unrestrained optimism. Although you are ready to enjoy yourself today, overindulging your senses could mean a tummy ache or a splitting head tomorrow. Nevertheless, paying attention to your limits doesn't have to lessen your enjoyment. Play hard without going too far."
gemini,2012-05-13,"You can get by today by doing less work than usual. It's as if a guardian angel is watching over you, or, perhaps, a close friend comes to your aid just when you need it most. Of course, your positive attitude doesn't hurt; in fact, self-confidence is a magnet now that attracts good things your way. Don't second-guess someone's motives; just graciously accept what is offered with an open heart."
cancer,2012-05-13,"There's no need to head off on your own today. In fact, it's a good idea to surround yourself with friends and family -- the more people, the merrier. Being part of group gives you a feeling of belonging to a community or a tribe of like-minded folks. Don't be afraid to open your heart to the love that's around you, for whatever you give will return to you many times over."
leo,2012-05-13,"Although you may be thinking about your professional objectives, you're not interested in working too hard to reach your goals today. Your confidence is running high and you might even feel as if success is owed to you because of past efforts. Don't be too cocky or you could inadvertently push away those who want to help you reach your goals. Paradoxically, a little humility goes a long way toward ensuring that you will receive the respect that you deserve."
virgo,2012-05-13,"Today you can concentrate your intentions toward the fulfillment of your desires. Of course, this doesn't mean that you'll receive everything you want. However, your singular focus can actually bring an increase of abundance -- including love -- into your life. Don't miss this opportunity to learn and grow. Take advantage of what life has to offer before it's too late."
libra,2012-05-13,"You may feel that a long-term phase of inner growth is coming to an end. The power of your positive thinking can be transformed into rewarding action now. Your rich fantasy life turns outward toward social activities as your needs begin to shift. Get ready to swing into action, but don't overextend your commitments or you'll quickly regret taking on too much."
scorpio,2012-05-13,"All types of relationships are favored now and it might even seem as if others just want to make you happy. Although you may question someone else's motives, your suspicions are probably unfounded. Rather than doubting anyone's integrity, just accept the advice or assistance you receive with appreciation. But don't succumb to the temptation of expecting more than is actually offered or you'll end up being disappointed rather than happily surprised with the good news."
sagittarius,2012-05-13,"Too much of a good thing isn't always such a good thing. You need to remember now that honoring reasonable limits can help you find satisfaction. You might be carried away by circumstances that start out feeling pleasurable until things grow out of control. Don't be afraid to enjoy yourself, but keep in mind that excessive indulgence could ultimately bring pain instead of pleasure."
capricorn,2012-05-13,"Although your creativity is running high, it's still difficult to plot a new course of action because there are so many possibilities available. Additionally, if everything is working well enough on its own, you may not want to jeopardize your sense of well-being. Practicality will ultimately rule the roost. Opportunities for personal growth and self-expression are everywhere, but setting priorities enables you to maximize the current potential. Trust your instincts and your chances for success are quite good."
aquarius,2012-05-13,"You must filter out the extraneous noise if you are to make the most of your day. You may even need to withdraw from social activities to spend time alone. The greatest opportunities arise now when you are at peace with yourself, rather than when you are interacting with others. Don't be distracted from your inner process; you'll do best today by working on your own."
pisces,2012-05-13,"The mists continue to swirl around you, clouding your perceptions of the outer world while increasing your reliance on your intuition. You are at the top of your game now when socializing, as long as you don't waste time trying to logically figure out what to say next. Don't worry if you're not making sense. Instead of thinking your way through a situation, speak directly from your heart. The real rewards of the day are emotional and spiritual rather than material."
aries,2012-05-14,"You're trying to be extra practical today as you consider your financial plans. Although you could make smart decisions about your money, you may be distracted by demands that others make on your time. Ultimately, being responsible grows boring, prompting you to look for ways to escape your obligations. Unfortunately, you don't have the luxury to slip into your fantasies yet. Finishing your chores won't be as painful as you expect if you narrow your focus and get down to business."
taurus,2012-05-14,"Logical Mercury in determined Taurus comes to your rescue today by helping you set priorities and concentrate on your goals. However, you may become frustrated if you're not making as much progress as you want. It's tempting to blame someone else for restricting your creativity now, but it's your own fear of failure that's probably slowing you down. Don't worry if everything is taking longer than you planned; your willpower enables you to overcome a variety of obstacles."
gemini,2012-05-14,"You may be spending more time lost in your imagination now than anyone realizes because you can hide your fantasies behind a smokescreen of clever words. Your special skill of being in two places at once empowers you to appear fully engaged with those around you while you are still daydreaming about your future. Remember, your need for solitude isn't just about escaping from other people's noise; a quick retreat replenishes your energy so you can create enough stories to satisfy everyone."
cancer,2012-05-14,"You're growing tired of hearing about everyone else's intense emotional dramas, especially if you have issues on your own mind that you want to share with your friends. Unfortunately, there might not be enough time to raise your concerns now, so you may need to reconsider your tactics. Ultimately, it's your responsibility to bring up discussion topics that are important to you; you cannot expect others to read your mind and do it for you."
leo,2012-05-14,"Your words carry a lot of weight today, so make sure to use them with care. Even if your motives are pure, you may be repressing anger that can leak out of your subconscious and into a conversation. Instead of speaking only the truth as you see it, consider other people's feelings before you say anything. Tempering your honesty with kindness now helps everyone feel better in the long run."
virgo,2012-05-14,"Your key planet Mercury continues to hum in harmony with cosmic bad boys Mars and Pluto, moving you closer to your creative edge. Your long-term plans may need clarification or revision, but you can take it all in stride. Don't try to do too much all at once; slow down to tie up any loose ends that might have unraveled. Stay on track and the distant light at the end of the tunnel will grow brighter day by day."
libra,2012-05-14,"You may grow a bit discouraged today if the finer things in life aren't within easy reach. It might even seem as if a co-worker or boss prevents you from achieving your goals. Although you aren't willing to put up with anyone's false sense of authority, letting go of your need to be in charge is your best move now. Once you relinquish control, pleasure could be closer than you expect."
scorpio,2012-05-14,"You have no logical reason to withhold any information today, especially as talkative Mercury slips into the shadows to have an intense conversation with dark Pluto. But saying too much creates a whole new layer of complications. Others will be less inclined to listen if you're only pushing your agenda. Don't talk just to win points in an argument; instead engage in a discussion to find places of mutual understanding and common ground."
sagittarius,2012-05-14,"Although you may not be ready to head back to work today, there are many critical tasks that require your attention. You might even need to have a heart-to-heart conversation with your boss about a looming deadline. But don't take your frustration out on anyone else if you left things until the last minute. Just get busy as soon as you can so you have more time to finish the job."
capricorn,2012-05-14,"Your mind is like a strong trap today; you catch facts and then integrate the most useful concepts into your overall plan. Although your calculated actions might alienate others, they will be secretly impressed with your relentless ambition and sound thinking. Simplify your life by acknowledging that you have time to reach your goals without panicking. Oddly enough, you'll reach your destination faster if you slow down."
aquarius,2012-05-14,"Although you are adept at thinking on your feet, advanced preparation helps you succeed. Having a concrete plan now works to your advantage. But you may be more productive today if you underplay your hand to avoid arousing unnecessary opposition. Unfortunately, progress becomes more difficult once resistance is stirred. Ultimately, sheer determination is your strongest ally. Don't give up; gentle persistence brings positive results."
pisces,2012-05-14,"You may not be interested in working on your own today. You prefer to play a part in a collaborative effort, sharing your success with others on your team. You might be happily surprised with the amount of help you receive from your friends and workmates now. Keep in mind that this support is a reflection of your loyal commitment to your peers. Accept the assistance gratefully; after all, you earned it."
aries,2012-05-15,"Managing your money requires more of your time now that you are attempting to solidify your financial position. You must focus your attention if you have put off your fiscal responsibilities. It's challenging to deal with the real issues because you are so easily distracted these days. Nevertheless, you can quickly eliminate some unnecessary expenses simply by cutting back on a few social activities. Graciously declining an invitation today gives you more time to get your affairs in order."
taurus,2012-05-15,"Close friends and co-workers may perceive you as being more stable than you currently feel. It's not that you're hiding anything from them now; it's just that you can use your charm to cover up your insecurities. Thankfully, you have a chance to build your self-esteem over the next few weeks, especially if you can be vulnerable with someone you trust. Expressing your uncertainty opens the door to a deeper conversation and a more intimate connection."
gemini,2012-05-15,"Everything seems to be moving too fast, yet you are being given an opportunity to slow down now that sweet Venus turns retrograde in your restless sign. Unfortunately, you might feel that personal relationships are overly complicated, yet you don't want to lose what you already have gained. Thankfully, if you bring your concerns out into the open in a kind and gentle manner, you can establish an important foundation for whatever comes next."
cancer,2012-05-15,"You're so close to achieving your goal, but now you may feel like you're falling short as Venus turns retrograde just before reaching your sign. Whether you like it or not, it's as if your personal fulfillment has been put on hold. Nevertheless, the weeks ahead can still bring happiness. Just remember that immediate gratification is only temporary, but working toward a meaningful long-term goal sustains your feelings of well-being."
leo,2012-05-15,"Your career objectives continue to be in the spotlight, and you really want your friends and co-workers to appreciate your efforts. Unfortunately, they don't seem interested in going out of their way now just to make you feel good. Don't actively seek recognition; pursuing fame only delays the recognition you want. Just stick to the tasks at hand and do the best job you can. The right people will acknowledge your contribution, even if it takes longer than you want."
virgo,2012-05-15,"You have a very realistic attitude about your long-term goals now, but you see two extremely different paths that could lead to the same ultimate destination. Your friends and associates may give you conflicting advice; nevertheless, you still need to make a decision. Instead of listening to everyone else's opinions, make a list of all the pros and cons for each option. Your judgment will steer you in the right direction today as long as you trust the facts rather than your emotions."
libra,2012-05-15,"You are particularly sensitive to your key planet Venus as she begins her retrograde cycle today, pulling you backwards in time. Frustrations could get in the way of your creative energy if you try to take a shortcut. But you can be wonderfully productive over the next couple of months if you're willing to work methodically. Your challenge now is to harness your ambition and turn it into a practical plan that you can put into action."
scorpio,2012-05-15,"Your insatiable need to understand the deeper significance of things is sufficient to slow you down these days. You are dismayed that others are more driven to have a good time than they are to learn something new. Thankfully, you're able to lean on a few very special friends from your past for the kind of support that you need. Ultimately, your ability to speak your truth inspires your friends to engage in the intense kind of interaction you seek."
sagittarius,2012-05-15,"Slow and steady actually has a better chance at winning the race today. But this isn't just a clever phrase from an old children's story. You must think like the tortoise now, and take one careful step after the next. If you race ahead like the hare, you'll only run into difficulties later on. Planning for the distant future is pointless now unless you take care of things in the present moment."
capricorn,2012-05-15,"Pragmatic Earth energy abounds today, requiring you to analyze what you know again and again, before altering your direction. Everything at work seems to be moving along rather slowly, increasing your anxiety and triggering fantasies of running away. Although you could benefit from having more time to complete your job than you planned on, the delays can be rather frustrating. Nevertheless, don't put off working on a project; it's easier to accomplish something now than you might think at first."
aquarius,2012-05-15,"You may be required to untangle a melodramatic soap opera in which you appear to play a leading role as romantic Venus does her retrograde dance in your 5th House of Love. Even if your life is relatively quiet now, you still could experience several weeks of relationship stress. Thankfully, differences can be resolved with repeated attempts to understand one another through honest dialogue. Compromise is the key to relationship success."
pisces,2012-05-15,"Domestic stress puts you through your paces during the weeks ahead, as Venus backtracks through your 4th House of Home and Family. It feels as if there are serious issues that need your immediate concern and intervention. Just don't waste your precious energy trying to fix everything all at once. You can't. Simply acknowledging that it will take time to work everything out can alleviate the pressure and help you cope on a daily basis."
aries,2012-05-16,"The Moon's current visit to your active sign pushes you through some pretty bumpy territory today, but you're capable of standing up to whatever challenges come your way. Handling the obstacles in your path requires hard work, yet you probably won't feel depleted now even if you put out a lot of energy. But your good intentions won't likely be enough; pace yourself and don't quit, even if you face a minor setback along the way."
taurus,2012-05-16,"Your determination comes in handy today as you try to remedy a complex situation that has created its share of stress. Although you might not be able to put everything back together right away, don't give up. Steer clear of taking a shortcut; temporary patches and quick fixes are not a smart idea. A little extra persistence will help you find a positive solution to the problem."
gemini,2012-05-16,"You aren't eager to stand up to a powerful person now and even just thinking about a confrontation makes you anxious. Luckily, the process should go more smoothly once you start a constructive conversation. Don't freeze under pressure; you can outmaneuver nearly anyone if you remain mentally agile. If you are willing to learn from your opponent today, you will probably end up getting exactly what you need from the interaction."
cancer,2012-05-16,"Someone's bad behavior doesn't have to be a showstopper if you nip the problem in the bud. However, your plan could backfire if you try to suppress the expression of fear or anger. The smartest way to respond to this tricky situation now is to engage the other person by showing genuine concern and asking probing questions. Once you understand what's happening, you can deal with the tension out in the open instead of shadowboxing with a hidden enemy."
leo,2012-05-16,"Concerns about self-worth and net worth are more intertwined than you might think. Thankfully, you may feel quite optimistic because you're in touch with the power of your emotions today. This is a good time to close a sale or ask for a raise, since your confidence inspires others. If your current actions are supported by your job performance, you are likely to get the money that you want out of the deal."
virgo,2012-05-16,"You are feeling special today, but relationships may be so intense now that life seems a bit overwhelming. You are tempted to go overboard by demonstrating your partnering skills because you want to give a special someone a show that he or she won't forget. Luckily, the results could be extremely rewarding as long as you don't lose sight of your purpose. If you put too much effort into appearing unrealistically perfect, others might walk away. Simply being yourself is your best strategy."
libra,2012-05-16,"Maintaining your concentration is nearly impossible today if your curiosity is aroused. It's difficult to ignore the information that is coming your way now because you realize its significance. However, you might be so sure of yourself that new facts won't change your mind. Even if you think that you know what to do, remain open to the possibility of changing your mind."
scorpio,2012-05-16,"You may be in a positive state of mind because your plans are unfolding on schedule now. But something is gnawing away at the edges of your awareness, no matter how upbeat you are feeling. Instead of attempting to ignore your pangs of uncertainty, explore the origins of your current doubts. Expand your thinking to integrate your fears; once you adjust to the new landscape, you should be able to navigate around the shadows of your subconscious without being afraid of the dark."
sagittarius,2012-05-16,"Expressing your feelings today might heat things up more than you expect, so it's a good idea to proceed slowly. Unfortunately, suppressing your ideas adds tension to your relationships with co-workers. Although it may be challenging to strike a manageable balance between your optimism and your pessimism now, don't give up. Do your best to keep communication channels open even if there's no obvious resolution in sight."
capricorn,2012-05-16,"You may be in a very expressive mood today, but what you're saying isn't easy for everyone to hear. Your uncharacteristic emotional intensity can surprise others and set them off balance. Yet, you aren't interested in lighthearted banter; you want to go deep. Don't waste your energy getting angry with someone who won't match your serious attitude. Instead of trying to change anyone; observe your feelings and work to transform them in a positive manner."
aquarius,2012-05-16,"You may grow restless today, especially if loved ones are being so nice to you that it makes you feel uncomfortable. Other people's pleasantries might even seem like a sign of weakness. But don't mistakenly harden your position now just to demonstrate your strength. Practice being strong and yielding at the same time, instead. Staying flexible in thought helps you move through your day with grace and gratitude."
pisces,2012-05-16,"You may be motivated by a co-worker or partner who seems to have all the answers today. Fortunately, competent peers help you be more productive now, but that isn't a reason to give up your power to others. Instead look at the role you play in your own success, even if you are just one member on a team. Working with amazing people doesn't have to rob you of your self-esteem if you're willing to acknowledge your valuable contribution to the group effort."

You have something important to learn from the obstacles you now face in spite of your good intentions."
taurus,2012-05-17,"You're at another turning point in your life, but everything could seem more important now than it actually is. It still may take several months to gain clarity about your long-term goals, yet your current choices are instrumental in setting a new direction. Don't be overly concerned if you can't synthesize your desires into one single goal. Just allow your daydreams to flow without analysis; you will have plenty of time to make sense of it all later on."
gemini,2012-05-17,"You wish you could bounce around from one amazing distraction to another today, but you are afraid that others might perceive you as being flighty and unreliable.

Even if you don't have all the details figured out, you can put the pieces together along the way."
virgo,2012-05-17,"You may be increasingly aware that something is missing from your life. It's tricky to describe what you're feeling now, but you realize that it's time to let go of your old assumptions about what you can do. You might feel as if you're being swept up by a big wave. However, if you say no and try to resist, you could end up regretting that you missed an opportunity of a lifetime."
libra,2012-05-17,"Too much drama isn't your idea of a good time, but someone could rock your world today by bringing surprising news, a significant opportunity or an innovative idea. However, it's not wise to jump too quickly. Instead, exercising cautious optimism is a better strategy since anything that enters your life now looks better than it really is. Nevertheless, if you don't turn your life inside out, you could take an important step on a major journey."
scorpio,2012-05-17,"Making small improvements to your lifestyle by introducing new habits into your daily routine can have lasting positive impact. Fortunately, it's easier than you expect to move past an old emotional pattern that prevents you from taking the next step on your path. However, there's no latitude for halfway measures today. You know exactly what you must do now, so don't delay any longer."
sagittarius,2012-05-17,"Although waves of nostalgia tempt you to hold on to the past, you have a narrow window of opportunity now to launch yourself into the future. Luckily, you aren't one to turn down an invitation for a great adventure, so go ahead and set your sights on a far-off galaxy, strap on your seat belt and prepare for blast-off. Just don't let your confidence grow into arrogance because you're still likely to encounter a little turbulence along the way."
capricorn,2012-05-17,"You need to reinvent your life now by remembering your personal history and retelling your story from a fresh perspective. Creating a new framework for the past enables you to envision radically different possibilities for the future. Nevertheless, your desire to break free from your present circumstances might stress you out because of the lack of security. Don't worry if you need additional time to get everything in order before you make your move. It's helpful to look back; just remember to also look ahead."

However, if you experience self-doubt, remember that he who hesitates is lost. Ultimately, you can figure out a way to make it all work."
pisces,2012-05-17,"You may express a sigh of relief today as the pressure for change temporarily eases. Just keep in mind that your current growth phase isn't finished; you simply have a chance now to move a project along at your own speed by taking a good idea and developing it further. You might be tempted to immediately jump right in, but impulsive actions won't create the lasting results you seek. It's more important to build momentum strategically than to rush ahead without knowing where you are going."
aries,2012-05-18,"You are building your case to justify something you intend to do, but this rationalization may be more about convincing yourself than anyone else. Think about what you're taking for granted before reconsidering your assumptions. You might need to change your mind, even if you are certain that you're right. It's crucial to establish an enduring foundation for your beliefs before you are too far along in your plans."
taurus,2012-05-18,"You are under steady pressure to change, but you will grow stronger by resisting on specific points. You may believe that others are judging you unfairly, yet you seem to take it all in stride. However, you could grow weary from the stress because you must pay attention to every single move you make. Try not to get too frustrated if your progress is stymied. It's better to take small steps than none at all."
gemini,2012-05-18,"The intensity of your daily routine continues to settle now, but even if you act as if you're doing great, things may not be as pleasant as you prefer. You may feel restless because you want more variety and excitement in your life. If your need for mental stimulation isn't being met, then something must change.

Although you probably have plenty of complications in your life, there may be a few more yet to handle. Even if there's a storm brewing around you, the good news is that you're feeling more centered. Don't be tricked into thinking that you will lose a chance at success unless you act decisively right away. The truth is that even the smallest steps can lead to major improvements."
scorpio,2012-05-18,"You are like a participant in a relay race now, trying to maintain a steady pace. You are finished with one cycle yet the next one hasn't yet started. If you aren't willing to let go of the baton, you will be stuck doing the same old thing. Fortunately, your teammates are more stable than you think and handing off responsibilities to them is a smart strategy."
sagittarius,2012-05-18,"Attention to endless minutiae can make you crazy as the practical Taurus Moon joins three other planets in your 6th House of Efficiency. However, demands are being made on you to pay additional attention to things so tiny that you're sure there's a conspiracy afoot. You would like to demonstrate how good you are at managing the big picture and prefer to ignore the details. Balance is your key to success today, so keep one eye on the greater whole and the other on the specifics."
capricorn,2012-05-18,"Endings and beginnings go hand in hand, but sometimes the timing is off. Unfortunately, you may already be champing at the bit, yet another set of obstacles prevents you from reaching your destination. Instead of bolting ahead, take the time to methodically finish up the old business in your life so you are completely free to step into the new creative cycle starting next week."
aquarius,2012-05-18,"Your focus is on domestic affairs this weekend, and you're likely to spend more time at home and with your family. You might even get drawn into activities without being formally asked. Your boundaries aren't as firm as they usually are today, leaving you more susceptible to the whims of those you love.

Instead, do something that makes you feel better about yourself."
taurus,2012-05-19,"You may be overly concerned about your appearance today with so many planets in your 1st House of Physicality. Wearing something that makes you feel attractive helps to get the day off to a proper start, but remember that looks are only skin-deep. True beauty extends beneath the surface, so stay in touch with your inner self, too. If you can express what's in your heart, you just might get what you need."
gemini,2012-05-19,"Finish up as much old business as possible today because you'll be anxious to start something new tomorrow. Getting closure on a project or a relationship issue requires that you stick with the process, even if your natural tendency is to move on. However, your tenacity will pay off now, for you can discover hidden treasure with enough determination and persistence."
cancer,2012-05-19,"Your friends will stand by you now and even come to your rescue if you need it. Thankfully, you're not necessarily having a hard time; it's just that you feel emotionally secure when you know that you can rely on others. It may be sufficient to plan a social event where you're part of a group activity. Simply going out to lunch with some casual acquaintances could be just the right thing to set you on the right track."

Thankfully, your ability to finish what you start holds you in good stead with your peers since they rely on your sense of duty and generosity. As long as you don't lose sight of your purpose, you have what it takes to get the job done now. Whether or not others are watching, just do the best you can and your efforts will be appreciated."
virgo,2012-05-19,"You're dreaming of faraway places today as a means of escape, and you might just get to take that trip if you maintain a practical attitude. But since you can also embark on a journey of the mind, this is an excellent time to initiate any action that increases self-awareness. Take every opportunity that's offered to learn something new about another culture or a place you wish to visit someday, even if it can't be now."
libra,2012-05-19,"A cluster of planets occupying your 8th House of Transformation lures you into a rather intriguing matter where you might become compulsive about solving a mystery. Although you want to take a rational approach, you are unable to quit until you get to the bottom of what's going on. Your determination is strong now, but you should do a reality check to make sure you aren't sliding off into a world of illusion and fantasy."
scorpio,2012-05-19,"You usually don't mind complexities because they enable you to seek a deeper meaning to life. However, now you're searching for the more obvious answers instead. There's nothing complicated about wanting to be close to someone you love or appreciating the benefits of a satisfying meal or restful sleep. Everything would be so easy if life was really that simple and straightforward. Nevertheless, little things can be enough to bring you happiness today."

You can make small improvements to your lifestyle now that have long-lasting consequences. If you are considering changes to your diet or thinking about a new exercise program, this is a great time to do it. You don't have to initiate major modifications; even a minor positive adjustment can have a meaningful impact on your life."
capricorn,2012-05-19,"If you have been thinking about relationships lately, you're probably more concerned with the practical considerations of love than the irrational emotional issues. It's not that you aren't romantic in your own way; it's just that you're focused on the real work at hand. One strategy is to think about how you could be the best possible partner or lover now. Then do whatever you can to make the most of your current or potential romance."
aquarius,2012-05-19,"You are heading toward an exciting week with your imagination soaring high above the mundane issues of the real world.

Some of your distractions are mental, rather than physical; your brain might be full even if your calendar is not. Ultimately, you have too much going on and you might even feel like a stage magician who is juggling one too many balls. Be bold and set a few things aside so everyone can see you perform at your very best."
aries,2012-05-20,"You might actually think that you can talk your way out of any problem today with the Solar Eclipse falling in your 3rd House of Communication; however, you could easily overestimate your capabilities. If you try to do too much at once, you could waste precious energy and won't succeed. Instead of taking on so many activities, limit your choices and focus on the things that you do really well."
taurus,2012-05-20,"Practical issues influence the decisions you must make as today's Gemini Solar Eclipse activates your 2nd House of Self-Worth, but talking about change is not enough to make something happen. You must consciously choose to improve your life by taking direct action in a down-to-earth manner. However, the quantity of work done is not as important as the quality. Make sure there's lasting value to whatever you decide to do now."
gemini,2012-05-20,"Today's Solar Eclipse occurs in your sign, making it extra critical to make the most of the present moment by consciously expressing your goals for the month ahead.

Whatever is in your mind now becomes more real in the days ahead."

There's no need to control the images; just allow them to unfold and they will show you what you need to know."
leo,2012-05-20,"Today's calendar may be filled with too many things to do as the curious Gemini Solar Eclipse rattles your 11th House of Social Networking.

Don't limit your options; if you meet others for fun, it still can turn into something more serious later on."
virgo,2012-05-20,"Although you might feel a bit scattered, the Gemini Solar Eclipse in your 10th House of Public Responsibilities enables you to accomplish a lot if you put your mind to it. However, be aware that this productivity isn't just about today. You are establishing the tone for the next few weeks by what you do now, so don't waste the day. Instead, make a concrete plan and stick to it until you reach your goals."
libra,2012-05-20,"The experimental Gemini New Moon Eclipse zaps your 9th House of Journeys, putting you in touch with your most fantastic dreams. Fortunately, nothing is impossible today. The groundwork you lay now is much more significant than you realize. Plan a trip or a course of study as carefully as possible. Doing your homework helps you to realize your goals."
scorpio,2012-05-20,"It's challenging to settle down today with the Gemini Solar Eclipse in your 8th House of Deep Sharing. While others may be motivated by visions of success, you are driven further with the involvement of your heart. Remember, as empowering as these emotions feel now, you must also process any disappointments with similar intensity. Taking the bad with the good increases your overall power and enables you to be a force for positive change."

capricorn,2012-05-20,"Setting practical goals early in the day will help you to be more productive in the weeks ahead. But don't be too myopic as you analyze the possible courses of action.

Most of all, honor your own need to play."
pisces,2012-05-20,"The whimsical Gemini Solar Eclipse falls in your 4th House of Roots. Today might find you nostalgically strolling along Memory Lane in your fantasies or, perhaps, actively sharing your past with a friend or lover. Either way, your thoughts are leading the parade now, with your emotions following after them. Take your time; there's no need to hurry on to the next feeling until you let the current one sink all the way in."
aries,2012-05-21,"Everything seems to be moving too quickly -- even though you speedy Rams are the Champions of Fast. You're also the Champions of First, but being in front of everyone else isn't what's most important now. Slow down your words so your heart can catch up to your thoughts, or otherwise you'll be the cleverest lonely person around. Even if you think too much today, saying less helps to maintain the peace."
taurus,2012-05-21,"Although your thinking picks up a bit of speed from the agile Gemini Moon, the urgency of your message is diminished by communicator Mercury's presence in steady Taurus. It's easier now to let go of those things that quietly bother you because you recognize that you won't find resolution today. Nevertheless, your natural persistence enables you to restore balance between your current need for immediate gratification and your willingness to wait until the timing is right."
gemini,2012-05-21,"Your world is changing faster than you realize. Even if you have a well thought-out plan, rational Mercury's anxious quincunx with sobering Saturn just might send you back to the drawing board to tighten your logic. Meanwhile, the Moon dances along in your sign, but it's not a simple tune that's playing, especially if you are trying to hold on to a feeling from the past. Nevertheless, share what's in your heart before it's too late."
cancer,2012-05-21,"Fear is creeping into your subconscious mind today and turning your imagination two shades darker. Just remember that dark doesn't necessarily imply evil; it simply means an absence of light. What you think and feel can seem more real now than reality itself. Enjoy the magic of the Hall of Mirrors without needing to know what's going to happen next. Fortunately, your active imagination holds the keys to your future."

virgo,2012-05-21,"If everything at work appears to be too good to be true today, then something is about to change. However, if progress has been bumpy, it may be smart to examine what changes you could initiate. But don't get too impatient or your frustration can put a negative spin on your professional relationships. It is to your advantage to allow the tensions to resolve gradually, without applying too much pressure to have things go your way."
libra,2012-05-21,"You tend to be rather philosophical about your day, even if it doesn't turn out as you envisioned it. Instead of getting all stressed out over a necessary change of plans, you might just quietly adapt as required. Nevertheless, there's still a price to be paid for missing your mark. Instead of wasting energy worrying about a setback, process your disappointment quickly so you can set new goals and try again."
scorpio,2012-05-21,"The current cluster of planets in your 8th House of Shared Resources might affect your material possessions and income status. However, this emphasis is just as often about non-material things that others bring into your life, including love and sexuality. You may secretly wish that you could withdraw for a bit to re-evaluate the complexity of a relationship. Instead, stay connected to those around you and save the contemplation for another day."
sagittarius,2012-05-21,"No matter how much you apply your analytical thinking today, you might not be able to figure out what's going on in the mind of your partner. Whatever is usually transparent has now gone dark, making it impossible to accurately read the situation. Stop trying so hard to solve a temporarily unsolvable mystery. Instead, focus on the beauty in those you love and support them the best way you can."
capricorn,2012-05-21,"Concentrating on the details of your work is extremely helpful today. If you do your job right, your efforts will bring you the rewards and recognition that you seek. In the meantime, there are probably more tasks to do than you expected.

Instead, focus on the possibilities of your creativity, without worrying about concrete production for now."
pisces,2012-05-21,"It's difficult to move forward today, even if you're enthusiastic about your next project.

aries,2012-05-22,"Although you may already have taken on too many responsibilities, you're so confident that you're ready to put even more on your plate today. Unfortunately, you could spend so much energy just trying to fulfill your obligations that there isn't much time left over to relax. Don't wait for the end of the day to wish you had less to complete. Instead, judiciously cut back on your activities by setting healthy limits right from the start."
taurus,2012-05-22,"You might think that your strategy is a sound one, but you could unexpectedly discover that you have oversimplified your plan. You feel a bit scattered today, even if you try to concentrate your efforts on what needs to be done. Although you know that pleasure eventually awaits you, finding the time to enjoy it remains tricky. Don't get discouraged; satisfaction will be yours if you keep your eye on the prize."
gemini,2012-05-22,"Things can quickly get out of hand today with the Moon back in your changeable sign and your key planet Mercury contacting expansive Jupiter. You could easily underestimate what's required to finish a specific task. Although you might feel overwhelmed for a while, you should be able to pull it all together by the end of the day. Don't complain, even if you temporarily regret how much you promised. If you just stay focused and work steadily, you could have enough time left over to have some fun."
cancer,2012-05-22,"You could lose your momentum by thinking of all the reasons you can't do something that you really want to do. Reality is testing you to see if you can overcome the obstacles in your path. Fortunately, your inner strength gives you enough clarity of vision now so you can organize many disparate puzzle pieces into a comprehensive picture. Although your friends show up to support your efforts, it's up to you to accept the assistance that's offered."
leo,2012-05-22,"Your moods seem to be changing quickly now and it's difficult to know how you're going to feel next. One minute you seem to have superpowers and then just a few moments later you're back to being a mere mortal. Even if you can leap tall thoughts in a single bound, you still need to follow through with sensible action. There's nothing wrong with having your head in the clouds as long as you can keep your feet on the ground at the same time."
virgo,2012-05-22,"You can accomplish a tremendous amount of work now and your productivity is likely to be positively acknowledged by others. However, you may be so enthralled with your big ideas that your excitement becomes your downfall. Unfortunately, you might not even realize if you've pushed too far. Don't assume more responsibilities than you can realistically handle. Take preventative action today before you find yourself over-committed."
libra,2012-05-22,"You can be a case study for the power of positive thought. You're on a productive high now and might even be able to imagine something right into existence. It's too bad you can't bottle this confidence for a rainy day. Unfortunately, the creative juices are fickle and you could get yourself into trouble if you assume that you can sustain such a steady pace. Give yourself a bit of leeway today to wander off track and don't be afraid to daydream along the way."
scorpio,2012-05-22,"You honestly might not think you have time to relax enough to have the fun that is right in front of your nose. You can say that you're ready to party, but it's challenging to avoid the responsibilities that you already accepted. Acknowledge the limitations of what you cannot do in the present moment. Then, you will be freer to explore the deeper meaning of life without the burden of having to find the right answer."
sagittarius,2012-05-22,"You might get caught up in a minor power struggle today as you move through the changes that are being demanded of you. But the more you try to hold on to whatever you believe you had, the more difficult this conflict becomes. However, if your commitment to a larger cause is more important than achieving your personal goals, you should be able to gracefully navigate your way through the resistance."
capricorn,2012-05-22,"You might feel a bit uncomfortable today as you try to get past your self-imposed restrictions in order to take advantage of the exciting opportunities that are being presented to you. The challenges may come to you now in the form of social engagements. However, you could learn something new if you don't retreat too quickly. Instead, push up against your own insecurities; it's time to recognize that your fears don't need to get in the way of the potential in your life."
aquarius,2012-05-22,"Someone might come to you with such a good idea today that it's hard to resist. You may be feeling so upbeat now that nearly every opportunity looks worthwhile. It doesn't matter if you're invited to participate in a business scheme or a private party; it probably sounds better than it actually is. Fortunately, there's no reason to react negatively; just remain open to modifying your position as more and more of the truth is unveiled."
pisces,2012-05-22,"You may mistakenly believe that you can see the whole picture now. Unfortunately, precision of thought doesn't necessarily come along with the vision. Sure, you can visualize it all, but you could jump to a wrong conclusion or miss an important detail that's integral to making the right choices. You will probably choose in favor of the new opportunity because it sounds too amazing to say no. Just remember not to over-commit or you might end up regretting your decision."
aries,2012-05-23,"Your dilemma may be quite real today, even if you're feeling sure of yourself. You think that you know what you want and it doesn't seem too complicated. However, achieving satisfaction isn't that easy because there's a big difference between your personal goals and what others have to offer at this time. Your current happiness could depend on your willingness to modify your highest ideals with what is actually possible."

Your moods may continue to fluctuate, challenging you to maintain an even temper. You can minimize your frustration and avoid being overwhelmed by only taking on what you know you can finish. Limiting your goals now makes room for spiritual growth."
cancer,2012-05-23,"You may be hypersensitive today and feel under the weather for no particular reason. However, it's crucial not to succumb to negativity since circumstances are probably not as bad as they currently seem. Above all, remain honest; any attempts to stretch the truth will likely backfire. However, sharing your fantasies with a trustworthy friend can be uplifting as long as you clearly differentiate your dreams from the facts."
leo,2012-05-23,"No matter how optimistic you feel, your usual demonstration of courage and vitality may be difficult to pull off today. Your positive energy isn't as readily available now. Ironically, you can turn the day around by bringing your self-doubt right out into the open. When others realize that you don't have all the answers, they'll be more likely to offer a helping hand."
virgo,2012-05-23,"Although you may feel as if you are on information overload, it's difficult to tell which data is useful and which is not. It might even be impossible to discern fact from fiction now. Naturally, you want to deal with the real world based upon objective truth; however, your confusion gets in the way of your progress today. If you soften your stance and don't push for clarity, the haze will lift on its own."
libra,2012-05-23,"You may become more optimistic and lighter on your feet as the day goes on. However, you also might grow more confused about love and romance. The problem is that you're less sure about what's real and what is imagined. Your thoughts come and go quickly now, so don't worry if you can't hold on to any of them. Attempting to control your mental process only brings frustration. Instead, float along with the currents and enjoy the day for whatever joy it brings."
scorpio,2012-05-23,"Although you might believe that you can logically think your way through a current dilemma, reason seems to break down just as the solution comes into sight. For now, it's practical reality versus creative imagination. It's frustrating, but you cannot hold on to both sides at the same time. Give yourself permission to entertain your dreams today, for the real world will intervene when necessary to bring you back."
sagittarius,2012-05-23,"You are being flooded by images arising from your subconscious mind today. You may feel as if you're being pushed to do something that doesn't really make sense to you, but this is the nature of unconscious expression. Anxiety might arise from your current confusion; the more you try to figure out what's happening, the farther away the answers seem. Don't take your lack of clarity too seriously, for it will pass soon enough."
capricorn,2012-05-23,"People usually trust your answers because you have plenty of common sense and typically seem to know what to do. Now, however, you are less likely to be certain about what comes next. Your acute lack of confidence could lead you down the path of less resistance, which may not take you in your intended direction. The most important thing is to allow yourself the luxury of wasting time today, even if it feels counterproductive."
aquarius,2012-05-23,"Although you may be quick to rise, dress and prepare for work, something still could be bothering you. You don't know what's expected of you today, but this can be a creative time if you figure out how to let go of the details for a while. If you refuse to give up control, you could inadvertently invite unnecessary irritation. However, remaining open to change can lead to rich and meaningful experiences."
pisces,2012-05-23,"There's no need to panic now, even if you don't have a game plan in place. In fact, expressing your fears might just make matters worse today. Unfortunately, you're not fully in control of your immediate environment; the more you try to make something go your way, the more resistance you encounter. Attempting to resolve an issue could make your frustration level soar, so just work through the uncertainty the best you can."
aries,2012-05-24,"You may have a conflict between your desire to hang out with friends and the simplistic need to stay true to yourself. Although you really want the camaraderie that comes from being with your peers, you might not be willing to risk your emotional security by spending too much time away from your home and family. You could try to rationalize your behavior, but ultimately you believe it's easier to hold yourself back. Fortunately, if you stop struggling you can get the most out of the present moment."
taurus,2012-05-24,"Oddly enough, you have very little resistance to change now, yet too much flexibility can get in the way of your happiness. You must take the credit or the blame for your present condition, but don't waste your energy regretting previous actions or trying to complete unfinished business. Don't wait for a better time to take action; this is it. Let go of your past so you can embrace your future."
gemini,2012-05-24,"Your ruling planet Mercury returns home and this may stimulate a higher level of mental activity. Unfortunately, the hectic pace of your life is picking up even further, even if you're already busy. It's best now to take the sweet moments as they come, for it might be difficult to make a decision and then stick to it. Take time to think about what you could learn. Pursue your interests without committing to any one particular path just yet."
cancer,2012-05-24,"You can feel the tension build as the necessity of change confronts your current plans. Take whatever time today you need to consider what you really want to do, or you could end up making the situation even worse. You might not be able to separate fantasy from reality now, so avoid making any significant decisions for a couple of days. There's nothing wrong with waiting until you clearly know how you feel before making your next move."
leo,2012-05-24,"Your social life is re-energized by talkative Mercury's move into your 11th House of Groups. Instead of being overly concerned with your personal calendar, use the next couple of days to increase your involvement with the larger problems of your community or even humanity itself. But remember there's no right or wrong when it comes to your life path. Instead of worrying about trivial things now, just focus on alleviating the pain and suffering of someone close to you."
virgo,2012-05-24,"You may be temporarily distracted by one thing after another now that your ruling planet Mercury is in restless Gemini. But rather than trying to force an issue by placing yourself right in the middle of a complex situation, seek solitude instead. Relax your concentration and follow your thoughts wherever they may take you. Unfortunately, trying to constrain your mental process only leads to frustration. Combine tolerance and patience and you will find the right solution."
libra,2012-05-24,"Loquacious Mercury joins the willful Sun and romantic Venus in your 9th House of Adventure. You might want to escape and take an extended vacation now. Unfortunately, you could use up all your time and energy talking about your ideas instead of actually going anywhere. Don't just get lost in your dreams; make practical travel plans that can bend a bit with the changing circumstances of your life."
scorpio,2012-05-24,"Messenger Mercury joins the cosmic party that's already spicing up your 8th House of Intimacy and Transformation. You might be confused by someone's inconsistent feelings, especially since they are slippery and may morph into something else if you attempt to address them. You could even make an error in judgment while assessing the current situation and then take an ineffective course of action. Don't waste time worrying about what went wrong; just rethink the problem and try again."
sagittarius,2012-05-24,"You may feel real conflict between your work duties and the personal circumstances of your life. Your rational mind is quite purposeful now, but don't overlook the needs of your friends and partners, too. However, don't be fooled by someone's emotional appeal unless it's also based upon facts. Be gentle with your own self-criticism, even if you must re-evaluate your position again and again."
capricorn,2012-05-24,"Although you want to find time today for personal enjoyment, there's too much on your plate now even for a quick escape. Practical responsibilities might require that you reschedule your playtime. Cover as much ground as you can on all your projects, but don't worry if you have unfinished business when the workday is over. Just make sure to take care of your need for pleasure before the day is done."
aquarius,2012-05-24,"There may be little you can do to prevent someone from going through his or her own discomfort now when adapting to a new situation. You are usually comfortable with the notion of making big changes in your life when necessary. However, just the thought of having to deal with a major shift might upset you today because of all the uncertainty in the air. Stay attuned to your own process and don't project your fears on to anyone else."
pisces,2012-05-24,What worked well for you in the past isn't necessarily useful now. Don't try to hold on to memories that only bring you sadness. Let the thoughts bubble into consciousness one last time and then leave them in the past where they belong. Conjure up some of that famous Piscean compassion so you can judge yourself less harshly. Being kind to others starts with accepting who you are first.
aries,2012-05-25,"Sometimes you're so confident that you have absolute faith in a wildly unrealistic idea. Ironically, reality seems to encourage you to turn up your volume even higher now. Be careful; if you're in need of a reality check, someone may come along and pull the plug to teach you a lesson. Instead of responding defensively today, be quiet and pay attention to your own feelings. Rushing off to start another project will only distract you from what you need to learn in the present moment."
taurus,2012-05-25,"You may struggle with your self-esteem today, especially if you receive mixed messages about your work from your boss. You aren't clear about what is expected of you and you might just want to sidestep the whole issue. However, it's healthier to talk about your concerns with coworkers or friends. Once you make some sense out of the situation you'll be able to keep moving forward."
gemini,2012-05-25,"Your current indecision is a symptom of a deep uncertainty about your goals. You may be quite confused, yet others cannot see the crossed signals you're receiving from within your own subconscious. Pretending that you have answers will only alienate you further from those who could be allies now. Find the courage to be honest today; revealing your vulnerability to a trusted friend can be a catalyst to deepen a relationship and bring clarity back into your life."
cancer,2012-05-25,"You feel a flood of powerful emotions washing over you today with the Moon back in your watery sign. The waves of feeling are strong enough to take you for a ride, whether or not you're a willing passenger. There is nothing to be gained by fighting the currents or trying to control your changing moods. Go with the flow, allowing the tides to take you where they will."
leo,2012-05-25,"Although you might be sparkling on the surface, there's something brewing today underneath your apparent display of warmth. Your insecurities are gnawing at you from within and they just won't leave you alone now. Your sixth sense tells you that something is preventing you from living up to your potential, yet you cannot quite put your finger on where this feeling is coming from. Don't run from the truth; seek clarity by practicing meditation or engaging in a deep discussion with a close friend."
virgo,2012-05-25,"You are the Champion of Critical Thinking, but it may not feel that way to you now. You like everything in neat and tidy compartments (even within your mind). However, conflicting thoughts draw you back and forth, making it difficult to find resolution to important matters today. Your mind is like a camera that won't focus sharply and the picture remains blurry no matter how you alter your perspective. No struggle is needed; free your imagination from all the rules for just one day and relax."
libra,2012-05-25,"You have lots of good ideas about something exciting that you want to do, but it's difficult for a plan to get traction at this time. You can feel the inner tension as you try to resolve a conflict between your hypersensitive feelings and the overall situation at work. You may be called on to nurture someone who you secretly think should be taking care of his or her own business. But you might choose to ride to the rescue now, even if you must temporarily put your needs on hold."
scorpio,2012-05-25,"The watery Cancer Moon instinctively feels comforting, giving you permission to muck about in the feeling realms today. You're like a beautiful rhino, enjoying playtime in the swamp. You can bask in the added intensity of today's experiences, but they lose something in the translation when you try to share them with others. There's nothing wrong with keeping some secrets to yourself until the Sun comes out tomorrow."
sagittarius,2012-05-25,"It's frustrating that you cannot easily resolve an emotional conflict today. Your feelings are tugging at your pants leg like the proverbial persistent puppy trying to tell you something important. Nevertheless, your resistance is wearing down and you're more willing to compromise now. Just make sure you're not giving in to avoid the truth. Keep in mind that your desires won't really fade until you take the time to acknowledge them."
capricorn,2012-05-25,"Sometimes you must drop what you are doing and place another person's agenda ahead of yours. Someone may reveal an emotional dilemma today that requires you to jump in and engage your feelings, even though they aren't very practical. Don't worry about solving anyone's problems now; you can be a good friend simply by showing up and responding in the present moment."
aquarius,2012-05-25,"Radical ideas are popping into awareness today faster than you can deal with them. You're more inventive and clever now, but some of your brilliant ideas might not hit the nail right on the head. Letting go of the craziest thoughts that would rightly be criticized by others is a good way to minimize the noise so you can focus on what's most important."
pisces,2012-05-25,"Mercury the Communicator is stressing your key planet Neptune, and you may feel like you are looking at the world through rose-colored glasses. Everything appears tinted by your imagination, as if you're seeing things through a filter that blurs difficult perceptions. Unfortunately, this doesn't mean that they're non-existent. Ask a friend for a reality check if something looks particularly amazing or terribly bad. Remember that what you see today is not what you get."
aries,2012-05-26,"Attempting to restrain your impulses is exhausting and reminds you of your ongoing struggle with impetuous behavior. It may be more difficult to hold back your desires now since your charm factor is working in your favor. Be aware of how your enthusiasm can be overpowering; go ahead and put on your show, but don't overdo it. Stepping back is a smarter strategy and empowers others to express what's on their minds, too."
taurus,2012-05-26,"You can be very stubborn about something that you think is important. You might unconsciously get stuck in an old emotional conflict or you could consciously shift your focus toward the outer world. Instead of withdrawing, take a chance now and express your feelings creatively. The current stress eases if you place your attention on your career or your role in the community, especially if you're willing to adapt to changing circumstances."
gemini,2012-05-26,"A dramatic gesture on your part today can have a significant impact on those closest to you, as long as it's based on sincere feelings. However, if your actions are just a calculated performance for the sake of eliciting a particular response, then your whole plan could backfire. Don't try to force an issue just for the effect. It's definitely not a good idea to pull the wool over anyone's eyes now if you want to maintain your integrity."
cancer,2012-05-26,"Although you may reach deep into your imagination now, your actions are motivated by a sense of practicality. You are driven to create something tangible, but can get lost in the logistics. Nevertheless, it's still advisable to maintain a connection with the more magical and spiritual realms. Fuel your day with your dreams but don't mix up fantasy and reality in the process."
leo,2012-05-26,"You are especially aware of your needs now that the Moon is visiting your proactive sign. An old familiar desire for extravagance might surface today, so try to resist unnecessary indulgences. Although you might not be able to ignore your desire to partake in social events, they really aren't the main focus of the day. Besides your apparent attraction to others, your emotions can connect you to a powerful yet private belief. You don't need to share your secret, but that doesn't make it any less real."
virgo,2012-05-26,"Perhaps a practical idea starts as a flash in a dream or even as a persistent daydream. Maybe something catches in the diaphanous web of your imagination, making you feel as if you are recovering a lost treasure from unknown realms. Normally, you are very logical, yet now it's wise to set aside your need for rationality. Keep open to any messages that come from your subconscious, even if they aren't understandable right away."
libra,2012-05-26,"You feel your creative urges stirring today and you would be wise to make the most of these feelings. Whether you get out the crayons, acrylics or the camera, try to capture your vision. It doesn't matter what your approach is; your current job is to recognize beauty and to express what's in your heart. Even just listening to music or reading poetry can be enough to inspire you to reach for the spirit that is beyond the physical world."
scorpio,2012-05-26,"Someone might want you to be involved in a social activity or to do something that helps others. However, you aren't interested in moving in that direction if you already have too many things on your schedule. A clash of desires could produce a standoff, but, fortunately, the disagreement probably won't turn into a major battle. The choice is yours; your best strategy may be to ignore the pressure temporarily and ride out the storm. Thankfully, the tension should subside in a few days."
sagittarius,2012-05-26,"The Moon's current visit to your 9th House of Big Ideas has you believing that nearly anything is possible. You can have a more direct impact on others than usual, but there's no need to overdo it. You feel especially adventurous and may lean toward taking a risk today, especially if it involves an impulsive attraction. However, don't confuse anyone else with that twinkle in your eye unless you know what you're getting into now. If your intentions are clear, you should be able to have a really good time."
capricorn,2012-05-26,"What's happening today is more complicated than what appears on the surface. Someone may try to pull strings, but others might see through the veiled attempts at control. You are not amused by hidden manipulations and prefer to bring things out into the open where they are more manageable. Nevertheless, the gulf between your inner world and the outer circumstances presents a paradox. Don't waste too much energy on attempting to solve what may be unsolvable."
aquarius,2012-05-26,"A stressful situation may prompt an emotional outburst as you process your feelings today. The tension may be exacerbated by the fact that you often become uncomfortable when you step outside of the logical realms. However, try riding the waves of your own emotions, even if you aren't sure where they are taking you. Don't blame anyone else for your anxiety. The source of your uneasiness comes from within now, so you need to face your fears and then let go."
pisces,2012-05-26,"Keep your feet on the ground today and stay as practical as possible. Thankfully, you can participate in all the daydreaming you want if you simply continue to perform your chores. Even if you would rather be doing something else, it's still smart to maintain the appearance of your normal routine. Remember, you're free to tap into unseen spiritual magic when no one is looking as long as your productivity doesn't suffer."
aries,2012-05-27,"It's a what-you-see-is-what-you-get kind of day. Although there may not be any major surprises, you won't necessarily be bored today, either. The obstacles that have been impeding your progress for a while now demand immediate attention. Don't try to avoid a showdown, even if it may be unpleasant. On the other hand, don't start an argument without a good reason. Just state the facts as you know them and let the conversation unfold naturally from there."
taurus,2012-05-27,"Your stubbornness can be a problem today, but being aware of your tendency to fear change could help you through a rough spot. It is crucial to fight for what is important, but it's less stressful to find a way to defend your dreams without starting the next world war. Visualize your goals; hold on to your destination firmly in your mind, but be flexible about how you might get there."
gemini,2012-05-27,"Don't be afraid to push hard this week, because recent frustrations could culminate in an important breakthrough. What happens now depends upon how you have handled the pressures of your life. If you have worked hard and asked the right questions, satisfaction might be right around the corner. But if you have tried to escape from doing your daily chores, everything can suddenly pile up on you. It's time to get busy; chances are, if you're willing to put in the extra effort success can be yours."
cancer,2012-05-27,"Other people may think you're more serious than you actually feel. But even if you are playing the role of a closet optimist now, try to understand why your partners and coworkers see you acting more cautiously than usual. Perhaps you are considering your core values and how you can show someone what you really believe. It is up to you to go the extra mile to share what you are feeling if you want others to really know you better."
leo,2012-05-27,"You are wearing your feelings very close to the surface today and others might be able to see them long before you say a word. You might think that you're holding your emotions safely behind a personal firewall of sorts, but it's nearly impossible to maintain clear boundaries now. Once you accept your current lack of privacy, you will be able to get on with the rest of your day."
virgo,2012-05-27,"You're not very excited about participating in a group activity now, especially if you can't relate to the other people involved. It's as if you were assigned to attend a meeting or a social gathering without being asked about your preferences. It's OK if you really don't want to go. Nevertheless, this event could be a very productive occasion because you can network with unexpected allies who will get a chance to see how much you have to offer."
libra,2012-05-27,"You may think you're being overworked now, or, perhaps that others expect you to perform specific tasks without being given any ownership in the overall project. It feels like an impossible job -- as if you cannot come out a winner. Whatever you do, don't stir up trouble; if you alienate your coworkers, you will minimize the impact that you can have today. Try to hold your ground, but not so firmly that you can't meet someone halfway."
scorpio,2012-05-27,"Naturally, you would like to have fun, but you might believe that you don't deserve to take time for yourself until you've fulfilled your commitments. In fact, you may add more responsibilities to your list of things to do, even if you have already surpassed everyone's expectations. No doubt, you are your own toughest boss. Remember, it's OK to be lenient with yourself from time to time; let your hair down and relax."
sagittarius,2012-05-27,"You may be in the middle of a disagreement now with a partner about your long-term goals. If you share a household with someone, you might have to exert stronger control over the current budget. There may be too much emphasis on having fun today and not enough aimed at meeting your obligations. Although you're not normally considered to be a party spoiler, you might have to put your foot down and just say no this time around."
capricorn,2012-05-27,"You are excited about shaking things up today, yet frustration can settle in if hurdles appear faster than you can jump over them. However, even if you can keep up the pace, you might need to put in a few days of hard work to stay on track. But if the obstacles are like mountains, you won't be able to climb over what's in your way. Instead of trying to do the impossible now, hold on to your horses and wait for the right opportunity before you initiate action."
aquarius,2012-05-27,"The Moon's current visit to your 7th House of Others means that someone close to you may be making too many demands on your precious time. You can't avoid responding directly to this situation since you have no easy way out. Fortunately, you could be so busy that you simply need to say that you don't have enough time to do anything else today. Nevertheless, your hard work  should ultimately satisfy everyone's expectations."
pisces,2012-05-27,"Your physical desires are strong now, yet it isn't easy to find the satisfaction you seek. Experiencing deep feelings isn't always comfortable, especially if an interaction is complicated. However, anything that adds stability to your life will be beneficial in the long run. Talk about what you need to feel emotionally secure. An intense conversation may not be as much fun as going to a party, but strengthening foundations is a wise thing to do if you want your relationship to grow."
aries,2012-05-28,"Your routine may be interrupted today by circumstances beyond your control. Something happens that could force you to shift your focus to a specific behavior, but even your full concentration doesn't have the desired effect now. Instead of spinning your wheels trying to minimize a problem before it occurs, you might be better off to step back and simply clean up the spilt milk later on."
taurus,2012-05-28,"Although you might try to keep everything on the straight and narrow today, your attempts to do so are met with challenges along the way. Your individual contribution may be lost in the noise of the crowd if you are working with a group of people. But don't worry about getting recognition now. Do your best work whether anyone is looking or not; your consistent efforts will pay off in the long run."
gemini,2012-05-28,"A subtle shift of energy at work is underway this week, but you might not feel the full ramifications of it for a while. Everything seems as if it's moving along, but undercurrents are set into motion now by unexpressed feelings. If you have something to say, it's better to spit it out before the ripples of frustration build into a tidal wave of emotion that you can't control."
cancer,2012-05-28,"Having too much information at your disposal is overwhelming today as you attempt to filter through the unnecessary noise. However, you can minimize the data flow if you simply stop asking questions once you discover what you need to know. Be smart and reconsider what's most important now. Establishing priorities and setting clear boundaries enables you to make the most of your day."
leo,2012-05-28,"Focus on your finances, since the attention you give to balancing your checkbook now goes a long way toward preventing a headache down the road. You have an extraordinary ability to shut out distractions today, allowing you to do the detailed kind of accounting that usually drives you crazy. Take advantage of this temporary phase, for your high level of concentration will not last forever."
virgo,2012-05-28,"Nothing sharpens your mental acuity like necessity. Today, the Moon's visit to your efficient sign demands that you must stay highly focused as a minor crisis snaps your attention right back to the present moment. The current conflict stems from a separation between your head and your heart. But don't try to rationalize your feelings; instead, share them as concisely as you can and then move on to what's next."
libra,2012-05-28,"Your dreams are demanding your attention today and you may need to pinch yourself in order to wake back up. Unfortunately, the real world isn't very compelling now, allowing you to slip back into the realms of your vivid imagination. However, this isn't about wasting time. Make believe you can be whoever you want to be. Then, when the Moon returns to your sign on Wednesday, start turning your fantasies into reality."
scorpio,2012-05-28,"You have a perceptive sixth sense working on your behalf now, but it's still difficult to fully trust what you're feeling. The current pressure could derive from an argument that's basically philosophical in nature. Is it more important to do the right thing, or should loyalty to friends and family override your values? Ultimately, you're better off now if you set aside the analysis and just follow your instincts."
sagittarius,2012-05-28,"Although relationship dynamics may be stressing you out now, every interaction reveals a path back to your own issues. It might seem as if someone is trying to bully you today, or maybe you are playing the role of the tough guy. Either way, don't be afraid to go the extra mile by setting clear limits and then sticking to them to show that you mean business."
capricorn,2012-05-28,"You are looking at the world through a rather practical lens as you lay out the details for a new project today. However, don't get trapped under the weight of too much minutia, for you might become so obsessed with getting each particular thing just right that you accomplish little else now. Perfection is often an admirable goal, but don't let it get in your way of success."
aquarius,2012-05-28,"It's challenging to settle on any one point of view today, for you are being pulled in several directions by opinionated people with rather strong arguments. If only your life would remain quiet for several days while you figure out your best strategy. But unfortunately, everything continues to change leaving no time to idly sit by on the sidelines. Make a choice and jump in with both feet, even if you are only partially convinced."
pisces,2012-05-28,"Someone may be so critical of you today, that you feel like tuning everyone out; however, it really isn't in your best interest to withdraw. Check your emotional baggage to make sure that you're not just acting overly sensitive. Rather than being resistant, listen to all the feedback you are receiving now. Learning from others can truly help you become more efficient at what you do."
aries,2012-05-29,"You may try to think your way through a complex series of facts today, but might grow frustrated if a practical solution to the current dilemma cannot be found. You could discover a satisfying answer, only to learn something new that reveals a problem with your plan. Answers won't come easily if you restrict yourself to the tried and true approach; setting common sense aside now enables you to come up with an innovative strategy that works."
taurus,2012-05-29,"Although it takes extra effort, you're able to keep things under control today; however, you can still tell that the winds of change are blowing in a storm. You may be scared that you won't be able to continue your present course. If your goals are realistic, they won't likely be threatened by the external chaos. But you might have to modify your current plan or you could temporarily lose your way."
gemini,2012-05-29,"You are receiving a real boost of intelligence with three planets occupying your mentally agile sign. But you have to manage your intensity over the next few weeks or you could squander your newfound energy. Let logic, rather than irrational emotions, be your guide as you make priorities in your attempt to balance personal responsibilities with career ambitions."
cancer,2012-05-29,"Oddly enough, hardly anyone knows how scattered you feel now, even though your thoughts may be bouncing all over the place. Fortunately, you can keep your mental meanderings to yourself by remaining closemouthed. Other people might believe that you're a bastion of common sense, even if you realize that your desire for acceptance is what enables you to appear so grounded. Limit what you say today to what's absolutely necessary so you don't give away your secret."
leo,2012-05-29,"An old emotional wound can start to heal once you see your past from a new perspective. You may have an unexpected ""Aha!"" experience today as a sudden realization allows you to let go of a self-imposed limitation. Be ready to move forward once you acknowledge that your previous point of view might have been holding you back in ways you couldn't imagine."
virgo,2012-05-29,"You can analyze the available data in a variety of ways today yet still come up with the same answer. You want an applicable solution that works, but you would prefer one that blasts you free from the status quo. Your friends and associates may be an inspirational source of motivation now, but your decision needs to be based on your own vision and not on someone else's. Don't force anything; the best path will open up just in time."
libra,2012-05-29,"You may spend your time making lists in secret because you don't want anyone to see how much you are struggling to resolve some pretty basic questions. You prefer to exhibit an air of confidence, but keeping up appearances is exhausting after a while. You don't need to have all the answers now, nor do you have to know exactly what you're doing in advance. If you share your current thinking process with a trusted ally, you might receive useful guidance that you didn't expect."
scorpio,2012-05-29,"You wish that you didn't always have to be the one who brings up the important issues that everyone else avoids. You would like to be light and easy today, but you keep returning to a harsh reality that lurks behind the rainbows and unicorns. Unfortunately, no one else sees things through your perceptive eyes. Thankfully, presenting what you know in a positive manner will actually be appreciated by those closest to you."
sagittarius,2012-05-29,"A business associate or a powerful friend might come to your rescue today by delivering the exact information you need. Integrating a single missing piece of data could be enough to make everything else fit into place, but you must approach it cautiously so you don't overlook any important details. Take your time and review your plan by sharing your ideas with someone else. But remember, being in a hurry to reach a final answer won't help you get there any quicker."
capricorn,2012-05-29,"You feel a certain sense of satisfaction when you can see the results of your hard work without having to wait too long. Luckily, you're in your own earthy element now as your cleverness is channeled into very practical endeavors. However, you could grow overconfident and lose your edge, so do your best today to stay focused on the specific tasks at hand."
aquarius,2012-05-29,"You want to extend yesterday's creative streak, but end up being more concerned with mundane tasks. Downsizing a big idea helps you recover lost time or resources. Money issues rise to the surface today, and facing them directly is healthier than letting them slowly eat away at your confidence. Balancing your future goals with your current responsibilities remains the persistent theme for the days ahead."
pisces,2012-05-29,"The Virgo Moon's current visit to your 7th House of Relationships can bring unwanted criticism from a close friend. Don't get overly defensive or you could miss some very useful advice. But going to the other extreme isn't helpful, either. There's no need to feel as if you're under attack if someone you trust is brave enough to tell you the truth. Instead of sidestepping a difficult discussion, allow the process to deepen an already meaningful friendship."
aries,2012-05-30,"You may enjoy the apparent chaos today as you're distracted by one good idea after another. Although you believe you're a positive force for change now, you should proceed carefully because you aren't as invincible as you think. Losing your cool isn't a wise idea; expressing extreme emotions could create more problems than it solves. Physical exercise helps channel your energy appropriately, but you also need to take additional timeouts to keep your anger in check."
taurus,2012-05-30,"You know you have too much on your plate today, yet you're eager to accomplish as much as you can. However, you're tired from chasing after so many goals. Don't spread your energy too thin; instead, set priorities and focus on the most important tasks first, letting the others go. Panic is unnecessary even if you run into unexpected problems. Remember, the calmer you are now, the more effective you will be throughout the day."
gemini,2012-05-30,"You're very charming, especially with sweet Venus in your sign. But tension is in the air and you can lose your patience if you don't pay close attention to your feelings. You may even find yourself in the heat of an argument now, wondering how it happened. Remember, you aren't the only one who is stressed out today, so your smartest move is to take the high road by demonstrating how well you can listen and respond with kindness."
cancer,2012-05-30,"You appear to have your desires under control, but you aren't actually expressing what you want now. Your feelings are drawing you into deeper waters and the emotional currents can carry you far off course. But you may reach a breaking point where it requires too much energy to hide your inner world from those you love. Don't wait too long to say what's on your mind. A gentle approach makes the most sense while demanding results will just stir up unnecessary resistance."
leo,2012-05-30,"You may feel unnerved from an intense emotional interaction with someone close to you. You could spend much of the day exploring ways to alleviate the tension. Unfortunately, even clever tactics won't hide the edginess to your voice. Examine your unspoken feelings if you notice that your words sound sarcastic. There are several sensible strategies for re-establishing your balance, yet saying hurtful things is not one of them. Instead, cultivate the peace and harmony that you seek."
virgo,2012-05-30,"Concentrating on your job is difficult now as impetuous Mars in your sign squares cerebral Mercury in restless Gemini. Sometimes you can let your thoughts wander for a while, but today your fantasies may not be all that peaceful. Worrying about meeting other people's expectations leads you around in endless circles. Fortunately, you can break out of a temporary emotional tailspin by doing something useful in the present moment, rather than wasting time stressing about the past."
libra,2012-05-30,"It's not easy to settle down today as your key planet Venus aligns with unpredictable Uranus. A lighthearted attitude seems inappropriate if you think you should be more concerned with serious issues. You may be too conscientious to try escaping from your responsibilities. Although harmony and pleasure seem elusive now, the Moon's return to your sign can be a much-needed catalyst in your search for peace."
scorpio,2012-05-30,"You aren't happy about having to maintain a high level of focus today, especially with all the intriguing distractions tempting you. But, ultimately, your strength of purpose is nonnegotiable; you really don't want to get angry, but it could be an effective way now to inform others that you mean business. Those unwilling to help you along your path would be wise to quietly step out of your way."
sagittarius,2012-05-30,"You are able to see the beauty in someone special, but it may not be easy to express how you feel today. You are tempted to sidestep the issue by glibly telling a story or talking about your plans so you don't have to show your vulnerability by sharing what's in your heart. Remember, the deeper meaning of life won't come from a clever conversation. Although it's easy to demonstrate your wit, it's more important to be honest and clearly say what's on your mind."
capricorn,2012-05-30,"You won't likely be caught off guard today, and your apparent stability could draw others to you as they try to manage the stressful situations in their own personal lives. However, you're not entirely without your own worries now, and everyone else's demands might create an extra layer of anxiety for you. Nevertheless, go ahead and offer your shoulder to a loved one, but be firm about drawing the line when you need time to take care of yourself."
aquarius,2012-05-30,"You nostalgically remember simpler days in the past and you may long for their return. You might even experience anger when you realize that these times are complicated and simplicity isn't likely to be found. Although you're balancing on an emotional high wire now, you still have an opportunity to live your dreams. Don't let this chance slip by without doing something about it."
pisces,2012-05-30,"You have more strength than others realize, yet your resistance to your own power can get in the way of your success. Don't succumb to any feelings of insecurity by needlessly comparing yourself to anyone else. You are a unique individual with unique capabilities; the key now is your own self-awareness. Fortunately, managing your belief system can have a positive impact on everyone around you."
aries,2012-05-31,"It's as if you are seeing yourself in a mirror no matter where you look today. Even in your interactions with others, the relationship-oriented Libra Moon seems to point you back to your own thoughts and feelings that you know all too well. Nevertheless, you can't help but thinking that you're missing information that can help you break out of a current rut. You are on the right track now, so allow time for your ideas to develop without acting too soon."
taurus,2012-05-31,"There's a lot to keep you busy now and you're enthused about getting started. However, you might have unresolved issues about a recent event and you're not quite ready to move on. Think of today as a transitional phase; there's no need to jump in all at once. Take your time to process your feelings; you should be back in the swing of things tomorrow."
gemini,2012-05-31,"It's amazing how quickly your interpersonal landscape can shift. If you were trying to outrun trouble yesterday, the sky could suddenly clear today. Although some conflicts may not disappear overnight, your lighthearted feelings make it easier to enjoy what the present moment has in store. If you don't have time to do something just for the fun of it, take a few minutes for meditation and visualize a pleasurable experience. Your wish just might come true when you least expect it."
cancer,2012-05-31,"An ongoing conflict may become overwhelming today, tempting you to withdraw from a possibly unpleasant situation. Unfortunately, retreating doesn't necessarily solve the underlying issue. Naturally, if you are just overhearing someone else's argument, emotionally disengaging could be the most sensible thing to do. But it's not wise to abandon a conversation if you are one of the active participants. Follow the high road and persist with the process until resolution is in sight."
leo,2012-05-31,"You could grow annoyed today because you want to enjoy life, but something keeps getting in your way. Although the obstacles may be real, you recognize that your attitude can have a positive impact on what's happening. Nevertheless, shifting your perspective isn't as easy as it sounds, even if you're able to maintain objectivity. Being patient helps more than you think, so taking baby steps is your best strategy. The big changes will arrive exactly on time."
virgo,2012-05-31,"You have had to face recent delays and overcome obstacles when action-hero Mars retrograded in your hardworking sign earlier this year. And although your trials may not be quite over, at least you can make progress again. The future is calling, yet it's still more important now to achieve balance in the present moment before jumping into the next phase of your personal development."
libra,2012-05-31,"Even if you're weary from recent relationship struggles, you probably feel much better today. Nevertheless, you're also aware that the issues may not yet be fully resolved. You might be overly concerned that your current vulnerability will lead to disappointment, but you're also intrigued by the potential of major breakthroughs in your life. Be ready to take a risk in the weeks ahead, for you can't count on anyone else to know what's in your heart."
scorpio,2012-05-31,"It might feel as if an interpersonal conflict is finally subsiding today, but the little trouble spots may continue to flare up for a while. Fortunately, you can use your imagination to weave fragments of fantasies to piece together a new vision for the next phase of your life. Don't worry if your dreams aren't very realistic; there's still time before you have to come up with a concrete plan. For now, prepare for what's ahead by just letting your thoughts wander freely."
sagittarius,2012-05-31,"You have one foot anchored to reality today through your relationships and your social connections. However, you're simultaneously floating around in space. Use your natural ability to visualize the future to set new goals without worrying about what others think. Thankfully, common sense ultimately prevails now because your friends won't let you drift too far away. Allow time to dream, but make sure you still meet your current obligations."
capricorn,2012-05-31,"You're clear about your objectives today, but you may not be sure how to actually accomplish them. Part of your problem is that someone may be working against you if you have made an enemy along the way. Avoid confrontation now; open conflict won't help you in the present moment. Instead, keep your eyes on your destination and continue to aim in that direction. Your determination should carry you a long way if you can minimize distractions."
aquarius,2012-05-31,"It feels as if you're on a roller coaster ride, aware that the potential for change is increasing day by day. Your anticipation continues to grow as the future encroaches on your present life, but you're still not sure what will happen. You could end up frustrated if you try to fill in too many details too soon. Rather than being overly concerned with what's to come, focus on the here and now where your immediate efforts can have a lasting positive impact."
pisces,2012-05-31,"Although it's said that love is a many-splendored thing, it seems more like an insurmountable challenge now. You might even be tempted to give up if someone is harshly criticizing you or is refusing to see your point of view. Unfortunately, acting rashly isn't a good idea today, especially if you're obsessing about an escape route. Remember that acknowledging your feelings doesn't mean that you have to act on them. Give yourself a few more days and then re-evaluate your feelings."
aries,2012-06-01,"You can be so direct in your communications that others tiptoe around you to avoid a confrontation, making it harder to get your needs met. Luckily, you're able to say what you want now in a way that doesn't alienate anyone. Still, you might be more emotional than you prefer today. Nevertheless, sinking into your feelings is healthy; just stop to consider which ones to keep to yourself before disclosing too much."
taurus,2012-06-01,"You have a lot on your mind today and want to share your thoughts with your friends at work. You might feel the need to talk about important issues, such as money matters, so you can process your concerns with others. Your co-workers may believe that you aren't being very practical, but you have your feet on the ground -- even if your dreams have drifted out of sight. Remain hopeful; just remember to take care of the present moment's responsibilities while you are busy imagining your future."
gemini,2012-06-01,"Your key planet Mercury aligns with sexy Venus in your sign, making this your time to move your thoughts out of your head and into your heart. Usually you can think about your feelings without becoming overly attached to them. Your rational approach is also your natural defense strategy. However, you are now ready to take an emotional risk; set logic aside and speak straight from your heart."
cancer,2012-06-01,"You're more connected to the emotional grid than anyone realizes. Maintaining your attachment to your world empowers you to better manage the intensity level of your feelings. However, if you appear separate and isolated, then you can hide your pain quietly behind your hard outer shell. But once you allow someone to get close, those feelings could be stirred up from the deep. This is an opportune time to let those who matter know how you really feel."
leo,2012-06-01,"You're itching to jump up on stage today and sing or dance. Although you may feel those creative urges now, you aren't really interested in performing unless you have an admiring audience. However, you don't necessarily need hundreds of people watching; you just want someone you love to shower you with attention. Go ahead and give them a show that is worthy of the adoration you seek."
virgo,2012-06-01,"Your ruling planet Mercury prompts you to talk a lot today. Unfortunately, your ideas might not be as coherent as you think. It's tempting to drift away from your regular routine and spend your day telling everyone how things should be done. However, others may not be listening now because they are busy with their own thoughts. Concentrate on finishing your work, rather than wasting too much time seeking perfection in an imaginary world. Actions speak louder than words."
libra,2012-06-01,"You want to express yourself creatively today, even if you have been struggling with something that's blocking your feelings. However, it's difficult to make your vision real if you let laziness get in the way. Although you would prefer to luxuriate in the sensual beauty of your ruling planet Venus, it's better to put in the extra effort and manifest what's in your heart."
scorpio,2012-06-01,"Nothing is quite as stuck as it might seem today. Although your mind is shifting into overdrive, you're still able to maintain a rich fantasy life. But your visions aren't very superficial. No matter what's holding you back, you will feel better once your thoughts are out in the open. Your dreams are a catalyst; use them to move through whatever has been blocking your way."
sagittarius,2012-06-01,"You have an opportunity to say something important to your partner today. Take a risk and express what's on your mind, even if you think it might create conflict. Keep in mind that you still can communicate your feelings in a kind and loving manner even when you are being critical. Luckily, you can use words to create pictures of your vision that can move others closer to your point of view."
capricorn,2012-06-01,"You may need to step back from all the hard work you are doing today so you can gain a healthier perspective. You're very close to achieving a goal, but rather than pushing harder to get there now, the planets are suggesting that you loosen your grip on the reins. Sharing control with others isn't easy, but you might be pleasantly surprised if you do."
aquarius,2012-06-01,"Whether the magic is at work or play, something special is going on that's out of the ordinary today, and it might just involve romance. This isn't ordinary love; it's actually the potential to realize a dream. Unfortunately, you can also set yourself up for a disappointment now. Nevertheless, keep your hopes alive; although they are your keys to success, you will still have to open the door yourself."
pisces,2012-06-01,"You are often the one with your head in the clouds of illusion and your feet barely touching the ground. However, you may be struggling to maintain your sense of reality now. You're fairly familiar with the escape routes from the real world into the realms of imagination. Although it would be more fun to fly away, you're much better off staying grounded today and paying attention to the world around you."
aries,2012-06-02,"You are thinking about altering your path because you can't see how your current direction will lead you to satisfaction. Unfortunately, the changes you make today may sound better than they actually are. Instead of flying by the seat of your pants now, allow sufficient time to create a sensible flight plan before you take off. Practicing patience is better than making a wrong move."
taurus,2012-06-02,"The Moon's visit to your 7th House of Partners reveals unresolved tension in a business or personal relationship. At first, it may seem as if you can talk things out and resolve the problem, but soon it becomes apparent that the issue is more complicated than you thought. Stay present with your feelings and see where they lead, but don't try to force an answer too quickly or you might end up heading the wrong way."
gemini,2012-06-02,"You won't be happy if someone drags you into a complex set of circumstances where extreme emotions seem to be running amok. You may attempt to avoid the entire scene because it makes you feel uncomfortable when logic is overwhelmed by irrational passions. Unfortunately, escape isn't in your cards today, so stop fighting against the current structures. If you show up for others now, you won't be disappointed when things start to change for the better in a couple of days."
cancer,2012-06-02,"A recent power struggle might not be over. Unfortunately, today's relative quietness doesn't necessarily mean that you are any closer to an enduring solution now. It's just that your current lack of imagination could encourage you to temporarily withdraw if you think that others will win. You haven't quit; you're just waiting for the best time to make your next move. Be patient and trust your intuition."
leo,2012-06-02,"You're ready for nearly any type of action, but your instincts are telling you to remain still today and wait for a more beneficial time to play your hand. You aren't interested in taking a risk if it means losing control. In fact, extreme behavior of any kind isn't advisable now because significant shifts over the next few days could prevent you from gaining traction. Hold your cards to yourself until the time is right to gamble with your heart."
virgo,2012-06-02,"You have a down-to-earth strategy you want to share with others, but somehow your ideas don't seem to translate easily today. Your confidence makes it challenging to willingly modify your plans, even when a better course is obvious to everyone else. Don't let your certainty trick you into believing that you know what to do. Stay open to suggestions from others now; one good idea could make all the difference between failure and success."
libra,2012-06-02,"You may receive an intuitive impression today about something simple you can do at work to ease the unspoken stress. Even if you mean well, your strategy could still run into obstacles, especially if someone who is vying for power believes that you are a threat to his or her progress. Trust your instincts now; focus on the common good instead of trying to improve your personal position."
scorpio,2012-06-02,"You have to work extra hard today to let others know exactly what you're feeling. Unfortunately, the Moon's current visit to your sign and her difficult aspects with friendly Venus and chatty Mercury can be troublesome. Your words may provoke intense emotions in others as you attempt to justify your perspective. Instead of trying to change anyone's mind now, simply deliver your message and just leave it at that. Let your love light shine and hope for the best."
sagittarius,2012-06-02,"Your possible overreaction to someone's casual remark is an intelligent reason to keep your thoughts under wraps for a while. Ultimately, you owe it to yourself to share your perspective with your friends. Nevertheless, it's better to wait until you can be more rational before saying what's on your mind. In the meantime, channel some of your fiery intensity into a physical challenge or a creative outlet and you might be happily surprised at the result."
capricorn,2012-06-02,"You might believe that you're everyone's friend because you can see the good side of nearly anything today, but others may not share your optimism. Although you don't feel like you're acting selfishly, someone might think that your helpful actions will ultimately benefit you the most in the long run. These differing points of view create an uncomfortable imbalance as a struggle for control ensues. Be smart and lay low until the resistance dissipates."
aquarius,2012-06-02,"You're not afraid to take charge since the powerful Scorpio Moon is occupying your 10th House of Public Responsibility. But just because you think you know what to do now, this doesn't mean that everyone will actually go along with your plan. In fact, you are likely to meet a silent enemy today as passive resistance stands between you and success. Instead of pushing harder against an invisible wall, relax your efforts and wait until your progress becomes less stressful."
pisces,2012-06-02,"There are many different things happening today that could require you to alter your plans. You are usually more accommodating, but your schedule might be so tight now that it's difficult to make changes that are necessary to stay on track. Luckily, your flexibility can turn a tricky situation into one that's successful for all involved. Thinking outside of the box gives you a chance to save the day."
aries,2012-06-03,"You're tired of waiting for doors to open and your irrepressible restlessness could get the best of you today. It's crucial to keep your mind from wandering because things could change very quickly now. Focus your full attention on what is happening in the present moment, since your ability to react swiftly and take advantage of new developments increases your chances for success."
taurus,2012-06-03,"It appears as if someone you know has something special to offer you now, but you're hesitant to make an assumption and overstep the established boundaries of your current relationship. Asking others for help sometimes isn't easy, making it difficult to start a discussion on a sensitive topic. Don't just give up; a sudden shift in your attitude may allow you to relax and approach the subject with ease. Stretching beyond your comfort zone can produce pleasantly surprising results."
gemini,2012-06-03,"Today's cavalier Sagittarius Moon brightens your 7th House of Partnerships, increasing your confidence and inspiring you to make new friends. Honor your desire for something different by trying innovative ways to interact with someone you would like to know better. But don't expect to attract more of the same kind of companions you've had in the past. Thankfully, remaining open to change works to your advantage now and demonstrates that you can play well with others."
cancer,2012-06-03,"You are quite aware that something is shifting now even if others can't see the changes in you yet. You're less encumbered by your need for security than you are in breaking free from old patterns. You are often cautious, taking tentative steps on a new journey until you become more comfortable. However, you want immediate results today and might be willing to risk your emotional safety for a little excitement. There's no need to wait for a better time; create a plan and make it happen."
leo,2012-06-03,"You cannot decide if you're jazzed about all the possibilities ahead of you now or if you're scared of the upcoming changes. Either way, you can tell that there's a big shift coming, even if you don't yet know what to do about it. It may be advantageous to throw caution to the wind so you can live the life of your dreams. However, if you don't take the initiative today, at least think about your future as if you could do anything you want. Share your thoughts with a friend; expressing what's in your heart is enough to lift your spirits."
virgo,2012-06-03,"It seems as if there's been plenty of change in your life recently and you wouldn't mind a bit of respite today. Nevertheless, there are some opportunities coming up that you would really like to pursue. Balancing your need for security with your desire to take your career to the next level isn't as difficult as you think. Act methodically and avoid sketchy schemes to achieve success without putting in the necessary work. You can reach your goals faster if you manage your resources properly."
libra,2012-06-03,"Your current enthusiasm encourages you to start a new project before you think about what your commitment really means. Unfortunately, you might end up behind the eight ball if you make too many promises, no matter how good your intentions are today. Ultimately, it's not wise to do anything that scatters your energy now. Nevertheless, you can make a lot of progress if you take the time necessary to map out your strategy prior to jumping headfirst into your next project."
scorpio,2012-06-03,"You have many lofty ideas about all the things you can do, but you may not have the stamina now to fulfill your fantasies. Fortunately, this isn't about missing the mark; instead, your current lesson is to learn how to set sensible goals so you can establish a successful track record. Practice dreaming about accomplishments that are actually in the range of possibility. This practical approach utilizes your imagination to create the future."
sagittarius,2012-06-03,"It's unusual for you to be so overwhelmed that you cannot determine what to do next. Nevertheless, tomorrow's Full Moon Eclipse in your sign stirs up so much excitement that you're challenged to stay rational. You may feel scattered because there are too many appealing options, yet you can calm down quickly by just breathing deeply. It's more important to maintain your balance now than to grab every possible opportunity that comes your way."
capricorn,2012-06-03,"The extroverted Sagittarius Moon activates your 12th House of Secrets today, but hiding your confidence is not your best strategic move. However, you still may feel like a closet optimist if you are acting on the premise that you can benefit only by presenting your serious side. Unfortunately, this kind of calculated scheming might leads others to withhold their trust. Let your authentic self shine through, even if you're afraid that others won't approve."
aquarius,2012-06-03,"Spending time with friends and associates can be lots of fun today, yet there's also a more serious side to socializing. Although it seems as if you're just having a good time, the connections you make now can be important to your success later on. But don't spend too much energy trying to gain status and vying for a better position. Ultimately, it's the heart-centered relationships that will add the most meaning to your life."
pisces,2012-06-03,"It's natural to look ahead and think about where you are going in life. Fortunately, sorting out your long-term goals is smart now because your vision is currently unobstructed. Consider ways to build on the solid foundation you have already created rather than heading off in an entirely new direction. Don't worry about how much you actually accomplish today; real progress is going to take some time to manifest."
aries,2012-06-04,"It's a good thing that you can think fast on your feet, since your goals are likely to change with the Sagittarius Full Moon Lunar Eclipse falling in your 9th House of Big Ideas. You thought you knew where you were going, but your world is shifting quickly and you are up for the challenge. No matter what happens today, it's essential to keep an open dialogue. If your communication with others closes down now, you will have fewer choices available. Don't try to plan too far ahead; stay flexible and keep bringing your attention back to the current moment."
taurus,2012-06-04,"If you have been relying on others to support you recently, you may need to re-evaluate your plans when you discover that your allies aren't as committed to your success as you thought. Although this isn't limited to financial assistance, it's wise to conserve your resources until you figure out what to do next. But don't rush to fix a potential problem right away because the Sagittarius Full Moon Eclipse is temporarily destabilizing your 8th House of Shared Resources. Ultimately, you could be in a better position than you think."
gemini,2012-06-04,"You may feel as if someone is being emotionally demanding today as the Sagittarius Full Moon Eclipse rattles your 7th House of Others. You are pushed to consider new relationship options, motivating you to grow in ways that can improve your current situation. However, pretending that everything is OK will only make matters worse. Take a risk and begin a conversation about what you need to feel secure. Even if there is a disagreement about what to do next, sticking with the discussion will ultimately lead to a healthier partnership."
cancer,2012-06-04,"It's challenging to maintain your boundaries as the Sagittarius Full Moon Eclipse shakes your 6th House of Routine. Your dreams are so big now that they overflow into your waking life. You might be annoyed that you aren't satisfied by your work; however, expressing your preferences without inappropriately directing anger at someone can lead to a major breakthrough. Embrace the future; the tides are changing and you cannot hold on to the past."
leo,2012-06-04,"You Lions are connected to the brilliance of the Sun, but now you are reminded to express your feelings as the Sagittarius Full Moon Eclipse rattles your 5th House of Love and Romance. But your logic only gets you so far. If you want to deepen a friendship or intensify a relationship, you must sink into the emotional lunar realms. Don't hold back; share what's in your heart."
virgo,2012-06-04,"You are still in a rather serious mood today, but you're ready to act on an idea that's been running around in your head for a few days. You can feel the tension between the words that are said aloud and your unexpressed desires. You may try to separate the rational from the irrational, but the two are hopelessly intertwined with the Sagittarius Full Moon Eclipse landing in your 4th House of Emotional Security. Ultimately, knowing where you want to go is more important now than knowing how you're going to get there."
libra,2012-06-04,"Today's Sagittarius Full Moon Eclipse activates your 3rd House of Communication, presenting you with another layer of an irresolvable paradox. You may be questioning what you know, but the current data indicates that you're on the right path. Instead of looking at the big picture now, return your attention to your immediate environment. You can't solve all the problems of the world, but you can attend to the practical details that improve your daily life."
scorpio,2012-06-04,"An emotional volcano has been building pressure and you may be tempted to alleviate the stress today. However, if you feel as if you're ready to explode, take a deep breath first and consider how your core beliefs influence your current attitude. Changing your assumptions about what you need to receive from relationships can release you from the past as today's Sagittarius Full Moon Eclipse shakes your 2nd House of Values. As your self-esteem improves, your dependence on the approval of others diminishes. Claim your power now."
sagittarius,2012-06-04,"Today's Sagittarius Full Moon Eclipse is in your sign and the Earth is busy blocking the light of the Sun. Your emotions can go dark as if someone has pulled the plug, leaving you to find your way by instinct. Fortunately, you can experience brilliant flashes of awareness like lightning in a storm. Don't withdraw from those close to you. Instead, continue to share your new feelings with those you trust. Your relationships will jump to a deeper level if you can keep your heart open to surprises."
capricorn,2012-06-04,"Someone may throw you a curve ball now, but it will probably come from left field, instead of from the pitcher. Today's Sagittarius Full Moon Eclipse falls in your 12th House of Secrets, bringing a hidden emotion out into the open. You might think that keeping up appearances is the best way to handle the current uncertainty. However, staying light on your feet allows you to navigate the unexpected changes successfully."
aquarius,2012-06-04,"This can be quite an exhilarating day as the Sagittarius Full Moon Eclipse electrifies your 11th House of Future Goals. You're ready for a major change and you could get clear signals today about what's ahead. Everything that happens is just another clue to the puzzle. Nevertheless, you still have to connect the dots for the current picture to make sense. Stay awake now so you don't miss a thing."
pisces,2012-06-04,"Your desire to get ahead might produce sparks in a close relationship today as the Sagittarius Full Moon Eclipse fires up your 10th House of Career. Your professional objectives seem to be at odds with the simple pleasures of home and family life. Although peace and quiet may be elusive now, open and honest discussions can be grist for the mill that ultimately creates the emotional foundation you want."
aries,2012-06-05,"Although you may be a bit lax about turning your strategy into action, you still have a pretty good handle on your goals now. You can figure things out as you go along, but you could certainly benefit from a little less spontaneity and a lot more preparation. It's smart to attend to the details in advance; just remember that you can always change your plans later on, if necessary."
taurus,2012-06-05,"You could make some extra money now if you overcome the temptation to take the easy way out. Your ruling planet Venus hooks up with the Sun today, tempting you to indulge your senses rather than being responsible. It's OK to eat, drink and be merry as long as you don't think that play is a viable alternative to hard work. Your desires may lure you away from what really needs to be done; reconsider what you want and make a solid commitment to reach your goal."
gemini,2012-06-05,"You may enjoy fantasizing about a flirtatious interaction with a close acquaintance, but you might be surprised when you discover that you want more now. Instead of just being satisfied with lighthearted banter, you're driven to dig deeper in your search for meaning. Although you sometimes avoid emotional intensity, the potential is so alluring that you don't want to miss your chance to experience something very special. Acknowledge your dreams, but try not to confuse them with reality."
cancer,2012-06-05,"You may feel the sweet tenderness of love today if someone goes out of their way to do something special for you. However, you might also experience anxiety if you think that you need to return the favor. Unspoken requests do not need your response unless you're worried that avoiding a discussion could set the stage for future conflict. Thankfully, you can keep everything positive by talking about any concerns as they arise."
leo,2012-06-05,"You Lions are particularly sensitive today as the love planet Venus comes directly between the Earth and the Sun. You're confident about your direction and eager to squeeze as much enjoyment as possible out of your life now. However, social demands pull you in many directions. If you're feeling over-stimulated you might not be able to decide which course of action to choose. Don't make any rash or impulsive decisions today. Taking your time to respond increases your chances of achieving true satisfaction."
virgo,2012-06-05,"You are making progress on many fronts now, but the most lasting consequences may come from public recognition. A new professional venture might open unexpected avenues for growth, but nothing will happen overnight. Patience is your greatest virtue today. Even if data is downloading faster than you can integrate it, just do your best to manage the flow. If necessary, leave the excess information to be dealt with on another day."
libra,2012-06-05,"Your key planet Venus is in the dark today as she travels between the Earth and the Sun, putting you in touch with your artistic nature. Your imagination is running amok, but your desires may not be as sweet and soothing as you wish. You could experience an anxiety-producing background hum from annoying thoughts that won't go away. Even if you cannot shut off the noise, remember to enjoy the simple pleasures along the way."
scorpio,2012-06-05,"Your actions are more complicated than they seem today. Although you might say that you want to re-establish harmony with a close friend or partner, you actually could stir things up a bit first. Everything is exciting now, even if your original plans fall apart. Try to let go of any preconceived agendas; maintaining a flexible attitude about your future turns a tricky situation into one that flows with positive feelings."
sagittarius,2012-06-05,"You are a joy to be around if you're willing to accept the good will being offered without questioning everyone's motives today. You might be afraid to dig beneath the surface because you don't want to upset the status quo. Thankfully, your current actions can produce good results if you aren't expecting too much. Honor your core values instead of striving for immediate gratification. Moderation, not excess, is your real key to success."
capricorn,2012-06-05,"Today should be a day of relaxation as gracious Venus makes a rare alignment with the Sun. Unfortunately, the Moon's presence in your ambitious sign heightens your emotional reaction to someone at work. It helps to have a sensible plan for the day so you don't become overly emotional in your interactions. Additionally, it's beneficial to find a little time to relax to keep your energy in balance."
aquarius,2012-06-05,"You are very persuasive today as you dazzle others with a combination of valid information and disarming charm. However, you may feel so confident that you can fool yourself along with everyone else. Your current tendency to walk on the sunny side of the street is a workable strategy now, unless you take it too far by ignoring important facts that lurk in the shadows. Fortunately, knowing the truth will not deter anyone from joining you if your position is a sound one."
pisces,2012-06-05,"You can easily lose track of your goals today if you are too eager to be a part of something that is greater than yourself. Whether you are overwhelmed by team spirit at work or by a social cause that's close to your heart, merging into a group is a mixed blessing now. Fortunately, collaborating with others is gratifying as long as you remember to simultaneously maintain a healthy perspective on your own professional trajectory."
aries,2012-06-06,"Think through your message before you even open your mouth today, since your reputation could be at stake. Your quick wit can put you into a defensive posture because your tone is emotionally charged and might inadvertently stir up an unanticipated response. Consider the impact of your words and then speak carefully. Others will value what you say now, especially if you back up your ideas with indisputable facts."
taurus,2012-06-06,"Take care of your basic needs today and finish up chores that you should have completed earlier in the week. However, you may not be fully committed to the most sensible routines now even if you see the world through a practical lens. Although you're able to attend to business while planning for your future, there's no reason for you to limit your dreams. You can accomplish the impossible if you just set your mind to it."
gemini,2012-06-06,"Don't waste energy being too self-critical now or someone else may jump on the bandwagon and take you to task, as well. You might feel as if others are raining on your parade today, but it's best not to engage their negativity. Instead of fighting back, look within and change your attitude because your analytical thinking could be the source of what is getting in your way. Lighten up and the world will lighten up with you."
cancer,2012-06-06,"You may be feeling stress about a lingering obligation within a relationship. Conflict could arise from the emotions you are experiencing, even if they don't fit into the current situation. Your mood has been rather serious recently, but now your words and ideas are reaching forward into new territory. Make changes gradually to realign your life with your heart's desires."
leo,2012-06-06,"If you are able to resign yourself to fulfill the rather uninteresting responsibilities that you have ignored, you may be pleasantly surprised. However, the more that you procrastinate today, the more work there will be to do. Unwavering concentration produces significant progress if you don't ignore the little things. A little less spontaneity now will grant you additional personal freedom later on."
virgo,2012-06-06,"You may feel challenged as your desires entangle with your analytical thoughts today. Even if you attempt to be rational, you cannot. If you share what's on your mind, deep emotions begin to surface, coloring what you say and how others will react. Be careful and deliver the correct message right from the start, for it will be hard to justify your current actions later on. Happily, expressing your feelings now could spark a creative streak."
libra,2012-06-06,"Responsibilities continue to pile up and you can't fulfill all your promises by yourself. Obligations related to your family may be just as important in comparison to your long-term professional goals. The key is in what you say today, for you can comfortably hold both ends together by being your natural diplomatic self. Instead of trying to be a superhero by rushing in to save the day, remain flexible and continue to support others the best way you can."
scorpio,2012-06-06,"Having real authority comes from communicating honestly and today, more than ever, you must talk your walk. Expressing what's significant in your life may not be what others want to hear now, but this is about your self-disclosure. There's no need to worry excessively if anyone actually pushes back against your beliefs and opinions. Be true to yourself, regardless of political or emotional correctness."
sagittarius,2012-06-06,"Although you're likely enthusiastic about new ideas, responsibilities might follow you around today like a heavy black cloud. It's not that anything is specifically wrong; it's just that you're concerned about staying true to your values as you move forward in your life. You might feel pressure to take on an additional leadership role, but could find it difficult to inspire others now. Give yourself a break; you may just need a day of rest and recuperation before making any major decisions."
capricorn,2012-06-06,"The Moon in your sign today makes you more concerned with the well-being of your home and family than with your career or your community responsibilities. Your desire to nurture others in a no-nonsense manner is strong, but your subjectivity can also create some difficulty now as your blunt honesty may be misinterpreted as a lack of sensitivity. Share your feelings with those you love even if it's awkward at first."
aquarius,2012-06-06,"Your spiritual practice may grow increasingly important now, but it's not sufficient to simply go through the motions of a religious ritual. Instead, you need to get in touch with your heart as you discover new ideas and possibilities. Although this might be a very busy workday, it's still healthy to make time for peaceful exploration by taking a walk in nature or listening to your favorite music. Practicing meditation will help in more ways than you can possibly realize."
pisces,2012-06-06,"You might want to join a social group, but networking with friends can make issues more difficult than they need to be today. There's no need for panic, however, because your optimistic nature encourages you to forget all but the best parts. Even if you think that you want to be alone, others can still inspire you to be a part of the process if you're willing to keep an open mind."
aries,2012-06-07,"You have practical goals that you want to reach, but recently it's been challenging to bring your thoughts down to earth. Thankfully, you finally touch the ground today, yet it's not as solid as you expected. In fact, you could find yourself embroiled in a conflict as the willful Sun squares your key planet Mars. Don't avoid the confrontation if the disagreement is about something important. However, proceed with caution; you have the power to sidestep an unnecessary argument by just walking away."
taurus,2012-06-07,"You're tired of your busy schedule and would like some time off now. If you're lucky, you may even be looking forward to a vacation. Unfortunately, there might be too many obstacles in your way to actually turn your dreams of a retreat into reality. Even if your obligations seem insurmountable today, you can accomplish your goals if you stay focused. Rest and relaxation are closer than you think if you're willing to compromise and settle for a little less than your perfect fantasy."
gemini,2012-06-07,"You have been surfing the intellectual waves over the past month with quicksilver Mercury visiting your sign. Now that Mercury shifts into nurturing Cancer today, it's more important to hug your friends than to entertain them with your clever wit. Nevertheless, a few judiciously aimed words about your hopes for the future can inspire others to join you on your spiritual journey."
cancer,2012-06-07,"Mercury, the planet of communication, sinks into moody Cancer today. Although you may be thinking more about your feelings now, you might be hesitant to express them. Nevertheless, you haven't lost your edge; you're just more concerned with keeping your family safe from changes in the emotional tides. There's no need to say anything; quiet contemplation brings more rewards than talking up a storm."
leo,2012-06-07,"You may feel overwhelmed today as your thoughts sink under water into the oceanic realm of emotions, where boundaries are difficult to establish and maintain. Nevertheless, it's pointless worrying about circumstances beyond your control. Bring your thoughts back to the present moment and listen to the wisdom of someone very close to you. There's no need to be concerned about losing your way now if you stay close to home."
virgo,2012-06-07,"Your head and your heart are pulling you between logical facts and irrational feelings today. You naturally prefer relying on your analytical abilities to help you make important decisions. But the problem is that you still get mixed outcomes, even when you stay strictly within practical realms. Instead of placing restrictions on which information to use and which to reject, accept all data as additional valid perspectives that widen your horizons and increase your alternatives."
libra,2012-06-07,"You may be feeling something more deeply than usual today, making it tougher to just analyze it away. It's challenging to gain a healthy perspective on what's happening because you cannot discern what's important now. Keep in mind that you don't have to act on every emotion. Loosen the reins of control; allow your thoughts to run free without having to find a solution."
scorpio,2012-06-07,"Your passion for something you love is growing and you know in your heart that you're not going to avoid a confrontation if someone gets in your face. Taking a deep breath and visualizing your happy place can help, but relaxation techniques won't make the problem go away. Just remember that you might inadvertently hurt another person's feelings if you don't think about the consequences of your actions first. Choose your battles carefully so you don't precipitate an unnecessary fight over something unimportant."
sagittarius,2012-06-07,"Relationship matters have become more complicated than you expected as the playful games of the past weeks have now settled into a possible stand-off. Self-protective feelings are more difficult to avoid today, but you must face the issues you have ignored sooner or later. Minimize a potentially angry exchange by compassionately speaking the truth rather than sidestepping it."
capricorn,2012-06-07,"The emphasis in your life is shifting away from work as relationship issues take center stage now. Although your interactions with co-workers are highlighted, the motivation for communication is to express your feelings rather than only discussing the details of your job. However, someone may be miffed if you're not paying enough attention to him or her. Stand your ground as kindly as possible. Let others know how you feel today, even if you don't say everything that's on your mind."
aquarius,2012-06-07,You must pay close attention to your actions because you can get so wrapped up in your own personal needs today that you inadvertently jeopardize a significant relationship. It's not that you shouldn't strive for creative self-expression; it's just that you will be better served if you remember that a little compromise goes a long way. Cherish the ones you love while you have the chance.
pisces,2012-06-07,"You may excel in your ability to justify your position to yourself today. Although you're more accepting of your own feelings, others might not see things from your perspective. Confusing matters further, your actions might not demonstrate your willingness to cooperate. But don't withdraw from the situation simply because there is an awkward tension in the air; instead, talk about your concerns openly without trying to convince anyone that you are right. Initiating an honest dialogue is your best weapon of attack."
aries,2012-06-08,"It's difficult to trust your perceptions today because you're not seeing things as they exist; instead, you're basing your assumptions on what you wish to be true. However, you stand the best chance of realizing the potential of the current situation if you can be an active listener now. Fully absorb what others are saying without shutting out your feelings in the process. You can learn an invaluable lesson if you're willing to open your heart."
taurus,2012-06-08,"Your confusion regarding your long-term career goals can cloud what you are doing today. You might have thought that your work was bringing you closer to your objectives, but it's difficult to remember where you are going and why. This is a test to determine if you believe enough in your current path to trust that it will take you where you need to go. When in doubt, rely on your intuition now instead of logic. Have faith that your instincts will lead you in the right direction."
gemini,2012-06-08,"Your key planet Mercury aligns with visionary Neptune today, inspiring you to express your thoughts in creative ways. You may grow frustrated or disillusioned if you try to limit your thinking with the restraints of common sense. Imagine that your ideas are soaring free as birds in a clear blue sky. There are no real obstructions in your imagination so you can save your logical reasoning for another day."
cancer,2012-06-08,"You might think that you have a quick and easy solution for a friend's problem, but you may be missing an important piece of the puzzle. Nevertheless, you believe that your intuition will steer you in the right direction and you're ready to trust your psychic hunches. Although you're able to convince others that your plan is a good one, it's smarter now to work on your own issues rather than anyone else's. Use your imagination to conjure up your ideal situation and then methodically work to make it real."
leo,2012-06-08,"Your words might not convey your true feelings today, even if you try to carefully explain what you want. There may be a cloudy veil hiding your true desires from others with elusive Neptune in the planetary picture now. Don't be satisfied with the ordinary and mundane. Your creativity will shine if you just allow your imagination to flow."
virgo,2012-06-08,"Normally, it's easy for you to narrow your concentration. Now, however, your imagination widens your vision as rational Mercury harmonizes with surreal Neptune. This heightened awareness enables you to see yourself in new ways, especially with respect to your job or daily routine. Choose your destination wisely and dream up a path that takes you there."
libra,2012-06-08,"You may be artistically inclined, and this is a fantastic day to explore the creative side of your nature. But even if you cannot play the piano like Beethoven, draw like Picasso or write poetry like Rumi, at least take time to enjoy the beautiful creations of others. Let your inner child come out to play; you just might inspire your friends to join you."
scorpio,2012-06-08,"An email or a phone call from a member of your family might send you on a wild goose chase today. Or, perhaps it's just your own jumbled childhood memories popping into awareness. In any case, you must be able to separate the fantasy from reality. You can say exactly what you mean if you can find the kernel of truth within your imagination. If you can't, then just keep quiet. Sometimes, silence is golden; your mysterious smile says it all."
sagittarius,2012-06-08,"Although you can normally rationalize your course of action, today your emotions set the stage for what is unfolding. You might think that you're not in control of your feelings now, especially if you doubt a recent relationship decision. However, you can turn worry into inspiration by consciously projecting your wishes into the future. Believe in yourself; your thoughts are the scaffolding upon which your future is being built."
capricorn,2012-06-08,"You believe that you have something special to offer, but your own center may be thrown off balance today. Fortunately, you still can inspire others to work more efficiently, but you must learn to lean less on logic and trust your intuition. Even if you can't justify what you already know, step further out on the limb, anyhow. Take a risk, but don't reach too far or you could accidentally break the branch that is supporting you."
aquarius,2012-06-08,"You may appear more confused than you actually are now, and the more you try to explain yourself, the farther away you get from the truth. Fortunately, it's easy to relieve some of the pressure by avoiding details, especially involving technical subjects. Although you're eager to take the day off, you still might have to show up for work. Nevertheless, you are better off keeping your thoughts and feelings quiet for a while."
pisces,2012-06-08,"Fantasy plays a very significant role in your life and your dreams might overflow the banks of your consciousness today. Avoid making decisions that require rational analysis now. Instead, use your imagination to create your own future. If possible, involve others in your personal process because they can help you clarify what you really want."
aries,2012-06-09,"You think that you have a handle on the events of the day, but you're viewing reality through a very optimistic lens. Your certainty is misleading to others who take your words at face value. Be fair to all involved by acknowledging your disorientation today before creating additional trouble. Your happiness depends on your ability to be honest with everyone, especially yourself."
taurus,2012-06-09,"You're currently concerned about losing your practical approach to finances or misplacing your good judgment about meeting responsibilities. Although you realize that your perspective is a bit off today, you still might not make the best choices. Ultimately, fuzzy thinking can weaken your position, so steer clear of unnecessary debates for a while. Putting off significant decisions for a few days is wise because you need additional time to clarify your goals."
gemini,2012-06-09,"Your vivid imagination is in overdrive today as every separate event sparks cascades of unconventional fantasies. Enjoy the show, but be careful of becoming so entranced by the distractions that you begin to think that your flights of fancy are real. You might not want to stop daydreaming, but you can simplify your life by keeping the visions to yourself for now."
cancer,2012-06-09,"You might mistakenly assume that your plan is worthwhile as long as you're receiving approval from someone else. A close friend may complicate your life by trying to change your mind while you're in the middle of resolving an emotional dilemma. Unfortunately, others cannot understand how deep your feelings really run, especially if you don't usually share your innermost process. Keep your best ideas quiet for another day or two until you're more confident about where you stand. Evaluate your own priorities by listening to your heart."
leo,2012-06-09,"Everyone seems a bit out of it today, but their vagueness says more about you than others. Although you are working harder these days to gain more clarity in your life, the truth still seems elusive. You tend to overcompensate by limiting your delusional thinking, reducing your own creativity in the process. There's no need to be too judgmental. When you become more accepting of yourself, everything else will appear more positive, too."
virgo,2012-06-09,"You may be feeling befuddled as you go about your chores today, but you're struggling because you aren't sure of your current role. Even if you have enduring routines, things are changing in ways that are difficult to understand. Instead of wasting time listing all the pros and cons of your situation, drop the analysis for now. Just show up and do what's expected of you; set aside the major decisions until you're more certain about where you want to go."
libra,2012-06-09,"Although you might have a specific agenda when you wake up today, you're likely to shift directions as the day unfolds. Trying to hold your focus grows increasingly complicated and can lead to frustration unless you're willing to reconsider your goals and reinvent your strategy. However, even if you're able to see into the future now, wait a few days until your feet are back on the ground before implementing anything new."
scorpio,2012-06-09,"You are happy to remain in motion today, yet you're secretly unsure that you will have a place to stop and rest later. However, your best friends might not even notice your anxiety, especially if you believe that you're doing others a favor by keeping your needs quiet. After all, sharing your feelings now would only complicate your life. But don't blame anyone else for a lack of support unless you're willing to disclose more of your emotional process. Confiding in someone you trust might ease your mind more than you think."
sagittarius,2012-06-09,"You may be quite sentimental about your memories today as a current experience reminds you of a forgotten past event. Unfortunately, nostalgia isn't emotionally fulfilling now, so you might look forward to the big changes ahead. Think before you speak, and be careful that your outspoken approach doesn't hurt an old friend or lover. Ultimately, letting go of the past allows you to move freely into the future."
capricorn,2012-06-09,"A discussion with a close friend can be very fulfilling today. Normally, you're attracted to practical conversations that can help you along on your journey through life. But now you're more interested in sharing your fantasies with someone who won't judge everything you say. There's no reason to feel guilty about your desire to escape from reality. If you can let yourself go, you will return to your chores refreshed and ready to work."
aquarius,2012-06-09,"It's difficult to express yourself clearly today because your desires are bouncing all over the place. Unfortunately, once you start talking, you quickly display a wide range of emotions, challenging others to keep up with your mood swings. Nevertheless, a more thoughtful approach enables you to minimize any uncertainty that arises from a breakdown in communication. Exploring your feelings by writing in a journal is a sensible way to ground yourself before sharing your feelings."
pisces,2012-06-09,"The Moon's shift into your dreamy sign increases your awareness today, allowing you to be even more intuitive than usual. But another person's inability to comprehend your irrational approach to life might make you feel insecure now. It's not necessary to respond to criticism or accusations; instead, be proud of your natural creativity, sensitivity and compassion."
aries,2012-06-10,"You had your heart set on doing something fun with your friends today, but as the time draws near, you might feel like bailing on your plans and taking some quiet time to contemplate your future. However, the universe encourages you to be more socially active now. Whatever happens, don't get caught up in someone else's drama. You can still find peace of mind as long as you pay attention to your own feelings, even in the midst of a noisy party."
taurus,2012-06-10,"You may resist sharing your feelings because you don't want your friends to think that you're being negative. Maybe you've been waiting for the right moment to tell everyone what's on your mind, yet it never seems like a good time. You might be annoyed today that you haven't spoken your truth, and it is tempting to blame an outsider. Instead, take full responsibility for your emotions and express them without pointing your finger at anyone else. Others will appreciate your integrity once you've cleared the air."
gemini,2012-06-10,"You are extremely susceptible to whatever your friends and family tell you now. Although your desires can be quite different from other people's expectations, you don't want to create a scene over a petty disagreement. However, your frustration may turn to anger if you decide to do what someone else wants rather than following your own instincts. It's certainly smarter to get your feelings out into the open than to let them stew in resentment. The sooner you share what's in your heart, the better."
cancer,2012-06-10,"Your dreams are too big to keep hidden now and you might continue feeding them with your fantasies all day long. Unfortunately, your vision is too idealistic to  integrate into your everyday life in a practical way. Nevertheless, your mental meanderings serve a definite purpose, encouraging you to explore all of the possibilities before you and all of the magic within. Allow your imagination to wander today; you never know where it will take you."
leo,2012-06-10,"You seem to know exactly what to say and your words have a positive effect on others today. But even if you have a solid plan, you are likely to ignore it once a conversation starts. Stay in the present moment now rather than trying to follow a particular script. Step boldly into unknown territory, but beware that you probably won't end up where you expected."
virgo,2012-06-10,"It's challenging to concentrate on the details in order to make certain that what you're working on today doesn't fall apart. But you might be trying to exert too much control over things that just don't matter in the long run. Instead of wasting time attempting to control external events, you're free to focus your attention anywhere you want. Establishing sensible priorities now enables you to make progress more than anything else."
libra,2012-06-10,Your overly dramatic attempts to convince your friends how efficient you are might backfire if you try too hard today. You are more likely to make an error in judgment now if you act under pressure. Adopt a more laid-back approach so you don't appear desperate. Give yourself more time to finish your work and don't worry so much about what others think.
scorpio,2012-06-10,"It's nearly impossible to know how you will react if a close friend brings a complex problem to you today. You really want to be supportive, but might discover that your eagerness to help quickly turns into resentment. Process your frustrations before they manifest negative consequences. Trust your instincts; you are more brilliant now than you realize."
sagittarius,2012-06-10,"You may want a quiet day at home, away from your regular responsibilities. However, even if you attempt to schedule your weekend so that you have plenty of downtime, don't be surprised if you end up taking on more than you planned. Compassion, rather than ambition, motivates you to help a family member, friend or even someone you don't know. The more you give, the more you get."
capricorn,2012-06-10,"Your sixth sense is highly active today and it can be startling at first if you suddenly realize something that you haven't yet been told. Remember that your regular rational approach won't work now because you may not be able to explain your current insights. Instead of putting up defenses because you feel uncomfortable, stay open to the waves of intuition flooding your awareness. Don't question this magical process; instead, act on a hunch as if you believe it's true."
aquarius,2012-06-10,"You may be annoyed with someone who doubts the wisdom of your choices because it feels as if your core values are being questioned. Normally, you can stand up for yourself, but words seem to fail you now. The harder you try to make your point, the more flustered you are today. Take a few steps backward so you can regroup and then state your case. Defend your decision and let your performance stand on its own merit."
pisces,2012-06-10,"You might be happier today if you don't have too many prior commitments on your calendar. Naturally, you won't be able to avoid certain responsibilities, but the less you have on your schedule now, the better. Just remember this isn't about being lazy; it's about staying attuned to your own internal clock rather than conforming to everyone else's agendas."
aries,2012-06-11,"You would prefer to keep your feelings to yourself today, but real-world obligations rudely pull you out of your inner reverie. Whether you like it or not, your attention must be focused on career issues rather than personal ones. Fortunately, a resolution to your current dilemma is possible if you state your needs with clarity. Remain relentless until you're on a professional path that you can follow without sacrificing your integrity."
taurus,2012-06-11,"Intense discussions about your most personal values are stressful, but you might want someone else's point of view to clarify your own. However, your plan to involve others can backfire because they might have their own strong opinions on what you should do, setting up the likelihood of a verbal disagreement. Keep a tender spot in your heart for those you love in order to minimize any unnecessary conflict."
gemini,2012-06-11,"Your uncharacteristic self-analysis pulls you into the mysterious shadows of your subconscious, bringing up old issues of self-worth. However, your current anxiety is probably linked to your relationship with the material world as you worry about your finances. If money matters present a challenge today, it's time to face whatever stands between you and your desired security. Taking a proactive approach now prevents a crisis down the road."
cancer,2012-06-11,"An intense character may enter your life now that mischievous Mercury opposes dark Pluto, presenting you with an emotional dilemma. You must decide whether to continue on your own path or to go along with someone else's agenda. Although everything seems dramatic now, a temporary retreat enables you to gain clarity so you know exactly which way you want to go."
leo,2012-06-11,"You are resistant to talk too much today because you believe that others already know enough about you. Although you prefer to avoid conflict, an unexpected argument can suddenly pull you off track. Unfortunately, you might not even have a choice now. Just make certain that you fully commit to the process, since the only way you can get out is by going through it. Improve the interpersonal dynamics by showing all your cards. Exercising full disclosure is your smartest strategy."
virgo,2012-06-11,"Emotional comfort may be elusive today as verbal sparring distracts you from making a real connection with someone you love. Even a straightforward romance can grow complicated today as communicator Mercury forms tense aspects with passionate Pluto and disruptive Uranus. Nevertheless, don't let the apparent lack of warmth discourage you. Intimacy doesn't come without a struggle these days. Engaging in an open and honest dialogue clears the air of tension, allowing sweeter times to follow."
libra,2012-06-11,"Your desire to be impartial dredges up hidden family secrets and brings unexpressed thoughts into awareness now as you go looking for answers. Allow communicator Mercury to do his job and initiate conversations, even if sharing at an emotional level precipitates an unpleasant confrontation. Thankfully, you should emerge unscathed and even relieved if you interact willingly, instead of avoiding the issues to keep the peace."
scorpio,2012-06-11,"You are like a ferryman today, shuffling to and fro between two opposing perspectives. Thankfully, you aren't easily deceived into believing that one side is right and the other is wrong. Nevertheless, don't get sucked into thinking your own point of view is superior to anyone else's opinion; a bit of intellectual detachment is exactly what you need."
sagittarius,2012-06-11,"Although you normally say what's on your mind, you may try to avoid expressing your feelings today because they make you uncomfortable. You might grow so passionate over a personal belief that you don't understand how anyone else could possibly think differently. Ironically, your ideas provoke strong emotions in others which can lead to conflict. Thankfully, the turmoil will pass quickly if you face your fears with the courage of your convictions."
capricorn,2012-06-11,"Even if you're feeling optimistic now, you must still handle issues that can bring you into direct opposition with a formidable opponent. Although you are prepared for battle, you might secretly wish you could just walk away. It seems as if your life has become a series of powerful transformations. You are not who you once were, yet you're not the person you are still becoming. Nevertheless, take it easy even in the midst of conflict, for real change takes time to unfold."
aquarius,2012-06-11,"You may be required to do something today that you would simply rather not do -- yet your resistance is futile. You could grow angry if it appears that someone is working behind the scenes to undermine your positive efforts. Taking a self-righteous stand only makes matters worse. Rather than just reacting to other people's demands with resentment, remain open to further discussion. You may be surprised that reaching a satisfying compromise is easier than you think."
pisces,2012-06-11,"It might appear as if there is no solution in sight to a current disagreement. Although loyalties in friendships may be rearranging as the current passions rise, you have a secret weapon at your disposal today. Your current ability to emotionally detach while staying intellectually engaged could save the day. Carefully analyze the whole situation to locate pieces of common ground upon which everyone can stand."
aries,2012-06-12,"Trusting your natural talent to react in the moment without a lot of forethought enables you to turn a complicated situation into one that is beneficial for everyone involved. Just remember to respond to an unexpected change of plans at work without going overboard. There's no need to convince anyone that you have everything under control, because you don't. The good news is that no one expects you to have all the answers."
taurus,2012-06-12,"Your fantasies are spilling over into your environment, challenging you to separate your real life from your dreams. It's difficult to make a decision now because everything tends to look better than it actually is. Stop and listen to what others are saying; a reality check is a smart idea today prior to making any significant moves."
gemini,2012-06-12,"Someone can misread your intentions today, reminding you that judging a book by its cover is never a good idea. Your current behavior says one thing yet your heart says something else. Nevertheless, don't blame others for misunderstanding your message. Trickster Mercury is still twisting your tongue into expressing your truth in a very convoluted manner. Fewer words now are better than too many."
cancer,2012-06-12,"You may become drawn into other people's business today, even if you usually try to avoid drama by keeping to yourself. Helping someone out sometimes is a slippery slope and being aware of your own feelings can prevent you from sliding too far and too fast. Putting up protective boundaries to maintain your emotional security isn't necessary now. Thankfully, you can still be a friend without losing yourself along the way."
leo,2012-06-12,"You feel so good about yourself today that you want to say yes to everyone and everything. You make friends quite naturally because your generosity of spirit is contagious. Nevertheless, a bit of self-restraint is necessary or your overconfidence can set you up for disappointment later on. However, demonstrating your responsible outlook on life may not be as much fun at first. Thankfully, setting priorities enables you to accomplish more than you expect."
virgo,2012-06-12,"Although you're receiving sufficient support to go ahead with your project now, moving too fast only creates problems. Your friends and associates may be enthusiastic about your plans, encouraging you along your way. However, if you bolt ahead too quickly, you could actually end up at the wrong destination. Even if you're eager to move forward today, taking your time pays off in ways you cannot yet imagine."
libra,2012-06-12,"A friend or business partner may promise one thing today and deliver something quite different. You yearn for consistency now and really don't like it when others lack follow-through. Your natural tendency is to graciously take it in stride, without showing your annoyance or anger. Nevertheless, it might be healthier to express your need for assistance from someone you can rely on. Your desire for harmony is admirable, but you still deserve respect just like everyone else."
scorpio,2012-06-12,"Everything seems copasetic on the surface, but you may feel as if you took something one step too far. You can't retreat; what's already done is done. Keep in mind, though, that others may not be as judgmental of you as you are of yourself. You might not be able to avoid spinning your inner web of worries today, but remember that you don't have to reveal your insecurities to anyone else. Things will look much better tomorrow."
sagittarius,2012-06-12,"There is so much happening in your life now that it's nearly impossible to keep up with every little detail. People around you may begin to annoy you, even if they are your friends. Try to look beyond your irritation, since you might be overreacting about something relatively insignificant. When in doubt today, express your thoughts by offering a positive perspective instead of venting your concerns. If your uncertainty lingers overnight, then find the right person to share your fears with tomorrow."
capricorn,2012-06-12,"You may feel as if you are being thrust forward like a rocket ship today, and you're already way outside of your element. You really don't want to do something if you aren't ready, but you might not have the luxury now of saying no. Luckily, you can accept the challenges of new assignments without losing your footing. You are capable of reaching the stars even if you prefer to keep your feet on the ground."
aquarius,2012-06-12,"It's so easy to fall in love these days that you might do it more than once. But allowing yourself to indulge in a romantic fantasy doesn't necessarily mean that you must bring it out into the open. Your dreams are intense now, so pay extra attention to what's happening to minimize confusion. There's no need to express your desires to anyone else unless you truly feel ready to do so. Channeling your passion into a creative outlet will produce lasting results."
pisces,2012-06-12,"You are hearing conflicting messages today from your own inner guidance system. Keep in mind that you are more sensitive now than usual and could also be picking up subtle signals from those around you. Even if you don't have a clear plan in place, choose your next project wisely and get started. You can always make necessary modifications when you are further along in the process."
aries,2012-06-13,"You can feel the adrenaline pumping through your body, but something is still holding you back today. Your inclination is to shut out all the contradictions by closing your eyes and just jumping into the fray. Although the impetuous Aries Moon tempts you to rush dangerously close to the edge, it's beneficial to think things through before going too far. Exercising self-restraint now is easier than usual and, luckily, works in your favor."
taurus,2012-06-13,"Good ideas are popping into your awareness today, but you cannot follow each one of them to its conclusion. Your smartest strategy is to narrow the field of possibilities now before taking action. It's silly to waste energy running around from one project to another, even if they are worthwhile. There is a gem in the mixture; your assignment is to find it."
gemini,2012-06-13,"You may be tougher on yourself than anyone realizes today. In some ways you're like a stage magician, for others just see what you want them to see. Everyone is fascinated with your hands waving around in the air and the amazing stories you can tell, but they may not understand this show is all to hide the mental juggling act you're performing behind the curtain. Instead of going to such extreme measures, just take action now to fix what's wrong."
cancer,2012-06-13,"Everything has grown pretty intense lately, but it's nearly impossible to tell who's really in control -- and this is part of the problem. Don't try to outsmart others with your logic, or you could end up tying your emotions into knots that cannot be easily untangled. You will find allies you didn't know you had if you simply lean toward cooperation now rather than competition."
leo,2012-06-13,"Your actions today should easily produce enduring results without a lot of extra effort. Thankfully, you probably won't have to wave your flag as much as usual to get others to respond. However, don't be surprised when they admire your dramatic flair instead of your work. Be humble; the real message is about what you can do now that adds meaning to your life."
virgo,2012-06-13,"You're very proud of your work, even if others don't seem to appreciate what you're doing. However, you might not feel like you're making much progress if you start to believe the negative feedback. Thankfully, you have more control of what happens than you realize. Your persistence will be rewarded, so remain focused on your objectives today no matter what anyone else says."
libra,2012-06-13,"Being artistic isn't all fun and games. There is hard work in doing what you do and living your life in your special way, even if it looks easy to others. Your self-discipline, combined with a strong work ethic, sets the stage for the big payoff. Although you're tempted to take the easy way out, it's more important to keep the production lines moving so you can reach your goals."
scorpio,2012-06-13,"Although your current feelings may be rather complicated, you can learn a lot by exploring them. Fortunately, you're quite capable when it comes to integrating complex emotions that have been lurking around in your shadowy subconscious. However, you must resist the temptation to leave questions unanswered now just because you are bored. Instead of skipping off to the next intriguing distraction today, stay in one place long enough to satisfy your quest for meaning."
sagittarius,2012-06-13,"You might feel as if you're in a restrictive box today, but oddly enough you don't seem to mind. Although you believe that unconventional thinking is your fastest way out of a difficult situation, you're not at liberty now to act on your thoughts. Ultimately, it's difficult to decide whether to be rebellious or rational. Others may encourage more radical behavior, but a traditional approach increases your chances for success."
capricorn,2012-06-13,"You Mountain Goats climb harder when the going gets tough, as if you're trying to prove that nothing will stop you. Nevertheless, it's challenging to focus now as you move from one project to another. Ironically, you may appear more scattered than you actually are. There's a method to your madness today, so don't let anyone plant a seed of doubt in your mind. You can reach the top of the mountain if you believe that you can."
aquarius,2012-06-13,"Others tend to take you quite seriously today, even if you're channeling the weirdest and most eccentric parts of yourself. Fortunately, you get to play both ends of the spectrum, being an unconventional rebel and a disciplined student. Although an impulsive reaction seems like the opposite of a more compulsive approach, you can somehow combine the attributes into a single posture that gets you what you need. Enjoy the balancing game while it lasts."
pisces,2012-06-13,"A family problem that remains unsolved now takes an important turn toward resolution. However, the conflict isn't over yet because the final outcome has not yet been determined. In the meantime, you can still get closer to compromise if you just allow your true feelings out of the bag. Embrace the future; sharing your hopes and fears creates an atmosphere of trust."
aries,2012-06-14,"You may feel as if you're spinning your wheels today, without getting much done at all. Part of the problem is that you are not as grounded as you think. Fortunately, you can make a conscious decision to choose a path that demonstrates your commitment to finish what you start. Focusing on just one task at a time enables you to have the positive impact you seek by the end of the day."
taurus,2012-06-14,"You don't want everyone to know what you are thinking today, but you still may not be able to avoid sharing too much. You must pay close attention to your words or you might inadvertently reveal more than you intend. However, limiting your interactions with others can give you the personal space you need now. Stay on track by resisting the tempting distractions as best you can."
gemini,2012-06-14,"Being presented with other people's intriguing plans can be overwhelming, making it tough to know who is cleverest, you or your friend. In any event, there are too many ideas flying around today and you could exhaust yourself just trying to keep up. However, you don't need to overcompensate by going quiet; just don't overdo it when you share your thoughts. Create a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable exploring their options."
cancer,2012-06-14,"You're feeling more independent on the job and would like to stretch your wings a bit. Unfortunately, you may be asked to help a fellow worker, which can temporarily restrict your freedom of movement. However, this doesn't mean you should be any less compassionate in your dealings with others. Although you might be resistant at first, you can deepen a friendship by being available now for someone in need."
leo,2012-06-14,"Although you may be looking far into the future, current circumstances pull you back to your responsibilities in the present moment. Nevertheless, you're not eager to shift gears so suddenly and a part of you continues to imagine what's ahead. Just remember that everything happens for a reason. Even if you must let go of your vision today, nothing will be lost. Your dreams will return when you have more time to attend to them."
virgo,2012-06-14,"You may still feel a bit scattered today, especially at work. It's as if you are too excited to settle down to the specific tasks at hand. Try not to worry so much about missing a deadline, for the internal stress generated by anxiety is counterproductive. Everything should turn out fine now even if you fall behind; what you don't finish today can be completed tomorrow."
libra,2012-06-14,"If you have been a bit self-absorbed recently, you may be snapped out of your current reverie by an unexpected event. Something special might happen today that reminds you of the magic of the universe and it's easy to make this even more important than it actually is. Remember that you are in an intense period of change that will continue over the next several months, so reserve your conclusions until you have a bit more perspective."
scorpio,2012-06-14,"You may take on too many projects now, yet the chores you finish early in the day will open up more free time for you later. Complete as much as you can or you might have to turn down an exciting last-minute invitation. Packing as much as possible into the morning hours ensures that you'll have sufficient time to play with your friends today, recharging your batteries for the work ahead."
sagittarius,2012-06-14,"If you have too much fun during the day today, you might have to pay for it emotionally later on. Let others know if you truly want to participate, but don't feel obligated to say yes in order to live up to someone else's expectations. Ultimately, your best strategy is to carefully pace yourself so you'll still have some energy leftover in the evening for what's important to you."
capricorn,2012-06-14,It's challenging to remain focused on your own agenda today since your thoughts are flying all over the place. You might even try to do the same old thing in a completely new way just to avoid boredom. The problem is that your new approach could throw off your natural rhythm and ultimately slow you down. Save your creativity for something more fun while getting your chores out of the way as efficiently as possible.
aquarius,2012-06-14,"There's so much to accomplish early in the day that you could easily lose sight of how to enjoy yourself. The simple solution is to avoid trying to do everything all at once. Remember, whatever you cannot finish now can be completed in a day or two. Finding a manageable balance between work and play makes all the difference in the world."
pisces,2012-06-14,"Your excitement about taking some time off can morph into anxiety if you are so overwhelmed with your current responsibilities that you're afraid of losing the opportunity. Instead of projecting the pressure you currently feel into the future, keep reminding yourself to calm down and accomplish as much as you can right now. Thankfully, taking care of your obligations in a methodical manner helps to ease your concerns and enables you to relax later on."
aries,2012-06-15,"Paying close attention to financial matters makes good sense now that the materialistic Moon is moving through your 2nd House of Resources. You may have to restrain your spending in order to manage your monthly expenses, but whatever corrective actions you take today might not have much impact until next week. There's no need to panic as long you take care of your business responsibly. Being thankful for what you currently have turns your outlook in a positive direction."
taurus,2012-06-15,"Dealing with practical matters is a constructive use of your time, but something still bothers you even if you cross off everything on your to-do list. Perhaps an unresolved emotional issue is gnawing away at your sense of accomplishment, making you doubt your own abilities now. Putting extra effort into your work tilts the scales of judgment in your favor. But make sure that you also honor your feelings by sharing your concerns with a dependable friend."
gemini,2012-06-15,"Conversations are lively today, words flowing back and forth with a natural rhythm. It seems as if there is a really good connection between you and your friends, but something significant isn't being addressed. The more questions you ask in your process of discovery, the less you realize you know. Instead of hunting down answers now, simply relax and enjoy the lighthearted interactions. You can continue your search for meaning tomorrow."
cancer,2012-06-15,"Don't act so surprised if your friends come through for you today in an unexpected way. You might be embarrassed at first because you are feeling more vulnerable than you prefer. However, a negative gut reaction can morph into a more positive one once you realize that you're all on the same team. Look at the help you receive as an opportunity to get closer to someone you truly admire."
leo,2012-06-15,"Offering your generosity and loyalty to a friend in times of turmoil is something you do quite naturally. However, your actions might affect more than any one single person. There's no need to hold back if others are looking to you for leadership. Deliver the goods, along with a song and a smile; your dependability acts as a shining example for those around you."
virgo,2012-06-15,"You're naturally motivated to stand high on the mountain so you have the very best view, yet developing your vision may be quite complicated now. Intellectually, you can expand your perspective through education, so consider enrolling in a course or even traveling to widen your horizons. There's no need to confine your explorations to books or classrooms; you might learn more by embarking on an adventure in the real world."
libra,2012-06-15,"Your love for the finer things in life lures you into an emotionally charged conversation with a close friend as you explore the possibilities ahead. You're interested in going on a trip or doing something that breaks you out of your current routine, but you don't want to move too fast. Talking about change is safer now than actually making your move. Consider today's discussion as the first step toward making your dreams come true."
scorpio,2012-06-15,"Getting into an argument is easier than resolving it. If you run into a stubborn person who tries to tell you what to do today, it might irk you enough to tell them off. Unfortunately, even a small disagreement now could escalate into an emotionally uncomfortable confrontation. Being aware of your intensity enables you to keep the energy from getting too extreme. Sidestepping conflict by taking the high road turns things in a positive direction."
sagittarius,2012-06-15,"Your own crazy antics may be more bothersome to you today than anyone else's fickle behavior. The good news is that everyone seems to be changing their minds as quickly as you are now. The bad news, however, is that it can be difficult to pin anyone down to specifics when it comes to relationship matters. Exploring your options is healthy as long as you don't commit to anything you might later regret."
capricorn,2012-06-15,"If you have been keeping up with your recent responsibilities, then relax, hit the reset button and recharge your emotional batteries today. Doing something special with a loved one or even just hanging out on your own can bring blissful satisfaction. But you are more restless than usual and could also start a few projects just to occupy your mind. Keep your priorities straight and remember that it's time to listen to your heart."
aquarius,2012-06-15,"You may grow anxious at work today because you want to begin your weekend as soon as possible. You are looking forward to some exciting activities now, but have a few non-negotiable domestic chores to finish before you cut loose to enjoy yourself. Try not to let your anticipation of the future get in the way of your current efficiency or you will have even more to do before the fun can start."
pisces,2012-06-15,"Expressing your feelings can be challenging when language falls short of describing the richness of your imagination. However, the right words come to you just in the nick of time today, increasing your confidence that you can get your message across. But it's not about rambling on aimlessly; state your point succinctly and then step back to let the other person respond. Remember, communication is a two-way street."
aries,2012-06-16,"You are naturally headstrong yet today you would rather others see you as more adaptable. Nevertheless, once you make up your mind, you're not likely to change it. Thankfully, you have the ability to alter your direction on a moment's notice if you so desire. Instead of taking the easy way out of a tricky situation by going into denial, continue to push as much information as possible out in the open. The more you're willing to share now, the more likely you'll receive the help you need."
taurus,2012-06-16,"What others think of you doesn't have to distract you from what you are doing today. It may seem as if they're questioning your beliefs or your core values, prompting you to take direct action now so you won't have to defend yourself later on. It's easy to become preoccupied with your fears, but you may not be under any real threat at all. Try not to blow things out of proportion and remember that you're not responsible for anyone else's thoughts."
gemini,2012-06-16,"You can't stop the ideas from flowing now as your key planet Mercury aligns with overblown Jupiter. Your creative urges are bubbling yet your current actions might not lead to anything concrete. It's wise to write down your best thoughts before you forget them. However, you run the risk of wearing yourself down without much to show for your efforts. Since you are naturally inclined to scattering your energy rather than conserving it, take extra good care of yourself and plan a weekend of rest and relaxation."
cancer,2012-06-16,"You may try to hide behind a cool and calm exterior now that communicator Mercury is moving through your cautious sign. But Mercury's alignment with excessive Jupiter magnifies your emotions, tempting you to bury them even further. Play close attention to what you're leaving unsaid today, for suppressed feelings can create problems. Instead, find ways to express what's in your heart without being overly attached to the outcome."
leo,2012-06-16,"You are more inclined to working and playing as part of a larger group now that several planets are moving through your 11th House of Social Networking. However, your need to participate is a mixed blessing, since it's sometimes more difficult to express yourself when there are other people's feelings to consider, too. Luckily, this can actually be a pleasant and productive time if you can skillfully coordinate things between your own interests and the goals of the group."
virgo,2012-06-16,"You are growing more concerned with your long-term career objectives now than you are about getting your daily work done. You might even fall behind on your chores today if you're too preoccupied with thinking about the future. Expansive Jupiter's yearlong visit to your 10th House of Status will likely open doors for you, but you still must keep up with your regular routine. Taking care of business in the present moment is your best guarantee for long-term success."

Analytical Mercury aligns with visionary Jupiter in your 9th House of Adventure now, inviting you to step beyond your regular limits. However, if there's no travel on the horizon, then this journey can be played out completely within your mind by reading a book or watching a movie. Either way, you are being pushed into new places and new ways of viewing the world."
scorpio,2012-06-16,"Sometimes you are left feeling dissatisfied by what you find when you explore the mysteries of the universe. However, you're able to gain great comfort from what you learn now. Reading books about metaphysical topics is a rewarding endeavor, but might not have a long-lasting impact on your life as long as it remains an intellectual exercise. Add real meaning to your studies by starting or deepening a meditation practice. Additionally, trying a physical discipline such as yoga or tai chi could be a healthy outlet. You may be pleasantly surprised by the positive results."
sagittarius,2012-06-16,"Get your thoughts out in the open while you still have the opportunity to talk about them calmly. Often your need to express your point of view is stronger than your desire to compromise in a relationship. However, this tension can build to a breaking point if you don't engage in a healthy dialogue now. Even if you aren't sure exactly what to say, just jump in and explore your feelings out loud. Maintaining a flow of give and take in the discussion should lead to a peaceful resolution."
capricorn,2012-06-16,"It's important to take care of personal health and hygiene issues now that several planets are visiting your 6th House of Daily Routine.

You are learning new ways to be playful and may even find yourself spending more time with children or getting in touch with your creative nature. Your activities aren't as frivolous as they appear as long as you're developing your connection with your heart.
pisces,2012-06-16,"It's time to pull in your energy and be less assertive at work. In fact, you may find yourself doing more at home this weekend, staying within your own protective sphere. Luckily, you should be able to find many projects to keep you busy. However, you might eventually get a little stir-crazy, so remember that this is just a passing phase. Appreciate the downtime while it lasts."
aries,2012-06-17,"Although you may wish that you were somewhere else now, you can still inspire others to reach greater heights by simply using the words that come to you naturally. Creativity abounds as you consider various ways to express what's on your mind. However, it isn't enough to have an active imagination today, for your clever thoughts could fade back into the hazy dreams from where they came. Make a conscious effort to share your ideas without holding anything back."
taurus,2012-06-17,"You may feel uncomfortable now as you leave the certainty of recent decisions behind. Although you might have been sure about your choices just a few days ago, you could start to question everything as circumstances shift unexpectedly. Let go of your stubborn desire to be steadfast; acting in a more flexible manner enables you to successfully navigate through the changing landscape."
gemini,2012-06-17,"The Moon returns to your sign for her monthly visit to activate your attachment to your emotions. You are identifying more with your feelings now and they might pull you into confusing territory. Even if you know exactly what you want today, it's still stressful if you don't figure out how to reach your goals. Fortunately, your unfulfilled desires won't weigh you down for long. Focus on your destination and the path will reveal itself just in time."
cancer,2012-06-17,"Memories seem close to the surface, but you aren't quite as vulnerable today as you've been recently. Logic is your greatest ally now, helping you to understand the differences between the past and the present. It's essential to stay emotionally available, even if you're afraid. Keep your feelings out in the open and communicate your fears to someone you trust. The power of your emotions will diminish as they are brought into the light."
leo,2012-06-17,"It's annoying that you can't have everything that you want now, but your problems may vanish if you can fool yourself into believing that all is well. Denial will not bring happiness and ignorance shouldn't be mistaken for bliss. Do whatever is necessary to get the facts. Only after you know what's really going on will you be ready to make the best decision."
virgo,2012-06-17,"After a couple of days of solid thinking and practical actions, you may be ready to loosen your grip on the mundane world now. A whole new wave of information heading your way can change how you handle relationships. Even if it's somewhat out of character for you, just enjoy the images floating through your mind. No immediate action is required today; you never know what fantasy might plant a seed for future use."
libra,2012-06-17,"Although you may be feeling scattered today, you're still rather optimistic about your prospects. However, the problem is that you could be unclear as to which future you are working toward. Your imagination conjures up vivid thoughts, but your friends find it difficult to understand exactly what you are saying now. Let your dreams inspire you, but keep your message to others as simple as possible."
scorpio,2012-06-17,"Shallow conversations may be irritating to you because you know that there are more crucial subjects to discuss. Unfortunately, everyone else seems to be steering clear of the same real issues that you're attracted to -- and there's little you can do to change their minds today. Although you don't have to engage in meaningless conversations, the alternative may be dreaming alone for a while. Nevertheless, striking out on your own now isn't a smart idea. Be patient; your closest allies will catch up with you."
sagittarius,2012-06-17,"You are at a turning point in a relationship with four planets occupying your 7th House of Companions. Although you want to push your agenda forward, it still may take a week or so for the momentum to build up steam. Erratic flashes of doubt snap you out of your optimistic state of mind. Although these unexpected visions may be annoying at first, they won't last. Concentrate on your long-range plans and don't let the details pull you off track."
capricorn,2012-06-17,"You are still riding a recent wave of creativity, yet something significant has changed. You may feel less demanding of yourself and others today. Part of your current dilemma is that your new relaxed approach is your own choice, but it doesn't help you feel more comfortable. Trust your dreams now; messages from your subconscious can lead you back to what is ultimately meaningful."
aquarius,2012-06-17,"It's challenging to assert yourself today, even if you know exactly what you want. But instead of coming right out and saying what's on your mind, your current passive-aggressive style can temporarily turn you into a victim. Wake up; it's time for an attitude adjustment. Alleviate your fears by going over the facts with someone you trust."
pisces,2012-06-17,"Intellectual Mercury is sending good vibrations your way today, but you can easily misinterpret the message. You tend to see only the very best in everything now, so resist the urge to make life-changing relationship decisions. However, the discrepancy between your thoughts and your desires can bring up stressful memories from the past. Remember what you need to know and then bring yourself back to the present moment."
aries,2012-06-18,"Spending the day relaxing seems like a good idea, but your irrepressible restlessness makes this unlikely today. You bore quickly and your overactive thoughts can fuel an attraction to an emotionally charged situation or an intense debate. Be careful about creating unnecessary noise just because you want a bit of excitement or an excuse to escape. It's better to remain quiet now and contemplate the results of speaking your truth before saying something you cannot take back."
taurus,2012-06-18,"You might be in emotional distress today, finding it difficult to ask for what you want. Your thoughts seem to be buzzing around in never-ending circles as they continue to grow more intense. Controlling your impulses is your smartest strategy to keep things from unraveling now. Thankfully, there's no need to be overly concerned because your mood will likely shift midday, enabling you to settle down and accomplish your goals."
gemini,2012-06-18,"You are in your own element today with the Sun and the Moon flying through your airy sign. Although you might feel a bit of emotional pressure from a family member or close friend, it's not necessary to jump through a lot of hoops now trying to live up to anyone's expectations. Instead, imagine you are a kite, riding on the changeable breezes. Don't try too hard to resist the currents; fortunately, the winds will ultimately carry you along effortlessly to your destination."
cancer,2012-06-18,"Although you may want to be alone for a while, your day depends on how well you can get along with others. You might wish that you could escape into fantasies, but the real challenge today is to balance your dreams with what you must do in the real world. Once you accept the necessity of social interactions, you should be able to find the security you seek from within."
leo,2012-06-18,"Being optimistic is a blessing, but you can float off into dreamland today with no obvious way to come back down to earth. The danger is that a balloon filled with too much hot air can explode. You could set yourself up for disappointment if your expectations are overinflated. Thankfully, talking with your friends and associates can help you balance your perspective as long as you're willing to listen."
virgo,2012-06-18,"Worrying about doing the right thing at work turns up the stress level. Although concentration comes naturally to you, one emotional issue after another today distracts you from what needs to be done. Everything seems more urgent now, so try to maintain a sensible perspective. Cut back on unnecessary activities and say only what's necessary. It's wise to conserve your energy for later in the week when you will need it most."
libra,2012-06-18,"The mood-setting Moon lightens everything up for you while it's in whimsical Gemini, which, like Libra, is a thoughtful Air sign. Although you're eager to listen and learn, you might believe that you should also share everything you know. However, full disclosure isn't necessarily the best option today. Discretion is advised now, for there are some things better left unsaid."
scorpio,2012-06-18,You may be somewhat unsure of the very same people on whom you normally rely. It feels as if you're the only person these days who takes enough time to think everything through to its conclusion. You really aren't that difficult to please; it's just that you wish others would try a bit harder. Push gently as you interact with friends and associates because alienating them will not necessarily produce better results or make you feel any happier. Work with what you have instead of what you want.
sagittarius,2012-06-18,"Today's flighty Gemini Moon fans your inspirational Sagittarian fires. Your enthusiasm is growing, but problems might arise stemming from an information overload.

aquarius,2012-06-18,"You are eager to glide through even the most difficult of circumstances today since the smart Gemini Moon comfortably supports your logical and analytical bias.

Give yourself the benefit of any doubt. If something enjoyable comes along, grab the opportunity to pursue the good time you deserve."
pisces,2012-06-18,"It's a multiple choice kind of day because the dualistic Gemini Moon reveals a variety of paths that all seem to lead back home. Ultimately, you would like to balance your current curiosity with a desire to maintain the status quo; however, these two needs can lead you in very different directions. Actively explore your options and follow your impulses. Once you have exhausted the alternatives, it will be much easier to settle on a final course."
aries,2012-06-19,"There are so many things to do today that you cannot keep up with your own agenda. The busy Gemini New Moon falls in your 3rd House of Information, tempting you to fill your mind with data instead of seeking the deeper meaning of your experiences. You may feel preoccupied by all the external noise, while wishing that you had a chance to delve into the pleasures that you know are waiting for you somewhere. Be patient; your time will come."

However, nothing is preventing you from reconsidering where you go next. You can always change your mind along the way."
gemini,2012-06-19,"If you feel tangled up in your thoughts now, remember that curiosity is a perfectly natural Gemini trait and you may need to play out every possibility in your mind. The clever Gemini New Moon might have you obsessing about details you cannot possibly know. It's OK if you feel lost in your own mental maze; you're perfectly safe and exactly where you need to be today."
cancer,2012-06-19,"Your dreams serve a very important purpose and you would quickly lose interest in your future without their inspiration. You often anticipate better times ahead, but now the Gemini New Moon in your 12th House of Endings may have your fantasies working in reverse.

Don't try to bluff your way through the situation; be open to the lessons at hand."

scorpio,2012-06-19,"Be careful about complicating a delicate situation today as the noisy Gemini New Moon occupies your 8th House of Deep Sharing. Nevertheless, you are driven by an unquenchable desire to explain the unexplainable as you push toward getting what you want.

Today's fickle Gemini New Moon occupies your 4th House of Security, tempting you to fearfully hold on to your feelings. Ironically, your attachment to the past might destabilize the present. Instead of trying to maintain the status quo, consider what you can do to become an agent of change."
aries,2012-06-20,"Your chores have piled up, especially if you've been procrastinating lately. In fact, the stack may be so high that it could topple over. Carefully considered preventive measures can help save the day, but you must act with restraint. If you try to fix everything all at once by impulsively jumping in with both feet, your intervention might start an avalanche that brings it all down on top of you. A shortcut is certainly tempting, but a conservative approach works best now if you want to make real progress."
taurus,2012-06-20,"Intense interactions between you and your friends may pull you away from your regular routine as a minor disagreement turns into a serious conflict.

This is the stuff that intimacy is made of, yet you may be resistant to the feelings of vulnerability that accompany this dance. Nevertheless, it's time to go beyond words and sink into the mystery. Even if you long for the safety of logic, this emotional exploration could reveal previously buried treasure if you're willing to take the plunge."
capricorn,2012-06-20,"You're often focused on your work and how you can get ahead in the world, but now there is also a light shining on your interpersonal relationships as the Sun visits your 7th House of Companions.

It's just that it's time to complete unfinished chores, and playtime may get pushed down toward the bottom of your priorities.

Even if you have a busy day ahead of you, spending some time quietly amongst family and friends feels nourishing to your soul. Instead of only pursuing your ambitions today, find contentment in the peaceful safety of your own home. No matter how much you have to do, make time to nurture those you love."
gemini,2012-06-21,"You want to surround yourself with people who are just as busy as you are today, but it's also smart to schedule some time to be alone.

Others can see you as more lighthearted and charming than you actually feel today; in fact, you might not feel very optimistic at all.

The current planetary culprit is illusory Neptune, but, thankfully, real trouble is unlikely. Your day can be built on an unsubstantiated idea and proceed completely on the basis of your assumptions. Straighten out the wrinkles now before moving along or you might need to backtrack later on."
aries,2012-06-24,"Your normal routine at home has been altered by circumstances beyond your control. Something occurs today that requires you to focus your attention on eliminating a specific habit of yours. However, even your best intentions may not produce the desired results right away. It takes time to make changes that endure; allow the current events to ripple through your life and wait to see what happens before judging yourself too harshly."
taurus,2012-06-24,"Although you normally try to keep things simple, you're met with a few serious challenges along the way these days. For example, if you are involved in a group project now, your individual efforts could get lost in the crowd. Don't worry; this isn't time for personal recognition. Rest assured that your consistent efforts will pay off in the long run and you'll derive satisfaction from being part of a winning team."
gemini,2012-06-24,"A powerful shift of energy at home may be underway, but you might not feel the full effects of the current changes for a while. Even if everything is moving along smoothly, weird undercurrents are set into motion now by suppressed feelings. If you have something on your mind, it's better to say it today in order to prevent your frustration from building into a bigger problem. Clearing the air opens the door for better communications ahead."
cancer,2012-06-24,Too much data can be overwhelming today as you do your best to filter out unnecessary noise. You're able to minimize the flow of information if you stop asking more questions once you discover what you need to know. You can ease your mental stress while reducing your sense of overload by initiating action. Doing something positive now is much more constructive than just talking about it.
leo,2012-06-24,"Focus your attention on your finances today, for the simple act of balancing your checkbook goes a long way toward preventing future headaches. Thankfully, you have a heightened ability now to shut out extraneous distractions, enabling you to do the basic accounting that otherwise can make you crazy. Sort through the details, set your priorities and settle down to work."
virgo,2012-06-24,"Nothing sharpens your mind like necessity. Today's analytical Virgo Moon requires you to focus, especially if a minor crisis brings your attention right back the present moment. Conflict stems from a separation between your head and your heart, so don't bother trying to justify your feelings. Instead, state them as accurately as you can and then move on."
libra,2012-06-24,"Your dreams demand a lot of your attention today, and you might have to pinch yourself to wake up. Unfortunately, your external world isn't as compelling as usual, so you may let yourself slip back into the realms of imagination. Thankfully, this excursion is not a waste of time if you believe that you can be whatever you really desire. Choose your ideal future carefully, since you'll soon have the chance to turn your fantasies into reality."
scorpio,2012-06-24,"Your sixth sense is working overtime now, but you are challenged to trust whatever you're feeling. Others may question your values today, complicating what should be a simple decision. Modifying your position to agree with your friends can make your life easier in the present moment, but isn't wise in the long run. Follow your instincts based on what's in your heart, rather than acting on someone else's analysis."
sagittarius,2012-06-24,"You have a lot going on in your life today, including other people trying to convince you that their points of view are better than yours. Although each interaction might seem unrelated at first, the various situations reveal a common theme. Remain open to changing your approach as long as the end result still supports your objectives."
capricorn,2012-06-24,"You are feeling even more pragmatic than usual as you set the specific goals for a project you've been working on. Avoid getting trapped under too many details today, for you can become so obsessed with getting one particular task just right that you accomplish little else. Perfection is an ambitious ideal, but don't let it stand between you and success."
aquarius,2012-06-24,"It's tough to settle on any single path today because you're pulled in several different directions by people with extremely convincing arguments. If only the events in your life would remain stable while you figure out your best strategy. But everything continues to change, so you don't have time to idly sit around on the sidelines. Make a choice and jump back into the game."
pisces,2012-06-24,"Someone may be overly critical of you today, tempting you to walk away, but retreat really isn't in your best interest. Check your own emotional baggage to make sure you aren't being hypersensitive. Instead of displaying resistance, listen carefully to the feedback you are receiving. What you learn now can help you become more efficient at whatever you do."
aries,2012-06-25,"You might feel an uncomfortable distance between you and your co-workers. However, you may need additional personal space more than usual now. You have a magical opportunity to learn something significant about yourself if you make some time to be alone. You will return to your work emotionally recharged with more to offer to others."
taurus,2012-06-25,"It's difficult to focus on the present moment, for your dreams keep drawing you into the future, where everything seems better than it is now. Keep in mind that the more specific your current fantasies are, the more likely they will come true. Spending time to fill in the details today can be a significant step in turning an idle wish into a concrete plan."
gemini,2012-06-25,"You might not see things at work as clearly as you think, so proceed with caution if you're making a significant decision today. It's not that you're missing any important facts; it's just that your desires are influencing your perspective now and your future probably appears brighter than it is in reality. But don't surrender your dreams; pursuing them still changes your life for the better."
cancer,2012-06-25,"It can be overwhelming to make a long-term commitment, whether you're thinking about signing up for a new course of study or planning a journey of discovery. You may like your idealistic aspirations in theory, yet are worried that you will want an escape route if you get scared along the way. Instead of talking yourself out of taking a risk; find ways to amuse yourself, even while following through on achieving your lofty goals."
leo,2012-06-25,"Although you might feel an irresistible pull into mysterious dimensions today, your dreams hide just beyond the reach of your senses. Fantasies are like music wafting over the hills; the song sounds familiar and comforting, but you can't hear it clearly enough to know what it is. You could grow very frustrated by grasping for the satisfaction of learning the truth. Quit trying so hard; knowing that the magic is out there is enough."
virgo,2012-06-25,"Although you are motivated by others today, it takes the beauty of nature to uplift you. Even if you must spend your workday inside an office, factory or school -- away from the wonders of the wild -- you can still discover the magic wherever you are. But, instead of wandering aimlessly in your dreams, listen to the inspirational stories that are told by those around you. There is an important lesson to learn in the most unexpected places."
libra,2012-06-25,"Something unusual at work might give you the creeps today, as if you somehow walked on to the set of a bad science fiction movie. Thankfully, you're not frightened, since you don't sense any real danger, but you probably won't get much work done, either. Before you begin your regular tasks, you may need to investigate to see if you can uncover the source of the mystery. Enjoy playing detective without expecting anything fruitful to come of it right away."
scorpio,2012-06-25,"Love may be confusing now, especially if there is ambiguous communication that leaves you hanging in an awkward state of uncertainty. But it's difficult to tell if your current lack of clarity is based on what's actually happening or what you wish would happen. Either way, the solution is the same: go back to the original conversation and try again. This time through, however, you will know what to do if you listen more carefully to what is being said."
sagittarius,2012-06-25,"Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system and is known for bestowing optimism. Now, however, as it squares foggy Neptune, your positive attitude is so dispersed that you may feel as if you're invisible. It's challenging to get traction today, even if your plans are strategically sound. Ironically, it's currently better to spend your time dreaming than trying to make something concrete happen. You can make up for lost production time tomorrow."
capricorn,2012-06-25,"Normally, looking back over your life for hidden treasures enables you to better understand your ambitions in the present moment. But today, your personal history is obscured by your emotions, so you cannot get an accurate glimpse of what really occurred. However, symbolic interpretations of a particular memory can still be helpful now as long as you accept that this is about your current feelings rather than being a true reconstruction of your past."
aquarius,2012-06-25,"You may struggle with your self-esteem today as you start to question your motives. Even if you thought you knew what was most important, your current doubts wear down the thick armor surrounding your core beliefs. There's no reason to fear this process; just let the meltdown happen at its own pace. Once it's complete, you'll be able to quickly reinvent a newer and more relevant sense of purpose on a firmer foundation than before."
pisces,2012-06-25,"The ship that carries your favorite fantasies may arrive in your harbor today, but you might feel too tired to offload the precious cargo. You could experience an odd sensation, as if everything was moving in slow motion, yet the words and actions seem to be slightly out of sequence. Don't panic; the real treasures will not mysteriously vanish as your dream fades. You still have plenty of time to create your ideal reality once you are awake."
aries,2012-06-26,"You may be feeling less optimistic as you are pulled in two different directions today. On one hand, you know what you need and it's really not very complicated at all. However, reaching satisfaction isn't as simple as you wish because there is a conflict between your goals and what others want from you. Your happiness depends on your willingness to temporarily accept a variation of your dream. Being flexible enables everyone to be a valuable part of the team."
taurus,2012-06-26,"Your energy level may be low, leaving you somewhat discouraged today. The most sensible option is to just take it easy for a while. Don't spend your time worrying about things you cannot control, especially if you want to conserve your strength. Thankfully, your stamina will return soon enough; everything will look better once you get some much-needed rest."
gemini,2012-06-26,"Pay attention to how your emotions influence your creativity today. Your moods may fluctuate throughout the day, making it difficult to keep an even temper. Hold on to your dreams, even if you are a bit overwhelmed by all there is to do. Be realistic; don't start a project unless you can finish it. Optimize your energy by taking on only what you know you can handle."
cancer,2012-06-26,"You may be so sensitive now that you're picking up on everyone's emotions and you might even feel under the weather for no logical reason. But don't give in to negativity, for your current emotional turmoil isn't as bad as it might seem today. Above all, be honest; if you attempt to deceive anyone at all, your plan will probably backfire. Avoid long-term relationship complications by honoring the truth."
leo,2012-06-26,"Others see you as very outgoing now that motor-mouth Mercury is back in your loquacious sign. However, your confidence may have recently waned so you might not feel as upbeat as everyone thinks you are. Ironically, you can turn your day around by putting your fears out into the open. Your friends will jump in to lend a helping hand when they see that you don't have the answer to every question."
virgo,2012-06-26,"You feel as if you're being deluged with too much information now, yet you aren't sure which data is useful and which is not. Naturally, you prefer dealing only with solid facts, but your confusion makes it hard to push forward today. Instead of being driven by what's real, for once don't try to figure things out. The hazy uncertainty will dissipate on its own."
libra,2012-06-26,"You may be confused about the boundaries of love and romance today as your fantasies bump into someone else's reality. You're not so sure about your attractions now, as they wax and wane throughout the day. Don't worry if your needs seem to be too fleeting to sustain. Repressing your desires can lead to frustration. Instead, drift along with the prevailing emotional currents and enjoy the day, without unconsciously pushing your agenda on others."
scorpio,2012-06-26,"Although you can rationalize your way through a tricky dilemma, sound reasoning falls apart now just as the solution comes into sight. The problem is that you can't hold on to both sides of an issue at the same time. Practical reality appears to be pitted against your creative imagination today, but it's safe to follow your dreams. You will return to the real world just in time."
sagittarius,2012-06-26,"Images from your subconscious are flooding into awareness and it may be as bothersome today as it is enjoyable. If you feel like you're being pushed to do something that isn't your typical style, it may actually be arising from your subconscious. Anxiety could stem from your sense of confusion; the more you try to figure out what's happening, the farther away the answers seem. Don't take your lack of clarity too seriously, for it will pass soon enough."
capricorn,2012-06-26,"People usually lean on you because of your wealth of common sense and your overall reliability. Even though you often know what to do, you might not be so certain now. Your lack of confidence could lead you down the path of least resistance, which may not take you in your intended direction right away. Go ahead and waste some time, even if it feels counterproductive while you're doing it. What you discover along the way can ultimately be more important than reaching your original destination."
aquarius,2012-06-26,"You are eager to go to work today, but you may not know what's expected of you once you get there. Thankfully, this can be a highly creative day that is rich with adventure if you let go of the details for a while. It's your choice; you'll only open a door to unnecessary irritation if you refuse to relinquish any control. Paradoxically, letting someone else take charge for a while will ultimately put you back in the driver's seat."
pisces,2012-06-26,"Don't panic, even if you're unsure about your plans today, for your stress will likely make matters worse. You aren't completely in control of your immediate environment anyhow, so you may grow discouraged if you stick rigidly to your agenda. Trying to force a solution to an unresolved issue makes your frustration level skyrocket; instead, float with the uncertainty the best you can."
aries,2012-06-27,"Don't work harder today than is necessary or you could overdo it and exhaust yourself. The gentle Libra Moon means that grace counts more now than brute force, so let your senses be your guide. Flow with the emotional tides, instead of struggling against them. Creativity, rather than productivity, is the business of the day."
taurus,2012-06-27,"The socially astute Libra Moon's presence in your 6th House of Employment indicates that practicing diplomacy at work is essential now. Unfortunately, you don't have a lot of patience with anyone who seems impractical today. Ultimately, you must be as flexible as possible, for there are many approaches to accomplishing the same task. Getting along with others might be more important than meeting any quota or deadline."
gemini,2012-06-27,"You're juggling a number of contradictory desires today and may find it difficult to settle on any particular one. Although you're more capable than most when it comes to managing conflicting emotions, your interactions with others can still be confusing if you try to hide your feelings. There is no reason to keep secrets now; everyone will appreciate your honest approach."
cancer,2012-06-27,"You may prefer to stay home, especially with the Libra Moon activating your inner-directed 4th House today. But if you cannot justify taking the day off, try to make your environment feel a bit cozier. Wear comfortable clothes, pack your favorite lunch and add some personal touches around your workplace. Increasing the security factor wherever you are now allows you to take risks and move toward your goals with greater success."
leo,2012-06-27,"You have many stories to tell today and are eager to hear what others have to say, too. The Libra Moon is visiting your 3rd House of Communication, increasing the joy you feel when reading an email from a loved one, talking on the phone with a chatty friend or taking a short walk with a new acquaintance. However, the key to your current happiness is sharing the spotlight. Think of your life as a team sport in which everyone wins together now or no one wins at all."
virgo,2012-06-27,"Purchase something that makes you feel attractive now that the lovely Libra Moon is traveling through your 2nd House of Self-Worth. Or spend a little money to improve your image, because showing your best side enables you to feel good too. These actions may seem like superficial indulgences, but when you see yourself in a more flattering light, you're likely to be more confident on every level."
libra,2012-06-27,"The social Libra Moon reflects her gracious light on your relationships today, increasing your sensitivity to those you love. The good news is how simple it is for you to put people at ease because you take the time to understand their concerns. But be careful of becoming so sympathetic to everyone else's emotions that you lose sight of your own needs. Just make sure that you balance your compassion for others with love for yourself."
scorpio,2012-06-27,"Issues of trust may be over-dramatized today, especially if you believe that someone is trying to withhold information from you. There are those who have complete faith in you and are willing to share their deepest secrets. But others might talk about you behind your back and there isn't much you can do about it. Be sure to consider the source of what you learn now and spend your time with those who deserve your confidence."
sagittarius,2012-06-27,"You are usually happy to listen to your friends when they want to share their dreams with you, but too many people may want your attention now, making it difficult to get all of your work done. You could hear lots of ideas and promises today that aren't grounded in reality. Remember, it's not your job to shatter anyone's illusions; instead, you can help others focus on the practical elements worth pursuing. In fact, you can set a good example by finishing your chores first."
capricorn,2012-06-27,"It's challenging to lead a group of people today because others may not work hard enough to live up to your tough standards. Nevertheless, everyone seems overly sensitive and might require more attention than you are willing to give. Being as diplomatic as possible enables you to navigate your way through these tricky conditions. Thankfully, you can earn positive recognition for your patience if you get it right."
aquarius,2012-06-27,"You could be in your visionary mode because you have more ideas about the future now than information about the present moment. This is a great time to connect with other big thinkers and to share thoughts about how to create a better world. Your current goals may not be very practical, but they empower you to dream of the magical possibilities that inspire you and everyone else."
pisces,2012-06-27,"Being too concerned about what someone else is thinking can prevent you from saying what's on your mind today. But don't be afraid to shake up a cautious companion with the truth about your feelings. Your remarks won't end a conversation, but might actually be an honest entry point for a deeper and more productive discussion. The first step is always the hardest, but you can't go wrong if you speak from your heart."
aries,2012-06-28,"Relationships grow more complex now, which might set off alarms in your head. It's not your normal style to get lost in a drama, but today could prove to be an exception. Perhaps you believe that everything will improve, so you're willing to put in the work. Although your hunch may be correct, don't just wait for something to happen. Taking decisive action right away increases your chances of being happy."
taurus,2012-06-28,"Someone may turn on the charm today, but all that attention can get on your nerves when the no-nonsense Scorpio Moon moves into your 7th House of Partners. On the other hand, it won't hurt to take a look back at your past to see if you're  currently resisting emotional attachment because you were once misled. There's no better time to heal your trust issues than now."
gemini,2012-06-28,"Instead of completing all the chores that require your attention today, you might make a halfhearted attempt to rush through them so you can move on to other things. However, it's in your best interest to fulfill your obligations as soon as possible, even if you know you can tap dance your way around some of your responsibilities. You will have a better chance of partaking in the fun tomorrow if your schedule is clear and your conscience clean."
cancer,2012-06-28,"Although you might not feel very lighthearted, you still want to enjoy yourself today. However, it's challenging to let others know what you want because your emotions are running very deep. You're afraid of revealing too much once you start talking. If you take the time to formulate your thoughts, you can share what's on your mind without going to extremes. Play it safe to find contentment; but you may need to take a bit more of a risk for greater satisfaction."
leo,2012-06-28,"Your doubts about love may have more to do with past experiences than with what's currently happening. Much to your chagrin, skeletons that you've hidden in the closet could come out to dance in full view of everyone. Although you might rather keep some things private, sharing your vulnerability with someone you trust now can be the key to soothing an old wound."
virgo,2012-06-28,"You may be confused by your own thoughts today because they don't lead you to the right conclusions. Even using your well-honed logic doesn't work so well now; you start to make your point only to end up somewhere else. Thankfully, clarity of thought will return later in the day, so save your most important discussions for tomorrow when you're more confident in your message. In the meantime, get some routine chores out of the way so you can rest easy tonight."
libra,2012-06-28,"Having a detailed plan isn't enough for you to succeed now, even if you are quite capable of executing it efficiently. Don't toss out an idea too quickly just because it wasn't the result of analytical logic. Instead, be open to the guidance that you can receive from your dreams. Step back and check out the big picture; your path will reveal itself when you are looking at your life from a different angle."
scorpio,2012-06-28,"The Moon's monthly return to your sign isn't always the easiest time. After all, your emotions are already intense; you really don't need any additional drama now. Nevertheless, denying your feelings just allows them to fester and creates even more challenging situations later. Instead, observe your reactions to events with a healthy curiosity and plenty of amusement. Laughter is your best medicine, and humor can disperse the buried tensions that bubble into your awareness."
sagittarius,2012-06-28,"You have some resistance to sinking into the shadows of your thoughts, because you usually prefer to take a sunny philosophical approach to life. Now, however, it may be more advantageous to slip quietly into the darkness, knowing that words won't adequately describe all that occurs. Even if daydreaming leads you to unpleasant memories, they will pass. Remember, this exploration is about psychological and spiritual growth, so imagine that you're setting off on an exciting journey of discovery."
capricorn,2012-06-28,"It's hard to understand the motives of your friends today since their intensity belies their hidden agendas. But perhaps, it is your straightforward approach and ambitious goals that prompt others to push your buttons. Instead of attempting to discover why others are treating you differently now, concentrate on what they are trying to tell you. You might just learn something important about yourself."
aquarius,2012-06-28,"Dynamic tension is building to a breaking point as your worries create more stress. It's a challenge to break out of this vicious cycle since your concerns aren't put to rest by rational analysis now. Let your thoughts run free today, but don't put too much stock in what you know if you cannot also feel it in your gut. Following your instincts can reveal a practical escape route."
pisces,2012-06-28,"Your long-term goals might overwhelm your agenda for the day as you attempt to make a break for the future. But the present also needs your attention, so refocus on current events now before you go wandering off into your dreams. Luckily, your due diligence may be rewarded tomorrow with an opportunity to solidify your vision. Taking care of what's right in front of you makes room for something new."
aries,2012-06-29,"You're not afraid to state your position today, even if it means you're left on your own. In fact, you gain a strange sort of pleasure when you stand alone. It's not that you like fighting losing battles; it's just that you're attracted to the adrenaline rush you get from feeling independent. Fortunately, you can enjoy the thrill of being alive without starting a war of words. Find a worthy opponent and then surprise everyone by establishing common ground."
taurus,2012-06-29,"Your words may not convey exactly what you're feeling today, even if you think that others are getting your message. Yet this positive attitude might also prevent you from seeing things as they actually are now. Facing reality head-on may temporarily diminish your sense of well-being, but discovering the truth is better than fearing the unknown. You might be unexpectedly pleased with what you learn, and your self-esteem can grow in the process."
gemini,2012-06-29,"You may think that everything will improve if you say what's on your mind today. But communicator Mercury's supportive sextile to optimistic Jupiter isn't enough to guarantee a positive outcome because you're not in control of other people's reactions. Instead of trying to convince anyone that your point of view is best, simply acknowledge the differences of perspective and move on. A confrontation won't solve anything now; wait until the energy settles down before striving for resolution."
cancer,2012-06-29,"It may seem as if you must take direct action on your new plan now, but your ideas are probably at odds with everyone else's. Nevertheless, you think that your opportunity will be lost if you don't do something right away. You might talk yourself into retreating back into the security of your shell because feeling so vulnerable makes you nervous. Trust your intuition; protect what is yours without letting irrational fears influence your choice."
leo,2012-06-29,"Examining your feelings could reveal signs of unexpressed anger, although you may do your best to avoid confronting these negative emotions today. Those close to you might not be aware of your turmoil since you could easily disguise your inner process by wearing a happy face. However, unresolved tensions suddenly resurface if someone tries to manipulate you. Express your hurt or disappointment with kindness to avoid any unnecessary conflict."
virgo,2012-06-29,"Your key planet Mercury offers to save your day by putting a positive spin on everything. Nevertheless, the trickster planet is no match for the truth. It's challenging to stand up to a powerful person, yet you may surprise yourself now with what you say in order to defend your position. Don't try to stick to your plan because the unexpected twists and turns will require you to set aside your previous agenda anyhow. Flexibility is your secret weapon in today's encounter with change."
libra,2012-06-29,"It's currently difficult to distinguish between what is public and what is private in your life. You may be quite passionate about an idea, yet still shy away from conflict. If you do get into an argument, avoid making statements about your own personal beliefs or habits that are better kept to yourself. Too much information could escalate a civil discussion into an unwinnable debate. It is better now to err on the side of saying less, so politely make your point and then let everyone else think it over."
scorpio,2012-06-29,"Your intense passions are aroused as the Sun opposes your key planet Pluto, while Uranus adds instability to any situation. You might quickly work yourself into a state of agitation if something goes wrong, but expressing your extreme feelings is not a simple matter. Unfortunately, denial won't work either. The way out of this delicate situation is simply to accept multiple points of view could be right. Yours is not the only solution, even if that's how it seems at first."
sagittarius,2012-06-29,"If you try to play the role of a wise philosopher today, you might end up precipitating an emotional meltdown. Assuming a holier-than-thou spiritual position could just be another way to avoid your feelings. Paradoxically, you'll feel better now if you can get out of your head long enough to express what's in your heart. Oddly enough, those around you will breathe a sigh of relief too, especially if they're tired of you pretending like everything is OK. Allowing others to see your weak spot isn't as scary as you think."
capricorn,2012-06-29,"Issues brought into the light now are beyond your control. However, you may be amazed by what happens if you have enough faith in the process to loosen your grip on the steering wheel. You will ultimately have the final say in the matter, even if it seems unlikely at the beginning. Thankfully, you have an excellent chance to restore your power while also making tangible progress toward your goals."
aquarius,2012-06-29,"You might come up with a new way to say the same old thing today, but this isn't just some kind of parlor trick. Don't minimize your efforts to communicate now, especially if you have been trying to convey an important yet complex message for a while. Even if you weren't getting through previously, your persistence could finally pay off; your unique approach allows others to hear you clearly."
pisces,2012-06-29,"Take a fresh look at where you find pleasure in your life. Even if you don't have time for relaxation today, schedule a few enjoyable activities for over the weekend. Don't let others place a guilt trip on you. Do everything you can to meet your obligations now and no one will have a valid reason to stand in your way. Although you have plenty of work in front of you, squeezing in some fun brings a healthy balance to your life."
aries,2012-06-30,"Although you have a plan ready to put into play, an uncomfortable feeling in the pit of your stomach today has you wishing that you responded differently to a recent situation. Reviewing past actions now is healthy for you Rams who don't often make time for self-reflection. Admit your mistakes before moving on, but don't linger over them. Look back only to gain perspective prior to looking ahead."
taurus,2012-06-30,"People seem very intense today, making it tougher to maintain your cool. Although you often act as an anchor for others, your apparent steadiness hides your current angst. Tempering your feelings with common sense is a smart strategy, but your desire to be practical can interfere with your natural expression of the truth. Thankfully, sharing your concerns with someone you trust could prevent a meltdown later in the day. Knowing when to ask for help is a sign of strength."
gemini,2012-06-30,"You are usually eager to engage nearly anyone in conversation, but you might consider withdrawing today if a discussion becomes too heated. You may be caught in the middle of an emotional struggle that grows more complicated as the day wears on. It's healthier to face conflict directly now than to let the tension simmer, but you don't need to take a side. Respecting differences of opinion can be enough to alleviate the discord."
cancer,2012-06-30,"Anxiety may be difficult to avoid because there is so much up in the air right now. You might discover that even the most well thought-out plans still need revision to adapt them to unexpected changes. But making minor modifications is trickier than just scrapping your previous idea and starting all over again. Instead, take radical action for the best shot at success."
leo,2012-06-30,"You thought you knew what was in your heart and that you were in control of your life. However, something might happen today that catches you completely off guard. It isn't a smart idea to pretend that you are in charge of your feelings when you're not. Let your changing moods take you for an exciting ride now; the journey could be very exhilarating as long as you don't fight against the prevailing currents."
virgo,2012-06-30,"You long to take a break in your struggle to hold on to recent gains while still embracing the future. Inevitable change is knocking at your door, but just as you decide that it's OK to invite it in, something happens that makes you question your assumptions. Don't be attached to your expectations. Instead, be ready to receive an unexpected gift and the opportunity it offers."
libra,2012-06-30,You are eager to respond to someone's call for emotional support today because you have something very special to give. But a friend might not want you to become so involved at this time. Don't worry about what motivates others to demonstrate their independence. You have plenty to accomplish on your own without wondering why your assistance wasn't needed. Get busy with your work without wasting any more time.
scorpio,2012-06-30,"Keep your heart open to the upcoming changes or your life could become very complicated. Even if current events aren't unfolding according to your expectations, they can still work out in your favor if you let go of some control. You may run into problems if you overextend your authority now. Thankfully, sharing responsibilities gives you more time to explore your personal needs, too."
sagittarius,2012-06-30,"Your romantic life is chock full of unexpected twists and turns now that unruly Uranus in your 5th House of Love is so active. Creative sparks are flying as tensions are released. Luckily, you're ready for the excitement, but any attempts to avoid honest emotional expression could quickly turn things sour. You can't get away with any kind of deception, so speak the truth and walk your talk, even if you end up ruffling some feathers in the process."
capricorn,2012-06-30,"Your lack of flexibility invites unexpected disruptions from others today. You need to shift gears to place yourself in the present moment if you have been holding on to the past. Fortunately, you can significantly reduce your anxiety by shaking things up yourself, instead of waiting for something big to happen. For now, it's smarter to be the lightning instead of attracting it from others."
aquarius,2012-06-30,"Your key planet Uranus prompts you to defy the rules today, upsetting the status quo. Interactions with friends can be unstable, especially if you have differing perspectives about what to do next. They may see you as the disruptive force of the group, even if you don't feel that way. Nevertheless, your smartest strategy now is to pull everyone's ideas out into the open, without expecting a final decision. You don't need to create an arbitrary deadline; resolution will come in its own time."
pisces,2012-06-30,"Your role in a relationship is shifting, even if you think that things are acceptable as they are. Nevertheless, it's wise to embrace change now, for it brings you the personal freedom you desire. Clinging to what you know makes the inevitable even more painful. Be courageous and let go of old expectations; reclaiming your individuality doesn't preclude cultivating a connection with someone you admire."
aries,2012-07-01,"You're quite optimistic today as the uplifting Sagittarius Moon visits your 9th House of Big Ideas. But it's tough to keep your visions in perspective when your fantasies loom so large. Although your desires are strong, your sense of urgency is dissipating. There's no reason to push too hard now, so take time to enjoy your day. Paradoxically, slowing down can help you get what you need even faster."
taurus,2012-07-01,"You may have recently been involved in an intense negotiation or even a conflict, yet others probably don't even realize that you were struggling. You might still be worrying about the final outcome as the situation continues to develop. Instead of keeping your concerns to yourself, bring any lingering fears out into the open and convert your secrets into positive action. Your actions will be more successful if everyone knows what's going on."
gemini,2012-07-01,"You are eager to meet new people and participate in nearly any activity that sounds exciting today. However, it's too easy to get carried away in the moment by someone else's idea of a good time. Make your highest aspirations your guiding light and you can figure out what you need to do next. Following your intuition now will lead you along the right path."
cancer,2012-07-01,"Improving your lifestyle by creating a balance between your personal needs and your obligations to others seems difficult now. The Moon's visit to your 6th House of Healthy Living makes it crucial to stick to your workout regimen today. If you haven't been exercising, this is a perfect time to start a new program. Managing your time wisely will give you the opportunity to take care of yourself and finish your work, too."
leo,2012-07-01,"Your thoughts may be on love today as the Moon in your 5th House of Fun harmonizes with mischievous Mercury and irrepressible Uranus. However, an austere Venus-Saturn connection could put the brakes on any flirting. Consider the consequences before behaving impulsively. If you are playing according to the rules and acting with integrity, then there won't be any problem following your heart's desire."
virgo,2012-07-01,"The planetary pressures continue to tug at your heart, while you swim into deeper emotional waters. Although you may feel overwhelmed, you might just satisfy a few of your curiosities about the mysteries of life, love and loss. Even if there's a lot at stake, remember that you have more to gain than lose. Be courageous; fear is the only thing that can get in the way of your current explorations."
libra,2012-07-01,"You are so sweet and gentle that you can lose yourself in the relationships that give meaning to your life. However, let your partner know what you really are feeling now. Although there's no reason to go overboard, it's best to come right out and express your needs today. If you remain silent about what you want, others won't know what to give you. It may be difficult to get the ball rolling, but it should get easier once the conversation is moving along."
scorpio,2012-07-01,"Stay on your toes today, because interactions with personal and professional partners can get quite entangled. Everyone seems to be pushing your buttons now, even if you're trying to stay cool and collected. Take time to consider your role in creating the situation and what you want from it. Trust yourself, and don't let anyone talk you into something that goes against your beliefs."
sagittarius,2012-07-01,"Your idealism is magnified as the Moon flies through your sign. You feel energized as you attempt to live your life fully in each moment. You may even be more emotional today, prompting you to demonstrate your feelings through flirtatious behavior or romantic play. Luck is on your side now as long as you use it wisely. But if you rely strictly on your charm to get what you want, you'll quickly be required to come up with the facts to back up your story."
capricorn,2012-07-01,"Your inner world is expanding these days, enabling you to become more aware of your feelings. This might be an important evolutionary step forward, helping you to relax the hold that self-imposed rules have on you. An overdose of ambition isn't healthy now; however, staying in touch with your heart also holds the key to your future. Positive changes are already churning the stagnant waters of your mind."
aquarius,2012-07-01,"The social aspects of love can pull you into a whirlwind of activity today with the aspirational Sagittarius Moon traveling through your 11th House of Friends, Hopes and Wishes. Fortunately, you are up for the adventure, as you want the chance to talk to others about your plans. Any thoughts you might have now about a major trip should be taken seriously. Nevertheless, it's still wise to explore as many possibilities as you can."
pisces,2012-07-01,"You think that you can take it easy today, but the cosmos may have a different plan as you are pulled all over the map by your moods. Others play important roles in your life and it could be their needs, rather than yours, that make your world feel very hectic now. No matter what else is happening, fulfill your obligations, even while further cultivating your dreams."
aries,2012-07-02,"You are feeling a strong urge for something that goes beyond your daily routine today. You're seeking more than recognition and acknowledgment now, and you need to know that your work has meaning. Nevertheless, you're not prepared to give up the stability that your job provides. Fortunately, there's no reason to make any changes, even if you are a bit frustrated. Keep your thoughts to yourself for now; it will be time to make your move soon enough."
taurus,2012-07-02,"Intense excitement sustained over several days begins to wear on your nerves. However, you're not ready yet to settle down and restore tranquility to your life. Although rest and relaxation usually sound like a good idea to you bucolic Bulls, you won't get a chance to kick back today. In the meantime, create small pockets of peace and quiet so you can recharge your batteries little by little throughout the day."
gemini,2012-07-02,"You would like to take the day off, but it's hard to shake the feeling that you should be doing something significant today. You might cover your concern with a cheerful attitude, but you won't likely have the patience to hide your true ambitions for long. Nevertheless, searching for the meaning of life is a long-term commitment, so don't expect to have an epiphany right away. Thankfully, if you're sincere about your goals, the fun times will return sooner than you think."
cancer,2012-07-02,"You don't want anyone to talk you out of your point of view today, even if you realize that compromise is ultimately a smarter strategy. Your resistance may be motivated by your fear of giving up control if you don't trust someone else. Thankfully, you grow more amenable to someone else's perspective this evening, once the Moon enters your 7th House of Others. Listening carefully throughout the day helps you find a path that values everyone's unique individuality, including your own."
leo,2012-07-02,"You may be more talkative with Mercury in your sign, but it's harder to make your words hit the target today. It feels as if everything you say is slightly out of focus, and trying harder doesn't seem to sharpen your message. Instead of narrowing your vision to gain clarity, try looking at your world through a wide-angle lens. Let the details fall to the wayside and concentrate on the bigger picture. A more philosophical approach ultimately gives you a healthier perspective."
virgo,2012-07-02,"Although other people might wish that you were more optimistic and outgoing, you aren't responsible for their discomfort. If you feel reclusive today, simply inform those closest to you and ask them to honor your desire to be alone. However, it's smarter now to keep one foot in reality even if the other one wants to escape. You will have more options if you walk between the inner and outer worlds instead of shutting off one in favor of the other."
libra,2012-07-02,"You have big plans about what you want to accomplish today, yet it might be difficult to actually get much done. You're hesitant to stir up any trouble by speaking your piece because your ideas are so revolutionary that you're afraid no one will take you seriously. Instead of trying to convince others that you are on to something significant, just reveal what you're up to as casually as possible. Downplaying your thoughts for another day or two strengthens your overall message."
scorpio,2012-07-02,"You're not one to avoid conflict if it's about your survival, prompting you to contemplate what's worth fighting for and what's not. You may unconsciously set up a situation today where you're at odds with someone else so you can better your position. However, it's smarter now to consciously choose compromise over confrontation in order to keep the peace."
sagittarius,2012-07-02,"Financial concerns, possibly involving a partner who spends more than you do, can put the brakes on the vacation you have been envisioning. But even if you're having second thoughts today, don't make any major changes to your plans yet. Hold on to your dream, for your positive attitude will help it to manifest. If you cancel now, you are quite likely to regret it next week. Take a deep breath and wait out the storm before running off to find shelter."
capricorn,2012-07-02,"You may need to pay more attention to your feelings now or you could inadvertently stir up unnecessary drama this evening when the Moon moves into goal-oriented Capricorn. Stay emotionally flexible and listen carefully to your inner voice of intuition. Luckily, your sixth sense will steer you right unless you decide to override it with calculated logic. Connect with your heart and not with your head."
aquarius,2012-07-02,"Your subconscious mind is trying to tell you something you really need to hear today, but it's easier not to listen. If you doubt yourself, you may attempt to convince others of your worth by driving yourself too hard, only to end up overcommitted and overextended. There is plenty happening all around you; create healthy boundaries so you don't lose focus. Begin by trusting your instincts, especially if you need to say no."
pisces,2012-07-02,"You're intent on making a good impression with your work today. However, finishing your chores on time won't help you figure out where you're heading. Spend time with friends who will give you the reality check you need. It's not that you're lost and confused; you just have a lot on your plate and could use an objective point of view as you set priorities for the weeks ahead."
aries,2012-07-03,"Today's Capricorn Full Moon brightens your 10th House of Profession, yet your heart may be drawn toward your family life. The dilemma arises from different strategies on how to best manage changes at work. On one hand, you are ready to fully engage and do whatever must be done. However, you also want to retreat into the safety of your personal world. Give yourself a few more days until the dust settles before making any long-lasting decisions."
taurus,2012-07-03,"The practical Capricorn Full Moon emphasizes your 9th House of Big Ideas, stressing your plans for the future. Although you may already know what you want to do, insecurities kick in, causing you to doubt yourself -- even if you are aware of the obstacles in your way. This isn't necessarily about real blockages; it's more about what you need to do to overcome your self-doubt. There's no reason for immediate change. But even while you stick to your current agenda, keep an open mind about what to do next."
gemini,2012-07-03,"Exercising self-control still won't prevent your feelings from affecting your thoughts now that the Capricorn Full Moon is illuminating your 8th House of Intimacy. Your thinking is not as logical as you prefer, but your emotions are telling you something important about your relationship with someone you love. You are tempted to ignore your inner voice and follow the path of common sense, instead. It may be a stretch but trust your intuition, regardless of your fear of being irrational."
cancer,2012-07-03,"The earthy Capricorn Full Moon pulls directly opposite the watery Cancer Sun, stirring tidal forces from the depths of your hidden subconscious. Your unspoken needs come precariously close to the shores of awareness, impacting your everyday life. Use your imagination to find balance; create a safe harbor for yourself and your loved ones where you can share your dreams and fears without worry. Instead of isolating yourself, spend time with those who will support you through times of change."
leo,2012-07-03,"Current responsibilities may prevent you from diving into the warm and nurturing backwaters of your own fantasies. However, others don't realize how deep and wide your imagination is, for you are not sharing everything that you feel now. The Capricorn Full Moon activates your 6th House of Habits, encouraging you to stick to your daily routine as much as possible. Just don't get so caught up in what you're doing that you forget to honor your unexpressed dreams, too."
virgo,2012-07-03,"Today's goal-oriented Capricorn Full Moon occurs in your 5th House of Self-Expression, requiring you to exercise good judgment and self-restraint if you want to reach your desired destination. Holding back your feelings isn't anything new to you since you understand the impracticality of emotions. Share what's on your mind, but taking a conservative approach is the most effective strategy now. Others are more willing to listen if they feel that their ideas are acknowledged and appreciated just as much as yours."
libra,2012-07-03,"The serious Capricorn Full Moon falls in your 4th House of Home and Family, possibly overwhelming you with domestic responsibilities. Yet superhero Mars enters your harmonizing sign today, reminding you that you cannot do everything all at once. Instead of fretting over deadlines, simply concentrate on the present moment. When the emotional currents settle down over the days ahead, you'll be thankful for what you actually accomplished, as will everyone who depends on you."
scorpio,2012-07-03,"Love grows complicated when you take an all-or-nothing approach to your needs. It's a challenge for you to stay comfortable in the middle of the emotional spectrum. However, the calculating Capricorn Full Moon falls in your 3rd House of Communication, encouraging you to consider the consequences of your message before telling a loved one what's on your mind. A healthy balance between expression and restraint can put you on the path to relationship success."
sagittarius,2012-07-03,"Today's responsible Capricorn Moon lights up your 2nd House of Personal Resources and you might be concerned if you don't see a way to balance your income with your expenditures. It's challenging to separate your financial worries from deeper issues about self-worth. Rather than focusing your attention on what's missing in your life, concentrate on the positive things, instead. Counting your blessings is a smart way to raise your self-esteem and also, possibly, your bottom line."
capricorn,2012-07-03,This cautious Capricorn Full Moon can test your strength as you ride powerful emotional waves. It's both challenging and invigorating to balance your strong feelings with the necessities of the outer world. The distinction between your dreams and reality is more apparent to you than ever before. But don't fight the strong currents; there's more to gain by just putting yourself in the middle and enjoying the ride. The intensity will settle back down over the days ahead.
aquarius,2012-07-03,"You are eagerly anticipating indulging in some personal time as today's Capricorn Full Moon shines in your 12th House of Escape, even if current obligations still require you to follow your regular routine. But don't get too worked up trying to finish everything now. Just do what you can, while allowing time for short breaks throughout the day. Enjoy the distractions; you will return to your chores feeling refreshed and reinvigorated. Finding the right balance between responsibility and recreation is the trick."
pisces,2012-07-03,"Although you might feel as if you're stretched to the max, you also recognize that you need to take time to recharge your batteries. The steady Capricorn Moon energizes your 11th House of Social Networking, giving you the opportunity to spend time with friends and relatives. Your current tendency is to be critical of yourself, which could drain your energy instead of increasing it. So, above all, cut yourself some slack, chill out and enjoy the camaraderie while you can."
aries,2012-07-04,"It feels as if new information is bombarding you from multiple directions today, encouraging you to change your mind. However, what you learn now doesn't necessarily arrive through normal communication channels. It's as if you have been offered a direct pipeline to the center of the cosmos, but the truth is that it's really coming from your own imagination. Write down your dreams, for they can tell you exactly what you need to know."
taurus,2012-07-04,"Your current attempts at taking it easy are shattered as friends shock you into a new frame of reference. Normally, you're resistant to this type of sudden change, but now your mind races ahead eagerly to integrate the exciting ideas. Make the most of your newly found intellectual freedom while you are still riding high from the adrenaline rush."
gemini,2012-07-04,"Sudden changes in your career can bring unexpected fluctuations to your financial condition in the form of an unexpected windfall or an unplanned expenditure. Remember, you are likely to react impulsively as your mind makes quantum leaps, so don't assume that your edgy thinking is without flaws. Reconsider large purchases before you buy something you may later regret."
cancer,2012-07-04,"Your emotional sensitivity is strong now as other people insist that you do things in a specific manner. You may have a different idea, yet it's hard to put your feelings into words. Meanwhile, others may think that you're holding back a big secret because you appear a bit nervous, but don't buy into their insecurities. Let your own emotions be your guide and not the fears of others."
leo,2012-07-04,"Your thoughts can tug you into strange and unfamiliar waters today, and you must travel alone on this short journey of the soul. You may be working on the solution to a particular problem, yet now you are poised to make a larger intellectual breakthrough. Nevertheless, don't push your thoughts onto everyone else; you can share your ideas with your friends when you return."
virgo,2012-07-04,"Clever Mercury, your key planet, receives a brilliant electric shock from Uranus the Awakener today, brightening your dreams and bringing your nervous system into the present moment. Your interactions with everyone else may be precise, but don't think that you know where each conversation will take you. Remain flexible and your willingness to change will teach you much about yourself and your world."
libra,2012-07-04,"Be outrageously original and as unconventional as possible instead of trying to please everyone today. Your creativity is running strong now as your key planet Venus is zapped by the high voltage of Uranus. Breaking out of expected behaviors can actually strengthen your hand, so be experimental, even a bit rebellious, as you move outside your normal boundaries."
scorpio,2012-07-04,"It feels as if you're watching short movie trailers of your future possibilities, and it may not be quite what you were expecting. Don't worry; these fantasies don't necessarily reveal your fate. Rather, they're your way to rebel against the status quo. There may be ideas worth pursuing that get lost in the sheer volume of original thoughts sparking through your brain. If something makes sense, write it down quickly so it doesn't get lost in the noise."
sagittarius,2012-07-04,"Your initial reaction to grow and evolve may be a reflection of your need to control something that is beyond your sphere of influence. Thankfully, you can see that things are shifting for good reason. Unfortunately, you may not be ready to jump on the next opportunity that comes along. Luckily, tensions will release once you accept the new direction you are required to take."
capricorn,2012-07-04,"Normally you try to build your reality on stable foundations, yet trouble develops if you become overly rigid. Today's lessons can help you learn how much you need to loosen up, especially as you deal with other people's feelings. Fear of change will likely work against you, so practice flexibility as you stretch and bend in the face of emotional transformation."
aquarius,2012-07-04,"Your key planet, eccentric Uranus, receives a power boost today from an inflow of useful information as intelligent Mercury harmonizes with it. Additionally sweet Venus brings her charm to the party and spices up any gathering. Nevertheless, you placed yourself in a data-rich environment, so make maximum use of what you know by stepping outside of the box. Be original while incorporating radical ideas into the flow of events."
pisces,2012-07-04,"You have a bit of magic at your disposal today. You can share your emotional spontaneity by communicating the feelings in your heart, but it won't work if you take too much time searching for the right words. Instead, just reach out in a new and exciting way, for your well-intentioned overtures might be just what's needed. There's no need to rationalize your desire to establish a deeper connection with a friend."
aries,2012-07-05,"You are relieved today by the feeling that the potential for positive change outweighs your fear of the unknown. Your focus has shifted from the past to the future, but even if you're eager for what's next, you still don't know what to expect. Events are unfolding rapidly and it seems as if you must respond to them immediately. However, you have more time than you realize, so give yourself permission to experience the excitement without trying to figure out everything right away."
taurus,2012-07-05,"Your inability to describe what's going on in your life now makes you feel anxious. It's just that you believe you would feel better if you knew where current events were leading. However, you have a wonderful opportunity to envision your ideal world, without the pressure of having to make your dreams come true today. Set aside your most concrete goals for a few days and let your imagination guide you into your future."
gemini,2012-07-05,"It's as if you're standing on top of a hill today, enabling you to see farther into the distance. However, you might not have an accurate perception of reality now. Instead, your inner world is projected onto your surroundings, prompting you to imagine a variety of possible scenarios before making your choice. Make certain to look into the shadows, for trouble will surface later on if you gloss over the rough spots. Explore the possibilities, and then head in the direction of your chosen future."
cancer,2012-07-05,"It is challenging today to coordinate your natural desire for emotional security with your current career goals. You may need to risk your apparent safety to make progress at work. But feeling vulnerable isn't as frightening as the thought of losing a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Even if everything doesn't turn out as rosy as you wish, you won't be able to forgive yourself if you don't give it your best shot now."
leo,2012-07-05,"Your network of friends and colleagues is changing now, and letting go of your old connections isn't as difficult as you expect. A recent acquaintance may reflect your current interests better than an old one. Instead of trying to hold on to your past, embrace the exciting relationship potential that's heading your way."
virgo,2012-07-05,"You might feel awkward today as you grow excited about an innovative idea and lose track of your feelings. Emotional detachment can help you think more clearly, but over-intellectualizing a decision also separates you from your heart. Pay attention to the facts, but don't forget to delve deeper and discover what you really want."
libra,2012-07-05,"You're in a playful mood today with the intelligent Aquarius Moon's presence in your creative 5th house. Luckily, you are not restrained now by the same weighty issues that have recently been on your mind. Enjoy your newly found freedom and explore different ways to express yourself. Keep in mind that you still need to be a bit cautious or you'll end up wasting time on an unrealistic idea that leads you in circles."
scorpio,2012-07-05,"You may be seeking ways to smooth out your responsibilities on the home front because your freedom is more important to you now than ever before. It's not that you're eager to walk out on your obligations; it's just that you don't want anyone to assume that you'll always show up on demand. Thankfully, you're able to express your needs today without triggering any awkward feelings. Stating your boundaries clearly is necessary if you want others to respect them."
sagittarius,2012-07-05,"The Aquarius Moon harmonizes with your key planet Jupiter today, expanding your 7th House of Others. Relationship issues that have been stewing for weeks reach a crucial point now, requiring you to take a stand. Thankfully, you're able to see the positive side of a difficult situation. Remember, your attitude is more crucial than any choice you think you must make, so don't diminish your power by feeding it fantasies of self-doubt."
capricorn,2012-07-05,"Your unwavering belief in a positive outcome goes a long way now to attracting people that truly care about you. Your cheerful attitude has more influence than you realize, making it difficult for anyone to harbor negativity in your presence. But don't take your optimism too far or others could lose faith in your ability to make sensible judgments. Thankfully, you can be confident without going into denial."
aquarius,2012-07-05,"The Moon's visit to your sign gives you clarity and inspires you to express your feelings. You're not seeking approval now; you only want acknowledgment and respect. Fortunately, there's no need to stress over someone's possible reaction to what you say, for subsequent events won't affect the truth of your words. Be genuine and you will be accepted for exactly who you are by those who matter most."
pisces,2012-07-05,"You may feel as if your dreams are slipping away today, but happily the possibility of turning them into reality is growing. Still, you might indulge yourself with one more meandering trip through your favorite fantasies now before you release them. Remember, this isn't about letting go of your hopes; it's about using your visions to create the future."
aries,2012-07-06,"Your life may be more complicated than it appears now, yet you don't want anyone to see how much you are keeping to yourself. It's easier to be socially engaged if you downplay your unorthodox interests. Restraining your impulsive behavior is wise because your need for independence clashes with your current desire to build lasting relationships. Remember, there's no reason to share all your thoughts and fantasies with anyone else unless that's what you really want to do."
taurus,2012-07-06,"You have an uncanny sense about the right thing to do in a relationship today. Unfortunately, choosing the responsible path over a more playful one may not be a lot of fun, but you can still feel good about acting in a self-disciplined manner. Being practical is not flashy, but it enables you to prepare for the future, which ultimately can bring you an enduring satisfaction."
gemini,2012-07-06,"Even the strongest dose of common sense may not be sufficient to keep you on task today because you are so easily distracted by the light of your own brilliance. However, shiny objects aren't as enticing as great ideas now, so it's hard to be motivated simply by the temptation of more money. Thankfully, a unique approach to your current job might enable you to make a long-awaited breakthrough. Keep refocusing on your goals if you want to achieve success."
cancer,2012-07-06,"It's difficult to express your feelings today. If you find yourself in a deep discussion with a powerful person, your fear of rejection might tempt you to withdraw to protect your security. But even if you face the resistance, your words might not flow easily now because your emotions are still in flux. Be patient, it becomes more natural to speak your mind once your changing moods begin to settle down. Take time to listen to your heart."
leo,2012-07-06,"Your expectations are very high today, increasing the chances of being let down by a close friend or family member. But others appear to be out of touch with their feelings. If someone very close to you seems to have lost her way, lending a sympathetic ear is better now than trying to make a heroic rescue. Concentrate on reaching your goals and setting an example for others to follow."
virgo,2012-07-06,"Most tasks handed off to you today are potential opportunities for you to develop a new and exciting method that saves everyone time. But it's crucial to know when to quit or you could spend the entire day seeking the next great breakthrough, even if the tried and true way would have worked just fine. Sometimes the same old approach is the most reliable thing you can do. Demonstrate your keen intelligence by choosing which path makes the most sense now for the job at hand."
libra,2012-07-06,"The sensitive Cancer Sun is halfway through its month-long journey through your 10th House of Career, possibly bringing you well-deserved recognition at work. But taskmaster Saturn is also in the equation today, requiring you to give your assignments all you can. Expect amazing results, for even if you don't quite meet your goals, your chances for success are greatly enhanced by your confident attitude and your extra effort."
scorpio,2012-07-06,"You're able to shine your light brightly today because you can see great potential wherever you look. However, blind optimism is not a wise strategy; it only inflates and then dashes your expectations. Nevertheless, your willingness to assume the best outcome could open one door after another to opportunities that you would have just walked by at another time in your life."
sagittarius,2012-07-06,"You're not particularly interested in undertaking a major project by yourself these days. Fortunately, your world is full of amazing people, each with something special to offer. You might expect it to be easy to find someone willing to work with you, but everyone seems to be too busy now. However, don't give up searching for a business or personal partner. Accepting less than you want may seem wise in the moment, but it's even better to wait for the right person."
capricorn,2012-07-06,"Your ruling planet Saturn is softened by a harmonious trine from the nurturing Moon today. Normally, rational Saturn and the emotional Moon send conflicting messages, but your steady work now seems to garner beneficial results. Find the balance between knowing exactly what you want and realizing that you cannot fulfill every desire. Prioritize the potential pleasures in front of you, carefully choose your best shot at happiness and then take it."
aquarius,2012-07-06,"You might be so confident today that you think you can do everything. Unfortunately, spreading yourself too thin makes it impossible to finish even the simplest chores. Don't be so blinded by your own illuminating ideas that you lose sight of the practical realities that still govern your life. It's more important now to be responsible than it is to act like a genius."
pisces,2012-07-06,"You could be undecided about a significant personal issue because you can see it from both sides now. Your enthusiasm tempts you to say yes and jump wholeheartedly into the new project, but your heightened common sense is screaming no. Forcing a decision today only leads you to change your mind farther down the road, so take your time before making a final choice."
aries,2012-07-07,"A fog has descended on your world today, but your lack of clarity can actually produce magic. It seems as if luck is with you and you make the right choices, even if you cannot see what's happening and you aren't thinking very clearly. Nevertheless, it's not wise to push too hard for what you want; a gentle approach is more effective now than a forceful one."
taurus,2012-07-07,"Your ruling planet Venus befuddles you today with one tempting diversion after another. It becomes increasingly difficult for you to follow through on what you started until something happens that requires you to pull yourself back on course with a new sense of determination. Ultimately, the outcome is up to you; you can accomplish a lot once you accept that everything will take longer to finish than you originally planned."
gemini,2012-07-07,"Your day might not unfold as expected, but you should be able to enjoy yourself anyhow. Unfortunately, you might not be as productive as you wish, but you can catch up on unfinished business next week. Don't waste time worrying about what others think you should be doing. For now, be mellow and maintain a middle-of-the-road course through the weekend."
cancer,2012-07-07,"It's difficult to know whether or not to share your feelings today. You might inadvertently turn a passing mood into a major event by speaking up when it's smarter to just remain silent. On the other hand, you could miss an important chance to have a positive impact on your day if you say nothing at all. Be prepared to flow with the currents no matter which course you choose."
leo,2012-07-07,"Expressing yourself in a creative way today can leave you with a good feeling, even if you realize that your current satisfaction is short-lived. But it's not about producing a lasting work of art that everyone else appreciates; it's about doing something that fills you with a sense of wonder or contentment. Don't get distracted by waiting for approval from anyone else. Making yourself happy now counts most."
virgo,2012-07-07,"You might believe that your feet are planted firmly on the ground while everyone else is acting flighty today. But you are standing in the magical Hall of Mirrors now, where it's impossible to discern the original object from its reflection, or the reflection's reflection. You can change what's happening around you once you realize that your own uncertainty is coming back at you through the unpredictable behavior of others."
libra,2012-07-07,"You are at a fork in the road and while other people's needs must be considered, the final decision is ultimately yours alone. Thankfully, you can see the pros and cons of each path, yet it's still challenging to fully clarify your preferences. Once you make a choice, don't waste energy continuing to play through an infinite variety of possibilities. Simply move ahead confidently without pondering the road not taken."
scorpio,2012-07-07,"The floodgates of your subconscious mind open wide today as waves of creative inspiration wash through you. Although this can produce fantastic results, you must be ready to ride the currents that arise from the depths of your inner world. Trust the process of self-expression; if you are uncertain about the outcome, you're liable to impede the flow without even realizing it."
sagittarius,2012-07-07,"You are often challenged to set limits and today it's even more difficult because your emotions defy definition. You prefer to fly by the seat of your pants now, and you might get away with this tactic unless a situation grows so complex that you are forced to regain control. But if you wait until things have gone too far, it won't be that easy to tighten the reins. The sooner you think about clarifying your boundaries, the more natural it will be to honor them."
capricorn,2012-07-07,"You have been working hard and you're ready for relaxation today. Fortunately, you should be able to take it easy now without sacrificing the gains you have already made. But this doesn't mean you'll be able to avoid your obligations; instead, you'll discover that you can get just as much accomplished at a slower pace and enjoy yourself more as you go along."
aquarius,2012-07-07,"You might feel as if you have lost the sharp edge to your intellect today, but this is just another passing phase in your creative process. If you recently had an ingenious idea, now it's time to relax your grip so it can mature naturally. Trying to force the next step won't work; it's smarter to let your plans gel at their own pace. Instead of concentrating on finding the answers, allow them to come to you naturally."
pisces,2012-07-07,"The Moon's return to your visionary sign can free you from the restraints of logic, enabling your imagination to express your brilliance. But it may not be easy to put your ideas into words today. Don't fret if you cannot describe your vision to anyone else now. Postponing the discussion for another day is a smart strategy because your actions will surely speak louder and clearer than anything you might say."
aries,2012-07-08,"You could feel as if you've gone too far today and cannot figure out how to shift into reverse. Although backing up seems impossible, continuing forward isn't a good idea either. Thankfully, you can turn things around, but it will take some creative thinking on your part. Bending the rules in your favor may not be enough; you might have to reconsider your goal, change direction and start over again. Setting a different course gives you a new lease on life."
taurus,2012-07-08,"You may feel as if you're being emotionally blackmailed today and you might not want to deal with the situation. You would rather kick back and enjoy yourself instead of engaging in the drama. Nevertheless, you can effectively establish limits around your involvement once you are pushed too far. Being clear about your resistance right from the start will make life easier for everyone later on."
gemini,2012-07-08,"Your friends and family might grow frustrated with you today if you don't seem to be worried about the same things that are bothering them. As far as you can tell, a current situation may pose temporary difficulties, but should iron itself out without your direct intervention. You're willing to wait and see what happens even if others are not. Visualizing your future in a positive light can be a powerful tool; nevertheless, you'll still have a better chance of success if you get more involved now, not later."
cancer,2012-07-08,"You can feel the stress building around you and wish you could do something to make it go away. However, it may be obvious that others don't want you meddling in their affairs at this time. It's challenging to withdraw because you honestly believe that your nurturing love could make a positive difference. Don't project your feelings of personal rejection on to anyone else; just allow those you love the emotional space they need. Simply letting them know that you care is enough for now."
leo,2012-07-08,"You may have a plan for the day, but events that are beyond your control put your original goals out of reach. You don't like it if someone assumes he or she knows what's best for you. However, struggling to stick to your initial agenda only adds to your frustration. Instead, follow the good advice you receive. You can always take back the reins later when you're ready to be in charge once again."
virgo,2012-07-08,"Your friends lean on you because they trust your logical approach to a problem. However, the harder you try to think clearly now, the more spacey you feel. Although you have a practical handle on reality, you get confused today when people question your responses. Stop trying to live up to everyone else's expectations by having all the answers. Listen to the compassionate Pisces Moon visiting your 7th House of Companions by simply communing with others in the space of dreams."
libra,2012-07-08,"You may be ready to give up because your current tactics aren't working and you don't seem to be able to control the actions of your friends with your charm. Unfortunately, they are resisting your pressure and aren't doing as you wish. Instead of pushing harder today, stand back and give everyone additional room to breathe and make decisions on their own. Paradoxically, your voluntary retreat improves your chances of getting what you want."
scorpio,2012-07-08,"You may feel frustrated because your key planet Mars is presently engaging in a struggle with elusive Neptune. Your personal dilemma will remain unsolvable as long as you are fighting with an unknown enemy. However, you have the power to shift your current paradigm from conflict to cooperation. Once you step outside of your competitive frame of mind, everyone can come out a winner."
sagittarius,2012-07-08,"You have big ideas about what you want to do, but there seems to be so many potential obstacles today that you may give up before you even start your journey. If you're considering the pursuit of an educational opportunity, wait to make your final decision until your current negativity passes. There's no reason to force the issue right away. You will have a much clearer idea of what's ahead in the next few days if you take the time to explore all your options now."
capricorn,2012-07-08,"It's challenging to organize your life this weekend, and your current lack of progress on a project could make you feel grumpy. Nevertheless, resist the temptation to take out your frustration on others or your attitude could compound your current problems. Work smarter now, not harder, or you'll exhaust yourself trying to finish what you started. Exercising a little common sense is enough to put you back on track."
aquarius,2012-07-08,"Your friends and family may get on your nerves today as they tell you exactly what they expect from you. Unfortunately, the more you resist, the bolder they grow. Still, you're not ready to give in to unreasonable demands. Announcing your intention to remain non-committal until after the weekend could be enough to remove the immediate pressure and give you time to decide your next move."
pisces,2012-07-08,"Your moodiness may be more annoying to others than you realize. You might not understand why someone is giving you the cold shoulder today until you realize that your current fussiness could be perceived as negativity. Instead of aiming at perfection, try softening your approach now. A temporary lack of focus won't jeopardize your big plans for the future. Thankfully, your true motives will shine through if you let go of your fear of failure."
aries,2012-07-09,"It's unusually difficult to control your emotions today as the Moon moves through your sign and opposes warrior Mars. Unfortunately, coming right out with your feelings could stir up plenty of tension; once things are said, there's no way to take them back. Nevertheless, it's smarter to address what's bothering you now instead of waiting until the anxiety is even greater. Just make sure that you're kind when you share what's on your mind."
taurus,2012-07-09,"You might be drawn into an argument today by someone's provocative words. You are a tough adversary, especially if you're defending a personal belief. Unfortunately, you probably won't convince your opponent that you're right and a conflict will only widen the gulf between you. Take the high road and avoid drama completely by refusing to respond to a verbal attack. Current differences are not as significant as they seem; thankfully, the tension will settle down on its own."
gemini,2012-07-09,"Your sarcasm could get you into trouble now, especially if you are delaying an important discussion. Attempting to avoid difficult issues increases your anxiety until a relatively careless comment triggers your anger and pushes your buttons. A temper tantrum might allow you to blow off some stream, but it won't make anyone feel better in the long run. Instead of unconsciously provoking someone for the wrong reason, set your humor aside and simply speak from your heart."
cancer,2012-07-09,"You are a force to be reckoned with today, especially if anyone tries to use his or her authority to gain control over you. At other times you might choose to remain quiet and acquiesce to someone else's demands, but now you're ready to fight to maintain your boundaries. It's healthy to let everyone know where you stand as long as you don't take your resistance too far. Claim your power but not at anyone else's expense."
leo,2012-07-09,"You appreciate receiving support from your friends and family. However, you don't like it when someone meddles in your business, especially if you are clear about your current goals. Your patience is on a short fuse today and your reaction to outside interferences may be swift. Be firm, but keep in mind that overreacting could further incite unwanted conflict. Take a deep breath and think twice before you respond."
virgo,2012-07-09,"You prefer to have everything under control, but something can go slightly awry today. Unfortunately, you may be caught off guard if you discover that a friend or co-worker misled you. Rather than overreacting, practice compassion instead. A simple misunderstanding might have set the whole thing into motion. Once you know the source of the error, you can correct it and get your day back on track."
libra,2012-07-09,"It's a wonder that others can be so pushy now without even realizing that they're being offensive. On the other hand, you are overly concerned that someone may think you're being too aggressive. However, if you spend more time and energy describing exactly what you need now, those closest to you might stop harassing you. Establishing clear boundaries isn't being rude; it's just what the doctor ordered for a healthy relationship."
scorpio,2012-07-09,"You feel as if you're back in the daily grind now that the Moon is visiting your 6th House of Routine. Although you might be motivated to attempt something new, it's reassuring to know that you can be successful while falling back on an old habit. Don't worry about what anyone else thinks; the opinions of others are less important than the results of your actions."
sagittarius,2012-07-09,"Your freewheeling behavior reflects your new wave of confidence, yet you may be jumping the gun and feeling optimistic a few days too soon. It's not that anything is wrong with the present circumstances; it's just that you still have more work to complete before you can harvest the fruits of your labor. Positive thinking is surely a vital part of your current strategy; just don't ignore reality in the process."
capricorn,2012-07-09,"You might be thinking about the potential difficulties you could face if you actually decide to pick up and move somewhere else, yet you're still tempted to do it anyhow. Whether or not relocation is feasible now, unrelenting responsibilities increase your desire to escape. However, it's not the best time to make big changes that destabilize your domestic life. Do whatever you can to maintain balance in your daily routine until you're sure that a bigger transition is really necessary."
aquarius,2012-07-09,"Your thoughts are running around in circles today, and you can tell how busy the next few weeks are going to be for you. But even if you are very eager for what's ahead, you still cannot just instantaneously jump forward to where you want to be. You must move into your future one day at a time and right now that means clearing any obstacles in your path, real or imagined. Don't avoid difficult issues any longer because they become more complicated if you wait until later to address them."
pisces,2012-07-09,"Your self-esteem is growing stronger day by day, but you could become so confident now that you take on more than you can manage. Those who depend on you will be quite unhappy if you don't deliver on your promises. Listen to your friends today, especially if they're suggesting that you slow down. A methodical approach helps you avoid making an impulsive decision that you might later regret."
aries,2012-07-10,"Your air of optimism may dissipate as you think about letting others know exactly what's on your mind. However, if you do tell all you might have a mess on your hands to clean up afterward. Discretion is important or you could needlessly hurt the feelings of someone you really like. An act of kindness is worth far more than a self-indulgent disclosure."
taurus,2012-07-10,"You would like to be by yourself today, but there may be too much going on for you to completely withdraw. It appears that you cannot have it either way. If you are home alone, you can't keep your mind off the fun things you could be doing. And if you are out with friends or family, you just want some quiet time to yourself. No matter what, don't fall into the trap of blaming your dissatisfaction on anyone else. Make the most of where you are in the present moment without trying to be somewhere else."
gemini,2012-07-10,"Your friends may be the source of a current dilemma, especially if they have one agenda and you have another. Social activities can play an important role in your weekend, but you might be bored with the agreed-upon schedule. Don't let yourself get roped into doing anything you cannot easily escape. Establishing your boundaries up front is wiser than suffering the consequences of just going along with the crowd."
cancer,2012-07-10,"Instead of being in charge of a group activity, you would rather have everyone share in the responsibilities now. You really don't have much patience since everything seems to take longer than it should. Instead of hurrying others along, try slowing yourself down. You may be surprised at how well this unorthodox strategy works for you today."
leo,2012-07-10,"You are ready for a vacation and even if you cannot take an extended one, a quick weekend getaway should be enough to alleviate the pressure. Don't worry if you haven't made any plans yet. A spontaneous day trip can be just what the doctor ordered. But if you're already booked for the day, at least pick a weekend on the calendar and start planning your great escape."
virgo,2012-07-10,"A new approach in your dealings with an intimate partner or a business associate might be enough to change a difficult dynamic. But don't expect to make gains without some sort of uncomfortable confrontation first. Once you put your feelings out on the table, others will be able to engage you on an emotional level and this can make all the difference in the world."
libra,2012-07-10,"A conflict that's been quietly brewing for several days might explode into a full-blown argument today. Although you believe that you have an airtight case, keep in mind that someone else may be thinking the same thing. Paradoxically, reality can support multiple points of view, so don't turn this into a fight to the finish. Instead, find a way that allows both of you to be right."
scorpio,2012-07-10,"Discovering new ways to do the same old things brightens your day with fun and excitement. But just because you have a great idea doesn't mean you can turn it into reality. Rather than trying to take on too much and fix everything today, just make one small improvement to your routine. Proactive change has a greater positive impact than you realize."
sagittarius,2012-07-10,"Although you would like today to be a play day you have previous commitments to fulfill, making it difficult to just go off and have fun. If you do ignore your current responsibilities, you might end up feeling so guilty that you cannot enjoy yourself, anyhow. Don't be in such a hurry to run out on your obligations. Instead, bring others into your confidence by letting them know about your desires. They may be more willing to compromise in such a way that you get some time off, anyhow."
capricorn,2012-07-10,"Spending some time at home today might not be as relaxing as you wish, for your day is filled with excitement no matter what you do. Instead of trying to withdraw from the action, engage it head on. By involving yourself voluntarily, you'll end up feeling more in control. And even if you try to go off on your own, you'll still get pulled into the day's events. Letting go of control allows you to enjoy yourself more than you could imagine."
aquarius,2012-07-10,"Your day can feel like one personal crisis after another if you attempt to spend it in solitude, because others will likely be more involved with your business than you wish. Even if you are left alone, you probably won't be able to completely relax since you have work to do. Although you believe you know what's best, be flexible and let your friends influence your plans. Expect the unexpected and enjoy the ride."
pisces,2012-07-10,"Retail therapy might make you feel better today, but this is merely masking a symptom of a deeper issue. Your values are changing and you are eager to surround yourself with material objects that reflect your new outlook on life. Go ahead and honor your impulse to spend money, but avoid buyer's remorse by making sure that your purchase is also practical."
aries,2012-07-11,"Complex issues continue to weigh on your psyche today, even as the real world pressures appear to ease. Although you're trying to re-establish balance between your needs and the demands of working with others, you might overstate the importance of a personal preference. Since your strong opinions could instigate an unnecessary meltdown, consider backing down from your supposedly non-negotiable position. Compromise is more stabilizing than conflict."
taurus,2012-07-11,"Even if your intent is to come clean, it may be more difficult to put your feelings out in the open with the Moon's presence in your 12th House of Secrets. It's best to avoid being drawn into an intense disagreement that's fueled by fear of the unknown. Shining your light of awareness into the shadows of consciousness is difficult at first, but grows easier when the Moon enters your dependable sign later this evening."
gemini,2012-07-11,"You might experience a wide range of feelings that don't have an acceptable outlet in your current social setting. However, these unexpressed emotions still have a strong influence on what's occurring in your outer world. It may be difficult to overcome the resistance that you face, but the blockages are easier to handle once you realize that you are the real obstacle to open communication and not anyone else. Overcome your fears with clear intentions and unrelenting persistence."
cancer,2012-07-11,You aren't as hesitant today about expressing your private feelings and you might not be able to stop yourself from saying what's on your mind. This isn't about you suddenly demanding what you want; it's about honoring your inner voice. Don't keep your thoughts locked up even if you're not sure about the consequences of disclosure. Say what you must; just remember to be kind in your approach so others will be more receptive to your words.
leo,2012-07-11,"Try not to overcompensate for any emotional insecurity by acting more intensely than you actually feel today. Disguising your vulnerability with an inflated demonstration of passion can trick others into believing that you have more self-confidence than you really do. Find someone you trust and openly discuss your dilemma, knowing that the ensuing conversation could help you figure out your next move."
virgo,2012-07-11,"Hiding your feelings isn't a viable option now since everyone seems to be able to read you like an open book. But even when you take the time to explain yourself in great detail, you still aren't sure that anyone else really understands what you need. Carefully examine your motives so you don't mislead someone in a way that could be problematic. Once you are clear about your intentions, it will be easier to communicate them to others."
libra,2012-07-11,"You don't need to let anyone push you around, for you have more power than you realize. On the other hand, nothing is gained by obsessing about something that you cannot have now. It may be challenging to manage the intensity of your reactions today. Continue to practice moderating your extreme emotions and seek middle ground wherever possible."
scorpio,2012-07-11,"Sexy Venus flirts with the fine line between delicious and overindulgent today as she stressfully aligns with the Moon. You aren't in the mood to play games now, unless you believe they will lead somewhere productive. Nevertheless, you still want to do what's right, even if you already know what you want. Be careful; make sure that everyone is on the same page before reaching a point of no return."
sagittarius,2012-07-11,"Logic isn't necessarily a part of your equation today as you attempt to satisfy your desires. You may be openly communicating with a romantic partner, yet your words can also act as a smoke screen that hides feelings you don't want to discuss. Avoid coercive tactics since they add power to what's not being said. Bringing your emotions out into the open can minimize unnecessary confusion later on."
capricorn,2012-07-11,"Even your closest friends have a hard time understanding how deeply your feelings run today. Although you don't often express your needs using emotionally-charged language, your heart can be just as vulnerable as anyone else's. Something special may be in the emotional slow cooker, but it's too soon to declare it done. Don't hurry the process; good things come to those who wait."
aquarius,2012-07-11,"Your desires could be overridden today by everyone else's demands. Ultimately, you might decide that it's a smarter idea to conform instead of rigidly sticking to your own plans. It may be inconvenient to stand up to others right now even if you know what you want; the time and effort required isn't worth it. But your needs grow in strength if you try to simply ignore them. Avoid the possibility of losing your temper by letting others know your preference without being attached to the outcome."
pisces,2012-07-11,"Dancing simultaneously in multiple realities can be exciting for you today, but it also produces extra stress. You are tempted to choose one set of emotions to live by, while burying the other. However, you're being called to do powerful inner work while still keeping up external appearances. Keeping one foot on the ground in each realm helps you face your feelings, even if you cannot fully integrate them into your current life yet."
aries,2012-07-12,"You may get a bit lazy today because something tells you that everything is going to be OK. You know that worrying won't help matters, even if some things are not quite right. The fact is that there aren't any quick fixes to life's current intriguing dilemmas, so let yourself off the hook for now. There is nothing you must do except be fully present in the moment. The rest will follow."
taurus,2012-07-12,"This is an opportune time to recharge your batteries now that the Moon is back in your sign. Even if you are busy fulfilling your commitments, find small pockets of time to do absolutely nothing at all. Giving yourself permission to contemplate life without the need to be productive is an excellent way to reconnect with what's truly important."
gemini,2012-07-12,"Don't let down your guard today or you could find yourself an unwitting participant in someone else's drama. Sure, you may have a role to play in what's going down, but it's time to step back from the action or you'll get pulled into something that's bigger than what you bargained for. Instead of trying to directly affect the outcome, take a more spiritual approach to gain a better perspective on the big picture."
cancer,2012-07-12,"By now you have probably made a choice that will carry you well in to the future. Although your plans are in an early stage of development, you can still make adjustments to them. But, on some level, the deal is done. You've gone through a period of serious questioning and now it's time to concentrate on putting your ideas into action, even if you don't see results overnight."
leo,2012-07-12,"You might find yourself in a situation where people seem to be relying on you more than you think is healthy. But don't just brush everyone's overtures aside. Instead, find the inner strength to express clearly what you can do while admitting what is beyond your reach. You don't have to fend for anyone now but yourself, so your friends will appreciate your honesty more than your denial."
virgo,2012-07-12,"Applying your analytical skills to your future goals is a valuable exercise now. However, even if you've been thinking about a quick getaway or a longer vacation, don't put off the planning since you have a rare combination of planetary help available today. Your imagination can conjure up an ideal adventure for you and someone special. However, it's up to you to bring your dreams down to earth."
libra,2012-07-12,"It seems as if the storm clouds are lifting, but your positive forecast may still be a few days out. Although the emotional skies aren't totally clear yet, you're already seeing the welcoming patches of blue amidst the turbulence. Be patient; don't try to push the dark clouds away. They will continue to drift off on their own accord as you learn to appreciate the rains they bring. Remember, finding the silver lining in a cloud can be its own reward."
scorpio,2012-07-12,"You feel a bit more upbeat today as you simplify your life and clarify your needs. Sometimes things seem way more complicated to you than they do to other people. Of course, others aren't always as perceptive as you are and they do not understand what you see. Nevertheless, eliminating some of the outer noise allows you to get even better at hearing your own inner voice."
sagittarius,2012-07-12,"There's plenty to do today, and it seems as if you are finally ready to attack your assigned tasks. It's not that you have been lazy during the first half of this week; it's just that there is a lot going on that continues to distract you from your normal routine. Nevertheless, it's better to keep going through the motions, even if your heart isn't into it now. Instead of looking to do things differently, concentrate for a while on crossing things off your list."
capricorn,2012-07-12,"You can do nearly anything you put your mind toward today, since your pragmatic nature helps you create a concrete plan to accomplish your goals. Thankfully, your focus is strong and you are determined to do whatever must be done in order to meet your obligations. Although you may be tired and work-weary, if you think you can, then you can. Don't wait for a better time; start now."
aquarius,2012-07-12,"An emotional conflict today might not be as overwhelming as your recent experiences. In fact, you may not be too concerned at all because you can approach the entire situation in an objective manner, enabling you to rationalize your feelings. Keep in mind that an intellectual orientation allows you to hide your vulnerability, preventing others from getting too close to you. Show your courage by being honest and admitting that you don't have all the answers."
pisces,2012-07-12,"Even though your feelings can still be quite strong today, your life seems a little calmer. Somehow, you seem to know that you'll end up exactly where you need to be as long as you move with the tidal flow. However, going contrary to the currents will tire you out. Resistance is futile, so save your strength for when you need it most."
aries,2012-07-13,You are eager to get to work today; you know what must be done and you are ready to do it. You have a growing sense of what's important -- beyond your simple list of chores. But you start to think about all the alternatives and what you could be doing if you were truly free. Talking about what your heart wants could be therapeutic now as long as you can skip over what your head thinks. Just finish your work before your run off in other directions.
taurus,2012-07-13,"You remember what it's like to feel completely at home with who you are now that the mood-setting Moon is back in your sign. Although there may be big changes you would like to make in your life, a smarter strategy is to be content just being yourself. Concentrate on your job today, but also take the time to do something to make your home look nicer like buying yourself some flowers. Adding a little color to your life is an easy way to be kind to yourself."
gemini,2012-07-13,"Secrets have a sneaky way of seeping into separate parts of our lives where they can cause mischief. But rather than needing to talk about your sensitive topics, it's the other people in your world that seem to be holding their cards very close. Someone may not be telling you everything he or she knows, and this might cause a rift between you. If you think that you're missing a piece of information, ask questions first before assuming the worst."
cancer,2012-07-13,"You might get away with resting on your laurels or, perhaps, you're able to finish your work now with less effort than normal. However, be aware that what you are doing on the outside is not where the real action is. Instead, create magic within your imagination that you can later manifest as reality. Make a wish without worrying about the details and destiny take its course."
leo,2012-07-13,"You seem to be stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place today. You may even attempt to dig in your heels and make a strong stand for something that you believe in. Unfortunately, your extreme stubbornness won't necessarily help you make your point. Don't compromise your beliefs, but be prepared to negotiate about your actions."
virgo,2012-07-13,"You have an opportunity to do some deep psychological work that alters your attitude in a profound way. Ironically, delving into parts of your psyche can suddenly shift the way you think. It may be difficult to start this emotional process, but rewards are likely if you take the necessary steps toward self-discovery."
libra,2012-07-13,"It may feel as if your values are floating in space right now. This doesn't mean that you are confused about your personal beliefs. Instead, it's as if you cannot easily integrate your likes and dislikes into your current set of circumstances. The good news is that you are doing some deep thinking about what you want, which ultimately can lead to greater fulfillment."
scorpio,2012-07-13,"Sometimes you wish you didn't know so much and feel so much. Nevertheless, you do; having a deeper awareness of things that other people miss is one of your gifts. Unfortunately, it's not easy to shut off your senses and close down your brain when your emotions become overwhelming. It's better to be fully conscious of your inner process than to be in denial. Ultimately, you have more choices available when you are in touch with an expanded view of reality."
sagittarius,2012-07-13,"Although your week finishes up slowly, the weekend ahead should prove to be quite exciting. You're on the edge of a major intellectual adventure and you would be wise to prepare for it now. Your thoughts are expanding as you discover new ways to look at your life. Travel is indicated, but remember that you can also go on a mental journey within the realms of your imagination."
capricorn,2012-07-13,"You are rediscovering the ground beneath your feet today. You might have pulled away from your own center recently and the continuous distractions have caused you stress. However, now you find comfort in feeling the earth again. Your solid pragmatism works in your favor as long as you to maintain integrity by following through on your good intentions."
aquarius,2012-07-13,"You might be experiencing emotional extremes today; your nerves are rattled by circumstances in your life that you cannot control. You are currently engaged in a life lesson about acceptance, not that long-term change is impossible. It's just that you must step beyond your feelings of personal discontent in order to touch a much deeper meaning of what's going on. Once you're aware of the bigger picture, the details will be easier to manage."
pisces,2012-07-13,"Whatever complications have been plaguing you, they finally seem to be more manageable today. It's not that the complexity has gone away; it's just that you feel better equipped to handle whatever happens now. Although your feelings are quieter, they are still running deeply. Allow yourself to feel good about the options in front of you without the pressure of having to make big decisions right away."
aries,2012-07-14,"You are often on to the next activity before you are even finished with the current one. However, you understand the advantage of slowing down today and you're willing to see a job through to the end. Nevertheless, growing bored can still be a problem now if things aren't moving along quickly enough for you. Accept delays as part of the process and stick with the task at hand, even if you would prefer to be doing something new."
taurus,2012-07-14,"You are in touch with your own strength of purpose today and are certain you can overcome any setbacks that arise. However, feeling confident isn't enough; you must reconsider your basic assumptions even if it means going back to the beginning. Starting a project over allows you to build a more solid foundation that can support whatever comes next. Do it now while you have time; if you let this opportunity pass, you may regret it later on."
gemini,2012-07-14,It's difficult to hide your feelings now that the Moon is back in your sign. You might believe that it's more efficient to keep interpersonal communication within the safe realms of rational thinking while steering clear of illogical emotions. But taking an objective approach won't enable you to talk your way around the obstacles in your path. Slow down and review a full range of alternative strategies before choosing a course of action.
cancer,2012-07-14,"You are lighthearted one moment and serious the next as you remember some of the profound emotional transitions that you have experienced over the last few years. You're ready to move on, but you still may be overly sensitive to your recent past with unresolved feelings weighing heavily on your mind. Revisiting childhood memories helps you to reframe your own history so you can do something brilliant in the current moment."
leo,2012-07-14,"You could run into a few snags today. A recent disappointment might seem like it's a big deal, but Mercury retrograde in your sign tells a slightly different story. You are being given time to review the details of what led you to the present moment. This isn't time for rest, so examine how the current blockages are symbolic of your own feelings. Awareness is the key; once you understand your role in creating the present situation, then you can steadily push on through to the other side."
virgo,2012-07-14,"It may seem as if the public spotlight has found you now, but you might prefer to hide from view. You are more likely just to accept the responsibilities that are heaped upon you and withdraw from others while you do your work. But if you have control issues and continue to do everything on your own, your ambitious strategy could backfire. Acknowledge that you need to be a part of a larger group, tribe or family. It really does take a village."
libra,2012-07-14,"You are experiencing an unusual mixture of Saturn's hard, cold reality and the whimsical fantasies of today's breezy Gemini Moon. You're very serious about your philosophy on life and might have to make choices now that put you in an emotionally vulnerable position. There's nothing wrong with having lots of acquaintances in your life. Just don't let your limited thinking get in the way of transforming a casual friendship into something more meaningful."
scorpio,2012-07-14,"You can feel the weight of responsibility on your shoulders now as you take on more than is required. It helps to examine what your past has to do with your current eagerness to help others, even if they haven't asked for it. Compassion is surely a gift, but codependence is not a viable path to happiness. Heal others by first forgiving and healing yourself."
sagittarius,2012-07-14,"Stand up and stretch your wings; it's time to claim your power. However, if you find yourself involved in a simple struggle for control, step back and take responsibility only for what is yours. You really don't have to win an argument, since the price can be too great. Turn the challenge into an opportunity to learn something about yourself as you handle the resistance with courage and grace."
capricorn,2012-07-14,"The weekend brings relaxation for some people, but not so much for you. You are a worker bee today and there are just too many things to do around your hive. It may even feel like a day of judgment and, naturally, you want it to be called in your favor. Apply yourself diligently, but avoid any self-criticism. Continue to work as hard as you can while remembering that you're in it for the long haul. Rome wasn't built in a day."
aquarius,2012-07-14,"You might believe that your relationship life is improving, but you're still afraid of crashing into a wall. Try not to get too discouraged if you have to deal with a miscommunication. A misunderstanding with a loved one can gobble up valuable time if you take it as a sign of defeat. But you should be able to accomplish what's necessary once you realize that the current events are clues about the work you have yet to do."
pisces,2012-07-14,It's time to cool off this weekend and re-evaluate what you want from your closest relationships. You may be more analytical than usual and less emotionally attached to the outcome. It's not that you are ready to give up; it's just that you can see the futility of trying to control someone else's feelings. Set priorities and give yourself extra time to accomplish your current goals.
aries,2012-07-15,"You always have choices as you approach an unexpected roadblock in your path. You can run directly into the trouble and try to power your way through it. When this headstrong tactic works, you are a sight to behold! But today an impulsive attack could be foolhardy and frustrating. Stop and try to understand what you can learn from the situation. When you recognize the deeper lesson, everything will quickly fall into place."
taurus,2012-07-15,"Whatever feelings rise to the surface now are doing so for a good reason; however, the logic may not be immediately apparent to you. Remain open to changes even if you feel like you're not getting what you want. The situation might still be unstable and you're wise to wait before making any significant decisions. Instead of focusing on a temporary setback today, remember that what you say has the magical power to transform everything in the blink of an eye."
gemini,2012-07-15,"Your key planet Mercury is retrograde now, turning your thoughts inward. Although responsibilities may seem somewhat oppressive, almost anything is possible if you put your mind to it. The feelings that are holding you back also contain the seeds for your forward movement. It's not time to accept defeat, even if you're feeling less than confident. Today's discussions can set the stage for tomorrow's transformations."
cancer,2012-07-15,"You may think that someone is being overly judgmental of your activities as critical Saturn rains on your parade. However, today's Sun-Saturn square gives you an opportunity to gain clarity about an important life lesson. Try to remain optimistic about your options because a challenge or a delay doesn't mean you should give up. Instead, strengthen your position by reviewing your plans and making necessary adjustments."
leo,2012-07-15,"You are being tested today, and how you respond will have important consequences in the days ahead. Imagine that the complex situations that you encounter are speed bumps on the road of life. If you are moving ahead too fast, they might cause serious damage. But trouble can be averted if you see the obstacles far enough in advance. Take your cues from the feedback that reality is offering you and plan your course accordingly."
virgo,2012-07-15,"Although you feel like throwing caution to the wind today, a friend will have enough sense to remind you about your priorities. Even if some things are not going exactly the way you want, you can make choices that will keep you on your chosen path. Flexibility is more important now than sustainability. If you conjure up the image in your mind, then it has the chance to become real. Believing is the first step to seeing."
libra,2012-07-15,"Nearly everything in your life seems to be moving along quite well. Nevertheless, you are still facing conflict about what you want to do versus what others want you to do. Or, perhaps, someone close to you is causing you stress because they are acting recklessly instead of fulfilling their responsibilities. Whatever problems you are facing now, remember that your ability to roll with the situation will help see you through it."
scorpio,2012-07-15,"Your mind continues to be very probing and, fortunately, your thinking process is grounded. However, your basic material needs and sensual desires may be the source of a dilemma. Your gut instinct encourages you to develop your vision of an ideal future. First, you must make some adjustments as your values transform along with the current circumstances. But it's not the right time to change everything all at once. Fine-tuning your daily routine, though, is certainly in order."
sagittarius,2012-07-15,"Love is in the air today but it doesn't come without complications. Although you may not be able to avoid serious matters in a relationship, you're tempted to step around a potential problem to get to the good stuff. Unfortunately, taking a shortcut now won't save any time and could also destabilize a romance. Instead of pushing your luck, adopting a slower approach increases your chances to find mutual satisfaction."
capricorn,2012-07-15,"You would be wise to examine your weaknesses as the willful Sun squares your key planet Saturn today. However, judging yourself too harshly could do more harm than good, especially if others are criticizing your efforts, too. Nevertheless, dwelling on your shortcomings is a waste of time. Think of yourself as a work in progress and get busy."
aquarius,2012-07-15,"Ironically, the sooner you accept the current limitations, the easier it will be to break free from the restraints. The lesson now is to work within your boundaries, rather than trying to work around them. There are times to push the edges of the envelope, and there are times to exercise self-control to keep things as they are. Thankfully, the problems you face today will seem less complicated tomorrow."
pisces,2012-07-15,"You Fish like to swim in the open waters where there are no boundaries. But now you are being presented with a restrictive situation that prevents you from reaching your destination. Instead of worrying too much about getting lost along the way, consider your current responsibilities. Once you have your priorities in order it will be easier to work within the defined limits of the game."
aries,2012-07-16,"You are marching to the beat of your own drum and the rhythm is so strong today that you cannot resist following it. Exhibiting a bit of self-restraint is usually a good idea, but there's no holding you back now. Although you want to be practical, you still could overextend your energy as your key planet Mars is magnified by expansive Jupiter. Nevertheless, you can improve your chances for success by concentrating on your goals. Eliminating unnecessary activities flips the odds in your favor."
taurus,2012-07-16,"You feel uneasy as everything starts to move faster today. It's apparent how your actions set the stage for what will happen, but there is so much heading your way now that it's challenging to settle down and make progress. Your prospects may be improving, but this is no time to abandon your responsibilities. The rewards that are waiting around the corner will likely vanish before you reach them if you fall short of what's expected of you."
gemini,2012-07-16,"Your positive attitude attracts opportunities, but you must be careful to balance your optimism with more practical considerations. Although you can tell that there is great potential for enjoyment now, this isn't all about fun and games. Ultimately, it's up to you to share yourself with those who are closest to you. You have a chance to do something meaningful that enriches your spirit today; including your friends makes it more special."
cancer,2012-07-16,"You might become so enthusiastic today that you break through your inhibitions and explode onto the scene with a few exciting ideas of your own. This is not your typical approach, so your spontaneous behavior could catch others off guard. If you feel compelled to risk exposure and take a chance, go for it. You can always clam up again later if you overextended your reach."
leo,2012-07-16,"When the going gets tough you Lions bounce back, and today the planets are on your side, giving you an extra jolt of energy. It's wonderful to have enough zest to get up and go, but it's not wise to swing into action now just to avoid a difficult situation. Nevertheless, you still might feel heroic from all the potential around you, but if you inflate things too much, reality will likely disappoint you."
virgo,2012-07-16,"You are feeling hopeful today, yet something seems to be on your mind, preventing you from riding your own waves of enthusiasm. Your conservative tendencies are holding you back, yet you still think that you can accomplish something special now if you just go out and give it your very best. Thankfully, you have an excellent grasp of the situation and your chances for success are really very good."
libra,2012-07-16,"You tend to be a people person since you flourish from your interactions with others. Your discussions with someone else help you see yourself more clearly. The feedback you receive now deepens your perspective if you can be receptive to hearing it. Another point of view increases your current choices, so take time to integrate what you learn before making an important decision."
scorpio,2012-07-16,"You are so realistic you probably realize that your current enthusiasm won't last. But you're also clever enough to make the most of it while you can. There is recognition coming your way for a job well done. Although a bit of positive reinforcement won't likely change the overall direction of your life, you can still have something to feel good about along the way."
sagittarius,2012-07-16,You're the central character in your very own mythical story. You have morphed into a superhero with larger-than-life intentions because your key planet Jupiter is receiving an adrenaline rush from red-hot Mars. Utilize this cosmic boost by throwing a great party or rushing in to save the day for a friend. The choice is entirely yours.
capricorn,2012-07-16,"Your sensible self-restraint is sufficient to get you through periods of weakness, but now you might not have enough resistance to keep everything to yourself. You're overcome by an impulse to share your private feelings today. If you have been suppressing anger or resenting someone close to you, get it out in the open while you can. Potential difficulties will not last long once they are discussed; it's keeping them secret that creates the most trouble."
aquarius,2012-07-16,"If you are keeping more to yourself than usual, reality may kick up a storm today. Your good intentions will come around quickly if you initiate meaningful communication instead of wasting time talking about trivialities. You might not even realize how influential your own values are or what you bring to a situation, but others appreciate your openness. Let your friends see your vulnerability; they can help you in ways you cannot yet realize."
pisces,2012-07-16,"You have a growing sense of confidence that motivates you into high gear today, but you're probably more grounded now than you seem. You have been thinking about your next move for a while, but your excitement overshadows any previous planning. Others may think you are out of control now, but don't worry about surprising anyone else. Just do what makes the most sense to you in the present moment."
aries,2012-07-17,"Stopping long enough to let your emotions settle down is a great idea, even if it isn't an easy path to follow. You could be moody today and fixing for a fight, especially if circumstances aren't going your way. Unfortunately, you cannot find a sensible target for your aggression -- and this is exactly why you should take a few deep breaths and chill out. Expressing your feelings is essential to your mental health."
taurus,2012-07-17,"This is a wonderful day for a quick getaway, but you might not have the time to do anything about it. Still, go ahead and create small pockets of solitude for spiritual rejuvenation. Try going for a walk, sitting in meditation or practicing yoga. Give yourself enough space to listen to your own inner voice rather than the stressful demands of others."
gemini,2012-07-17,"It's often not easy for you to relax and today you may be dealing with even more stress than usual. Fortunately, you correctly sense that things are changing, but it won't be an overnight turnaround. You might feel as if others will be in your way for a while. In the meantime, don't vent your frustrations on innocent bystanders or ignore the situations that trigger your resentment. Create a middle path and try to stay on it."
cancer,2012-07-17,"Although you may feel the upbeat energy today, annoying distractions prevent you from being as positive as you like. Perhaps someone is being more demanding than normal. You might even be drawn into an argument with others who are already fighting amongst themselves to see who is king of the hill. Ironically, you could make the best leader of all if you're willing to stand up and fight for your beliefs."
leo,2012-07-17,"Your feelings are running through some very deep waters today and it might just make you somewhat uncomfortable if others unwittingly step into your emotional turmoil. Your confidence is shaky now, but your actions could speak a very different story as you roar your way through the day. Remember that false bravado won't make your certainty return any sooner; it only alienates you from those who want to help. Showing your vulnerability can be a positive step toward developing greater intimacy."
virgo,2012-07-17,"Nothing will be gained by pushing the river, for the water will ultimately arrive at the sea in its own time. The same now applies to your life. Try not to push others to react faster than they can, for it won't help your cause as you move into your next phase. Instead, be as open and flexible as possible. When others feel supported, they will be more willing to cooperate with you."
libra,2012-07-17,"This can be a day for intense emotional interactions as you confront the gulf between your thoughts and feelings. These conversations could even be expressed as a dialogue between two inner voices. Take a chance in a relationship and open up to another person, but avoid being too dependent on logic alone. Remember, you need both the objective and subjective sides of reality today to round out your experience."
scorpio,2012-07-17,"Social interactions might bring up your insecurities, adding more drama to an already intense day. You may feel as if you are engaged in a battle that you must win, but the truth is that your fears are making the situation more problematic today. Instead of overreacting with unrestrained passion, seek ways to salve the open wounds and slow down your own emotional rollercoaster."
sagittarius,2012-07-17,"You feel a boost of enthusiasm from your key planet Jupiter today, but the buzz isn't long-lasting. There are bigger issues developing and even if you believe that you have passed through the eye of the storm, there is still more turmoil to come. You could inadvertently make a situation worse by attempting to bring an unresolved matter to a premature conclusion. It's better to just let the energy take its own course without trying to control the outcome."
capricorn,2012-07-17,Your feelings are much clearer now as you get a fresh perspective on the events of the past few days. But your current view of reality may be influenced by your unexpressed emotions as you struggle between the thoughts in your head and the desires of your heart. Lean on your friends for support instead of pushing them away. Trusting someone else enables you to trust yourself.
aquarius,2012-07-17,"Fire up your intellect for a little bit of fun and break out of old routines wherever you go. Enjoy the show as you actively engage everyone in intense conversations to gain perspective on your own feelings. However, avoid negotiations that require detached analysis today, as it will be difficult to separate your logical thoughts from your irrational needs now."
pisces,2012-07-17,"You are highly enthused and could even be passionate enough today to take a risk in a conversation or email exchange with someone you want to know better. Listen to your heart, even if you hear your fears trying to talk you out of expressing your desires. Just remember to give others enough latitude so they can be comfortable to share whatever they feel, too."
aries,2012-07-18,"This is a power-packed day with red-hot Mars negotiating between your desire for independence and your need to be loved. Remember, Mars is not known as a peacemaker, so his brand of diplomacy may incite conflict today. Things might reach a tipping point when you don't know what's going to happen next. Nevertheless, real progress toward finding lasting solutions can be made if you build the future upon mutual respect and positive intentions."
taurus,2012-07-18,"Don't lose sight of the value of your common sense since a total breakdown of routine at work can be circumvented if you maintain your composure. However, no one wants to face the difficult issues until all parties realize what's at stake. Don't be afraid to take an unpopular stand if necessary, for the current circumstances may require a disruption just to get everyone's attention."
gemini,2012-07-18,"Usually you are the clever one who can miraculously pull a solution out of thin air, even if it is not a permanent one. But today, every tactic you try is met with surprising resistance or an unexpected response. The uncertainty is enough to make you lose confidence in your own ability to communicate. Don't give up; your persistence could pay off once you hit on a strategy that settles down the energy."
cancer,2012-07-18,"Relying on your intuition now is a smart way to stay on your path. However, just because you know how to respond, this doesn't mean that you'll be able to do what you believe is right. In fact, you may feel as if your route to success is being blocked. Everything at work seems to be out of control, yet you aren't comfortable expressing your feelings. Office politics are complicated, but restrained action and clear communication prevent things from falling apart."
leo,2012-07-18,"Something may not go according to your plans today, even if you're fully prepared. You carefully studied your lines and you know how to play your part, but it's as if someone changed the plot and your lines are no longer relevant. You may even feel as if the other players have been given new scripts and no one informed you. Don't lose control of your feelings; showing your anger will only make things worse. This is a test to see if you can let go of your personal agenda and graciously adapt to the changing scenery."
virgo,2012-07-18,"Your logical analysis is usually a source of reason, but today it just makes everything unbearable. You can see what's wrong and, fortunately, you know how to fix it. But you're not in control. The harder you work to stabilize the situation, the crazier it becomes. Be aware that the dynamics of a relationship may have to get shaky for a while before they are able to improve."
libra,2012-07-18,"This might not be the kind of pleasant day that you Libras dream about. It's challenging to figure out exactly what is happening today, but it is apparent that loose ends defy being tied. Forget about putting everything back into balance now; you'll only grow more aggravated if you try. Instead, concentrate on cooperating with others and you'll make it through the day with flying colors."
scorpio,2012-07-18,"Although you might like the idea of a romantic involvement, your need for self-determination is very strong now. Ironically, you won't let someone else steer your car, even if you asked him or her to drive it. It doesn't matter what kind of logic you apply to your current dilemma today; you still may not be able to figure out the best course of action because you are conflicted over the situation. Go ahead and do what feels right in the moment, but don't focus on the distant destination just yet."
sagittarius,2012-07-18,"The cosmic tension affects nearly everyone today, yet you Archers seem to get away with pulling a few strings of your own. You can actually help someone work through a difficult situation while others just seem to make it worse. Thankfully, your actions have a powerful impact, but you'll be even more effective now if you refrain from pushing your needs onto anyone else. Listening with an open mind is your secret strategy."
capricorn,2012-07-18,"It may not matter today how much you have prepared for a big event. You might be better off to throw your strategy to the winds and simply start all over again. Fortunately, this is not as difficult as it sounds, for the real lesson of the day is about releasing buried tensions and re-establishing any lost integrity. Toss your battle plan if you must, but don't negotiate away your feelings of security. Your chances for success are greater when you honor your own position."
aquarius,2012-07-18,"Although it seems as if you can't rely on anyone today, everything that's happening is actually a projection of your own experiences. You might be feeling as if you're stretched to a breaking point and the only solution is to stir things up even more by acting unpredictably. Don't resist the current changes; be the initiator instead of the victim."
pisces,2012-07-18,"An unexpected encounter might prompt you to question a long-standing belief that has come between you and someone else. You are tempted to just throw your hands up in despair and walk away from a conflict, but it's healthier to confront your fears, instead. Your world is transforming and you may have to alter your basic assumptions about yourself. Be courageous; stepping outside of your comfort zone and embracing change is the most direct path to re-establishing the stability you desire."
aries,2012-07-19,"Problems may arise today from your natural tendency to initiate action too quickly. You really want to make something special happen now, but are uncertain about how to move forward with the Cancer New Moon in your 4th House of Security. If your intuition suggests that it's not yet time to start anything, you are better off waiting. There's no reason to overcompensate by needlessly pushing your agenda too soon."
taurus,2012-07-19,"You might end up spending much of the day sticking close to familiar routines, without much of a desire to do more than is necessary. It's a quiet day, yet you have many things you want to say now that the Cancer New Moon occurs in your 3rd House of Communication. Speaking your piece is healthy, but listening to others is important, too. Your friends and co-workers will feel better if there is an equal give and take in their interactions with you."
gemini,2012-07-19,"You could use a healthy dose of peace and quiet now. Although there are social activities on your calendar, you also are advised to create some time to be alone. However, this isn't about being isolated or lonely. Rather, it is about listening to your own inner voice, which can all too often get crowded out by the everyday noises of your life. Meditating leaves you feeling rejuvenated and ready to mingle with others again."
cancer,2012-07-19,"When you're finished working today, head outside and catch some rays. Perhaps you could find time for some summer reading or listening to music. And even if you aren't inclined to be in the Sun, at least make sure you utilize today's New Moon in your sign to revitalize your soul. There's no need to worry about accomplishing much now; just enjoy the experience of swimming around in the sea of your colorful inner world."
leo,2012-07-19,"You have intense desires that are building just beneath the surface. Often you Lions are quite up-front and just tell it as it is, but today a more secretive mood comes over you because of the cautious Cancer New Moon that activates your 12th House of Spiritual Mystery. You don't have to act on every emotion, but neither do you have to push away your feelings, even if they further complicate your life. It's better to proactively deal with a complicated issue than it is to just stay quiet."
virgo,2012-07-19,"Getting together with your friends sounds like a good idea now that the Cancer New Moon falls in your 11th House of Companions. However, something may hold you back. Maybe you're busier than you want to be today. Since you are protective of your feelings, remember not to spread yourself too thin. If you end up partaking in some social fun, at least make it a low-key event. Save your energy for when you need it."
libra,2012-07-19,"Your ideal scenario today may consist of you crawling back into the privacy of your home and luxuriating in the idea that you don't need to go anywhere or see anyone. But unfortunately, reality doesn't let you off the hook so easily. You could be called upon to take responsibility for someone else and you must rise to the occasion. Nevertheless, you have invisible boundaries and still feel protected as if you are within your own shell, even if no one else notices."
scorpio,2012-07-19,"Your intense feelings draw you into uncharted waters today as the Cancer New Moon emphasizes your 9th House of Adventure. There is a haunting familiarity to the landscape, whether or not you are eager for the next adventure. You can't tell if you have been here before or if it was only a place that you imagined. Pay careful attention to all the details, for signs appear everywhere to reveal your future."
sagittarius,2012-07-19,"You may feel on-edge today with the Cancer New Moon in your 8th House of Intimacy, especially if you're pulled into an emotional drama that is one step over the edge of your comfort zone. Short of booking a ticket on an airplane, there isn't much that you can do to avoid the intensity. Forget about trying to escape; just sink into your feelings, armed with the knowledge that they will change soon enough. There's no reason to be overly concerned; you will be back to your buoyant self before you know it."
capricorn,2012-07-19,"You self-motivated Goats strive for stability now, even as you ambitiously climb higher on the mountain. But you don't feel as sure-footed as you seem; nevertheless, emotional waters are swirling around your feet today. Thankfully, it's perfectly safe to let your feet leave the ground. Swim through the mixed feelings, but don't try to hold on to any of them along the way."
aquarius,2012-07-19,"You can feel the shift as the Moon enters your 6th House of Routine, taking you away from the high-flying thoughts and drawing you into a pool of feelings about your daily life. Try as you might to separate out the strands of emotions, they are interwoven. You might feel as if this emotional fabric is so heavy that it's a burden. However, you're still advised to wear it as if it were your own. Paradoxically, accepting your obligations magically lightens your load."
pisces,2012-07-19,"Although the Cancer New Moon in your 5th House of Romance suggests that you might need to start anew with respect to love, you don't necessarily have to walk away from a current healthy relationship. Instead, consciously infuse your passions into a partnership, adding depth and magic to what you already have. But if you aren't in a relationship, you may be hesitant to jump into one now. Move slowly for the best results."
aries,2012-07-20,"You're probably feeling more positive about what you are doing with your life now, but you may be afraid of moving too fast and missing something important. You are enthused because it seems as if you just woke up from a deep sleep. However, rather than acting impulsively, it's best to proceed slowly and deliberately. If you work yourself into a frenzy of activity today, you might have to retreat so that you don't go over the edge."
taurus,2012-07-20,"Two facets of your personality clash today without a clear winner. Unfortunately, the more you try to hold on to your original plan, the harder it will be to resolve the current tension. Nevertheless, it's challenging to decide how far to go in reviewing and revising your agenda. You could end up wasting precious resources by making the wrong choice. Although uncertainty doesn't feel good, the best solutions will come on their own accord if you simply remain open to change."
gemini,2012-07-20,"You can easily run circles around everyone else now because you are at the top of your game. Others may find you irresistible today but it's crucial not to overplay your hand. If you appear too confident, you might attract the very same attention you were attempting to avoid. Your plans could backfire if you try too hard, so relax and let the day unfold at its own pace."
cancer,2012-07-20,"Opening your heart to a trustworthy companion today could make you a bit uncomfortable. As sensitive as you are, try not to get too caught up in the response you receive to your emotional disclosure. What anyone else thinks now isn't as important as what you are feeling. Ultimately, you are better off once you share what's on your mind, even if your trust isn't immediately reciprocated. The awkward moment is temporary, but your relationship will improve for the long-term if you're willing to take the risk."
leo,2012-07-20,"The Moon is back in your sign, encouraging you to let everyone know exactly what you want. However, expressing your needs could create problems if you seem too demanding. Concentrating on your desires prevents you from being fully present in a relationship, and you may not even notice if another person is already offering you love and support. Paradoxically, removing yourself from the spotlight is a more reliable path to satisfaction now, so focus on others rather than yourself."
virgo,2012-07-20,"What someone doesn't say now can grab your attention, as if the unspoken words have additional power because they are kept secret. Your fear of the unknown might create a simple misunderstanding, especially if you assume the worst. But don't try to fast talk your way around an awkward situation. Instead of lingering on your uncertainty, just say what's on your mind and then move on."
libra,2012-07-20,"Someone comes through for you today, offering an enjoyable escape or a more meaningful chance to share what's on your mind. If there's nothing already on your social calendar, pick up the phone, call a few friends and see what kind of fun is possible. This can be a very satisfying day, but it may not amount to much unless you are willing to take responsibility to make something special happen."
scorpio,2012-07-20,"You might try to present yourself in a more official manner now that the demonstrative Leo Moon is visiting your 10th House of Public Status. However, you could inadvertently forget about your position and share more of yourself today than you intend. Acting professionally is a smart idea since your job needs to come first at this time. Even though you shouldn't leave your emotions completely out of the picture, you are not under any obligation to reveal your secrets to anyone else."
sagittarius,2012-07-20,"You're encouraged by what's happening now, but there is still missing information out there for you to uncover. Thankfully, you can enjoy your little hunt for critical data, but not if you're just trying to amass personal power. Going into denial about the evidence is not a good idea, either; it's just that the facts may not be as clear as you like. If you catch yourself drifting off into fantasyland, consciously bring yourself back to what's real before you wander off too far."
capricorn,2012-07-20,"You might have to work harder than usual now because you believe that you must make a significant commitment to your career -- especially if you are to reach your goals. However, your current fear of failure may just be a symptom of a deeper issue. Harsh self-judgment could stem from your uneasiness with your own ambitions. Be more accepting of what you have already accomplished instead of needlessly worrying about what's next."
aquarius,2012-07-20,"Tension in a partnership bubbles to the surface today, even if you didn't see it coming. It's quite likely that things are going well, yet there still may be difficult interactions as you express your ambiguity about your role in the relationship. Striving for clarity helps sweep away your clouds of uncertainty. Getting the conversational ball rolling will enable both parties to express their positions clearly so you can work toward establishing common ground."
pisces,2012-07-20,"You might need to spend extra time in service to others now without receiving the recognition you deserve. This lack of acknowledgment could bring up old issues of low self-esteem. You don't necessarily want to be in the spotlight, but you still may have resentment if someone else receives the applause. If this is an ongoing problem, it's time to let those involved know. As long as your intentions are for the good of all, speak from your heart."
aries,2012-07-21,"You expend a lot of mental energy these days thinking about relationships. Even if you realize that burying your feelings isn't healthy, it's still tempting to slip into denial. Stop worrying about what might happen if you lose control; using logic to distance yourself from your emotions doesn't help now. There's nothing to be gained by attaching rational thoughts to irrational desires. Don't complicate matters with unnecessary expectations."
taurus,2012-07-21,"Thankfully whatever resistance you have recently experienced settles into the background now, allowing you to be more comfortable in your own skin. Use your time to tackle a creative project today, even if it doesn't have any specific purpose. The process of doing something strictly for your own enjoyment may unlock other more practical possibilities to pursue. Follow your bliss and enjoy the journey along the way."
gemini,2012-07-21,"You're searching for clarity about how to reach your long-term goals. Your emotions may seem erratic at times, yet standing on the edge of the future is the most exciting thing imaginable now. You're considering what's most important and seeking ways to integrate your personal needs into the larger circumstances of your life. However, you have thought about everything long enough. Go for it; taking a risk isn't as risky as you think."
cancer,2012-07-21,"Although everything may appear very still today, you know that a storm is building on the horizon. You can feel it in every cell of your body. Something big is brewing now and you're not fooled by the apparent calm. Be cool and collected as you approach pockets of emotional turbulence. Thankfully, once your needs and fears are addressed, your uneasy anticipation will be alleviated. Having a heart-to-heart talk with one of your close friends can supply you with all the support you need."
leo,2012-07-21,"You might think that this is a now-or-never day as you sort through your choices. It feels like you have to do something quickly or the window of opportunity will begin to close. To a certain extent, this is true; opportunities will be fewer and farther apart during the next few weeks, so make your move as soon as possible. However, there's no need to panic; let your confidence lead the way."
virgo,2012-07-21,"You may have chores that you must finish up during the first half of the day. If you are attentive to your commitments, you will be ready to react to a new set of needs and desires as they become more pressing later in the afternoon. Find clarity within your own mind before trying to impose your position on the rest of the world. Take the time you need to sort out what matters most to your heart."
libra,2012-07-21,"You better get to work if you have a deadline looming, whether it's imposed by outside circumstances or by your own desire for completion. Either way, it's crucial to stay on track today. These past weeks have been rather hectic, but now it's time to focus your intentions and apply your talents to what's right in front of you. Don't worry about next year; concentrate on the present moment and do your best."
scorpio,2012-07-21,"Your visions become more grounded now that the Moon shifts into Virgo, a practical Earth sign. Instinctively you know how your dreams co-create your future. This is very serious work and you're surely not going to waste it on unrealistic illusions that are so idealistic they have no possibility of fulfillment. Even if you know your limits, don't let them hold you back from doing something extraordinary."
sagittarius,2012-07-21,"Circumstances pull your thoughts and feelings back to earth today. You are needed by others at work and at home, so your own personal agenda may have to be placed on the back burner for a while. Nevertheless, you still harbor deep feelings that drive you to make your life more meaningful. There's no reason to be satisfied with the status quo. Dream big and reach for the stars."
capricorn,2012-07-21,"Although you may have trouble focusing your attention for the first part of the day, you're ready to get to work by the time the Moon enters industrious Virgo. But your good intentions aren't enough because your brain is buzzing with exciting ideas. Instead of trying to limit your expression by settling into comfortable old routines, try a radical new approach. Even if it takes longer to finish a task, it's more interesting to take the scenic route and explore alternative options along the way."
aquarius,2012-07-21,"You may prefer to do a project on your own today, but someone plays an important role in your day anyhow. Needless to say, this could be frustrating since you will need to make compromises in order to earn the support of others. Even if you resist engaging in social games to get assistance, you can turn things around by changing your attitude. Everything will fall into place if you express your gratitude instead of displaying your irritation. Approaching the situation with an open mind makes all the difference."
pisces,2012-07-21,"You might feel as if you're falling short today, especially if others are overly critical of what you're doing. Thankfully, someone's harsh judgment may say more about his or her insecurity than about your behavior. Don't take it personally; instead of being defensive, listen to what's being said and use it as a catalyst for improving your work. The best way to prove yourself is to take your game to a higher level."
aries,2012-07-22,"You are eager to sound the trumpets and blow the horns today because there isn't anything holding you back. Trickster Mercury in the outgoing sign of Leo the Lion is energized by action-hero Mars. If you play your cards right, fun and games are just around the corner. Just remember that with Mercury retrograde, it may take a bit longer than you think to finish up your work before you begin to play."
taurus,2012-07-22,"You may talk about all the things you want to do today, but it's hard to turn your thoughts into action. Your schemes and dreams about making a lot of money might not amount to much now, especially if you decide to just stay home and let the rest of the world go by. There's really no need to be concerned if you don't accomplish a lot; it's a perfect day to chill out and enjoy the company of your family and friends."
gemini,2012-07-22,"Although your key planet Mercury is retrograde, you're not likely to experience any communication difficulties today because positive planetary aspects remediate any problems. The Sun's shift into expressive Leo and your 3rd House of Information adds energy to your words. You're able to explain your ideas in a very straightforward manner now, so don't hesitate to share what's on your mind while the intellectual force is with you."
cancer,2012-07-22,"This is a practical and down-to-earth day. You need to find a natural outlet for your creativity so you can fire it up at will to do a particular project. You are feeling the urge to get back to basics and simplify your life. The most enjoyable sources of fulfillment now come from simple activities like working in your garden, cleaning your home, or getting creative your kitchen."
leo,2012-07-22,"Now that the Sun is in your royal sign, you have a good reason to feel like you're the center of your own universe. Your current confidence enables you to act magnanimously, even if you don't have the resources to give as generously as you would like. Luckily, doing something special for others doesn't have to cost money. Visit a lonely friend or relative, help a neighbor with a chore, or just be there to listen for someone who needs it."
virgo,2012-07-22,"Your creative juices are cooking today, but in a very pragmatic manner. You want to play a role in putting on a show, but you're content to work behind the scenes. You really don't need to be on center stage and you might even be relieved if you can maintain some anonymity. Ultimately, you wouldn't really mind a little recognition now, so show up and give others a chance to acknowledge your contribution."
libra,2012-07-22,"The Sun's shift into proud Leo is uplifting for all you purveyors of harmony and justice. You resonate with the Leo concept of needing appreciation, and perhaps you feel as if you are long overdue for some recognition of your own. Relax; these next few weeks can bring you more popularity with your peers, resulting in some memorable and meaningful experiences. It's time to kick back, enjoy your friends and have a good time."
scorpio,2012-07-22,"You've been the beneficiary of harmonious aspects from the planets as they traveled through sensitive Cancer. However, it seems as if the connection to your emotional life is temporarily slipping out of your grasp today. Don't worry, the feelings will return, but for now you are being called into action. Even if you don't like this phase as much, you have a lot to gain and, certainly, more work to do. Place action, not contemplation, at the top of your agenda."
sagittarius,2012-07-22,"You're back in your comfort zone with the Sun in loyal Leo. You may have struggled against deepening your involvement with unfamiliar feelings. However, day by day, the positive energy is growing brighter and you are ready to have a good time dancing in the summer Sun. Try not to get hung up on the details. Focus on the big picture now instead."
capricorn,2012-07-22,"You might feel any hopes for simplicity slip away like the Sun does on a late summer evening. Once night falls, you grow more aware of the beauty hidden within the mysteries of the unknown. However, you may be frightened, wishing that you could turn on the lights. Unfortunately, your real work now is not about shining radiance into the shadows. Instead it's about transforming the darkness into something that can have a positive impact on your future."
aquarius,2012-07-22,"You might feel the need to escape today, but current circumstances won't let you until you finish your chores. Although you may try to sneak away, you will need a really good excuse to avoid your responsibilities. But instead of jumping through hoops trying to get out of work, you might as well just accept that there's no easy way out. Fulfill your promises and then claim some guilt-free play time later on."
pisces,2012-07-22,"People seem to be noticing you and your work now, even if you would rather remain off the public radar screen. This newfound popularity isn't a negative thing, but you really aren't looking for attention today. Although you're not into flashy egocentric activities, accept the spotlight that is going to find you whether you want it to or not. Bask in the positive vibes coming your way."
aries,2012-07-23,"It's challenging to know how much to reveal when talking about a current problem. You might believe that you have a concrete plan that will work, but you are likely to misjudge the size of the task. Unfortunately, you don't have sufficient time to go back to the drawing board. You must simply engage the issue in real time without certainty and do the best you can. The more you take care of today, the easier it will be tomorrow."
taurus,2012-07-23,"You might have thought that minimal effort would be enough to accomplish your goals today, but it's beginning to dawn on you that it's going to take a lot more work. Fortunately, you're not easily discouraged and anyway, being hard on yourself is counterproductive. If unexpected difficulties slow you down now, keep applying steady pressure for the best possible results."
gemini,2012-07-23,"It doesn't matter how hard you're pushing yourself now or how fast you are already going, since you're dependent on circumstances outside of your control. The smartest strategy is to consciously slow down before someone else does it for you. It may be frustrating trying to overcome the current resistances head on. Instead, relax and let the events dictate the speed at which you move. Take it easy and enjoy the journey rather than focusing on your destination."
cancer,2012-07-23,"A complete shift of plans might be somewhat upsetting, even if it's necessary. Remember that your ideas may be totally valid; you just need to take something into account that wasn't apparent when you first made your plans. Don't look at the difficulties you face as a failure. This is merely a test to see if you are listening to the feedback the universe is giving you."
leo,2012-07-23,"Your determination continues to create progress in your life, but it's useful to stop long enough to take stock in what you have already accomplished. Make time to analyze what you truly want and then revise your plans so they reflect your desires. Don't worry if satisfaction seems just out of reach now. Do what you must while believing that the good times will return."
virgo,2012-07-23,"You are becoming increasingly focused on your goals, but the Moon in your sign stirs dissatisfaction with your current situation. Before initiating any major changes in your life, make a list of what you have already done and what is left to do. Finish up as much as you can, even if your work isn't quite up to your exacting standards. You'll feel much better about what's going on now as you look forward to something special in your future."
libra,2012-07-23,"Your desire to keep everyone happy may be challenged today, especially if you believe that you can change someone else's feelings. Ironically, the more you push for peace, the more you contribute to the tension. An awkward interaction has all the makings of a losing battle. Nevertheless, exercising patience and letting go of control can allow for an equitable solution."
scorpio,2012-07-23,"You may feel uneasy about a topic you don't really want to discuss now, even though your inner voice encourages you to speak up. Nevertheless, you might still try to avoid a subject that could complicate a close relationship. Fortunately, you should be able to push past your resistance because you know that temporarily making a situation worse can actually transform it to ultimately bring you happiness. A calculated risk could clear the air of tension that's been lingering around for too long."
sagittarius,2012-07-23,"Although your life appears to be running smoothly, you could find yourself working through an unexpected crisis with a close friend or co-worker today. Someone with good intentions might not realize that you're upset and the more others say or do now, the worse you feel. But there's no need to stop anyone from talking because that will only raise the frustration level even higher. It's best to take a break and wait it out; everything will settle down faster than you think."
capricorn,2012-07-23,"You are a natural when it comes to sensible planning. You're able to work long and hard to reach your goals. Usually, you reserve some energy for when you need it, but something is pushing you from within now and tempting you to burn all your fuel at once. Nevertheless, it's really not a good idea. You won't get what you want any faster, so retain some resources for next month when you will surely need them to sustain your momentum."
aquarius,2012-07-23,"You may attempt to slog your way through an obstacle course that continues to hold you back, but you'll face the consequences of your foolishness unless you get it right. This isn't the best time to try an unproven shortcut or any clever maneuvers. Simply apply yourself in a steady manner, even if you don't seem to be making a lot of progress. There's no need for panic; you are accomplishing more than you realize and others will soon notice your work."
pisces,2012-07-23,"There's no quick escape route for you now, so don't even bother wasting your time and energy trying to avoid your work. However, backing off just a little is a good idea; it allows someone else to take the reins for a while. Sharing the burden of leadership lightens your sense of responsibility and can bring you a bit of much-needed freedom. The changes may not be huge, but even a small shift has a positive effect on your attitude."
aries,2012-07-24,"You want to believe the best about others now, yet you could be led off course by your incorrect interpretation of their intentions. Unfortunately, your willingness to accept people at face value can create problems. Although everything might truly be fine, it's still helpful to moderate your optimism. Being realistic about your relationships prevents setting yourself up for disappointment. Instead of pinning your hopes on anyone else, just express yourself clearly and move on."
taurus,2012-07-24,"You might have unrealistic expectations about what you want to accomplish at work today. Although you're wise to be cautious about the situation appearing disarmingly good, there's no reason to be overly negative, either. As long as you remain practical now, everything should work out OK. Maintaining integrity is your ticket to success."
gemini,2012-07-24,"Your key planet Mercury harmoniously sextiles optimistic Jupiter today, enabling you to see the big picture and inspire others. This visionary outlook encourages you to solve a pressing problem, but you also might be tempted to minimize the upcoming challenges. Don't exaggerate your ability to handle everything by yourself; be smart and ask for help when you need it."
cancer,2012-07-24,"You might spend extra time reminiscing about childhood memories that are stimulated by something that happens at home today. Even if you must go to work, it's difficult to shake off these powerful recollections, whether they are mildly irritating or sweetly nostalgic. Enjoy your fantasies, but make sure to find your way back to the present moment as soon as you can. Revisiting the past is only useful if you apply what you learn to your current circumstances."
leo,2012-07-24,"The people in your immediate surroundings are your greatest supporters now, but you have to invite them to help or you might miss the benefits of what they could offer. Don't pretend that you are more self-sufficient than you truly are. It is your vulnerability that sets the stage for the magic to happen."
virgo,2012-07-24,"Your key planet Mercury forms a cooperative sextile with philosophical Jupiter today, increasing the potential to inspire others with your words. Your insights offer workable solutions to problems that have reached an impasse. Trusting your instincts should guide you toward an acceptable resolution for all involved."
libra,2012-07-24,"Your sweet charm is your best tool today as you make the best of a tough situation. The reflective Moon in your sign arouses your emotions and you're able to use this to your advantage. Covering up your feelings isn't a sensible strategy; express them naturally and let the events of the day flow wherever they take you. Thankfully, you can effectively say what's on your mind while still being kindhearted in your interactions with others."
scorpio,2012-07-24,"It's not a big surprise; others know that you are hiding some of your emotions. And it's quite likely that you could be holding a wild card up your sleeve. Your intuition tells you to enjoy everything while you can, but an irrepressible smile on your face will likely give your secret away. Nevertheless, wait until you're ready before you share your news."
sagittarius,2012-07-24,"You may be inclined to concentrate on the social aspects of your job now, rather than paying attention to a specific task in front of you. Fortunately, you're less constrained by your previous commitments so you can enjoy your time with others, even in a professional situation. Just remember that this doesn't mean you should let your obligations slip. Finding the proper balance between work and play is your best bet."
capricorn,2012-07-24,"You might finally receive peer recognition for your hard work or maybe even get a long-awaited raise. Your regular caution is dissipating now. In fact, you could turn today's event into something more than it really is. Bask in the light of recognition while it shines on you, but remember that things can quickly return to normal. Nevertheless, the positive feelings are yours to hold on to forever."
aquarius,2012-07-24,"It seems as if there are fewer restraints on your life today, yet you ultimately still have to answer to the same authorities as before. It's just that you can see more options now and are eager to start exploring them. Be careful that you don't overextend yourself. Consider where you want to go before you agree to a plan that ends up taking you somewhere completely different."
pisces,2012-07-24,"You want to be fair, but you may have already made up your mind based on what someone else said. Unfortunately, your inflexibility could close the door on a conversation that's waiting to happen. Thankfully, the Moon's presence in your 8th House of Intimacy increases your desire to delve beneath the surface issues. Get the ball rolling; intense discussions can lead to creating common ground, especially if you are open to changing your mind."
aries,2012-07-25,"Although your intentions are clear today, your follow-through might fall short of success. Your words get muddled and your ideas can be lost in what appears to be sloppy thinking. Thankfully, your uncertainty also offers the possibility of inspiration. Stop trying to convince everyone that your way is the only path to success. There's no need to justify your feelings."
taurus,2012-07-25,"It's tough to settle down and live in the present moment because your mind is hyperactive today. You are easily distracted by co-workers or friends who engage you in discussions about everything except what you should be doing. Establishing boundaries may be futile, since you find each and every conversation quite fascinating. There's no need to make sense of it all now; just float through the day with as little resistance as possible."
gemini,2012-07-25,"You can skip your second cup of coffee today because your brain is exploding with too many crazy ideas. It's nearly impossible to focus on any one of them long enough to matter. Just when you realize how to make use of a new concept, something distracts you and you're off to ride the next train of thoughts. Instead of trying to control your thinking now, let the stream of consciousness take you wherever it flows. You will be able to regain your concentration with a fresh attitude tomorrow."
cancer,2012-07-25,"There is a lot going on in your world today, yet you have the ability to limit your field of perceptions to drown out much of the noise. Others are impressed by your apparent calmness in the middle of chaos, and you can use this to your advantage. Don't let anyone know if you are lacking in confidence now; everyone's faith in you will ultimately inspire you to perform your tasks even better."
leo,2012-07-25,"You can speak your piece in a manner that sounds more casual than you actually feel today. Your uncertainty about a recent choice makes it easy to set your personal agenda aside for a while and follow any whim that comes along, even if it doesn't support your long-term goals. It's impossible to know what the universe has in store for you now, but rest assured that there's a master plan that you haven't seen yet."
virgo,2012-07-25,"You may be feeling on edge today, but you can't connect your free-floating anxiety to any single cause. Instead of just forgetting your concerns, you might attempt to exert more control over your immediate environment, but this isn't a useful strategy now. The tighter you hold on to the reins of reality, the more surprises you will encounter. Instead, yielding to external circumstances alleviates the building pressure and soothes your ruffled feathers."
libra,2012-07-25,"Self-doubt is a waste of your time and energy, but questioning the viability of your strategy today is not. Daydreams may float in and out of awareness throughout the day, yet you should be able to recognize the fantasies and separate them from your more realistic thoughts. Be courageous and think outside of the box now, for your most radical ideas could be your best ones."
scorpio,2012-07-25,"A close friend may come to the rescue today with practical advice. But you aren't sure that you want help and are tempted to reject any outside interference. Instead of viewing any offers as an indication of your failure, turn this into an opportunity to deepen the bonds between you and someone else. Remember, accepting assistance from those you trust is a sign of intelligence and strength."
sagittarius,2012-07-25,"You're so concerned about doing the right thing now that you might miss your chance to make real connections with your friends or associates. You may feel as if you've been pushed to the edge as decisions bear down on you. However, it's not smart to make a choice if you are feeling pressured. Instead of worrying about your next move, take some time to explore your relationships without placing any encumbering expectations on your experience."
capricorn,2012-07-25,"You may be trying to nail down your work agenda, but there are too many variables at play today. Since you are normally such an efficient planner you expect everything to fall into place, yet this day continues to defy your rational analysis. It might be wiser now to leave loose ends untied and return to them in the future. Knowing when to step back from a task saves you from a lot of frustration in the long run."
aquarius,2012-07-25,"Your key planet Uranus is buzzing today as it forms a harmonious trine with communicator Mercury. You certainly could shine brightly at work because everyone thinks you're so clever now. But stay cool and don't make a big deal of anyone's judgments or expectations. Instead, follow your instincts without revealing too much about how you make your decisions. You might be jumping to conclusions, but you'll probably be right nonetheless."
pisces,2012-07-25,"You may actually think that your strategy is invincible today until something happens that requires you to reconsider your assumptions. Instead of being overly protective of a plan that isn't working, strengthen your position by going back to the drawing board with the new information. Fortunately, things should go much smoother after a mid-course correction."
aries,2012-07-26,"Waiting for what happens next requires more effort than just dealing with a current situation, yet an immediate solution seems elusive. You wish that you could relax your jangled nerves today, but it feels as if you have a significant part to play in a power struggle and haven't been given a script to follow. Being flexible is crucial; stay loose and you will be ready to engage in the drama as it happens."
taurus,2012-07-26,"You might wish that you could get back to a familiar routine today, but something isn't quite right. No matter how many ways you analyze the facts, you still don't seem to be able to put your finger on the source of the problem. Unfortunately, you can't just banish the lingering discontentment by avoiding the subject. Thankfully, talking with your friends in a cool and calm manner helps to ease your emotional discomfort and puts you in a positive frame of mind."
gemini,2012-07-26,"You think that you know what you should do today, especially if you've given it a lot of thought before you made up your mind. Unfortunately, reality isn't necessarily as cooperative as you wish. It might seem as if the universe is resisting your decisions now for no apparent reason. Don't be overly concerned if there's a gap between your desires and your current circumstances. Keep your eye on the destination; although it may take a few days, the conflict will resolve on its own."
cancer,2012-07-26,"You might feel as if you have stewed in your own juices long enough. You're ready to act on what you know today, even if you cannot see where your current decision will ultimately lead. It may be challenging to accept the instability at work, but your needs must also be taken into consideration when making choices now. Don't reject what doesn't fit in; success is more attainable when your professional aspirations are in harmony with your personal goals."
leo,2012-07-26,"You might feel overwhelmed by the feelings that tug on your heartstrings today. Unfortunately, you let yourself get hooked by the dramas of life too easily. Luckily, your inner strength can save you now. Even if you believe you're exempt from playing by the same rules as everyone else, at least remember that open and honest communication is still the most important thing."
virgo,2012-07-26,"Coming to terms with your powerful desires may require that you do a few mental gymnastics today. However, it's not as simple as you wish because clever Mercury is being sideswiped by mysterious Pluto. One minute you have everything figured out and then just a few minutes later, you're not so sure. For now, it's wise to take yourself a little less seriously. Having a healthy sense of humor is like using a lubricating oil that makes everything move along with less friction."
libra,2012-07-26,"Whatever positive intentions you have now, they might not be sufficient to carry you through the day. Other people seem to be testing your composure to see if you can maintain your cool and still act graciously, even if you're secretly ready to explode. Fortunately, you won't lose your temper if you remember to release pressure gradually by expressing your feelings before they build to a critical level. Take a deep breath before you speak."
scorpio,2012-07-26,"You might be so focused on the outcome of a current work project that you become distracted from what's happening in the present moment. The reflective Moon in your sign increases your connection to your subconscious mind, making it even more crucial to maintain a handle on what is real now. Honor the creativity that comes from your imagination while staying aware of what matters most."
sagittarius,2012-07-26,"You could work yourself into a state of high anxiety today as you strive to manage the complexities of your life. Thankfully, circumstances aren't as overwhelming as they seem, yet your annoyance is real, nonetheless. Previous obligations may prevent you from being as socially active as you wish. Luckily, there's no need to worry so much; many of the situations that are up in the air will sort themselves out within the next week."
capricorn,2012-07-26,"Your life is full of contradictions today because you must put out fires by responding to multiple situations. Paradoxically, you don't seem to be overly concerned about what's happening. It's not that you don't care; it's just that you have so much on your plate now that it's nearly impossible to get overly involved in any single issue. Thankfully, this detachment can work to your advantage by enabling you to stay calm while handling the demands of the day."
aquarius,2012-07-26,"A disagreement that springs up over differing points of view could be blown out of proportion today. Although there may be a very real issue behind the current dispute, it's also possible that you're battling with your own imagination. Anger can rear its ugly head, stemming from something entirely unrelated, such as your inability to reach your stated goals. Assuming full responsibility for your own success or failure minimizes the possibility of taking your frustration out on the wrong person."
pisces,2012-07-26,"You may feel agitated about something at work today, but you don't have an obvious target for your nervous energy. Powerful emotions that are stirring in your subconscious motivate you to find courage you didn't know you had. Listen carefully to what you are being told now, even if the message isn't what you want to hear. Instead of acting on your first impulse, wait for the deeper lessons to emerge before making your move."
aries,2012-07-27,"You Rams like to be in control of your own fate, but these days you may spend more time responding to external situations than creating your own events. You're dependent on people for the skills they have and the resources they bring. Thankfully, you can still manifest your own destiny. Just be certain to take others into consideration in order to maximize your potential."
taurus,2012-07-27,"You have been slipping in and out of a fantasy recently, trying to establish a basis for it in the reality of your life. However, people in your immediate environment cannot be ignored now, and unfortunately they don't seem interested in making your dreams come true. Instead of withdrawing from others, it's better to engage them fully. Your chances for success improve when you face the facts instead of running into the safety of your dreams."
gemini,2012-07-27,"You won't be able to sail around the tricky waters you find yourself in today. Although the situation is still developing, you already see that you must separate out the big ideas floating around so you can really dive into a specific problem. Temporarily setting aside your personal desires helps you manage the volatility of the current situation. Save the important discussions for next week when the planets are more conducive for resolving tension."
cancer,2012-07-27,"You're able to express your passions creatively today with the emotional Scorpio Moon's presence in your 5th House of Spontaneity. Luckily, you can have fun now without sacrificing depth of feeling, and your intensity is appreciated by others. Romance is favored if you're willing to show your vulnerability by asking for what you want. You might be pleasantly surprised with the immediate response you receive once you share your heart."
leo,2012-07-27,"Difficult communications on the home front might lead to a weekend conflict. Fortunately, today's annoyance won't necessarily turn into tomorrow's confrontation if you're willing to exhibit flexibility in your interactions with a close friend or partner. Ease the pressure by facing the feelings that are lurking beneath the surface and bringing them out into the open. Even if an honest conversation feels awkward at first, it will clear the air of the tension before it gets out of hand."
virgo,2012-07-27,"Communication may be strained over the next few days, but it's crucial to maintain a healthy perspective today instead of focusing on an issue that ultimately doesn't matter. Your biggest concern isn't what to say; it's whether or not to say anything at all. However, denying the problem isn't a long-term solution, so sit down for a heartfelt discussion now before it is too late."
libra,2012-07-27,"The keel of your boat has been keeping you level, but you're still afraid of hitting rocks that you cannot see today. It's difficult to tell if you are riding deeper in the water now or if it's just growing shallow. Either way, you have to get to the bottom of a dilemma in order to re-establish your equilibrium. Once you have planted your feet back on the ground by acknowledging your core values, your vessel will regain its proper attitude. Maintaining balance is easier when you know where you stand."
scorpio,2012-07-27,"Normally, the Moon's monthly visit to your sign is an emotional journey into your private world of unexpressed feelings. However, this time it's complicated because someone seems to be withholding information from you. Thankfully, there's no need to struggle for understanding now; it may just be your insecurities rising to the surface. Simply observe what's happening around you; everything will make more sense tomorrow."
sagittarius,2012-07-27,"You are tempted to withdraw into your own little world by heading off to a monastery or just hiding out in your office, but retreat isn't an option at this time. There are too many demands being made on you now. You have the responsibility to be clear in your thinking -- not only for your own benefit, but also for those who depend on you. Struggling to stay in the communication loop today will pay off over the weekend when social activities bring you the satisfaction you seek."
capricorn,2012-07-27,"You may be stressed today if you have responsibilities to fulfill that aren't in your best interest. You know what your long-term goals are, but you might be required to set them aside for a while to do your job. The more you can keep your mind focused on the immediate tasks, the faster you will finish. However, others seem to be distracting you as if it is some sort of parlor game. Play along by acknowledging them, but remember to return to your work as soon as possible."
aquarius,2012-07-27,"You are not afraid of complications; in fact, you're often attracted to difficult mental puzzles and complex mechanical concepts. However, you don't enjoy entangled emotional issues as much. Unfortunately, there may be some weird power struggles in your life that you cannot understand. Don't push for resolution yet. Your patience will be rewarded and you should be able to settle the score next week without conflict."
pisces,2012-07-27,"It seems as if you can feel every single wave in the sea of consciousness today, yet it's an impossible task to know what to do with all your perceptions. The emotional intensity may be so overwhelming that you might feel like giving up. However, your current key to success is to concentrate on the small things and do them well. Leave the big picture for another day."
aries,2012-07-28,"You might not realize just how positive you're feeling today, even if you naturally assume everything will work out in the end. You have the strength to face a tough issue now as your unending optimism overrides reality, empowering you to take risks and do great things. But the bad news is how detached from reality you could get. Keep in mind that you do your best work if you can see the potential without losing authenticity."
taurus,2012-07-28,"Uncertainty overshadows your life today as you might become more confused about your overall direction. However, you don't necessarily have to start something entirely different or try a whole new approach. The good news is that you can visualize potential everywhere you look, even if it didn't previously exist. Stay open to the all the exciting roads that appear, but don't commit to any one path at this time."
gemini,2012-07-28,"Someone might try to convince you to get more involved with a project you're not so sure about, or maybe others are enticing you to skip your responsibilities today so you can join their party. Either way, you may be stressed out by the pressure before you're ready to make a decision. After serious deliberation, you'll probably choose the fun over the work anyway. This is a sensible choice if you make time to finish up your chores later."
cancer,2012-07-28,"You might fantasize about breaking out of your secure routine now, but you're probably not ready to do it. Don't waste your limited energy by questioning your prudence. Instead, trust your instincts. It  will be more productive in the long run to make small adjustments gradually than instigating one big change today."
leo,2012-07-28,"You are the king or queen of the jungle and you're roaring with confidence today. Maybe you're secretly inspired by knowing how proudly you would strut your stuff if you tried. Nevertheless, you should be cautious since imagination is not the same thing as reality. Don't be complacent. Make your dreams come true by giving them voice and taking decisive action."
virgo,2012-07-28,"Your emotions may be triggered by the strangest things and the uncomfortable part of it is that you might feel out of control now. This isn't so bad, for sometimes you are so careful that you place unnecessary limits upon yourself. Don't try to restrain yourself today; let your feelings flow and take advantage of whatever inspires you the most. Follow your bliss and see where it goes."
libra,2012-07-28,"If your life is on the upswing, you might be afraid that this positive phase won't last too much longer. Although nothing is permanent, stressing about unforeseen trouble is most likely a waste of a beautiful day. By consciously focusing your attention on the present moment, the good times will last longer than you expect."
scorpio,2012-07-28,"Although you may feel as if you created an impossible dilemma, self-doubt or self-criticism is a waste of your precious time. You will only make matters worse by thinking about all the things you should have done differently. Luckily, today's upbeat Sagittarius Moon illuminates your 2nd House of Self-Worth, supplying the strength you need to reach your goals. Concentrating on your skills instead of your shortcomings empowers you to work wonders and make up for past mistakes."
sagittarius,2012-07-28,"Your emotions are close to the surface today with the Moon back in your cavalier sign, yet her opposition to your ruling planet, Jupiter, suggests you might easily overlook a critical detail. Logically, what you want to do may seem beyond reach now. Nevertheless, your optimism could serve you well because the impossible is probably more attainable than you think. You'll never know if you don't spread your wings and try."
capricorn,2012-07-28,"Your attempts to discover who is working against you may not be very effective today. You might be told to reveal a secret, yet you're reluctant to open up too quickly. However, you're likely to gain more support now if you are forthcoming with your intentions. Revealing some facts about yourself can be useful to re-establishing a climate of trust and helping you reach your goals."
aquarius,2012-07-28,"You may have a case of incurable optimism today, but an unexpected outburst of emotional energy could leave you wondering what happened. Fortunately, you are able to transform a difficult situation into one that has great potential, but you must not attach your happiness to any one specific outcome. If you can maintain a cool and calm disposition now, you just might be unstoppable at whatever you do."
pisces,2012-07-28,"You are intuitively wide open, whether or not you acknowledge such things. Luckily, you're likely to receive an uplifting jolt of cosmic juice today. However, you might not believe you have a viable course of action to take and may not know what to do next. It's crucial to keep your emotions under control; the upcoming changes will be much easier to navigate if you rely on logic to keep your life in balance."
aries,2012-07-29,"Your spirits soar with the Sagittarius Moon, allowing you to fly above the situations complicating your life. It's not that the pressing predicaments have gone away. Although your current challenges are still unresolved, it may seem as if you're on a temporary holiday today. Nevertheless, feel free to imagine that you are visiting your own future, even if it's only in your mind. Your positive thoughts can have more of an uplifting impact on your life than you might think."
taurus,2012-07-29,"This may be a dreamy day, but it doesn't mean that your wishes will automatically manifest according to your favorite fantasies. However, being practical is not the answer; it's about using your imagination to get what you want. Acknowledging that you're extremely idealistic now might not help you reach your goals, but it can prevent disappointment from setting in when you realize the limits of reality."
gemini,2012-07-29,"The tension in a relationship may be exacerbated by your unrealistic ideas today. Grandiose plans don't create problems by themselves; the difficulty stems from the apparent impossibility of carrying out your adventures in the real world. Nevertheless, it's not helpful to needlessly worry about what happens next. Just make sure others realize that you know the difference between the facts and your fantasies."
cancer,2012-07-29,"Just as you were thinking about sinking into the deep emotional stew, someone turns up the heat enough that you decide to change your mind. Your current discomfort is alleviated when you rise above the drama by refocusing on a project you put aside a few days ago. Remember, you're not escaping from responsibility; the unresolved issues will still be there upon your return."
leo,2012-07-29,"A gentle breeze blows through the balmy backwaters of your mind. It's just enough to remind you of something that you really want. The refreshing movement is actually a sign that you are not as stuck as you believe. Although the changes you desire won't likely happen today, you should feel better just knowing that they're not as far away as you thought."
virgo,2012-07-29,"You may feel like you're trapped today, but it's likely that you're actually being nurtured by someone special. However, the support you receive doesn't necessarily improve the circumstances that ultimately need to change. Your close friends may think that they're helping, but they could be exerting too much emotional control in the process. Thankfully, this imbalance won't last long, so just go along with the present conditions for now, rather than making waves."
libra,2012-07-29,"You're feeling less self-contained now and you might be experiencing a strong need to communicate your thoughts to others. Your restlessness may be getting the best of you today, prompting you to get up and go. Heading outside is a good start; anything that stirs up the energy will also help you think better. Seek out like-minded souls who want to make a positive change and exchange ideas for further inspiration."
scorpio,2012-07-29,"The fiery Sagittarius Moon brings you a new perspective on all the powerful emotions you've been feeling lately. Life is taking on the appearance of a great adventure again, and although this can be scary, it is also exciting. Your higher self knows that you are on a path meant for you, alone. Be careful what you wish for, since your current desires help to crystallize your future."
sagittarius,2012-07-29,"The Moon's current visit to your sign signifies emotional rejuvenation, especially if you've recently experienced some turmoil. Whatever encouragement you receive today is good for you. However, the problem is that you may not get the rest you need, since the free-floating anxiety is still lingering in the atmosphere. Accept the idea that there aren't any quick fixes to your dilemma. Slowing down and living the life you have frees you to also create the life you want."
capricorn,2012-07-29,"It may feel as if a phase of your life is coming to a close today. However, there are still many things to do before launching your next project. Most importantly, give yourself enough time in order to deepen your relationships to those close to you. Regardless of any current interpersonal struggles you might be embroiled in today, take time to smell the flowers when you get the chance."
aquarius,2012-07-29,"Although you won't be able to avoid all the things you need to do today, at least now you can see some light at the end of the tunnel. The notion of finally coming out the other end is exciting, since it feels like you've been subterranean long enough. You're more than ready for the return of blue sky, but everyone else's schedules may prevent you from reaching your goal until later in the week. There's no need to be in a hurry; just rest assured you are on the right track."
pisces,2012-07-29,"You know what your obligations are today, but you may not be able to deliver on all of your promises. Thankfully, your intentions are honorable and you inspire others with your optimistic willingness to jump in to nearly any good cause. Unfortunately, you might inadvertently leave your own needs out of the equation. Taking care of yourself isn't being selfish; it's about assuring your health and welfare so you can continue to help others."
aries,2012-07-30,"Something wonderful is going to happen. Although you might not know what it is yet, you can feel it in every cell of your body. Perhaps your willingness to take more of a risk today is what stirs up the excitement. Just remember to discuss your intentions with others before involving them in your crazy plans, since they may not be as eager for the same kind of action."
taurus,2012-07-30,"You might not be able to get fully comfortable today and your restlessness isn't helping anyone else relax either. Your anxiety stems in part from what you aren't saying now. It's not productive to pretend that all is well if you wish you were doing something else. Remember, the first step to making others happy is to speak from your heart. Your true friends will understand that sometimes you need to follow your bliss."
gemini,2012-07-30,"Today's rumbling of excitement rattles your nerves. It may even be challenging to sit still because you want to move physically in resonance with your hyperactive mind. You have an endless string of clever ideas and witty remarks now, but unless you narrow your thinking, the day will end with little to show for all your brilliance. Channel your creativity wisely and use your extra energy to perform random acts of kindness."
cancer,2012-07-30,"Although you're normally afraid of losing control, you may have an uncharacteristic attraction to the rush of adrenaline today. You're up for almost anything, and if nothing exciting is going on, then you might step forward as the instigator. Obstacles fall to the wayside as you dance into a day filled with fun. Spread the joy; it's contagious."
leo,2012-07-30,"You seem to be in the flow today. Others think your light is shining brightly and that all is right in your world. However, your emotions are agitated and there's pandemonium beneath the surface, even if everything appears placid. This kind of intensity might normally be overwhelming, but now you are eager to shoot the rapids of the emotional white waters. Grab your metaphorical kayak and start paddling."
virgo,2012-07-30,"You want your co-workers to enjoy themselves and you're willing to expend an extraordinary level of energy to accomplish this goal today. This could be a very social day, so make the most of it by doing something outside your regular routine. Your approach to life is more unconventional than usual, which can be quite thrilling. Shine your light of love and good feelings will reflect back in return."
libra,2012-07-30,"Everyone expects you to be the steady backbone of the group, but you aren't interested in playing your regular role by trying to hold it all together today. You prefer your day to be without unnecessary social responsibilities, and could go to great lengths to make your point. Even if you don't want to upset others with your need to rebel, tell them what you desire. And don't act too surprised when you receive unexpected support from an unusual source."
scorpio,2012-07-30,"It's challenging to navigate a course between your need for a quiet retreat and your desire to partake in the scheduled festivities with everyone else. Your friends would like to spend more time with you now, since you can be more fun than you realize. Don't write off any social engagements just because you think it will distract you from your inner work. The juice you get from others gives you something special that solitude never will."
sagittarius,2012-07-30,"Group activities allow you to accomplish more today, but you might have to pay too steep of a price. Of course, being a part of a group can also be a lot of fun. Nevertheless, there's a rebellious part of you that wants to break loose and demonstrate your own unique individuality by striking out on your own. However, solitude isn't the best answer now. Chill out and allow others to do the planning and set the pace. All you need to do is show up and smile."
capricorn,2012-07-30,"Leave your sense of duty behind today so you can have some good old-fashioned fun. This irresponsible behavior may be difficult because you Goats work hard and aspire to greatness, but you truly deserve a break. Forget about your previous accomplishments and don't worry about what you need to do tomorrow. Just ride the exhilarating wave of enthusiasm now; letting go restores your spirit while also spicing up your life."
aquarius,2012-07-30,"This is a highly stimulating day, so it could be difficult to stay on target if you have specific tasks that need finishing. The Sun is illuminating your key planet, wild Uranus, giving you permission to get a little crazy in your interactions with friends and family. Go ahead, take a chance and embrace the unknown."
pisces,2012-07-30,"Everything is a bit more hectic today as your thoughts run around in circles. But this isn't just about a few random ideas; you actually seek out external events now to match your internal intensity. Unfortunately, you may feel disappointed if you can't find anyone special to share your passion, but don't let your frustration turn into discouragement. Instead, aim your energy outward and indulge in an activity for the sake of sheer enjoyment."
aries,2012-07-31,"You feel as if you have been riding a rollercoaster recently with all your emotional ups and downs. However, now you're more even-keeled as you get a handle on the relationship between what you desire and what you're willing to give up in order to get it. If you went overboard on your search for independence, it's time to be supportive of someone you love to heal the rift you possibly created."
taurus,2012-07-31,"You may be a very formidable opponent today, even if you're trying to steer clear of any sort of conflict. Your patience and determination can wear down someone who stands in your way. Your strength comes from your ability to avoid arguments, even if there's a noticeable difference of opinion. Don't push too hard; gentle persuasion works in your favor better than anything else."
gemini,2012-07-31,"You might be protective of your feelings now, but your quiet acceptance of others can help to create peace and harmony. Enjoy the current calm, but remember that it may just be the temporary eye in the center of a storm. Don't worry about justifying your unconventional goals to anyone today; you are well equipped to tell your story as long as you're not in a hurry. Slow and steady wins the race."
cancer,2012-07-31,"Someone could be secretly pulling strings behind the scenes in order to get his or her way. However, you're not willing to give up your power until you try to bend reality in your direction. It's challenging to deal with the situation if you don't know the whole truth. But instead of trying to uncover anyone's hidden agenda, just concentrate on your own positive action. Save the detective work for some other day."
leo,2012-07-31,"You know what's possible today and what's not. You have a realistic outlook on life now, indicating that this may be a good time to make a decision about a major purchase or a job change. But don't limit your options by playing it safe. A calculated risk could be your smartest strategy, especially if you're willing to act methodically, rather than impulsively."
virgo,2012-07-31,"Clarity returns today, allowing you to have confidence about an important decision you must make. However, it's a mistake to believe that your current choice is your final one because logical Mercury is retrograde in your 12th House of Destiny. You have a general understanding of where you are heading, but there are still specifics to be determined. Give yourself some breathing room so you can respond to the facts as you learn them."
libra,2012-07-31,"You probably know more than you're saying today and no one can get you to spill the beans. Perhaps a friend told you something in confidence, or maybe you just haven't yet put your ideas into words. Either way, your allies quickly appreciate your high level of integrity now because they understand that you will share what is necessary when the time is right."
scorpio,2012-07-31,"You realize that a special relationship is more complicated than it appears, but you're afraid to disturb what seems to be working so well. Luckily, you're blessed with sensible friends who will tell you their honest opinions today. Thankfully, the advice they give you now is sound. The current window of opportunity won't last, so don't procrastinate. If you want another perspective, ask before it's too late."
sagittarius,2012-07-31,"Your friends may grow weary of your tap dancing today because it's obvious that you don't want to be pinned down. They would prefer that you say what's on your mind without beating around the bush or talking in vague generalities. Don't let your natural resistance to making a commitment turn your allies into enemies. Focus on creating stability, not upsetting it. Honor your friendships by appreciating your loved ones in the present moment."
capricorn,2012-07-31,"Your ruling planet Saturn basks in the warmth of delicious Venus today, encouraging you to be extra considerate of those you love. Others are attracted to your current easygoing style, but that doesn't mean you're carefree enough to ignore your responsibilities. Although you're motivated to pursue pleasure now, meet your obligations first and then head out to play with your friends."
aquarius,2012-07-31,"You may be quite serious about relationships today, but you still want to be seen as a person who knows how to have a good time. However, it isn't easy to enjoy yourself fully now unless you are engaged in creative projects that involve working with others. Achieving satisfaction is more likely if you don't set your goals too high. Unfortunately, you could become so lazy that you don't do much at all. Find a way to balance the two extremes since your current happiness depends on it."
pisces,2012-07-31,"You may have to struggle to get a meaningful relationship back on track, especially if you're currently in the doghouse. Thankfully, you can make up for lost time or bad behavior by paying extra attention to what others need today. But don't assume that you can earn bonus points by doing all the right things; you're off to a bad start if you're keeping score. The best way to re-establish trust now is to combine kindness with honesty while staying present in each and every interaction."
aries,2012-08-01,"Your energy may run out of control today as your creativity blossoms. The Aquarius Full Moon activates the radiant Leo Sun in your 5th House of Self-Expression, making you even more spontaneous than usual. On the surface, all is well, but there could be more going on than meets the eye. Watch your step; exercising sensible caution now is more than just good advice to follow."
taurus,2012-08-01,"You would like your emotions to settle down, yet the Aquarius Full Moon occurs in your 10th House of Career, pulling you back into a familiar pattern at work today. You may grow anxious when you learn that someone didn't tell you everything; now you want full disclosure before you go on. Uncovering all the details could be challenging at first, but everyone will feel better once the facts are finally out in the open."
gemini,2012-08-01,"Today's Aquarius Full Moon falls in your 9th House of Big Ideas, broadening your mental horizons. Unfortunately, this wider perspective can be confusing because you may pick up extra noise along with the important data you need to know. Use whatever psychological or spiritual tools you have to keep a fix on reality, since you're going to receive some mixed signals from others along the way. Above all, keep your feet on the ground."
cancer,2012-08-01,"You are deeply connected to lunar rhythms and can't help but be moved by the intensity of today's Aquarius Full Moon that brightens your 8th House of Intimacy. Let the emotional tide surge with its swells of unexpected power, but remember that you don't have to express every passing mood. If you must say something now, do it and then let go. Attachment to your desires adds complexity to an otherwise beautifully simple relationship."
leo,2012-08-01,"The Aquarius Full Moon is especially powerful for you Lions, illuminating your 7th House of Relationships. Your emotions are intensified by a partner or close friend who is going through a dramatic change. As tough as it may be today, stay connected while still allowing everyone involved plenty of room to feel independent. Life will settle back down in the days ahead."
virgo,2012-08-01,"You are motivated to find new meaning for your life, yet your outer world may seem uninspired in comparison to what's happening within your subconscious mind now.

Enjoy the show while you can without worrying too much about the future."
scorpio,2012-08-01,"Today's Aquarius Full Moon is buried in your 4th House of Roots, but it's not a smart idea to suppress your emotions. It's even more important to pay attention to your feelings if your head is telling you one thing and your heart is saying something else. Slipping into denial is neither healthy nor productive. Instead, reconsider your priorities and deal with the underlying issues rather than the symptoms for enduring results."
sagittarius,2012-08-01,"The Aquarius Full Moon falls in your 3rd House of Communications, inspiring you to write a letter or make a phone call that you were previously avoiding. Do it right away since what you do today will have the impact you desire. But even if you have good intentions, your intensity can be overwhelming. Be patient and allow everyone enough time to assimilate your words before changing the subject."
capricorn,2012-08-01,"You are highly productive when you set your mind to a specific goal. However, you could physically exhaust yourself if you aren't careful now, because you're riding a surge of energy that continues to build over the days ahead. The Aquarius Full Moon's presence in your 2nd House of Personal Resources enables you to keep yourself grounded. Make time to care for your body and don't short yourself on sleep. Being at your physical best improves your chances to accomplish your lofty ambitions."
aquarius,2012-08-01,"The thoughts that are flowing in your subconscious are lifted to a high tide level by the brilliant Aquarius Full Moon. Your imagination floods into every aspect of your waking life today. Normally, the Moon works in the realm of dreams, but you cannot contain it now. Embracing the emotional storms can clear the air of stagnant feelings and allow relationships to flourish."
pisces,2012-08-01,"Your heightened sense of urgency may stem from unrealistic fears today as the Aquarius Full Moon illuminates your 12th House of Secrets. Although you might feel as if time is running out, it could just be an illusion. Nevertheless, there is still work to do and you want to finish as much as possible. Close your eyes and take several deep breaths. Then, open your eyes and return to the task at hand. Doing this simple relaxation exercise often throughout the day helps you accomplish more than you thought possible."
aries,2012-08-02,"Quirky expressions of energy may be motivated by very straightforward desires today. But even if you know what you want, it's difficult to put your feelings into words. Try not to judge yourself too harshly if you give up before you can make someone understand you. Knowing when to back off reduces the stress for everyone. Being patient helps your cause now; remember communicator Mercury ends its retrograde phase next week and things will begin to turn around."
taurus,2012-08-02,"You believe that life should be simple, but it's not. Your current work situation may be causing tension, prompting you to worry about your financial circumstances. You can make it all work out, but the solutions won't be what you expect. Take the initiative and talk about your dilemma, since clear communication must be a key component of your strategy today."
gemini,2012-08-02,"You excel as a communicator, but you have been holding back some of your thoughts recently. You may be getting bored with this self-restraint because you're feeling charged up and ready for some fun. However, others might resist your plans if you push too hard or move too quickly. There's no need to upset anyone with your sense of urgency. You will be more successful getting what you want if you continue to take your time and proceed with sensitivity."
cancer,2012-08-02,"It seems as if you need to concentrate on taking care of yourself now, but you might not know how. Although someone may not be giving you what you want, there's no reason to think you'll remain unfulfilled. You could scare off others if you appear desperate, so acting in a self-sufficient manner is a smarter approach. When you take decisive action on your own behalf, those around will be more likely to respond supportively."
leo,2012-08-02,"You feel more connected with your heart now, but a close friend or partner might think you're self-absorbed. Unfortunately, you could become fixated on getting something that you want. You may not realize how much of a negative impact your neediness has on those around you. Thankfully, your personal relationships deepen when you trust your instincts without pushing others too far."
virgo,2012-08-02,"You may believe that you're building your future on a solid foundation today, yet your plans are not as grounded in reality as they seem. The good news is that your confident yet unrealistic vision of what's ahead could actually turn out to be what you get if you're willing to follow through with hard work. Don't let yourself get discouraged if you experience a setback; just pick yourself up and try again. Success comes to those who don't give up."
libra,2012-08-02,"There's relationship tension brewing today, but it's hard to know what to do about it. Your key planet Venus is in whimsical Gemini now, putting you in touch with your inner butterfly. It's easy for you to flit around an issue without fully engaging it. Although you may get fired up with energetic Mars in your sign, its alignment with nebulous Neptune later this evening lessens the stress all the way around. Be patient; you should be able to refocus your intentions tomorrow."
scorpio,2012-08-02,"You may be seeking ways to express your individuality at home today with the Moon currently visiting your 4th House of Family. Although the Moon's harmonious trines with hot Mars and cold Saturn prompt you to act in a more thoughtful and gracious manner, you're not interested in living your life on stage now where you can be judged by others. Nevertheless, you're capable of doing nearly anything as long as you know exactly what role you play in the larger picture."
sagittarius,2012-08-02,"This is your kind of day, even if there is a difficult emotional issue that needs to be resolved. On one hand, you feel as if your future is opening up before your eyes, in spite of the current dilemma. On the other hand, there are so many choices that you're uncertain of which way to go. Fortunately, you can take the pressure off the relationship tension by focusing on long-range goals instead of your more immediate concerns."
capricorn,2012-08-02,"You finally have a clever way to handle an outstanding financial concern, but achieving real progress may be harder than you think.

Giving yourself a little more time can turn a brilliant plan into a strategy for success."
aquarius,2012-08-02,"You might be distracted today by someone close to you as demands of a friend or co-worker prevent you from doing something that you really want to do. It may seem as if there is no immediate way out of this conflict, but beneath the surface tension is your firm belief that everything will somehow work out for the best. Thankfully, a positive outcome is likely, but allow a few extra days before you request to revisit the conversation."
pisces,2012-08-02,"It feels as if everything is up in the air now, and there's no quick release button to push that gives you an easy way out of the current tension. Your logic won't lead to a solution but, paradoxically, your dreams might. Instead of seeking a concrete answer to your questions, allow your fantasies to take you along for a ride. Without the stress of having to find an immediate resolution, your imagination is free to show you exactly what you need to know at this time."
aries,2012-08-03,"Confusion may arise today as fast as you can gain clarity. Every question you answer just peels off another layer of the growing onion. Seeking positive solutions may feel like a hopeless battle. However, it's good to remember that with strength and determination, Hercules was able to defeat the Hydra who grew two new heads each time one was cut off. You can be the hero of your own world if you summon your courage from the wellsprings within."
taurus,2012-08-03,"It's difficult to get a handle on the day today as circumstances keep changing. However, the greatest challenges may come from your friends or associates now because of the Moon's presence in your 11th House of Social Networking.

But you don't have to move so fast; there are goodies to be discovered if you allow enough time to untangle the complexities before giving up."
gemini,2012-08-03,"It can be disarming if your data aims you one way while an intuitive hunch suggests that you should be doing something else.

Instead of jumping to any conclusions, consider all your possibilities until your feelings are more aligned with the circumstances. You'll feel better about what your choice if you wait before swinging into action."
cancer,2012-08-03,"You have gathered all the necessary information and have successfully withheld your feelings as you developed your plan. Although you can be very patient when needed, you grow so restless today that you don't want to wait any longer. However, you may be more focused on your ideal fantasy now than you are on reality. You've made it this far, so don't blow it by acting too soon. The turning point is next week."
leo,2012-08-03,"What someone else says today can wound you, but it's crucial to look past the current circumstance and carefully consider the true source of the pain. Think about any past situations that are brought to mind by the current situation. Explore your resistance to letting go of the past. But the real work in not about remembering; it's about bringing your memories out into the open so healing can occur. Acknowledging the truth brings resolution."
virgo,2012-08-03,"Irrational fears about a relationship may come to the surface today, but you might not be able to talk about your deeply rooted emotions easily. Try not to let your limitations stop you, for negative feelings can be destructive if you keep them to yourself. Make time to have the conversation that you keep postponing. Think about what you're going to say, and then go for it. It will become easier once you start."
libra,2012-08-03,"You may not be all that clear about what you can do to make yourself happier now, but it's likely that change is needed in your daily routine. It seems like this should be an easy task, but the closer you get to taking action, the more difficult it becomes. Don't give up just because you are feeling confused today. Trust in yourself and your clarity will return."
scorpio,2012-08-03,"You can't stop thinking about something that's been bothering you recently. You intuitively understand that the only way anything will get better is to talk about it until the energy settles. However, it's difficult to bring your intense feelings out into the open because the resultant vulnerability makes you uncomfortable. Be courageous and move directly toward the source of your discomfort, not away from it."
sagittarius,2012-08-03,"This is one of those days when your head and your heart aren't reading from the same adventure novel. You may be feeling softer and more compassionate than you are acting as your cavalier behavior masks your vulnerability. Thankfully, you can regain your focus by looking within and exploring your motives for not sharing what's in your heart. There's no need to hide behind a false sense of bravado; just be yourself."
capricorn,2012-08-03,"You can be a fount of strength if you let go of your own self-criticism for a while. You're ready to discover how much you have to offer others. Your carefully chosen words have the power to heal, and you have co-workers who can really use your help today. Push beyond any personal resistance to the idea of being a healer and start listening to those around you with an open heart."
aquarius,2012-08-03,"Self-doubt can be debilitating today, especially if it prevents you from being part of a crucial discussion. Fortunately, your thoughts are quite powerful and more connected to your core essence these days. Your perspective is desperately needed now, no matter what it is. Share your opinions, but be careful about overstating your cause in order to cover your own uncertainty."
pisces,2012-08-03,"Your imagination is far more active now that the Moon is paddling through your watery sign. Go ahead and sink into your dreams today, but be wary about using them to escape from the difficult emotions attached to real world circumstances. Fortunately, the symbolism that bubbles up from your unconscious might be the key that clarifies your current uncertainty. Once you are in touch with the meaning, you can change your attitude about what's happening."
aries,2012-08-04,"Your feet might not touch the ground today, for cosmic influences are pulling you into the spiritual and dream realms. You're eager to leave your chores behind for a while so you can space out. But you cannot completely ignore reality; there will be a price to pay if you do. Nevertheless, you can make the best of both worlds if you allow time for work and play. A balanced approach to life isn't always the easiest to maintain, but is smartest in the long run."
taurus,2012-08-04,"There are contradictory messages bubbling up from deep within your soul now. You might even feel as if you are at odds with yourself throughout the day. Every optimistic emotion gives rise to a corresponding uncertainty. Fortunately, your ambivalence can be useful socially because you're more willing to go along with the group. Stay in touch with your changing feelings, even if you don't share them at this time."
gemini,2012-08-04,"You may jump back and forth today between an all-inclusive view of your life and a highly specific one that's very detail-oriented. On one hand, your imagination soars and you can see your life from a global perspective. However, the problem is that you cannot act on the grandiose visions now. Bring the big ideas back down to earth and proceed one step at a time to reach your goals."
cancer,2012-08-04,"Although you may appear to resist change, you are probably much more adaptable than others realize. After all, you Crabs are in tune with the rhythms of the sea. But now, as the emotional tides shift, it's difficult to tell which way the waters will be flowing. Don't be overly concerned if you cannot figure out exactly where you are now. Hold on to your present position until you see where you're going next. Give it a few days; the confusion will pass."
leo,2012-08-04,"It is challenging to separate your dreams from what's real now, but the hard cold facts just won't go away. You're caught between the relationship fantasies you create and the limitations that you must acknowledge day to day. Focus on the positive tangible aspects so you can remain open to the love around you, even if it isn't quite what you imagined."
virgo,2012-08-04,"Your spiritual and metaphysical interests may be gaining a more significant role in your life these days. There are big changes on the horizon, but they might already be influencing the subtle yet powerful realms of your subconscious mind. Instead of staying so wrapped up in your data, let go of the analytical perspective in order to get the most from your imagination. You can always refocus on the specifics later in the week."
libra,2012-08-04,"You are the zodiac's champion of balance, and you can now feel the cosmic conflict pulling part of you into the spiritual realm as the other part of you must manage the real world. You could easily idealize your current situation, but it's important to see things as they truly are if you want to succeed. The future is in your hands. The best way to assure that you will get what you want is to learn to walk comfortably in both worlds."
scorpio,2012-08-04,"You may be unclear about where you're going in your career now that confusing Neptune is aligning with retrograde Mercury in your 10th House of Career. Although your role in the outer world is important to you, thinking about your goals raises confusing issues. If your employment isn't fulfilling, it might be time to place more attention on the inner dimensions rather than material success. There's no quick or easy answer as you attempt to discern which is more important. Reflecting on what makes your heart sing is a good place to start."
sagittarius,2012-08-04,"Your dilemma du jour is a familiar old pattern that resonates from time to time. You wish that you could live your life in a big way, as if you were an action hero in an adventure story. You don't always want to handle the little things. Now, these unattended details come back to haunt you. It's best to manage the practical issues first before engaging in discussions of grandiose possibilities."
capricorn,2012-08-04,"Although you typically prefer to keep both feet firmly on the ground, you might spend much of today lost in daydreams. You may be presented with complex issues that involve other people's feelings or their involvement in a joint project. Strive to maintain clarity as you work with them, for there is potential to misunderstand each other's basic values. Thankfully, conscious communication can help you navigate through this tricky territory."
aquarius,2012-08-04,"Intimate relationships could be a source of confusion today, especially if you aren't really listening to what the other person is saying. Hearing the message behind the spoken words may take extra effort for both of you, as language can actually get in the way now. Try not to push your point of view on to anyone else. A lessening of the current tensions occurs naturally by simply allowing multiple points of view to exist side by side in peace."
pisces,2012-08-04,"There are demands being placed on you today, but you might not realize it until it's too late. Someone may assume that you're helping out with a particular project, but you don't even know that your assistance is needed. Most problems now stem from your difficulty in staying focused. However, relaxing your mind, daydreaming, reading a book, or going to a movie reinvigorates you. Do something nice for yourself and you'll be able to work more efficiently later in the day."
aries,2012-08-05,"You are buzzed by the Moon's afternoon entry into your sign, prompting you to feel more aggressive than usual. Your desires, whether expressed or not, may be the source of a minor dispute even if your intentions are good.

taurus,2012-08-05,"Although one cycle is coming to an end, the new one has not yet begun to unfold. Nevertheless, there is still a lot going on, even though it may feel as if you are between two major events. There's no need to rush into initiating a new project. Although time seems to be in short supply, you actually have more of it than you think. Give yourself permission to relax while you have the chance."
gemini,2012-08-05,"You may be at the end of your rope today, yet you still are unable to put your feet on the ground. You probably know exactly what you should be doing now, but compassion for someone close to you might influence you to take a different course of action. Remember, there isn't any one correct solution to your dilemma. In fact, there isn't only one question. It's time to do what you Twins do best: enjoy the exquisitely delicious paradox of life."
cancer,2012-08-05,"Your feelings rise to the surface today, even if you try to keep them hidden. Consciously withholding your emotions won't work and you can't push them away just because they are difficult to integrate. Instead of resisting the inevitable, let your inner process flow outward. Although it may be scary at first, ironically you will feel more secure once others see what's going on in your heart."
leo,2012-08-05,"You're in a rather feisty mood today, yet your confidence might not be up to par. Still, you're willing to put yourself on the line and tell it like it is -- even if you're not sure about what's going on now. There's no need to overcompensate by pretending that everything is fine. Instead, acknowledge your uncertainty and see what lessons you can learn about yourself."
virgo,2012-08-05,"You may be facing some of your own fears and insecurities today, even if they appear to be coming from someone else. It feels as if your friends aren't telling you everything that they know, but it could just be their lack of clarity. Nevertheless, it seems like you're missing something significant. Don't dig too deeply now, unless you are willing to deal with the can of worms you might open as you gain new insight about your relationships."
libra,2012-08-05,"You may not handle emotional uncertainty very well but, paradoxically, you don't mind your own ambivalence. You just don't like it when it comes from someone else. You're tempted to take out your frustration on others today, but it's only because you aren't sure about what's going on. Don't worry about what to do; concentrate instead on how you feel. Keep in touch with your heart, no matter what comes into awareness."
scorpio,2012-08-05,You're energized to do something new and different before the imaginative Pisces Moon leaves your 5th House of Fun. You feel more carefree now and you're prepared to blast through the restraints that have prevented your spontaneous creativity. Don't spend too much time in deep analysis today. It may be healthier in the long run to just write yourself a permission slip to play.
sagittarius,2012-08-05,"You may have inadvertently fallen prey to your own desires, and now there are no quick escape routes. Your way out of this self-made trap is by heading directly for the center of the building storm. Recognize that you and your loved ones are not in jeopardy, unless, that is, you try to avoid facing the truth. Happily, your willingness to let go of your expectations might be all that's required to free yourself from disappointment."
capricorn,2012-08-05,"It's challenging to get a handle on the day because every situation seems to take its own course without regard to your preferences. The uncertainty of how to respond to the twists and turns of events makes the day an unsolvable riddle. You might feel as if time is speeding up, but this quickening may just be a result of your own sense of urgency. Clarity begins to return later in the day as your routine settles down over the next few days."
aquarius,2012-08-05,"Your personal finances may be confusing today and it's difficult to decide on a sensible course of action. Nevertheless, it's valuable to make an extra effort toward taking care of money matters, even if it's just paying a few bills. Your intuition is a better source of guidance than you realize, so don't waste energy second-guessing yourself. Just get as much done as possible now because you won't have as much time during the week."
pisces,2012-08-05,"Those closest to you might think that you aren't very dependable today, but they may have unrealistic expectations. You don't necessarily want to spend your entire day in service to everyone else's needs; you want some time to do a few of your favorite things. Fortunately, you won't have to fight to get your way if you calmly inform others of your priorities right from the start. You could be pleasantly surprised when you receive more support than you expect."
aries,2012-08-06,"You know what you want today with the Moon in your sign, yet impulsively announcing your desires to the world isn't necessarily the most effective way to reach satisfaction. You could stir up an emotional hornet's nest by saying more than is necessary. Thankfully, a little self-restraint goes a long way now. But it's not necessary to keep all your thoughts to yourself. Revealing your most uplifting feelings allows you to walk on the sunny side of the street."
taurus,2012-08-06,"You really don't have to say much today because that special someone probably already knows what you are feeling, even if you think you're keeping a secret. There are lots of different ways to be demonstrative; although verbal communication may be the most obvious, it's not always the most efficient. Your acts of kindness toward those you love enable you to get your message across loud and clear."
gemini,2012-08-06,"Your current wave of enthusiasm can create a big splash with your partner or lover. However, a long-winded speech might have the opposite effect unless you follow your good intentions with sincere actions. People may tire of your sweet talk. Delivering the goods is more impressive than empty promises."
cancer,2012-08-06,"You shouldn't have to work so hard at letting someone know how much you care.

Steer clear of flattery and flowers; stick to the facts and speak straight from your heart."
leo,2012-08-06,"You might exaggerate today as you try to paint the most positive picture of your love life. However, your words can be misleading now as talkative Mercury nears the end of its retrograde period. Even if you believe that you're being clear, others may still hear what they want to hear. Fortunately, your actions speak the truth in a way that cannot be misinterpreted. Say less and do more."
virgo,2012-08-06,"Communication skills are crucial today, especially if you want to delve beneath the surface to discover what's real. Exploring your feelings is difficult now without the support of others. But a visit to a therapist or counselor won't be able to replace a heartfelt discussion with someone you love. Keep in mind that finding the truth is less important than the process of interaction. There are no absolute rights or wrongs when it comes to matters of the heart."
libra,2012-08-06,"It may seem as if everyone is a bit jumpy today and their reactions can be extreme. Nevertheless, avoid basing your actions on how you think someone will respond to you. Instead of carefully weighing your words, just say what's on your mind while still conveying kindness and respect. Others will be so appreciative of your positive attitude that they might not even care if you disagree with them."
scorpio,2012-08-06,"Instead of doing your job according to the established routine now, take a risk and experiment with a different plan.

Thankfully, acknowledging your vulnerability draws others closer to you and disperses lingering feelings of loneliness. Saying exactly how you feel now will likely lead to more intimacy in the days ahead."
capricorn,2012-08-06,"Others might be walking on eggshells when they are near you because they don't want to unnecessarily stir up difficult emotions now. However, this may be the exact opposite of what you want. You can set an example by expressing your desires clearly instead of keeping your desires to yourself. But being brutally honest doesn't mean that you have the right to hurt someone's feelings. Say what you must while remaining sensitive in your delivery."
aquarius,2012-08-06,"You wish that you could push your feelings into new territory, but you still might be cautious with your words. Oddly enough, it's easier to demonstrate what you want with bold actions rather than rationalizing your needs. Keep in mind that you are not responsible for how anyone reacts to your decisions. Nevertheless, you can be true to yourself and still be kind to others at the same time."
pisces,2012-08-06,"You're feeling optimistic today about what you have to offer others in your life. You are excited about exploring this newfound confidence by sharing your exciting plans with your family or coworkers.

Ultimately, you're more believable if you speak matter-of-factly, without turning everything into such a big deal."
aries,2012-08-07,"The spontaneity of today's Aries Moon is befuddled by the passivity of Venus in Cancer. You want to seize the day because the courting process is like going to war.

Although being subtle is not your usual style, it's the best way to make sparks fly now."
taurus,2012-08-07,"Romantic Venus is your key planet, and you will feel softer and more receptive to love as she travels through sentimental Cancer.

Fortunately, your modus operandi of slow and steady wins the race really does work at this time."
gemini,2012-08-07,"If you have been on social overload lately, things should begin to settle down as Venus finally leaves your sign. Although you still may want to play, it's time to set new priorities and focus your intentions on what you want in a relationship. But don't be too concerned if your emotional needs aren't being fulfilled right now. Concentrate on long-term goals instead of seeking immediate gratification."
cancer,2012-08-07,"The next few weeks could provide a heightened sense of belonging, adding an expanded depth to your current relationship or introducing a new love interest into your life. If a romance starts to heat up while charming Venus is in your sign, it might be about tender caring and sensitive nurturing instead of a sudden, head-over-heels infatuation. There may not be any showy fireworks, but the feelings can run very deep."
leo,2012-08-07,You're encouraged to look at your own issues about love and romance now that Venus is wandering through your 12th House of Spiritual Mystery. You have subconscious fears that can motivate you in relationships. Use these coming weeks to dig into your rich fantasy life. Face your previous disappointments. Own what you are attracted to and what repulses you. Self-acceptance is your key to happiness.
virgo,2012-08-07,"Venus in sensitive Cancer moves through your 11th House of Friends and Wishes, emphasizing your long-term relationship goals and putting you in touch with your future. It doesn't matter whether you fantasize at night or if you daydream at work. The content isn't all that important as long as you dream. Don't judge yourself; it's OK if you don't yet have the intimacy you seek. Love works on its own schedule and can't be rushed."
libra,2012-08-07,"Venus is your planetary ruler, but you may find yourself in conflict with the planet of love and money now as she moves through vulnerable Cancer. You are attracted to harmony and equality, but have a more difficult time balancing everything today because you're concerned with protecting your feelings. As such, situations might intensify for a while if you let yourself be drawn into a drama. Your best defense is to not hold on to more than you need."
scorpio,2012-08-07,"You are in your element with sensual Venus' visit to caring Cancer. These next few weeks may bring tender situations that mellow your intensity without requiring you to suppress your feelings. Although you have a clear vision of what you want now, you might be quieter than usual. Shift your attention away from the outer world and create a safe bubble where your feelings can contribute to building a nurturing relationship."
sagittarius,2012-08-07,"You may not easily understand the care-taking aspect of Venus in Cancer, making your relationships difficult to manage for the next few weeks. You might prefer jumping into a situation without necessarily becoming attached. However, this isn't possible now, so you'll need to take a risk and allow yourself to become emotionally vulnerable. Luckily, if you can break the ice by opening your heart, others are able to do so in return."
capricorn,2012-08-07,"You Goats typically find security by establishing structure in all aspects of your life. Naturally, you take love seriously and want it to be real. Some of your well-defined boundaries grow mushier now as Venus moves through your 7th House of Relationships. This might make you anxious, for you're not comfortable with the more vulnerable side of love. Give yourself permission to enjoy the pleasures without worrying about the cost."
aquarius,2012-08-07,You are normally attracted to relationships that give you a bit of extra room to be on your own. But Venus in caring Cancer now tempts you to attach yourself to the object of your love -- and this clinging behavior may make you irritable. Stretch into your vulnerability and explore the emotional intimacy that's possible. You might be happily surprised that being very close to someone could be exhilarating rather than smothering.
pisces,2012-08-07,"As a sensitive Water sign you are comforted by Venus' entry into soothing Cancer and your 5th House of Romance. In fact, this transit may bring some sweet relief to a relationship dynamic that was recently a source of stress. Thankfully, you're able to lighten up and be more playful now. Pay attention; love might be just around the corner."
aries,2012-08-08,"You are at a fork in the road, anticipating the journey ahead. Although you aren't sure of all the details yet, you have probably given them quite a bit of thought. Don't let your optimism overshadow potential obstacles. Shortcuts taken today will be problematic tomorrow, but doing the right thing now will pay off in the weeks ahead."
taurus,2012-08-08,"The Moon's current visit to your sign may sugarcoat your memories as you think about your past. As you look to the future, your plans seem more reliable than they actually are. Fortunately, your chances for success are still good if you make sure everything is in order and that you keep a practical perspective. Although you won't reach your goals overnight, your dreams can come true if you remain focused on your destination."
gemini,2012-08-08,"Your key planet Mercury has been retracing its steps in the sky since mid-July, requiring you to revisit mental ground you thought was already covered. However, now it's time to set your sights on where you will be going next and to start moving in that direction. Stop talking about what you want to do and begin doing it today."
cancer,2012-08-08,"There is a conflict between your head and your heart now, but you have tools at your disposal to work out the differences. No one said this current transition would be easy, but the energy does seem to be lightening up. You feel positive today about the very same things that were overwhelming you just last week. Take advantage of your newfound optimism to overcome any fears you might have of failure. Anything is possible as long as you believe."
leo,2012-08-08,"You may start the day feeling good only to find frustration knocking at your door later on. Unfortunately, you are so enthusiastic about what's happening that you want everything right now. However, the present moment cannot give you all that you need. A more successful strategy is to give yourself a couple of weeks to see how things develop. In the meantime, practice patience while concentrating on your goal."
virgo,2012-08-08,You are particularly sensitive to the movements of your ruling planet Mercury. The messenger planet hangs apparently motionless in the sky today and you may feel that same stillness reflected within your thoughts. Cut yourself some slack if you aren't as far along on a project as you think you should be now. Mercury speeds up over the days ahead and your efforts will begin to reap the rewards you seek.
libra,2012-08-08,"You're feeling self-indulgent today and you are willing to do whatever you must to get your share of pleasure. However, striving for satisfaction seems to be an uphill battle and you might be unpleasantly surprised that your desires are going to take longer to fulfill than you originally believed. Maintain a positive attitude, for that will make your trek easier. Remember, appreciating the journey is just as important as reaching the destination."
scorpio,2012-08-08,"You know what you want professionally and you want it now. You've been working hard for weeks yet you aren't sure you have enough to show for your efforts. Still, clever Mercury's direct turn in your 10th House of Career is a harbinger for the success that's coming your way. Everything has taken a long time, but your confidence is returning and you know you'll be rewarded. Don't give up; you're closer to your dreams than you think."
sagittarius,2012-08-08,"Plans that you made at the beginning of summer could finally be coming together now. However, it's too soon to take your work to the next level because there may be just a few final details that need to be put in place before you're off and running. Try not to be in such a hurry. You will arrive at your destination at exactly the right moment."
capricorn,2012-08-08,"It's tricky to find balance today, since you may be tempted to extend beyond your usual limits. Reaching too far might upset your equilibrium, and you stand to lose the gains you already made through hard work. If your dream is just out of reach now, you probably can get along without it. And if it's something you were meant to have, you should be able to earn it more easily in the days ahead."
aquarius,2012-08-08,"Focus on your work now; powerful lessons are yours for the learning. Often there is some pain associated with assimilating what we need to know. But the difficult side of this cosmic equation is minimal today, since you can dig deeply, experience the emotional juice and then get on with your day. Slow down and you'll have more time to soak it all in."
pisces,2012-08-08,"Although you may be happily engaged in a very busy day filled with a variety of activities, you have a keen ability to find stability amidst a storm. Ironically, you're not as flexible now as you seem with the stubborn Taurus Moon visiting your 3rd House of Immediate Environment. Don't worry so much about meeting others halfway today; be strong and hold your position. Once you establish that you mean business, you can negotiate from a position of strength, not weakness."
aries,2012-08-09,"Rather than pushing your agenda on others today, it's better to trust your instincts and pay attention to your changing feelings. Luckily, your allies have your best interests at heart, so it's a smart strategy to listen to what they have to say. Even if your goals seem impractical or unattainable now, don't be afraid to reach for your dreams while they are still near enough to touch."
taurus,2012-08-09,"Your ruling planet Venus teaches you a lesson in compassion today as she harmonizes with spiritual Neptune. However, this kind of dreamy love doesn't come naturally since you prefer to keep things real. Keep in mind that sometimes stretching outside of your comfort zone is well worth the effort. Opening your heart does not put you in any real danger now since the practical Taurus Moon comes to the rescue and brings your fantasies down to earth."
gemini,2012-08-09,"A visionary boss or associate may become a close mentor now, but you must be willing to embrace him or her beyond a superficial level. Others won't accept your clever wit as a substitute for a real connection of the heart today, so don't let your nonchalant attitude distract you from sharing your dreams. Instead, enjoy the beauty of the emotional support that is available to you now."
cancer,2012-08-09,"You're able to soak in the admiration from others today, but you must also be willing to reach out to express what you want. You might actually be more eager than anyone realizes now, but you have to be comfortable before revealing your heart. If you're insecure, you can quickly clam up. Your current challenge is to stay present even if you feel vulnerable; share your perspective so others can see what you have to offer."
leo,2012-08-09,You may be totally charmed by someone you meet today and could even fall in love. But the entire relationship might occur only within your imagination. You're hesitant to share your feelings with anyone else because you have trouble seeing a good reason to come clean with your fantasies. It's crucial to give yourself permission to explore your desires whether or not you express any of them out loud. Honor your heart by listening to what it wants.
virgo,2012-08-09,"You may not be able to keep your perspective rational today because you're probably dreaming about an unrealistic relationship. You might also be wondering how you can put your desires into words. Unfortunately, your interactions with others seem too shallow to express the depth of your feelings. Don't give up before you even try. Go ahead and convey your message anyhow; the right person will understand your point perfectly."
libra,2012-08-09,"Your key planet Venus is visiting your 10th House of Career, enabling you to enjoy the magical vibes of her alignment with Neptune in a professional manner. Being on a creative high can be exhilarating today, especially when others at work acknowledge your artistic talent or your dramatic flair. Do whatever is necessary to motivate yourself into action; you'll be very happy with the results."
scorpio,2012-08-09,"Usually, you aren't one to evade intensity or sidestep difficult issues, yet today it is a tempting possibility. You see great potential everywhere you look now, but don't want to do anything to mess up what you currently have going. Keep in mind that suppressed feelings can be expressed gently in a way that's productive instead of destructive. It's the timing and the tone that make all the difference."
sagittarius,2012-08-09,"You might be feeling pretty good today and think that everything is wonderful. It's easy to believe a fantasy now, especially if it offers you some sort of emotional security. But even if you are being nurtured, your need for adventure may stir up uncertainties about your current relationship situation. The more you try to ignore your concerns, the more intense they become. Ironically, staying in touch with your discomfort can actually improve your day."
capricorn,2012-08-09,"You may not like the idea of lessening your resistance, even if you secretly would like to try. You are attracted to exploring a potentially positive experience today, but you feel safer within the formality of rules. However, your dilemma won't be solved with a simple all-or-nothing choice now. Observe when you tighten your muscles or hold your breath; engage your heart, instead of automatically closing it down."
aquarius,2012-08-09,"You're ready to enjoy the finer things in life today, but there may not be time since it's busier than a typical workday. You have sufficient energy to do your job, but unexpressed desires could get in the way. Unfortunately, the more you try to concentrate, the more persistent your fantasies become. Instead of pushing them away now, focus on ways to make your dreams come true."
pisces,2012-08-09,"Your key planet Neptune trines enchanting Venus today, activating your desire for love. Venus is visiting your 5th House of Romance and Creativity, encouraging you to pursue a relationship. Don't worry about what others think. Nevertheless, you are seeing things as you wish them to be in an ideal situation, rather than how they are now. Wait a few days before making any significant choices regarding matters of the heart."
aries,2012-08-10,"Settling in to a slower pace isn't as easy as it sounds. Nevertheless, it's a smart idea to relax while you can because the pace is going to pick up again later in the day. Try practicing reliable techniques such as yoga, t'ai chi or meditation. If you have excess energy, take a walk, work in the garden or do something creative. Just make sure you partake in activities that rejuvenate you rather than depleting you."
taurus,2012-08-10,"It might seem as if someone is pushing your emotional buttons now just to upset you, but your resistance is strong and you won't likely get involved in other people's dramas. Your stubbornness works in your favor when establishing your boundaries today. You can be bull-headed yet, thankfully, others won't take your lack of interest as a personal rejection. Nevertheless, give yourself permission to change your mind at the last moment."
gemini,2012-08-10,"Your imagination is busy with captivating fantasies today, challenging you to stay focused on the events in the outer world. However, you may actually become single-minded as you mull the same image over and over again in your daydream. Don't worry; your current obsession won't last long and soon you will be back to your old playful and productive self once more."
cancer,2012-08-10,"Your mind doggedly pulls you into the future, whether or not you're ready for it. However, your current thoughts aren't just idle musings; you're actually laying the foundation for what will unfold over the months ahead. Instead of cutting yourself off from the connections to your own memories, weave them into your dreams. Your subconscious will do the rest."
leo,2012-08-10,"You might feel uneasy today with the expectations of others conflicting with your own ideas about how you want to spend your day. Try to avoid bringing a conflict to a head now, for it probably won't resolve the tension anyhow. Instead, accept the differences between your needs and your reality. Discussing your worries with a good friend over the weekend will help to soothe your concerns."
virgo,2012-08-10,"It's difficult to find satisfaction today because your plans seem to be getting cold while sitting on the back burner. But even if some larger pieces of the puzzle are out of place, enough of the smaller ones fit so well that the energy still flows. Nevertheless, you're wise to take it slowly and use this time to rejuvenate and prepare for the next adventure around the corner."
libra,2012-08-10,"It may seem readily apparent to you that others are attempting to influence your feelings in an indirect way today. Unfortunately, your friends won't come right out and say what they want. Instead, you feel an awkward undercurrent and there isn't much you can do about it other than recognizing it for what it is. It's crucial to remember that you don't need to sink to a level of retaliation. Moving ahead with your own agenda is your best course of action."
scorpio,2012-08-10,"You might feel as if others are trying to make something appear less complicated than it is now. You are all too familiar with the truth, but cannot get anyone to see it from your perspective. Accept that there are totally different ways of looking at a similar experience. Multiple points of view bring much-needed awareness and choice. Seeking common ground increases your chances for success."
sagittarius,2012-08-10,"You're off in your own world today, reminiscing about a recent trip or planning your next one. However, reality keeps calling you back to the boring tasks at hand. Although you might rather be somewhere else, it's necessary to concentrate on your current work now. Take care of chores as soon as possible and you'll be able to enjoy yourself without remorse over the weekend."
capricorn,2012-08-10,"A gentle dance between your heart and your head can lure you into socially warm waters today. You might feel as if you are trying to overcome some old limitations that are based on an unpleasant memory. Fortunately, the past is over and you aren't tied to yesterday. Your current truths are quite different now. There's not as much risk in the present moment as you think. Just do what comes naturally and enjoy the ride."
aquarius,2012-08-10,"Be cautious about your interactions with others today since complex emotional issues can drain you of much-needed energy. You don't need to take someone else's problems and automatically make them yours, even if you care a great deal about the people involved. Listen with an open heart, but keep some of your feelings private, nonetheless."
pisces,2012-08-10,"This relatively quiet day can turn chatty if a co-worker tells you more than you need to know. However, you cannot just ignore someone in need when he or she comes to you with a problem. Thankfully, lending a helping hand doesn't mean giving up your own agenda. Let others know your limits and then stick to them."
aries,2012-08-11,"Although you are busier than normal today, it may just be a string of distractions. On another day, this constant barrage of activity might be tiring, but now the twists and turns just make things more interesting. Nevertheless, your judgment could be slightly off now, so it's wise to delay an important decision. Enjoy the unexpected changes to your schedule, even if they unravel your previous plans."
taurus,2012-08-11,"You're able to handle the intricacies of financial planning today, so it's a good day to attend to money management. Unfortunately, you might have to iron out a sticky situation prompted by your temptation to spend more cash than you actually have. But the current issues may also involve your emotional relationship to your possessions. Be logical and move beyond whatever is standing in your way of material success."
gemini,2012-08-11,"You may be irrepressibly optimistic today as the Moon aligns with lucky Jupiter in your sign. Additionally, your key planet Mercury is playing the trickster, making it difficult to keep a healthy perspective on a new project. Although a positive attitude is essential, too much confidence can lure you in over your head before you remember that you cannot swim. Avoid trouble later by acting cautiously now."
cancer,2012-08-11,"Although you may be very talkative today, the most important subjects are being kept behind your emotional firewall. But protecting yourself from potential pain might also make you feel lonely. You aren't one to confuse light and clever dialogue with the real emotional communication that leads to intimacy. Nevertheless, holding back is unnecessary; change your strategy so you can still interact with your friends without closing down your heart."
leo,2012-08-11,"Your sign is sometimes referred to as lucky Leo, but the good things that come to you are usually more about your positive attitude and your willingness to make lemonade out of lemons. The good news is that your friends are rallying around you to support your dreams. Fortunately, you don't have to do much today other than staying open to whatever assistance you might receive."
virgo,2012-08-11,"Others see you as more outgoing and talkative now, but in reality social chit-chat annoys you most of the time. Nevertheless, you can still be so wrapped up in unimportant activities or trivial conversations today that they distract you from the real work at hand. Instead of trying to stay on track and ending up frustrated, let go of your agenda and return to it tomorrow when the noise quiets down."
libra,2012-08-11,"You might want to escape to somewhere far away like a tropical paradise. Whether an exotic vacation is practical or not, plant your feet firmly on the ground and take a stand. You deserve a pleasurable get-away after the challenges you have experienced lately. Start talking about your next adventure now, even if it seems out of the question. Remember, you're greasing the wheels and putting a larger chain of events into motion that could culminate in your private dreams coming true."
scorpio,2012-08-11,"The deeper you dig today, the easier it will be to navigate through the tangle of weeds that hold your life together. However, they also might prevent you from taking the next step. Thankfully, you can see the truth from just about every angle. This is a very important time; remain true to what you know and incorporate what you learn now into your values. Trust your intuition to guide your way."
sagittarius,2012-08-11,"There's a lot happening in the realm of relationships today, but the events in your environment are less important than what occurs within your own heart. If you practice staying aware of the irresolvable dilemmas at home, your own war on terror can be won. As you solve your inner issues, external events becomes less scary. If you calm your irrational fears, unnecessary worry has nowhere to take root."
capricorn,2012-08-11,"You may take on more than you can possibly finish because you tend to overestimate your capabilities today. However, your optimism won't last long once you realize that you're running out of time. Unfortunately, it's tough to know what to do to make the best out of a difficult situation. Don't try to hide your mistakes. Let others know as soon as possible that you might have promised more than you can deliver. People will be more sympathetic if you're honest. After all, you're human just like everyone else."
aquarius,2012-08-11,"It's a highly creative day, but it's easy to get frustrated if you don't reach all your goals. It's as if you're a rocket ship and aren't burning quite hot enough to achieve escape velocity. Thankfully, you still can do really good work, even if you don't reach your original destination. But there's no reason to be discouraged as long as you give it your best shot. Remember, you don't need to be a hero every day."
pisces,2012-08-11,"You may feel misunderstood today and the more you talk, the wider the gulf grows. However, silence isn't a viable option now because you cannot rein in loquacious Mercury in dramatic Leo. Every thought becomes a song and a dance. Ironically, your confidence doesn't flag, even if you have trouble making your position known. Instead of trying to justify your actions, simply let others know how you feel and then be quiet."
aries,2012-08-12,"You may have recently experienced a resurgence of creative energy, whether you made progress on an existing project or are fired up about a new one. However, today you could be torn between continuing your productivity and just taking time to enjoy the summer weekend. Indulging in pleasure is a great idea, but be sure to balance your play with something more practical, too."
taurus,2012-08-12,"Even if you wake up raring to go, you may lose steam during the day. You feel as if your energy level is high, encouraging you to say yes before you consider the whole picture in a realistic manner. Set clear boundaries to avoid running out of fuel before the day is over. Be conservative as you make your plans; doing less ensures you'll have the necessary resources to finish what you start."
gemini,2012-08-12,"Don't let anyone talk you out of doing what you want today. However, keep in mind that your antennae might pick up on more potential fun than you have time for now. Ultimately, you need to monitor your own behavior so you don't overextend your energy. Ironically, acting in a responsible manner enables you to enjoy yourself and still complete your chores."
cancer,2012-08-12,"Your feelings seem to go back and forth between hot and cold today. Although you are upbeat about the possibilities, reality sets in as you meet up with unavoidable obstacles. Taking care of your obligations outweighs other more exciting plans. Listen to the voice of reason; doing the right thing now will have a positive impact on the week ahead."
leo,2012-08-12,"Although you're often the life of the party, this weekend you might take things to a whole new level. You may be temporarily free from some of the more serious responsibilities that have kept you occupied these past few days. Go ahead and let your hair down, but don't overdo the fun and games because you will need to be at your best for the busy week ahead."
virgo,2012-08-12,"It's likely that you will become more involved within your own community today, possibly even in a leadership role. Although you might not have the inclination to take on additional obligations at this time, the Moon's presence in your 10th House of Status prompts you to jump in and help others anyway. Everyone appreciates your willingness to come forward and lend a hand."
libra,2012-08-12,"Your fortune seems to be swinging back and forth today, like a pendulum. One moment everything appears rosy, yet a few minutes later you feel stuck. The optimism rises and falls, making you uncertain about your choices now. There's no need to be self-critical; just keep your goals in sight and continue to do the best you can to achieve them. Observe your emotional variations without trying to stabilize the movement. Although it may take a few days, your feelings will settle down on their own."
scorpio,2012-08-12,"You might be reconsidering your life's direction in a way that gives you a deeper perspective. Sometimes it's challenging to think clearly when your emotions are stirred, but you have a chance today to be passionate while still being logical. Don't try to make any long-term decisions now; just let your mind meander through the various scenarios and mull over all the possibilities."
sagittarius,2012-08-12,"A friend's scattered behavior may be distracting now as you unsuccessfully try to finish what you started. But others are not the real problem; your attention span is rather limited today and you might be eager to jump at the opportunity when someone suggests something fun to do. Even if you don't complete everything you begin, staying focused long enough to make a bit of progress will bring you more satisfaction."
capricorn,2012-08-12,"It's time to improve your current exercise program or, at least, get off the couch and go for a walk. You're thinking about options today you normally might ignore, and hopefully one of them is exactly what you need for inspiration. But making plans is not enough now; you must put your best ideas into action as soon as possible. The sooner you start, the better your chances are for success."
aquarius,2012-08-12,"Creative activities are highlighted now, whether you are redecorating around the home, working on an artistic project or planning an adventure with kids. Since the Moon is traveling through your 5th House of Fun and Games, it's also possible to channel your own inner child. Even if you feel young at heart, there's still a serious tone to the day. Successfully balancing work and play is your current key to happiness."
pisces,2012-08-12,"The Moon's current visit to your 4th House of Security reminds you that it's important to make time for contemplation. Write in your journal today or talk about your needs with a close friend or family member. An unusual mixture between self-reflection and a desire to connect with others may prompt emotional disclosure now, which can lead to increased intimacy. However, it's your choice; you must be willing to take the risk and confide in someone you trust."
aries,2012-08-13,"You may decide early in the day that you're not going to let anything bother you. This cavalier strategy might actually work for a while, but it's impossible to hold on to your laissez faire attitude if someone does something that offends or threatens you. Even if you consciously choose to just let it go, handling your unresolved feelings will be easier now than later. Share your concerns with a friend and then move on."
taurus,2012-08-13,"You're feeling very positive about life and could even ignore an important detail just so you can maintain your current peace of mind. Unfortunately, it becomes more difficult throughout the day to continue to bury your head in the sand. It's better to face an uncomfortable truth than it is to try to dance your way around it. Be courageous; your dilemma is probably not as big as you think."
gemini,2012-08-13,"Although you could be tenaciously holding on to fears about your finances, you're acting so confidently that others may not see past your charming appearance. There's nothing wrong with wanting to present your life in a positive light. Nevertheless, don't try to fool yourself even if you can dazzle others with your fancy footwork. Be smart today and manage your money or pay some bills. Push past your resistance and get down to work. All that anyone needs to know is that you're busy and can't be disturbed now."
cancer,2012-08-13,"Although you may be rather distracted today, it's wise to acknowledge your own feelings and express your needs now that the Moon is back in your sign. You are at the beginning of a whole new emotional cycle, yet your attachments to the past can prevent you from moving forward. Being patient is one of your strengths; just don't let it turn into procrastination while waiting for the best moment to act."
leo,2012-08-13,"You have probably experienced many distractions over the past few days. Although the busy pace hasn't fully settled down yet, it's time to concentrate your scattered energy and pay less attention to anything that keeps you from doing what you must. It may take extra effort today, but setting priorities enables you to accomplish more now and gives you extra time to relax later on."
virgo,2012-08-13,"You may find your professional responsibilities overwhelming now. Although too many tasks are pulling you in too many directions, you want to narrow your focus to do one thing at a time. Ultimately, you feel better when the quality of your work meets your high expectations, yet you can't perform at this level when you're under pressure. Take a stand; discuss your concerns with your boss so you can set a new agenda that gives you the chance to do each task well."
libra,2012-08-13,"You may not be as productive as others expect of you, but the most important work you're doing now is taking place within your mind. Maintain any appearances that are necessary to give yourself the room you need to continue your inner journey. Keep in mind that today's creative ideas can fuel your accomplishments in the days ahead. Get lost in your imagination to find the keys to your success."
scorpio,2012-08-13,Your willingness to go along with someone else's plan today doesn't mean you are without your own limits. You may be pushed into an uncomfortable emotional confrontation if you think that anyone is taking unfair advantage of your flexibility. Try not to blame others for their shortcomings; focus on your feelings rather than what anyone else did or didn't do. This compassionate strategy allows for the best possible outcome for everyone involved.
sagittarius,2012-08-13,"A relationship with a powerful person may come to a head today as clashing points of view require resolution. However, a direct confrontation won't produce a winner, so avoid locking horns with anyone to prevent unnecessary drama. Instead of arguing about who is right and who is wrong, explore common ground so you can accomplish more than either of you could on your own."
capricorn,2012-08-13,"You could be busier than normal today, but you aren't one to be afraid of hard work. It's just that you don't like being pulled all over the map to put out fires as you handle a string of small crises. Although you might be quite effective taking care of problems as they surface, it prevents you from accomplishing what was on your initial agenda. Fortunately, there's no need to struggle; you can return to your unfinished projects tomorrow once everything settles down."
aquarius,2012-08-13,"Although crosscurrents at work require your undivided attention today, you're up for nearly anything. Your positive attitude will take you far, but be careful that your eagerness doesn't set up a situation where you are stretched so thin that you cannot do a good job at any one task. Stay aware of your energy level so you can maintain a sustainable pace and, ultimately, feel good at the end of the day."
pisces,2012-08-13,"You may be stressed by a relationship problem that can interfere with your concentration on the job today. Or, maybe your emotional needs are in conflict with your current work obligations. Either way, you need to find a sensible course of action that allows you to remain in touch with the issues without believing that you must fix anything right away. Resolution will come in time if you don't push too hard now."
aries,2012-08-14,"You can finally slow down today -- a relatively unusual event -- yet you may still resist easing up on the gas. You have been racing at high speed for a while and could be in danger of depleting your fuel. Take the time to gather resources and recharge your batteries while you have the opportunity. Nevertheless, be ready to swing into action later in the day instead of passively waiting for something to happen."
taurus,2012-08-14,"A maternal feeling toward someone you love may sweep over you today, even if you aren't parentally-inclined. Nurturing others can be healing, yet you must make the effort to do it. But don't take care of anyone just so you can feel good about yourself. Practicing unconditional love has the greatest impact on everyone involved."
gemini,2012-08-14,"Love begins at home by learning how to value your heart's desires. You're often quick to say the right thing at the right time so you receive the approval of others. But now it's time to stop trying to elicit the response you want from anyone else and follow your dreams. Taking care of yourself feels good; ironically, it also can set the tone to deepen the connection between you and someone special."
cancer,2012-08-14,"Although the Moon's visit to moody Cancer stirs your emotions, you have some serious self-restraint issues coming to light today. You may feel as if you're on-edge, but cannot easily express the things you want to share. Keep in mind that you're probably being harder on yourself than is necessary. Stay aware of the facts, but save your critical judgments for another day."
leo,2012-08-14,"Your fantasy life is rich now with the Moon illuminating your 12th House of Imagination. Nevertheless, keep one foot anchored in the real world so you don't drop off into the realm of dreams. You have significant feelings that you need to unfold in the privacy of your own mind, because letting others know doesn't seem quite right yet. There's no need to worry; trust your intuition and you'll know when to open up."
virgo,2012-08-14,"Sometimes when you're participating in a group function you are hesitant to say what's on your mind. You don't have a problem talking to your partner or your boss in private; however, it's difficult to express yourself in a public meeting. Gather your courage to speak up today. You don't need to disclose everything, but rest assured that every word you share will be taken seriously."
libra,2012-08-14,"You want to do what's right, but something is preventing you from taking action now. You have been observing your feelings as they change, but haven't said anything yet because you don't want to upset the status quo. However, today you can share what's been bugging you as long as you do so with sensitivity. Show how much you care in a way that allows you to get away with saying more and offending less."
scorpio,2012-08-14,"You might be especially concerned about your future now. Even your fantasies may be related to your career or community goals rather than your personal life. It's tempting to get emotionally worked up about issues of social injustice. Your opinions could be so strong that your passionate perspective explodes to the surface. Speak your mind, but hold back just enough so your message isn't lost in the drama of the moment."
sagittarius,2012-08-14,"Your unexpressed feelings may be the most significant ones now, especially if your idealism attracts unrealistic dreams. Actually, the subtle signals you're receiving might not even be on the radar of perception. Don't question where your ideas are coming from. Just listen carefully, even if you're not sure what you are listening to. Write down everything you hear today; you will understand more in due time."
capricorn,2012-08-14,"It's not all about you today; in fact, it's about everyone else. At least that's how it seems. But someone isn't telling you everything, and the unexpressed feelings can rebound to create a tense situation. If this is what's happening, look to your own issues and acknowledge your contribution to the current events. You can change your outer world most effectively by transforming your inner perspective."
aquarius,2012-08-14,"You could be a bit anxious today. Your dilemma stems from your desire for love and acceptance. Of course, nearly everyone wants to feel needed, but you complicate matters by attempting to avoid emotional interdependence. There is no one-size-fits-all answer; instead of seeking the right solution, try to be comfortable with all sides of an issue. Others will be more appreciative when you are flexible enough to recognize their points of view, too."
pisces,2012-08-14,"Your feelings are growing more serious day by day. However, it doesn't mean you are antisocial, even if you need some time to yourself now. To the contrary, this is an ideal day to pursue a romantic interest or to use your creativity to make something real. Reach out to enjoy the moment with someone special."
aries,2012-08-15,"You may be struggling with relationship issues now that your key planet Mars runs into immovable Saturn in your 7th House of Partners. Although there are no quick solutions, circumstances push your awareness to new heights. You might need to work harder today, but at least you can see a light at the end of the tunnel. Curb your impatience or you might drive everyone around you crazy. Instead of conquering new frontiers, try a cup of soothing herbal tea and a nice cool bath to relax."
taurus,2012-08-15,"A powerful emotional storm may be brewing today, yet it's hard to put your finger on the source of the disturbance. But instead of obsessing over something you don't understand, take care of your immediate responsibilities. Be as practical as possible, especially if there are deadlines looming. Although it's difficult to prioritize which tasks are the most important, pay attention to the ones that are the most pressing in the present moment."
gemini,2012-08-15,"If you are feeling overwhelmed by a relationship dilemma, you might seek respite by burying yourself in work. You may even take on additional obligations just so you don't have to face your emotions. But escape isn't the answer; gentle confrontation will achieve better results. Remember, it's not necessary to overcome all obstacles today. Acknowledge what is holding you back now, even if you don't try to resolve it until another day."
cancer,2012-08-15,"Your current desire for excitement can put stress on a relationship. You might even feel as if the expectations of your partner are holding you back. You could become disappointed with yourself if you slip into denial because you don't want to upset the status quo. Hiding your frustration does more harm than good. Thankfully, initiating action will be easier after Friday's New Moon. Make a practical plan now that you can work with over the next several days."
leo,2012-08-15,"The emotional heat can lift your spirits, but it will take more than a good time to set things right in your world. You are happier when you aren't under so much stress, and the current intensity might be a bit too much. If you find yourself shutting down, try some prayer or meditation to help you turn fear into love. But don't sit still; anything that helps you move your physical energy also calms your nerves."
virgo,2012-08-15,"You may have plenty of work to finish today before you can take some time for yourself. You might even question everything that you do, especially if professional activities are not resonating with your heart. You need some quiet time to contemplate your destiny. Don't ignore your inner voice now; there is much to learn about yourself, even if you have already done a lot of personal transformational work."
libra,2012-08-15,"Your key planet Venus is being challenged by Pluto, the planet of evolutionary change. You might have to express yourself at work by standing up for what you want. No one ever said that making your way in the world would be easy, especially if your personal views get mixed up with the truth. Don't confuse your values with facts or others may question your motives. Take your intuition seriously but don't lose your common sense."
scorpio,2012-08-15,"You feel even more passionately and intensely now that your key planet Pluto is activating your desires. Meanwhile, your other ruling planet Mars runs into Saturn's wall. However, your good intentions, unrelenting strength, and unflappable determination enable you to do profound magic and overcome all odds. Everyone benefits from your personal transformation."
sagittarius,2012-08-15,"The fires of pent-up resentment can burn today, allowing you to come across with more intensity than you feel. Someone might see you as a threat, so it's wise to play it low key. On the other hand, your magnetism is electric so there may be pleasant fireworks in the love arena. Nevertheless, your current situation isn't ideal. Rather than trying to resolve any discrepancies now, living within the paradox leads to happiness."
capricorn,2012-08-15,"You have a natural knack for knowing how hard to push forward and how much to hold back. It's tricky to live by this innate common sense now, but it's crucial to do so nonetheless. These are strange times that benefit from your strategic calculations rather than careless impulsive actions. Don't be afraid to temporarily drop your anchor where you are so you won't veer too far off course."
aquarius,2012-08-15,"You may be uncomfortable with the intense passion you're feeling today. Logically, you know you should suppress your wild desires because you're already stretched to the maximum. Although fulfilling your responsibilities might slow you down now, they won't hold you back for long. Set your sights high and don't be afraid to work hard toward a special goal."
pisces,2012-08-15,"Unspoken desires might be linked to issues of power today. You have the urge to act impulsively, but your behavior is driven by deep compulsions now. Unfortunately, if you deny your emotions, they could escape somewhere else. But if you express them too casually, you may find yourself in over your head. Take it slowly. You have more time than you realize to share your heart."
aries,2012-08-16,"You're fairly confident that you'll reach your destination, but you have trouble verbalizing your needs today. Unfortunately, your goals may be so far out of the box now that you cannot talk about them. Even still, you might attempt to express your feelings anyhow, only to discover what you want changes as the day goes on. Go ahead and open your heart, but remain flexible and be ready for a surprise."
taurus,2012-08-16,"You don't like being caught off guard, but today you may have to respond quickly to new feelings that arise quite suddenly. You won't be able to blame anyone else now, as this is probably a result of your own urges that erupt from the hidden depths of your unconscious mind. Don't withdraw; take every opportunity to break through whatever you have been avoiding. Facing your fears is the best way to overcome them."
gemini,2012-08-16,"You're usually willing to explore pleasurable distractions, but it's not that easy today. Other people have their expectations, but you might be disinterested in their goals now. If you do go along with someone's unusual request, you'll likely regret it later. Nevertheless, you don't want to let down a friend or associate. Do what is required, but don't be surprised if you get restless during the day and just want to walk away from it all."
cancer,2012-08-16,"Innovative ideas pop up unexpectedly today, thrilling you with the possibilities. However, this isn't a great time to let these desires run your life. In fact, it's wise to filter your thoughts so you don't get pulled off track. The challenge is in discerning which dreams are worth pursuing. Remember, you can think about all your options without having to act on every one."
leo,2012-08-16,"You may become upset if a co-worker ruins your fun today, but keep in mind that no one is purposefully trying to make your life difficult. To the contrary, others are more likely to assist you along your road to emotional satisfaction if you are doing your fair share. Although you might not get your way now, being a team player greatly increases your chances for fulfillment and enjoyment."
virgo,2012-08-16,"Someone may step into your world unexpectedly today with an intense emotional outburst that doesn't fit into your idea of appropriate behavior. Fortunately, you are magnanimous enough to incorporate this unsettling experience, but you need to make a conscious decision to be compassionate rather than critical. A great adventure can be yours if you accept the fact that you cannot control all the facets of your life all the time."
libra,2012-08-16,"Forget about sticking to your normal routine today since your key planet Venus is buzzed by high-strung Uranus. You may even feel as if you're going crazy, but rest assured it's just that the energy is a bit unstable now. Let restrictive structures and unhealthy assumptions fall away without resistance. Resume your regularly scheduled activities once the dust settles."
scorpio,2012-08-16,"You may experience free-floating anxiety today as you're feeling a combination of excitement and annoyance. Although others could seem overly stubborn, you might actually be the one most responsible for holding yourself back. Even if you feel trapped by the current circumstances, don't focus on your limitations. Instead, allow your feelings to take you wherever they go without judging them. You can easily find your way back to a more productive place later on."
sagittarius,2012-08-16,"Unpredictable Uranus rattles magnetic Venus today while she visits your 8th House of Intimacy. If your pocketbook isn't directly affected now, your love life might be the next thing in line. Don't give anyone else power over you -- either emotionally or financially -- as your current need for immediate gratification may feel more important than how much cash you have in your checking account. Be willing to take a risk as long as you carefully consider the consequences first."
capricorn,2012-08-16,"Someone may jump to the wrong conclusion about your desires, especially if you aren't forthcoming with what you want now. In other words, what you don't say today can be even more important than what you do say. Step outside of your comfort zone and speak your piece. No matter how irrational your feelings are, it's still better if they're out in the open."
aquarius,2012-08-16,"Your attachment to objects of beauty might get you into trouble today, whether you are attracted to a piece of art or another person. Although your desires aren't necessarily physical, they could manifest that way now. Ultimately, you're more in love with an idea than with anything in reality. Understanding this can help reduce your frustration, especially if you are less than satisfied with what you receive."
pisces,2012-08-16,"Your behavior seems highly erratic now, making it difficult for anyone to trust you. However, your emotions are very close to the surface and your sudden mood shifts are quickly reflected in transparent mannerisms. It's not necessary to be in total control today. Let others know that you are moving through some rough waters and could use their support. Ask and you just might receive more than you expect."
aries,2012-08-17,"Today's Leo New Moon activates your 5th House of Love and Play, kicking off an exceptionally creative and romantic month for you Rams. You have a lot of energy that you want to direct toward meaningful but possibly non-productive projects. Even your attitude toward relationships could lighten up from this passing cosmic influence. Instead of worrying about other people's expectations now, open up your heart and follow your bliss."
taurus,2012-08-17,"The Leo New Moon falls in your 4th House of Roots today, symbolizing your need for a deeper soul connection with your family and yourself. This drive can play out in different ways, but you may be drawn toward thinking about your past as your attention turns inward. Don't withdraw from all your social activities; instead, make sure to integrate your inner life with your outer one. Opening your heart brings unexpected rewards."
gemini,2012-08-17,"The Leo New Moon's presence in your 3rd House of Communications emphasizes your natural gift of gab. Your life is busier than ever these days, and it may feel as if time is accelerating now. You are at the front of an energetic push, and you can accomplish a lot as long as you make a concerted effort to finish what you start. There's no need to hold back if you're passionate about your goals."
cancer,2012-08-17,"The New Moon is usually an introspective time when you reflect on what you have been doing and what is coming up. However, the outgoing Leo New Moon lands in your 2nd House of Possessions today, bringing you an opportunity to improve your relationship with money. It may be time to give some quality attention to your pocket book, your checkbook and your overall financial condition. Demonstrate your commitment to fiscal responsibility by taking care of business before you wander off to do anything else."
leo,2012-08-17,"You are on center stage today with the New Moon falling in your very own sign, possibly offering you your fifteen minutes of fame. You may tire of the drama as the attention turns into a spotlight that follows your every move. Nevertheless, take time now to review what you've done this past year, so you can start to plan for your future. You're being pushed into new territory, and the good news is that you have the energy and willpower to reach any destination you choose."
virgo,2012-08-17,"Today's Leo New Moon in your 12th House of Soul Consciousness emphasizes your desire to get back in touch with your spirituality. You want to dig deeper into your own dream world to explore how the conditions in your life are being affected by your past actions. However, this journey is not just a mental exercise, for the ramifications of your current work can be quite profound. Normally, you do whatever seems most appropriate in the moment, but now you actually get to change the root causes of your behavior."
libra,2012-08-17,"You want to express your feelings about your friends now that the Leo New Moon illuminates your 11th House of Social Networking. Thankfully, whatever you say today can have a lasting positive impact upon your relationships. A new emotional cycle is pushing you to think more about your dreams in terms of concrete goals. Consider what you want out of life, but don't stir up too much change all at once. Even the smallest steps taken will have unknown consequences."
scorpio,2012-08-17,"The Leo New Moon isn't usually an easy one for you because it forms a stressful square with your Sun sign. You are drawn out into the open more than you prefer today, even if you would rather silently hold on to a perspective that you developed in the past. However, this New Moon is supported by a sextile from assertive Mars, encouraging you to act on your feelings. Don't resist; carefully observe the signs around you and be ready to make your move at the right moment."
sagittarius,2012-08-17,"It's still mid-summer, yet it might already feel as if cooler weather is just around the corner. However, this feeling is actually a reflection of your intuitive perceptions more than anything else. You realize that things are getting ready to change, but even with the Leo New Moon buzzing your 9th House of Big Plans, you cannot see what's coming. The future will be here before you know it. Quit worrying and simply enjoy what you have now -- even if it's not everything you desire."
capricorn,2012-08-17,"You are normally focused on practical logistics because you live in the realm of circumstances and common sense. However, you are growing more concerned with meanings that arise from your own psyche as the Leo New Moon highlights your 8th House of Mystery. This is a great time to practice philosophical inquiry, therapy or meditation. Consider trying different activities that allow you to delve beneath the apparent surface. Expect the unexpected and you won't be disappointed."
aquarius,2012-08-17,"Situations unfolding in your life now are too complicated for a quick and easy explanation. However, these events can open you up to new ideas and philosophies. Today's Leo New Moon falls in your 7th House of Relationships, setting a tone for the entire month ahead. Be aware that you may need to control your anger if others push your emotional buttons. Remember, your first reaction might not always be your best."
pisces,2012-08-17,"Today's Leo New Moon lands in your 6th House of Details, presenting you with a dilemma because it asks you to act in ways that are useful, rather than just compassionate. You would like to turn on your intuition and jump right in, but it's wise to take time to get all your ducks in a row before initiating action. A rational approach is your best bet now."
aries,2012-08-18,Your idealism quickly fades as new thoughts fuel your creativity today. You don't need to rely on your dreams now; you can step beyond the limitations that were previously holding you back. Your real life could become almost as good as your fantasy world. But don't keep your enthusiasm all to yourself; your story is inspirational to others. Your influence positively impacts those who know you as long as you acknowledge the difference between fact and fancy.
taurus,2012-08-18,"An authority figure may be the source of a problem today, leaving you unsure how to respond. You don't want to make a big deal out of something unimportant, yet glossing over a significant issue can come back to haunt you later on. Delay action for the first part of the day if possible; once you trust your instincts, your uncertainty will fade and you'll know exactly how to approach the situation."
gemini,2012-08-18,"You have a lot to say today and people listen to you because you're often very clever. The words slip smoothly off your tongue with the greatest of ease. However, if anyone assumes that you're telling the whole truth, you could find yourself in trouble now. Stretching poetic license too far in your favor isn't a good idea, for you might not feel so great when the tension snaps back to reality. It may be more fun to embellish your story, but it's wiser to stick with the facts."
cancer,2012-08-18,"It's challenging to remain clear about your desires today, but a lack of certainty won't stop you from voicing your feelings anyway. Your understanding of what you want is transforming along with your values, so try not to make too much of your current needs. Give yourself room to vacillate before creating a concrete plan and announcing your new intentions to the world."
leo,2012-08-18,"You have the finesse to talk your way out of almost anything now, but it's not a smart idea to test the limits of this gift. You are very charming, yet a pleasant personality isn't a substitute for speaking the truth. There's no need to rely on anyone else for your reality check today, since others may be feeding your fantasies. Instead, take your current thoughts with a grain of salt, no matter how amazing they sound. The most worthwhile ones will still be useful in a few days."
virgo,2012-08-18,"An emotional connection with a profound spiritual truth might open up a new path for you to follow. You have a chance to move past your analytical skills and tap into the power of your imagination. Visualize all the possibilities and let your mind travel just for curiosity's sake. If you discover a brilliant idea on your journey, seize the opportunity and work toward making your dreams come true."
libra,2012-08-18,"You're appreciative of the unconventional people in your life now, for they spur you to the heights of your creativity. Although your intuition is strong, you cannot get away with making unrealistic wishes. The power of your positive thoughts might be able to move mountains, but not necessarily according to your schedule. Instead of focusing on others today, increase your efficiency by improving your own work habits. Minor changes can have major impact on your productivity."
scorpio,2012-08-18,"If you stay in touch with your feelings today, you can reach beyond your usual limits. But you won't be happy unless you consciously integrate your spiritual beliefs into everything else that you do. Monetary success isn't what's most important now. Possessions come and go, yet memories are yours to keep forever. Make choices from a sacred perspective rather than a mundane one and the rest will fall into place."
sagittarius,2012-08-18,"It's not easy to focus on one specific project today, since your mind is traveling all over the place. Fortunately, you don't need to spend money on an airplane ticket to visit faraway places; you can go anywhere within your imagination. Do some metaphysical journeying now because original ideas come to you when your brain is free from the drudgery of everyday routine. Just remember to meet your obligations before you slip away to dream."
capricorn,2012-08-18,"A little misunderstanding about shared property or resources may create a temporary rift between you and a close friend or partner. But instead of limiting your discussion to the specific issue, you need to dig beyond the apparent problem. A disagreement over finances might be symptomatic of a deeper struggle. Go directly toward the heart of the matter, even if it makes you feel uncomfortable at first. Your vulnerability can lead to unexpected rewards."
aquarius,2012-08-18,You are comfortable with all the movement today because your brain is buzzing and you feel very smart. But your edgy behavior might stir anxiety in others since they may not be used to the high level of mental activity. Examine your feelings because you could be sending mixed messages without even realizing it. Take the extra step and make sure that your friends and family understand your true intentions before rushing ahead and inadvertently hurting someone's feelings.
pisces,2012-08-18,"If you are unsure that your current approach to a problem is the best one, don't pretend that you have all the answers. Your defensive behavior only makes matters worse today, especially if someone is showing you a better way to accomplish a goal. Remember, there are multiple paths to the same destination; your willingness to take a different route can make all the difference in the world."
aries,2012-08-19,"You're able to express your feelings clearly today. It's not that you normally hide them; it's just that your emotions are now even more intense than usual. Fortunately, your natural spontaneity allows you to shift gears when necessary. You can be appropriately somber one moment and more lighthearted the next, enabling others to relax and enjoy your company. Let your moods flow with the changing tides, but don't stray too far from your original intentions."
taurus,2012-08-19,"You have a lot to say about your feelings today, especially as they pertain to family issues. However, you're better expressing your love by direct action rather than just talking about it. Taking care of those closest to you can be a source of pleasure, but don't be overprotective. You'll draw others closer if you give them the freedom that they need. Your faith in them means more than you know."
gemini,2012-08-19,"You may try to persuade a powerful person to be your ally today by making bold statements. However, a grandiose display of emotion won't cast you in a positive light. Toning down your message is a good idea so you can actually make a longer-lasting impression. Don't say more than is necessary now; too many words might dilute your intent."
cancer,2012-08-19,"You can accomplish a lot around the house today because you're more interested in getting results than in attracting attention. You are happy to work behind the scenes to maximize your positive impact. Nevertheless, you would ultimately like to be recognized for your contribution. Be patient; appreciation is already on the way."
leo,2012-08-19,"It's tricky to step out of your current emotional situation, especially if you're still processing recent events. You could be overly dramatic and make a performance out of your perspective. Although you are eager to speak your piece in a new and different way, it's tempting to repeat an old familiar message to the same audience. Think about what's coming up rather than what recently happened. Taking a calculated risk might be in your best interest now."
virgo,2012-08-19,"Your emotions may be so powerful today that you have a difficult time sharing them with anyone else. But, unfortunately, someone might make a wrong assumption if you keep your feelings to yourself. As scary as it to reveal what's in your closet, you will feel safer once your secret is told. An open flow of information works in your favor now."
libra,2012-08-19,"You are the host with the most today as insightful Pluto harmonizes with dependable Saturn in your sign. However, you are somewhat restrained as you entertain others because your mind is on weightier issues that possibly affect your most important relationships. Instead of trying so hard to make everyone else feel good, get serious about taking care of yourself. You'll be even more amazing once you acknowledge your heart's desires."
scorpio,2012-08-19,"Your key planet Pluto continues to turn your everyday world upside down. However, a magical alignment from taskmaster Saturn gives you the ability to work extra hard now without depleting your energy. But don't decline a social invitation too quickly; hanging out with your friends increases your self-confidence and sharing your thoughts helps you clarify your goals."
sagittarius,2012-08-19,"You may have a strong desire to get your chores done efficiently, yet you might find it hard to focus on mundane tasks. You are inclined to dream of faraway places and distant times with the Sun still traveling through your 9th House of Adventure. Although it's challenging to stay in the present moment now, establishing balance between your future goals and current obligations can make your days more fulfilling."
capricorn,2012-08-19,"If you are dreaming about asking someone out on a date or taking on a business partner, act on your feelings while you can still think clearly. But save your energy by concentrating on what's happening right now. Don't stress over the results of your invitation because your worry will only lessen your chances for success. Nevertheless, rehearsing your lines a few times before actually popping the question takes the edge off your anxiety and helps you feel more comfortable about taking a risk."
aquarius,2012-08-19,"It's time to clarify your intentions by talking about what you need. Don't waste any energy mincing your words; just come right out and say what's on your mind. Although showing your vulnerability often makes you uncomfortable, it feels natural today to get real with someone you trust. Thankfully, your straightforward approach now makes it easier for others to respond in unexpectedly positive ways."
pisces,2012-08-19,"It may seem as if you are hurrying to finish tasks that should have already been completed. Unfortunately, your self-criticism might have that all-too-familiar deja vu feeling. But don't be too hard on yourself because something is different this time. Steer clear of too much analysis; just act on what's in your heart now rather than what's in your head. Honoring your emotions will ultimately help you be more powerful in all you do."
aries,2012-08-20,"The emphasis in your life shifts toward those who depend upon you while the cooperative Libra Moon visits your 7th House of Relationships. You may be feeling particularly enthusiastic as superhero Mars supports your current efforts at putting others at ease. But you must also attend to your own needs, too, or you won't have anything left to give anyone else. Being a perfect partner is an admirable goal, but don't lose yourself in the process."
taurus,2012-08-20,"In an ideal world there would be a simple way to make your workday more pleasant, but in reality you might feel overwhelmed now. You cannot escape into a dreamworld because there is just too much going on. Fortunately, once you acknowledge what needs to be done today, you should be able to muster up the determination and energy to tackle your chores one by one. Don't give up; you could surprise yourself with how much you actually accomplish by the end of the day."
gemini,2012-08-20,"The emotional web you weave could develop some tangles this morning, and your energy might feel as if it's tied up in knots. However, you'll be able to straighten out everything once you navigate your way through the challenges. Don't worry about finishing a task a little late; keep your eyes on the goal and you might arrive at your destination sooner than you expect."
cancer,2012-08-20,"Unexpressed feelings on the home front could complicate family dynamics, even if you try to remain objective in your assessment of the situation. You're extra sensitive to those you love today, making it difficult to separate your own feelings from theirs. Contemplating your options makes sense, but dwelling on them is of no use. Don't hesitate to take action once you review the possibilities because you have a small window of opportunity now to make something wonderful happen."
leo,2012-08-20,"Sometimes your path seems quite obvious to you, but today a few distractions could obscure your way. You might even feel as if others are being overly pushy, trying to persuade you to set aside your plans in favor of theirs. Unfortunately, pushing back doesn't solve anything; it just escalates the tension. Don't try to justify your actions. Sidestep the entire conflict by simply doing your thing instead of wasting energy in endless dialogue."
virgo,2012-08-20,"Everything seemed pretty clear for a while, but now you're thinking about a whole new set of possibilities and doubting the wisdom of your current path. Your sudden exuberance for something different can complicate things by luring you off track. It's time to stop and think before expending more time and money on a goal that may no longer interest you. Don't switch directions yet; wait until you are certain about what your heart wants."
libra,2012-08-20,"You have a good excuse to change your mind now that the Moon is in your sign. But this is not about logic today, which is your usual reason for making seesaw decisions. It's your emotions that are currently fluctuating every few minutes. If you don't like what you're feeling, just patiently wait for the next wave until your moods begin to stabilize."
scorpio,2012-08-20,"You're trying to keep your life balanced, but there is only so much you can manage today. There are too many variables to track now, each adding subtle nuances to a delicate situation. You can make yourself crazy by attempting to untangle the threads of complexity. Or, you can turn up the volume on your daydreams and float downstream for a while. Escaping makes sense as long as you know that it's only temporary. You'll have more energy to deal with everything in a few days."
sagittarius,2012-08-20,"You may feel as if you need to do something with your friends today or you'll miss the chance. Unfortunately, as tempting as it might be to play hooky, you won't necessarily be able to just take the day off. Meanwhile, lucky Jupiter encourages you to believe that everything will work out fine, even if you bail on a previous commitment. But your overconfidence can steer you wrong. Don't let blind optimism talk you out of being responsible. The choice is all yours, along with the consequences."
capricorn,2012-08-20,"Although you have relationship issues on your mind, they're just a distraction from the real dilemma at hand. Your more immediate concern is about your career path; decisions need to be made that can have long-lasting ramifications. Ironically, your current choices have a significant impact on a partner or spouse. Luckily, your emotions settle down later in the day, revealing a clear path to your goal. Patience, combined with hard work, leads you to your desired destination."
aquarius,2012-08-20,"You may think that your adventurous ideas are too outrageous today, but it would be an interesting exercise to let your imagination go wild anyhow. Set aside the restraints of logic, resources and time while you explore the alternatives without being attached to the outcome. Ultimately, you might not be able to take this particular dream trip, but giving yourself time to think about it now is a vacation in its own right."
pisces,2012-08-20,"Your restlessness could get the best of you today as you think about the numerous possibilities before you. Unfortunately, you're tied to previously made commitments, so you can't just wander off to explore alternate paths. Instead, keep your eyes on the road and your feet on the ground. Utilizing your common sense now is a wise antidote to all the spacey energy coming your way."
aries,2012-08-21,"This is a day of compromise for you sometimes-uncompromising Rams. The good news is that you are willing to soften your hard edges now. Your uncharacteristic gentleness enables you to meet others halfway. In turn, this sensitivity allows you to avoid unnecessary conflict. But don't give in too quickly or you'll end up settling for too little and resenting your current situation."
taurus,2012-08-21,"You may wish that you could take the day off, but you have responsibilities that need your undivided attention. The sooner you accept that work comes before play today, the easier it will be to improve your attitude. Although just meeting your obligations will get you by, don't take the lazy way out now. Be practical and make use of the Moon's visit to your 6th House of Habits by making positive changes to your daily routine that move you in a healthier direction."
gemini,2012-08-21,"Your most important responsibilities may be temporarily put on the back burner for a while today. But your need to relax doesn't automatically mean you can avoid your obligations. Then again, you don't need permission from anyone to honor your needs as long as you also deliver on what you promised. Go ahead and be spontaneous. Have yourself some good old-fashioned fun, but cover your bases."
cancer,2012-08-21,"You might be required to make a decision that affects your home and family today; however, you would prefer waiting to see how things develop. Unfortunately, things can come to a head so you really should take your current situation seriously. Ambivalence won't get you through this one, but hiding your feelings won't work either. Come out of your protective shell and show your true colors, even if revealing your opinions feels like risky business."
leo,2012-08-21,"Your even-handed approach to life now can be your greatest strength. Being fair and objective takes some mental effort, but is well worth it. The alternative is to rely on your charm, but this strategy will likely leave you short of your goal. Use your common sense to sift through a variety of possibilities and then do your best to find common ground that's acceptable to all."
virgo,2012-08-21,"It's time to think about new ways to accomplish your goals now because the old methods may be growing stale. It's helpful to take a few deep breaths before you act so you can think about what's most important to you. Even if you already made up your mind yesterday, review your decision today. But don't wallow in self-doubt; pick a path and be confident as you proceed."
libra,2012-08-21,"Although you're moodier than usual with the evocative Moon in your sign, you can trust your feelings now. Even if you're dreaming of a perfect day today, you're also thinking about some deeper psychological issues that you have wrestled with before. Thankfully, you have newfound hope for resolution or change. Use your natural instincts to look at both sides of the situation before choosing which one to support."
scorpio,2012-08-21,"There's a lot you're not saying today, but then again, you may not be aware that something is still missing from the picture. Unfortunately, what you don't notice now can come back and bite you later on. Your best defense is to think about the unthinkable. Push your own buttons by exploring your fear of change. If you can face the dark, you might just realize that the unknown is not as scary as it seems from a distance."
sagittarius,2012-08-21,"You're no stranger to living in the future since you often aim your arrows of thought toward the next possible adventure. However, you must bring your big ideas down to earth today or you might face disappointment later on. Instead of fantasizing about an unrealistic journey around the world, start planning a less ambitious activity that you could actually manifest. It's better now to set a goal that you can reach than one that will remain beyond your grasp."
capricorn,2012-08-21,"Other people are depending on you and the pressure is palpable today. Escape might sound like a good idea, but you know that you cannot quit before the job is done. Although you may feel as if you are in over your head, don't entertain the possibility of failure now. Fortunately, you know exactly what you must do, so bite the bullet and get to work. There will be time enough for rest once you're done."
aquarius,2012-08-21,"It feels as if you're riding on a roller coaster lately. Although you might have been lost in fantasyland yesterday, there's very little room for any kind of escape today. There will be no idle dreaming of your alternate life on a tropical beach because you have serious work to finish now. Instead of being angry about the unchangeable circumstances, use your emotions to fuel your superhero efforts. It seems like you're facing a final exam, but with dedication and perseverance you'll surely pass with flying colors."
pisces,2012-08-21,"You have something important to say now, but it's hard to put your complex emotions into words. Ironically, you're just as impatient with others for not understanding you as you are with yourself for not speaking clearly. The harder you try to get your point across, the more confusion sets in. Be smart and watch the signals; if your message isn't connecting with anyone, stop pushing. You'll be more successful if you start up the conversation again tomorrow after everyone has had time to chill out."
aries,2012-08-22,"The Sun's entrance into meticulous Virgo makes you slightly uncomfortable because you find it challenging to focus on the details. You want to get up and do something right away. However, the Virgo Sun reminds you some things are worth waiting for now. Thankfully, your patience is rewarded later in the day when optimism replaces negativity. Don't let your impatience get the best of you; concentrate on your long-term goals rather than immediate gratification."
taurus,2012-08-22,"The earthy Virgo Sun feels easy because it naturally reinforces your pragmatic approach to life. The month ahead can bring you several significant realizations about your relationships. Fortunately, you don't need to be concerned about success versus failure. All you have to think about is doing what's right. Keep your feet on the ground and listen to your heart."
gemini,2012-08-22,"You are probably more stressed by the information in your life now than by the company you keep. Nevertheless, it's crucial to set priorities and decide which data is the most useful. The situation grows more complex as the Sun moves into thoughtful Mercury's other sign, Virgo. A family member may demand a solution, but answers are elusive. Don't respond if it means compromising your intellectual integrity."
cancer,2012-08-22,"It's a communication-oriented day, and the Sun's presence in rational Virgo motivates you to sift through your ideas and eliminate the ones that don't stand up to your high standards. The problem is that the speed of events in your immediate surroundings might accelerate to an unsustainable pace. Fortunately, your analytical skills help you juggle the various parts of your life. But trying to manage everything now only makes you more anxious. It's admirable to set your goals high, but give yourself plenty of time to reach them."
leo,2012-08-22,"You may have mixed emotions today as the Sun leaves your sign to begin its month-long stay in cautious Virgo. The lights were shining brightly on you the past few weeks and it felt good. However, now it's someone else's turn to take center stage. Although you might feel relieved, it's likely that you also feel a bit let down. Step out of the spotlight; once you are behind the scenes you can take the momentum you've gained and turn it into something that is real and lasting."
virgo,2012-08-22,"This is your special time of year to be reinvigorated by the radiant Sun's life force. Although you may start off in a bad mood, your attitude improves throughout the day. Look back over your previous year to take stock in what you've accomplished, re-evaluate your present path, and visualize the year ahead. Blow out the candles in your imagination and make your wishes come true."
libra,2012-08-22,"It's time to get down to business so you can finish what you already started. But if you catch yourself daydreaming today, gently pull your thoughts back to the present moment. Maintain a high level of objectivity so you can respond to specific situations in your immediate surroundings without being emotional. This isn't the best time to fantasize about the future; instead, be pragmatic now and concentrate on the work at hand."
scorpio,2012-08-22,"The precision of the exacting Virgo Sun stirs the deep passions that motivate you Scorpios, both for better and for worse. You can erupt from the heat of the center of the volcano into the blue sky of hopes and dreams. But this is not about the appearance of random fantasies of better times and different places. Your current vision is about the very real goals you are creating now to drive yourself right into your co-created future."
sagittarius,2012-08-22,Your big Sagittarius energy may be at odds with the attention to minute details that is required by the narrowing Virgo Sun this month. But there are rewards for you Archers who shoot your arrows of intention high into the night sky while also concentrating on your work and career. Set aside some of your grandiose plans today so you can put one foot carefully in front of the other. Great journeys begin with a single small step. There will be time for giant leaps later on once you're already on the move.
capricorn,2012-08-22,"You Mountain Goats like to dig your hooves into solid ground, and you get your chance now that the Sun is entering earthy Virgo. It seems like there are specific things you must do today and you're eager to perform to the best of your abilities. Applying careful analysis to the situation and letting others know what you think is the best course of action."
aquarius,2012-08-22,"It's challenging to settle down today, even if you skipped your morning coffee. You feel like a mosquito nervously buzzing around waiting for a summer storm that never arrives. You may find it difficult to solve a problem; just as you figure out what needs to be done, the circumstances change and a totally different solution is required. Stay light on your feet and be ready to respond to the situation as it evolves."
pisces,2012-08-22,"Relationship issues are on your mind now that the Sun's visit to your 7th House of Partners emphasizes your interactions with others. But you might not understand a co-worker as much as you would like, possibly creating an insurmountable gulf between you and someone else. Nevertheless, it may be wise to temporarily bury your feelings and downplay your intuition. Keep in mind that this isn't a life-altering change; it's simply what the day's energy requires."
aries,2012-08-23,"You may be charging through these days with newfound excitement, but a familiar friend is knocking at a hidden door of your own subconscious. Old issues are brought to light that you might have thought were resolved a long time ago. However, the unconscious mind isn't limited by our sense of linear time. Allow the thoughts from your past to resurface now, for they are messengers that can help you remember what is important to your journey."
taurus,2012-08-23,"A problem may not come to a head today, but it still feels as if a power struggle is brewing with someone close to you. There are parts of this conflict that might not be out in the open yet. Although neither of you have all the facts, it won't necessarily prevent the current standoff. If you feel that you are being pushed around, try your best to be flexible in your response since this can help ameliorate the tension in the air."
gemini,2012-08-23,"An interaction with a powerful person today may leave you wondering what happened and why you even jumped into the fray. This isn't a negative situation, but it might be difficult to remain detached from the drama unfolding in your immediate surroundings. Even if you try to push it out of sight, it's not going to go away. Don't waste energy fighting it. Summon your inner courage now and let your feelings, not your logic, guide your way."
cancer,2012-08-23,"You may be resentful about something you are required to do now. Your inner voice is telling you to grit your teeth and just finish your chores, while a second voice is encouraging you to express your feelings in protest. You are caught between these extremes, wondering what to do. If you are angry, it's best to share your concerns as kindly as you can or the suppressed energy will come back and bite you when you least expect it."
leo,2012-08-23,"You could inadvertently instigate an argument by overreacting to a situation on the home front today. It sounds like a good idea to sidestep confrontation, but there is a price to pay for keeping silent. You may feel as if you're walking through an emotional minefield now, but being truthful is still your best option. Set your fears aside; no one needs to get hurt if you are considerate of other people's boundaries. Expressing your feelings is the first step toward clearing the air. Listen to the response you receive with an open heart."
virgo,2012-08-23,"The pace of your daily routine speeds up today, but you would rather block out the world for a while so you can recharge your batteries. Unfortunately, checking out from your responsibilities isn't as simple as you wish. Even if you manage to escape, it probably won't last for long. Don't fight against the flow. Cooperating with others relieves the pressure and sets a good example for everyone to follow."
libra,2012-08-23,"You want to be practical now while fulfilling your obligations. Even just taking care of your finances by paying bills and balancing your checkbook can give you a feeling of accomplishment now. But don't be afraid to think about your personal values and how to better integrate them into your life. Thankfully, setting goals doesn't mean you need to reach them today; just aim yourself in the right direction. There's more time to get there than you think."
scorpio,2012-08-23,"You are feeling frisky now that powerful Mars and the emotional Moon are in passionate Scorpio to turn up the heat. You are itching with excess desires and attractions, but may not know what to do with all your energy. Physical exercise is a good idea; even a relaxing walk will help to keep things flowing. Your tendency is to bite off more than you can chew, so monitor your actions before you find yourself in over your head."
sagittarius,2012-08-23,"You are riding a surge of intense subconscious energy today, like a surfer on a powerful wave. You like the excitement; the adrenaline rush makes you feel fully alive. Just don't get so distracted that you lose touch with your unexpressed feelings. You may have an opportunity for increased intimacy now, but you have to be willing to take a different kind of risk. Instead of avoiding the discomfort of vulnerability, discuss your desires with someone you trust."
capricorn,2012-08-23,"You can kick back today and contemplate your current position in life. Naturally, there is always something else to do and more goals to accomplish, but just spending time with friends or family now brings you great joy. However, beneath your apparent happiness you could be struggling with a more serious issue that you aren't ready to share. Don't judge yourself too harshly if you decide to enjoy yourself while you can. The existential questions of life will still be there when you return to them later on."
aquarius,2012-08-23,"Your astute perspective inspires you to be hopeful, no matter how bleak the global economic or political landscapes are now. Even if it seems like the rest of the world has gone mad, you don't have to accept defeat in your personal world. Be relentless in your pursuit of a more meaningful life for you and those you love. Your optimism and persistence enable you to rise above the chaos and do the right thing."
pisces,2012-08-23,"There's an underlying tension that is creating a struggle between who you want to be and what your partner or friends expect from you. There may not be an easy resolution to this dilemma, but you still might believe that things will resolve if you just hang on. This is a dangerous strategy because you can talk yourself out of taking the necessary action that would bring you closer to happiness. Instead of clinging to an illusion now, seek concrete ways to make positive changes in the present moment."
aries,2012-08-24,"You are eager to negotiate for the common good today, but you're not ready to set aside your personal needs. You know all about your financial bottom line and may be afraid of reaching it. But don't worry; things are not as grim as they appear. Try not to make too many impulsive judgments until you have all of the facts. Acting too soon might lead you into trouble you can simply avoid by planning in advance."
taurus,2012-08-24,"The adventurous Sagittarius Moon is fueling your emotional renewal, yet there's also another influence bubbling up today. Nebulous Neptune brings a highly spiritual kind of love to your relationships, even if your friends confuse you with their actions. Fortunately, you should be able to draw on your common sense to get some perspective. But don't pretend you know exactly what's going on now; stay in touch with your uncertainty, even if it makes you uneasy. There's magic to be found if you can surrender to the unknown."
gemini,2012-08-24,"You may find yourself swinging back and forth between the largest possible view of life and the most specific details. Your imagination soars today, allowing you to see every issue from a global perspective. But it's difficult for you to act on a grandiose vision. Bringing your mental meandering back down to earth will be rewarded now. Find small ways to move toward the big picture."
cancer,2012-08-24,"You aren't as resistant to change as your co-workers think. After all, the Crab's daily rhythms are intimately connected with the constantly shifting tides. But today, as emotional currents finally shift, it may be challenging to tell which way the waters will ultimately be flowing. Hold on to your current position for now. Wait a few days until the confusion clears before taking action."
leo,2012-08-24,"If a close friend or partner is hard to read, it may be that your own confusion is broadcasting mixed messages which now echo back to you. If you are uncertain about a relationship, don't fall into the trap of pretending that everything is OK. By covering up your feelings today, you are setting the stage for more misunderstandings to surface later on. Be honest about what you need while also imagining the best possible outcome."
virgo,2012-08-24,"Your spiritual energy is growing stronger and metaphysical interests may take on greater significance these days. Subtle changes are occurring now, even if their effects aren't yet visible. Although there are big shifts on the horizon, they are already being activated in your subconscious. Quit worrying about the details today to fully benefit from what's happening in your imagination."
libra,2012-08-24,"You are the uncontested champion of the balancing act, yet today you're feeling unsettled as the cosmic conflict between the willful Sun and confusing Neptune now pulls you in two directions. Part of you is ascending into the spiritual realm as another part handles the very real limitations of the material world. You may idealize the situation, yet it is crucial to try to see things as they truly are. Honoring both sides -- the invisible and the tangible -- ensures that you'll be ready for whatever happens next."
scorpio,2012-08-24,"You may not know where you are going these days, yet your role in the outer world is still very important to you. You wonder if you should pursue your career or place more attention on the spiritual dimensions of your soul. There are no quick and easy answers to this existential dilemma. Simplify the issues as much as you can and then let yourself feel what it's like to linger in your own uncertainty. The longer you sustain the mystery, the easier the resolution will be when clarity finally arrives."
sagittarius,2012-08-24,"You are often drawn toward the grandest ideas, since you enjoy living your life in a big way. You may not always attend to all the details, and sometimes they can come back to haunt you. You don't have the inclination to return from your current dreams yet if you're wandering on the outer edges of the universe. However, you might not have a choice if the hard cold truth requires you to pay close attention. Take your cues from reality and do the responsible thing."
capricorn,2012-08-24,The inspirational Sagittarius Moon tends to pull you away from more practical realms. It may be more difficult to keep both feet on the ground now with magical Neptune lifting you into the clouds of illusion. You might be required to solve complicated problems involving your relationships with friends or co-workers. Stick to the facts because there is great potential to misunderstand each other's basic values. Listening with your heart helps to keep you on track.
aquarius,2012-08-24,"One-on-one relationships are a source of confusion today, especially if you don't listen to what others are saying. It takes extra effort to hear the truth because your words can get in the way of the message. But don't force your perspective on anyone else. The solution to the current tension comes from recognizing multiple points of view and allowing them to exist side by side now without panicking."
pisces,2012-08-24,"You are quite wise to attend to the rigorous demands of your life by taking concrete action and checking off each item on your list of things to do. The truth is that you may find it very challenging to maintain focus today as the Sun opposes your key planet Neptune. You would rather spend time daydreaming, reading a book or going to a movie. Finish your work first; you can fully enjoy guilt-free time afterward to activate your imagination."
aries,2012-08-25,"Although someone you trust could be overly concerned with a brewing storm, you're likely rounding up a search party to go looking for rainbows. You see the positive side of nearly anything now -- whether it exists in reality or not. A close friend may accuse you of just spinning your wheels, but remember that tonight's Mars-Neptune hook-up makes it your job to have faith today, no matter what. If you believe in yourself, your dreams can become real."
taurus,2012-08-25,You are often skeptical because you really don't like to be confused or misled. It's quite simple; you want to know what's going on. But you may be more attuned to subtle energies today and are therefore open to spiritual truths that you might otherwise miss. Don't settle for your regular approach now; the comforts of the three-dimensional world will only leave you dissatisfied. Wandering off to explore a parallel universe could be fulfilling as long as you return home for dinner.
gemini,2012-08-25,"It may seem as if speaking honestly solves nearly any problem that surfaces today, but things are not as simple as they appear. Your best strategy is to be sincere and communicate in the spirit of compromise. Unfortunately, as clever as you are now, it's difficult to know what is real these days. Accept the challenge and keep trying to put your finger on the elusive truth. Hitting the mark will quickly ease the tension."
cancer,2012-08-25,Your personal boundaries are not very well defined today and it may be difficult to keep your feelings separate from the tensions of the world. You might even feel as if complex geopolitical events are somehow directly affecting your own family. Face your fears instead of hiding from them. Acting with love and compassion makes life better for you and all those within your spheres of influence.
leo,2012-08-25,"Unresolved feelings may add to your general uneasiness today because getting clarity about your current circumstances is tricky business. Your frustration tempts you to seek an escape route as you consider cashing in your chips and heading home. However, you might also be ready to make a personal sacrifice, but the role of a martyr just doesn't suit your style. Although you cannot single-handedly save everyone, it's still probably worth a try. If nothing else, playing superhero for the day could be a great adventure."
virgo,2012-08-25,"Even the most intense, in-depth analysis won't likely help to solve your current dilemmas. This strategy is very tempting, yet it's a trap since you cannot think your way out of the binds of logic with psychic Neptune so active now. Whether you like it or not, you have to rely on your imagination. Although the idea of dreaming your way to success makes you nervous, it's time to trust something beyond language. The power of faith is so strong that it might even surprise you."
libra,2012-08-25,"You may not understand exactly what's happening now as your dreams seem to become real. Although you try to remain detached, it's easy to get hooked on your own fantasies today. You might even feel discouraged because you're unable to maintain your usual objectivity. Stop fighting your feelings; creative treasures are waiting for you, but you cannot find them by sitting on the fence."
scorpio,2012-08-25,"You know there is often more happening than can be perceived by the five senses alone. Although you respect the hidden realms and the magic that arises from them, you might confuse the current darkness now with a lack of understanding. There's no time to waste by wallowing in self-doubt. Let go of whatever is gnawing at you. Magic is afoot; say goodbye to your previous caterpillar self and trust in the process. The butterfly will emerge if you believe in yourself."
sagittarius,2012-08-25,"You could get totally lost in your own thoughts today. On the positive side, you may become more involved with a social cause based upon your beliefs. Unfortunately, you might think that everything is on the up and up, only to discover that you missed something important. Be aware that you can deceive yourself now, especially when it comes to spiritual matters. However, it's less essential to be right than it is to find peace."
capricorn,2012-08-25,"You may try to reach too far today if you're not paying attention to your energy level. You might go too fast because you don't know your own speed limit. Events can spiral out of control now, raising fears that a situation at work could get worse before it gets better. However, maintaining a clear vision of what you want helps you prepare for the upcoming changes."
aquarius,2012-08-25,"You have a highly idealistic vision of the future and it may disturb you how far off everything has drifted from your perfect fantasy. You might feel alienated because you don't relate to what other humans are doing to the planet, other animals and even each other. But getting discouraged is a waste of energy today. Accept that you don't have a quick and easy solution because there isn't one. Instead, focus your energy on those closest to you and be a model for the lifestyle of your dreams."
pisces,2012-08-25,"It's tempting to plan your own metaphysical escape from the circumstances that hold you back today, but avoiding serious issues won't make them go away. The most sensible way to lighten your load and lessen any unnecessary worry is to focus on the higher truth and continue moving in its direction. There is a spiritual side to everything that happens; thankfully, you'll discover you're on the right path if you act with compassion rather than resistance."
aries,2012-08-26,"It's difficult to distinguish your dreams from what's happening right in front of you today. Relationships really do hold great potential now, but remember that you're seeing everything through your subjective filters. You might not have the true picture yet, so don't make any promises you cannot keep."
taurus,2012-08-26,"You're tempted to set aside the facts in favor of what you want today, and ironically, this strategy might actually work for you. Just remember that you must still contend with reality sooner or later. In the meantime, accept the good energy that seems to be coming your way. The power of positive thinking helps to turn a difficult situation into one with great potential for growth."
gemini,2012-08-26,"Although you are willing to put your faith in a friend or partner today, it takes more than one person's optimism to get you through the day. An emotional drama can become complicated, especially if someone else's feelings contradict yours. You don't have to agree on every issue; instead of focusing on the differences, concentrate your attention on the similarities. Sharing a common dream allows you to temporarily sidestep an unnecessary conflict."
cancer,2012-08-26,"You might be pleasantly distracted by an infatuation today as fantasy-prone Neptune aspects hot Mars in your 5th House of Love. However, a problem stems from your difficulty with discerning reality from fantasy now. It's nearly impossible to tell where the hard edges of truth soften into the creative fabrications of your imagination. Wait for clarification from someone you trust before you swing into action."
leo,2012-08-26,"Even if you are feeling more somber than usual today, you can rely on your performance skills to overcome your uncharacteristic seriousness. Although withholding your fears and uncertainties may help you to remain in control, you have a lot more impact on others than you think. If you can imagine reaching your goal, talk about it in a positive manner. Painting the details of the image in your mind's eye helps you manifest your dream."
virgo,2012-08-26,"Let go of the little things today because they will not matter much in the long run. Try to loosen your grip on your daily routine; going with the flow can have an immediate beneficial effect on your self-esteem. An authoritative approach invites backlash. However, a hands-off style prompts your friends to be more encouraging of your goals, which increases your optimism. Let the day unfold without micromanaging each and every moment."
libra,2012-08-26,"Your artistic creativity is functioning at a very high level now, but you must consciously reach for your vision with all your heart if you want to make the most of it. Even if you don't have aesthetic leanings, your interactions with others allow you to apply your charm to get what you want today. Be careful and pay attention to the feedback you receive. Don't assume that everyone shares your dream until they let you know what they are thinking."
scorpio,2012-08-26,"You are at the threshold of a dream now, but you can't tell where it's taking you. Subconscious streams of thought are flowing into awareness and you might act quickly on what you see. But this isn't the time to just ride the currents of your imagination. Practice controlling your mind; keep your thoughts on track and you can turn today's fantasies into tomorrow's reality."
sagittarius,2012-08-26,"You may be confused about what's true today. Your smartest strategy now is to suspend belief and judgment if you cannot tell what is real. Just accept your perceptions as you would if they were scenes in a movie, without any emotional attachment. If you make an important decision, you might have to reconsider it in just a few days. Wait until reality sets you back on the ground before choosing your new direction."
capricorn,2012-08-26,"Your contributions are recognized today, even if you aren't working as hard as usual. Ironically, being acknowledged for your efforts presents a problem if you don't think you deserve the attention. Meanwhile, your current positive attitude tempts you to overextend your reach, especially if everything is looking good. Remember, it's more important now to conserve what you have rather than dreaming about what you can get."
aquarius,2012-08-26,"Your mind is roaming to the distant edges of your imagination today, dreaming of exotic lands and traveling to other galaxies. There's no need to hold yourself back since you are hearing the call of a great adventure -- and it's a perfect time to answer. Embrace the fantastic thoughts you are having now and apply them toward planning your next big getaway."
pisces,2012-08-26,"You may be feeling the pressure to let go of an unrealistic dream today, but it's tempting to hold on to your sweet fantasy, anyhow. You might believe that a more mature approach will serve you better. However, anything is possible now, and your visions could actually begin to manifest if you accept them as real. Don't sell yourself short. Imagination rules; even if you run into resistance, visualize your future the way you want it to be."
aries,2012-08-27,"You have a lot to do today, but your responsible attitude goes beyond the normal business hours. Your top priority is to finish your chores, so make a list of all your tasks and stay focused until you have made a serious dent in your work. Put your stress to use by pushing extra hard to tie up any loose ends now. Don't delay because your reservoir of energy could dissipate later in the week."
taurus,2012-08-27,"You may feel as if you are meeting resistance wherever you go when you would much rather be spending quality time with a close friend or partner. But others might seem emotionally cooler now as they set up roadblocks to delay your possible satisfaction. Try not to get too worked up over the stress. Instead, concentrate on the love that is in your life; celebrate the cup being half-full instead of complaining that it's half-empty."
gemini,2012-08-27,"Your greatest concern now is that you can't pursue every curiosity that pops up in your life. Your time and energy are limited by circumstances beyond your control, and your current situation may prevent you from being as footloose and fancy free as you prefer. Yet, behind the apparent frustrations, important changes are occurring in your private inner world, so don't stand in the way of progress."
cancer,2012-08-27,"Your emotional neediness could prevent you from finding happiness now, for it is not likely that others will meet your expectations. This is not as bad as it might sound since the real lesson here is about learning what you can give yourself. Use your time wisely to clearly define what you want from a relationship. If you are already in a close partnership of any kind, you may need to back off a bit to allow everyone involved more breathing room."
leo,2012-08-27,"It seems as if your life is going to settle down now, but this may be a premature judgment. Even if you see solid movement in your career, there are unexpected twists and turns in the path you have chosen. Be smart and prepare for whatever you might find once you get around the next bend in the road. Your ability to analyze the facts and decide what is most important will help you through this difficult phase."
virgo,2012-08-27,"Some people mistakenly think that creativity originates only from the wellsprings of inspiration. However, the source of your creative streak may be triggered from your desire to finish a project now. You know what you want and you have the ability to transform your professional ambitions and romantic urges into serious practical manifestations. Whatever you do today, be certain that it is done with a greater purpose in mind."
libra,2012-08-27,"Tension finds its way to the surface today, even if you are trying to maintain stability at home or in your relationships with your family. But a disruption to your routine might not be such a bad thing if it puts you in touch with repressed emotions. Don't resist your feelings now, even if they make you uncomfortable. Increased awareness facilitates positive change that may already be overdue."
scorpio,2012-08-27,"You may be facing two very different issues now. On one hand, you are redefining your own boundaries -- and this can lead to increased isolation for a while. On the other hand, a parade of amazing revelations prevents you from slipping into self-pity. Ultimately, you're amused by the soap opera that is your life. This is a very healthy attitude since personal growth is possible if you reduce the drama by cultivating some emotional detachment."
sagittarius,2012-08-27,"Although self-criticism can be a powerful motivation at certain times in your life, it just slows you down now. If your typically high self-esteem is presently faltering, make a deal with yourself to travel the depths of your subconscious. Decide what's most valuable and then come back up to the surface refreshed and ready to work for what you want."
capricorn,2012-08-27,"Waves of intense feelings wash over you, but your tendency is to strengthen your tide walls so you can shut off the flow of emotions. You may be afraid that if you allow these feelings to rise to the surface, they will destabilize your personal world in ways that are not easy to manage. However, the more you try to hold back your irrational emotions, the greater the possibility of unwanted changes. Relax your resistance; you can learn what you need to know by trusting your inner wisdom."
aquarius,2012-08-27,"Someone may be trying to control your behavior today, yet you don't seem to have enough information at your disposal to resist with confidence. There are hidden pieces to the puzzle now and it's difficult to fight an unseen enemy. Rather than actively arguing point by point, it's more productive to hold on to familiar routines for a while longer. The truth becomes clear soon enough, and there will still be time enough to act when it does."
pisces,2012-08-27,"You are being prohibited from expressing yourself as freely as you would like today, yet this restraint ironically works in your favor. If you say whatever is on your mind now, you could inadvertently offend the people that mean the most to you. If you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all. Patience is your best friend; proceed slowly and with great intent."
aries,2012-08-28,"Your life seems to grow crazier today, as if everything hasn't been weird enough already. You have a lot to do now, but others may not realize exactly how much you have on your plate. The good news is that you can compress time and accomplish a lot, especially when the pressure builds. Try to set a manageable pace for yourself, even if it's difficult to stick with your original plan."
taurus,2012-08-28,You are in a stressful frame of mind today and things that are usually fun and easy may become the source of anxiety. You might do better if you are willing to let go of your preconceived agenda and roll with the incoming waves of emotional intensity. An unexpected event could be a signal that something is off-kilter. If anything goes wrong now try to understand the deeper message. Staying open to change allows you to make the most of the present moment.
gemini,2012-08-28,"Circumstances grow more intense as you are pulled in multiple directions. You want to keep your attention on a specific task today, but chances are that you might be easily distracted. However, you may not be able to resist the temptation. Just remember to put yourself back on track as soon as you realize what has happened. Making the necessary adjustments throughout the day enables you to rise above the noise and reach your goals."
cancer,2012-08-28,"You have an innate sense of knowing when the emotional tides are changing. You can feel it in your stomach; you just know something's going on. Although your tendency now may be to say too much rather than too little, there are things that must be brought out into the light of day. Speak as kindly and respectfully as possible. Playing the guilt card won't improve the situation."
leo,2012-08-28,"You are experiencing a metaphorical changing of the guard; one phase is over yet the next one hasn't yet begun. In this time of being in between worlds, you have an opportunity to react to the circumstances as they unfold, without being anchored down by your own emotional baggage. Take the developments in your life slowly, for they are important ones and you really need to respond in a thoughtful manner."
virgo,2012-08-28,"Things seem to be getting better today, but the final outcome depends totally upon you. It's good news if you're willing to let go of people or things that no longer serve a meaningful purpose. It's also time to say goodbye to those aspects of your personality that impede your progress. Bring whatever makes you feel tense to the surface so you can deal with it out in the open once and for all."
libra,2012-08-28,"If someone seems erratic to you today, remember that you're the one being zapped by unpredictable Uranus. Anything that happens out of the blue now is pointing the way to hidden stress that needs to be released. Even if things seem crazy, it's time to take a serious look at your personal and professional relationships. Don't stand in the way of change. Be bold and stir up anything that feels stuck so that you can break free from old patterns."
scorpio,2012-08-28,"Your nervous system is buzzing today. You may feel as if you're trying to choose between wanting to participate in a group project and needing your personal freedom. However, it's exciting to be involved with something larger than your individual interests. Allow yourself to experience the energy of sudden change rather than attempting to avoid it. You will feel revitalized when the edginess settles down tomorrow."
sagittarius,2012-08-28,"Unexpected romantic conflict might surface today and have impact on other areas of your life. If there are relationship tensions brewing now, this is a time when they may suddenly blast into your awareness. But you aren't eager to show your vulnerability. Although this emotional exposure could be unpleasant at first, it's catalytic and certainly can lead to positive change. Clearing the air opens the doors for amazing opportunities to follow."
capricorn,2012-08-28,"You are attracted to a wide variety of new ideas during this topsy-turvy time. Something that you might have judged negatively during another period in your life now makes total sense. You are becoming more aware of innovative concepts that are normally outside of your comfort zone. If you allow yourself to entertain intellectual possibilities today, exciting experiences could follow. Let yourself experience the buzz, even if you choose not to act on it."
aquarius,2012-08-28,"You feed off of the energy of a group, but you don't actually feel as if you're part of it. Sometimes, when others are stressed you are just excited about the potential. You need to stay open to big changes now because things will only grow more unstable if you try to hold on to the safety of old habits and structures. Let go of those things that are holding you back to make the upcoming transition as smooth as possible."
pisces,2012-08-28,"It's time to expect the unexpected, even if you are comfortably settled into a relationship. Of course, knowing how to second-guess what's around the corner remains a mystery. Your need for freedom of expression is strong now, so anything can happen. If you have tied your future to a narrow band of expectations, then you could be in for an abrupt surprise. But if you remain open to new possibilities, today's awakening can carry you along toward your destination in life."
aries,2012-08-29,"You are committed to getting ahead at work today and not much will stand in your way. Although your enthusiasm inspires you, you're able to balance your confidence with a grounded sense of reality. You would be smart to get busy now while you have a practical outlook on what you need to accomplish. Don't wait for others to jump in to support you; the sooner you start, the faster you'll reach your destination."
taurus,2012-08-29,"Your romantic urges are strong now and there's not much to hold you back from expressing what's in your heart. You're attracted to the idea of romance, yet you have a very pragmatic approach to a relationship that you want to enliven with meaning. Exploring the possibilities in your imagination is exciting, but it's not enough. Finding a way to turn your desires into reality is what really counts."
gemini,2012-08-29,Your loyalty to your home and family may come to the forefront today as circumstances require you to supply a shoulder for someone to lean on. But every little thing you do now has more consequences than you expect. Think first before you respond so you can accurately express your deepest convictions. Others will appreciate you more when you take the time to show that you really care.
cancer,2012-08-29,"Although you may be ready to deepen a commitment today, something is telling you to wait. Of course, you won't likely listen to this cautionary voice of reason because you are feeling self-confident now. Even if you believe that you know exactly what steps to take next, there's still a part of you that just wants to have fun. Remain open to events as they develop and remember you might have to change your plans along the way."
leo,2012-08-29,"You may be choosing to wear that generous heart of yours on your sleeve where everyone can see how much you have to give. They can also tell how much you need to be appreciated and loved. Your openness is a double-edged sword now. Strong desires motivate you to take action right away, but you must moderate your behavior. Pay attention to others so you don't inadvertently hurt anyone as you seek emotional and sensual fulfillment."
virgo,2012-08-29,"Sometimes intense emotions tempt you to act defensively so no one realizes how strongly you're feeling today. The basic problem with this strategy is that your deeply rooted passions may get buried in the process. Letting others know your feelings can seem like risky business because you don't want to appear inappropriate. Nevertheless, it's safer than you think to be vulnerable now, so listen to your heart and do what it says."
libra,2012-08-29,"You are a champion at lightening up the atmosphere when a discussion gets down and dirty. It's not because you don't find meaning from the mysterious hidden places -- it's natural for you to try to balance the energies. Nevertheless, you're being pulled into a powerful tidal current of complex feelings -- and you might not be able to swim your way around it today. Flow with the emotions and keep breathing. You'll emerge with a new perspective if you stick with the process."
scorpio,2012-08-29,"The radiant Sun harmonizes with your key planet Pluto today, shining a light on that which is hidden. Passionate Pluto symbolizes the dark mysteries that might be scary because of ignorance. However, it's time to muster up an extra dose of courage and head down into the darkness of your own subconscious mind. Once you know the truth your reality grows brighter."
sagittarius,2012-08-29,"You might not be feeling as optimistic as you wish today, but you can rely on your strong inner resolve no matter what's happening in your outer life now. Your core beliefs are changing for reasons that you might not yet fully understand. Let go of those things that have already begun to slip away. Don't attempt to stop the process because room is being made for new opportunities that will soon enter your life."
capricorn,2012-08-29,"You have the endurance to hold your own position, even in these stormy seas of change. You can feel the instability all around you. But there isn't anything coming at you that is necessarily harmful. Be ready to dance with the unknown, for if you try to ignore the music, it will play louder and louder until you cannot shut it out. Ultimately, your willingness to experience what's happening in the present moment will enable you to move gracefully into the future."
aquarius,2012-08-29,"You may feel waves of emotions wash over you in a very unpredictable way today. Your feelings are often quirky anyway, but now you're getting strange emotional reactions that are unlike your regular feelings that come and go. All emotions rise and fall like the tides, but this could seem more like a tsunami. Nevertheless, it's wise to go with the flow for a few days until the energy settles back down."
pisces,2012-08-29,"It's a smart idea to pull back from the maddening crowd today; however, it's difficult to escape because you may be in over your head with unfulfilled promises. But if you can't go on a retreat now, at least cultivate a spiritually conducive atmosphere wherever you are. Religious or spiritual ritual can enhance your day, so make time for quiet meditation or get outside in a natural setting that is good for your soul."
aries,2012-08-30,"You might not be able to express your feelings easily today, yet you're very clear about your position. You have a responsibility to a group of people, family or work associates, and you believe that you should withhold your personal perspective for the good of everyone involved. This discretion is a smart move and others will appreciate your self-restraint. Just be sure to stay in touch with your emotions even if you keep them to yourself now."
taurus,2012-08-30,"You're normally capable of staying calm in a tough situation, but this detachment could lead to an emotional storm later if intense feelings finally overflow their banks. This could be one of those times when inconsequential matters provoke strong responses that are out of proportion with the current events. Look within to find the true source of your angst before making an unnecessary scene."
gemini,2012-08-30,"Your senses are extra sharp today, giving you the ability to apply logic to a complex set of circumstances. You're able to see beneath the surface and understand why things are the way they are as long as you don't jump to a conclusion without considering the facts. Ineffective arguments cannot stand up to your mental acuity now, so strip away the fluff and go for the core issues. The right words hold the power to make real changes."
cancer,2012-08-30,"A sharp word can be piercing today, quickly stimulating an old emotional wound. Thankfully, this criticism could be a healing experience if the source is someone you trust. Acknowledging the pain frees you from its grip, providing that you are really ready to let go. It's natural to hold on to the past, but sometimes the price is too high. You have much to gain if you can listen with a flexible mind and an open heart."
leo,2012-08-30,"Your power of persuasion is quite strong today. Fortunately, you can convince anyone of almost anything if you have your story in order, along with all the facts. It's the combination of precision and passion that puts you over the top. Rehearse your presentation if you must, but get it right the very first time because you may not get a second chance."
virgo,2012-08-30,"There is a delicate balance between clearly stating your position and coming across as being overly critical. Pick the right situations to express yourself so you can avoid the need to correct any social errors. However, even if you believe you're being helpful today, others may feel attacked. A little diplomacy and tact goes a long way to soothe fragile nerves."
libra,2012-08-30,"You're in a rather playful mood today, ready to toss out an occasional flippant remark. But be careful with the teasing because others may not get your jokes. You're exceptionally creative now, so you might want to go back to a project you recently set aside and make a few more adjustments. You have a good sense of what to keep and what to purge, enabling you to turn a rough idea into a polished product."
scorpio,2012-08-30,"The key to your current success now is in understanding your priorities. Luckily, you should have a keen sense of which projects need your attention at this time, so cut through the clutter and get to the essentials as quickly as possible. However, communicating your message to others requires clarity and patience. Don't expect anyone to work effectively without precise instructions. Take your time and say exactly what you mean to get the job done right."
sagittarius,2012-08-30,"Your imagination is often so filled with big ideas that it's difficult to know which ones are most relevant. You may feel pressured to make a choice today and, fortunately, the sense of urgency works in your favor by forcing you to get off the fence. Nevertheless, it's still hard to pick one path over all the other possibilities. Instead of getting lost in endless analysis now, trust your intuition."
capricorn,2012-08-30,"Being cynical can be a curse because you tend to take a negative view that rules out a great number of possibilities. However, healthy skepticism brings you the ability to see the differences between empty promises and real prospects. An idea that you recently rejected may seem useful today, even if it makes you feel uncomfortable. Push past your personal preferences to find the deeper truth."
aquarius,2012-08-30,"The Moon in your sign increases your mental fortitude. You can use intellectual force combined with your power of intent to get what you want. However, you might become so passionate in your beliefs now that you ignore others, refusing to listen to what's being said. Don't fall prey to thinking that you know more about the truth than anyone else does. Use your imagination today along with your intelligence."
pisces,2012-08-30,"Usually, you feel honored when people trust you enough to tell you their secrets. However, your knowledge of sensitive information can become problematic today. It's difficult to know how much to keep to yourself and what can be shared now on a need-to-know basis. Telling secrets has tremendous power to help or to hinder. Nurture those you love by considering their needs before saying something you might later regret."
aries,2012-08-31,"A stressful situation at work may activate old memories of past hurts, even if the current circumstances aren't exactly the same. But your subconscious mind isn't focused on the differences, creating a cascade of fantasies that bring up uncertainty or even fear. Thankfully, the Pisces Full Moon lights up your 12th House of Spirituality, helping to dissipate negativity and allowing you to be more fully present in what's happening right now."
taurus,2012-08-31,"You may feel as if you need more attention from others today as the Pisces Full Moon illuminates your 11th House of Friends and Associates. However, you would be wise to depend less on everyone else and just do something extra nice for yourself now. Your feelings are on a rollercoaster ride and anything that you can do to help settle them down is a good idea. Being creative in your pursuit of pleasure is the key to your satisfaction."
gemini,2012-08-31,"A confusing situation that develops on the job may have you ready to hide out at home as the Pisces Full Moon shines in your 10th House of Career. But you cannot just skip out on your work today, even if you're feeling stressed. Instead of wishing you could retreat, change your attitude. Don't try to second-guess what others want. Do what makes the most sense rather than trying to live up to other people's expectations."
cancer,2012-08-31,"You're particularly sensitive to the imaginative Pisces Full Moon in your 9th House of Big Ideas because it stirs up visions of journeys to far-off places and distant times. Whether you're experiencing sweet nostalgia for the past or a deep yearning for the future, today's dreams are not about the present moment. However, these fantasies can shed light on your current feelings if you take time to explore the symbolism arising from your subconscious."
leo,2012-08-31,"You may feel the emotional stress associated with today's watery Pisces Full Moon flooding your 8th House of Transformation. Unfortunately, you might not be ready to evolve in ways that are now being required of you. Intuitively, you know that the old road is changing as new paths appear. This could be a difficult transition, but keep in mind that your future happiness depends on your ability to let go of the past."
virgo,2012-08-31,"With the Sun in your sign, today's Pisces Full Moon occupies your 7th House of Partnerships, making it difficult to understand what's happening in a relationship. Everything might not go exactly as planned. Your mind is illuminated with sparks of awareness that electrify your feelings. Once awakened by the truth, it isn't easy to go back to sleep. If you need to make changes in a relationship, at least remember to be kind in the process."
libra,2012-08-31,"A co-worker might be working to undermine your efforts today with the Pisces Full Moon influencing your 6th House of Employment, yet it's difficult to uncover the details of who or why. Something unexpected may occur on the job that suddenly brings a new awareness to the current situation, but everything doesn't necessarily come to the surface. Focus on what is already on your plate. Don't waste your precious energy trying to fight an unknown enemy."
scorpio,2012-08-31,"People you know are coming out of the hidden corners of your life, bringing light and energy to you. The imaginative Pisces Full Moon brightens your 5th House of Fun and Games today, offering a sense of spontaneity that is charging up these supportive relationships as they add excitement to your sometimes quite-serious world. Forget about being in control now; let go and have a good time."
sagittarius,2012-08-31,"If you're obsessing about long-term objectives, your career can have a negative impact on your home life today. However, the Pisces Full Moon occupies your 4th House of Domestic Conditions, highlighting family issues that may require you to readjust your priorities. If you are too focused on your work and your role out in the community, this is a fantastic time to make changes to bring your life back into a healthier balance."
capricorn,2012-08-31,"The visionary Pisces Full Moon in your 3rd House of Immediate Environment reminds you to push beyond the social constraints that often make you feel safe. However, comfort is not the answer. You are pushing the edges of the envelope and opening to new and exciting experiences. This isn't because you want to right now, it's because you have to. Let go of old memories so they can no longer prevent you from feeling free and happy."
aquarius,2012-08-31,"You may struggle with a financial decision today as the elusive Pisces Full Moon floods your 2nd House of Resources. You might need to rethink your strategy if you discover that your facts are wrong. But instead of isolating yourself with your worries, lean on someone you trust. Others could come through with the exact information you need now to make the right choice."
pisces,2012-08-31,"It's extremely difficult to hold back the flow of feelings now as the Full Moon shines in your 1st House of Personality. You are probably displaying your emotions, whether you intend to or not. The problem is that your moods can fluctuate faster than greased lightning, so what you say may not reflect your needs just an hour or two later. Thankfully, you don't need to justify yourself every time you change your mind."
aries,2012-09-01,"You must find ways to express what's in your imagination today with the surreal Pisces Moon occupying your 12th House of Fantasy. However, your current desire to escape reality also makes it difficult to follow through with your chores because you would rather be daydreaming than anything else. It can be quite a challenge to channel this slippery energy as material from your subconscious comes to the surface. Thankfully, fulfilling your obligations first frees you up to explore more interesting activities later on."
taurus,2012-09-01,"Your life may appear quite differently to your friends than it does to you. Oddly enough, the more you try to unveil the truth of your feelings today, the more you confuse everyone else. Fortunately, if you can rise above your need to set the record straight, you could be an inspiration to others. It's more important to cooperate with your cohorts now than it is to be right."
gemini,2012-09-01,"A lack of clarity may cloud your thinking, but you should be able to make the most of your day anyhow if you pay attention to the potential pitfalls. You are ultra-sensitive now and irrational feelings are flooding into your thoughts. Even your sensory impressions can be overwhelming and confusing. Forget about balancing your checkbook or planning the rest of your life; write poetry, listen to music, and dream about your future, instead."
cancer,2012-09-01,"You have fantasies about cutting loose and doing something special. If you haven't had a real vacation in a while, maybe it's time to start planning your next getaway. However, you must balance your dreams with a bit of realism if you want them to come true. But don't be too hard on yourself if you cannot figure out all the logistics today. Let your vision grow unencumbered by facts for a while; there will be time later on to fill in the details."
leo,2012-09-01,"Be careful because you may be easily misled today by someone you trust. Keep in mind that no one is out to purposefully trick you, but others can inadvertently confuse you if they don't check all their facts. Furthermore, your logic is blurred by a sudden attraction to fame or fortune. But don't be distracted by the possibility of your name in lights. Forget about ego concerns and concentrate on taking care of business."
virgo,2012-09-01,"Your ruling planet Mercury is stressed by its opposition to nebulous Neptune today. Your analytical thinking may not be as sharp as it normally is. In fact, reality could be just slightly out of your grasp now, with your mind working overtime in the realms of fantasy. This isn't necessarily detrimental as long as you remember the difference between fact and fiction."
libra,2012-09-01,"It's quite a dreamy day with the Moon traveling through psychic Pisces, which should lighten up nearly any situation, especially if you can find a way to work off some of your excess energy. Your fantasies are so convincing now that it's difficult to discern the truth. It's not a great time to trust your own logical thoughts because they are more subjective than you might realize. Your antidote is to do something that allows you to physically engage in fun and return to the real work tomorrow."
scorpio,2012-09-01,"Your romantic landscape can become foggy and fraught with traps of misunderstanding today. Do your best to be clear in all your communications with others, without necessarily being overly aggressive about it. You could even fall in love with something or someone if you let your guard down. It's probably safer to seek pleasure from the creative arts now than from relationships, for nothing is quite as it seems."
sagittarius,2012-09-01,"You are already on your way to doing something exciting and daring today. You carry an air of spontaneity about you now -- even more so than usual. Although your idealism might attract interesting people, it's hard to find someone who shares your perspective. Don't worry if you need to say no to a current offer. Limiting your options helps you to accomplish more in the long run than you thought possible."
capricorn,2012-09-01,"It might be disconcerting if you cannot finish everything you want to do now. You have your sights aimed high, but you may be so unrealistic that you end up missing your mark completely. You could grow frustrated if you think you should be more practical. Just move forward slowly, because patience really is a virtue to strive for today."
aquarius,2012-09-01,"You might have some explaining to do today, but the more you ramble on, the less convincing you sound. Even if you prefer not to say anything at all, you may be enticed into spilling all the beans. Your words don't quite paint the picture that you see now, so keep reminding yourself to craft your message carefully, make your point succinctly, and then stop talking while you're ahead."
pisces,2012-09-01,"You're carrying your feelings close to the surface now, but keeping up appearances just enough so that others aren't aware of your emotional turbulence. Your guarded behavior is actually an effective tactic, but be careful not to send out too many mixed messages today. Postpone your most important decisions until your clarity returns later this week."
aries,2012-09-02,"It's a day of contrary cosmic messages as the Moon in your sign motivates you to take charge. Meanwhile, confusion from the past few days still lingers, holding you back and preventing you from swinging into action. It's challenging to find a way to honor both sets of feelings. Go ahead and drive into new territory, but move slowly to allow time for your emotions to catch up with your intentions."
taurus,2012-09-02,Your fantasies take on new colors now and the symbols are different from what they once were. Nevertheless you are not ready to let go of your familiar thoughts and feelings. Don't be too hard on yourself; you don't need to move any faster than what feels right. It isn't necessary to justify your actions -- or lack of them -- to anyone at this time. Just trust the timing of the universe and accept that you are right on schedule.
gemini,2012-09-02,"You feel restless today, yet you still can play the role of a quiet observer who is carefully taking notes and considering your alternatives. Your inner strategist takes charge now, making you less concerned with the hectic pace of life. Cultivate this inner voice as it works to create the most efficient path possible through the stormy seas that rage around you."
cancer,2012-09-02,"You want to be seen in public now with the extroverted Aries Moon traveling through your 10th House of Status. Although your feelings are strong today, they may still be in dynamic conflict with the logic that you've wrapped around yourself for protection. Thankfully, you understand that the emotional tides are in constant flux. Ride out this wave and you'll feel better soon enough."
leo,2012-09-02,"Even if you are still a bit uncertain about what's most important now, you're probably feeling more optimistic than you did yesterday. The path is clearing and you have become, at least temporarily, aware of your destiny. You can grow frustrated if you believe you need to reach your goals right away. This is going to take time to unfold. Grant yourself the luxury of getting excited, but don't strive for goals that are so unreachable that you set yourself up for disappointment."
virgo,2012-09-02,"You need to do the right thing, whatever the emotional cost. You might have recently retreated for a while to make sure that your feelings were real. Now that you have thoroughly analyzed the situation, you're eager to set your plan into motion today, but this may not be as easy as you think. Go ahead, but remember you are in pursuit of long-term happiness and not immediate gratification."
libra,2012-09-02,"You've been playing out your situation with style and grace, even if you recently had to face a high level of uncertainty. However, you can actually improve the outcome of a tricky situation with a proper attitude today. Thankfully, you just might snatch success from the jaws of defeat if you work in partnership now. Remember that you are building foundations and you'll have plenty of time for fun and games later on."
scorpio,2012-09-02,"There is a dark side to the power of Scorpio that adds to your mystique. But this isn't an evil force; it's merely a portion of reality that hides in the shadows. You're aware that something is lurking unseen nearly all the time, but if you can see it now, you can deal with it. Watch for signs of suppressed possessiveness, resentment or jealousy. Facing difficult issues with fierce determination ensures that you will emerge stronger and brighter in the near future."
sagittarius,2012-09-02,"You are in love with life itself and are ready for a very special surprise. But something is in the way, preventing you from fully expressing your usual happy-go-lucky optimism. Don't look at the current situation as an obstacle that stands between you and your happiness. Instead, be thankful that your search for meaning is slowing you down so that you can learn what you need to know from emotional interactions along the way."
capricorn,2012-09-02,"You tend to restrain from expressing your first reactions, yet you may feel even more conservative today than usual. This is not about national politics; it's your emotional politics you're concerned with now and your personal relationships are strongly impacted by your caution. You would rather settle for a little less excitement, love, or money than gamble on the possibility of losing it all. Remember, nothing ventured; nothing gained. A small risk is better than none at all."
aquarius,2012-09-02,"Your interplanetary radio is playing private requests today, but the cosmos seems to be broadcasting tunes with conflicting messages. You may not be able to decide whether to follow your initial impulse to be with people or your current desire to be alone. Remember, whatever happens now, things will change. Staying flexible enables you to handle the contradictions with grace as you experience them."
pisces,2012-09-02,"You might feel that you're not receiving enough emotional support now from those closest to you. You may get a bit discouraged today, but being down on yourself or others is not an effective use of your time. The best thing you can do is analyze the situation clearly, isolate the source of your negativity and share your feelings about it. Initiate a new pattern in your life; even if it doesn't start off smoothly, stirring things up can bring about positive changes down the road."
aries,2012-09-03,"You may try to avoid fulfilling your obligations on the home front. However, you won't be able to escape from doing your part no matter how much you struggle. You might not be pleased with those who make demands on you, but you don't need to isolate yourself from everyone else. Instead of building walls around your heart, try meeting others halfway. Finding a healthy balance between dependence and freedom is your best route to healthier relationships."
taurus,2012-09-03,"Someone at work may get on your case today about something you consider trivial. You might not intend any harm, but what you say now can inadvertently hurt a person you care about. Try to maintain a high level of compassion and tenderness. If you open your heart a deeper friendship will have a chance to blossom, even if it doesn't happen overnight."
gemini,2012-09-03,"You might be dealing with issues of low self-esteem today, making you doubt your every move. Problems may surface within a relationship if you withdraw to address your concerns. This detachment could make the other person uncomfortable with the emotional distance. Keep the communication channels as clear as possible to avoid any trouble. Try not to take yourself or others too seriously now since the energy will warm up again in a few days."
cancer,2012-09-03,"Loving Venus in your sign squares austere Saturn, stimulating feelings of dissatisfaction. You might not even want to try to bridge the gulf between your emotions and the circumstances of your life. Be courageous and face the current issues, even if it doesn't seem like it's worth the effort. Considering the options, do whatever is required to give it your best shot. You may not feel satisfied with your accomplishments today, yet the rewards will follow if you simply do the work."
leo,2012-09-03,"Today is one of those days when it is difficult to motivate yourself to do much of anything. It's easy to come up with reasons to lay low, yet it is important that you take immediate action. Methodical and careful movement can help you make progress to your goals. But if you leap before you look you will have to go back to the beginning and start all over again."
virgo,2012-09-03,"You have social obligations that you prefer to avoid now as sobering Saturn stresses gracious Venus in your 11th House of Friends and Community. Unfortunately, you still have to deliver on your previous commitments, even if you want to stay home. It's easier to justify attending a function if you consider it to be business related. Just show up without expectations and it will probably end up being more fun than you anticipated."
libra,2012-09-03,"Your key planet Venus squares conservative Saturn today and this dynamic could work in one of two ways. On one hand, you may feel like pulling back from your interactions with others as you attempt to establish clear boundaries for yourself. On the other hand, you can apply your talents in practical ways now. Even if you don't feel as creative as usual, your artistic or technical skills could still be put to good use. Overcome any discouragement or self-doubt you might face and push steadily toward your goals."
scorpio,2012-09-03,"Although you're aware of your feelings, you don't necessarily want to make them available for public consumption. You aren't saying what's on your mind now and others probably realize that you're keeping something private. Nevertheless, they cannot figure out what to do about your silence. Don't be overly concerned about what others think. Put all your energy into choosing what to do next."
sagittarius,2012-09-03,"You could be caught up in a complicated dilemma that pushes you right up against the edges of your own comfort zone. But it's really not so bad now, even if you are more anxious in the emotional realms than you are in the world of actions and ideas. Don't try to control your feelings since that never works as well as you think. Instead, observe what makes you uncomfortable today. Awareness can be the most effective catalyst for change all by itself."
capricorn,2012-09-03,"You may be required to choose responsibility over fun as your key planet Saturn forms a stressful square with pleasurable Venus. Your life seems to be controlled by circumstances now rather than your desires and it grates on your nerves. However, you are learning about a higher truth, so push through whatever is holding you back. Delaying gratification seems like a sacrifice, but could lead to a deeper sense of contentment in the long run."
aquarius,2012-09-03,"Although you may face your normal routine today, it's important to also take time to think about your emotional needs. Even if this self-reflection seems out of character, you stand to make real gains if you can isolate what you require for your own happiness. You might try to apply logic to the situation, but it won't work now. Leave the rational world behind while you explore the realms of your imagination and heart."
pisces,2012-09-03,"You can create a bubble of happiness around you if you accept the present limitations now. Unfortunately, there may not be room enough in the bubble for others, so you might experience a temporary sense of isolation. However, pushing beyond the apparent boundaries allows you to stay connected with those you love no matter what."
aries,2012-09-04,"Life is challenging now because part of you wants to race ahead while your inner voice is telling you to slow down and proceed with caution. You may believe that accomplishing your goals will take more time and effort than you have to give. Nevertheless, push forward today or you could lose your enthusiasm. Stating what you want as soon as possible can help pave the path to your success."
taurus,2012-09-04,"You have fundamental issues that must be addressed now and, thankfully, you're up for the task. But, even if you are eager to talk about what's on your mind, circumstances make it difficult to rock the boat. However, you might be hesitant to soften your stance since you realize the overall significance of the current discussion. Push beyond the resistance; saying something today is better than waiting for a perfect moment to act."
gemini,2012-09-04,"You may run into a roadblock today, but this delay gives you more time to think everything through before opening your mouth. Often, you speak your mind first and then figure out where a conversation will take you as you're talking, but this isn't a smart strategy now. Summarize what's on your mind by creating an outline to help you better organize your thoughts. Doing your homework in advance helps to clarify your message."
cancer,2012-09-04,"You may be overly emotional today, but don't let your moodiness stop you from expressing your truth. Thankfully, you get extra juice out of a deep and meaningful conversation now. But remember that your perspective could be too extreme for someone else, so be gentle if you bring up a difficult topic. Others might not be as inclined as you are to dig up hidden feelings, even if your intentions are good. Pay attention to the feedback you receive before going too far."
leo,2012-09-04,"Something happens that brings up memories of a past emotional experience which might make you want to bury your feelings. Strong passions lurk just beneath the surface and you probably would prefer to keep them there today. Don't try to force anything out into the open. If you believe that exercising caution is a good strategy now, trust your own judgment. You can always put your thoughts down in a journal, since this keeps the process moving along in a healthy manner."
virgo,2012-09-04,"Rational thought comes easily to you and although you are at the top of your mental game now, you may be hesitant to delve into the emotional realms. Still, you could become engulfed in a complicated set of circumstances involving others. Don't allow yourself to get distracted by someone else's drama if it's just a way to avoid a serious matter of your own. Rather than focusing your energy on an external situation, honor your feelings instead."
libra,2012-09-04,"Your moods may still be all over the map today, yet you're likely to feel more secure as time moves on. You must get through these next few days of strategic planning and practical thinking, even if you prefer a more flexible approach to life. If you apply yourself diligently, you will be rewarded for your hard work."
scorpio,2012-09-04,"You are looking at relationship issues through a very practical filter today, but this won't stop you from dreaming about your future. It's just that your imagination is more likely than ever to cross the gap and manifest as reality, so don't waste a perfect opportunity on idle fantasy. Take control of your life by visualizing exactly what you want to happen."
sagittarius,2012-09-04,"Conversations about career objectives may be initiated by others today, and you might as well go along for the ride. There is a lot of ground to cover as you turn your attention toward the practicalities of work. Even if you would rather take it easy now, don't miss this chance to solidify a business deal or stabilize your place in the community. Act with confidence and others will follow your lead."
capricorn,2012-09-04,"You stand to benefit from sharing your thoughts with others today since there are still significant issues that remain unresolved. Fortunately, your ability to organize your ideas is even greater than usual. Nevertheless, it's also wise to trust your feelings and listen to your heart; just ask your friends to tell you if you wander too far off track."
aquarius,2012-09-04,"You need everyone to take you more seriously now, for you are in a productive phase and want to be recognized for your contributions on the job and at home. Show up and work at the best pace you can, even if it's behind the scenes. Don't worry if others appear to be unaware of your efforts just yet, since it may take additional time to be noticed."
pisces,2012-09-04,"You wish you could kick back and enjoy yourself today, but practical concerns weigh heavily on your mind. Don't resist your responsibilities; put off the fun and games until you are finished with your work. Someone may demand even more of you than you think you have to give. Nevertheless, do your absolute best and then reward yourself with a bit of well-earned rest and relaxation once you're done."
aries,2012-09-05,"Do your job well today and everything else should fall into place. Whatever issues you face represent opportunities to pay attention to your common sense. Forget about the lofty ideas of philosophy and metaphysics for now. Instead, work around your home, in the garden or at your desk, but don't waste your time on anything that's not useful. Being able to see tangible results brings you more satisfaction than you expect."
taurus,2012-09-05,"You know what would satisfy you now and what you need to do in order to find happiness. Thankfully, you're able to establish concrete goals and work steadily to achieve them. However, you may have to overcome someone's objections to your plan before you can proceed. Be clear when stating your position and don't waste too much time in a disagreement. Ultimately, walking your talk is the best way to demonstrate your convictions."
gemini,2012-09-05,You may spend the day lost in daydreams that are tied to your childhood memories. Your family history -- both good and bad -- is flooding into your consciousness now. Your imagination is communicating a message to you and it's important that you keep your rational perspective out of the way. Let the images wash over you without seeking any logical explanation today. The puzzle pieces will fit together when the time is right.
cancer,2012-09-05,"Healing arrives in an unexpected manner today. Even if you have inadvertently hurt someone recently, your own insecurities about your feelings might stir up the most pain. Talking about your emotional process is the most beneficial thing you can do now. Take care of your needs first so you're able to continue to nurture others. Your willingness to be vulnerable opens the way to mutual understanding."
leo,2012-09-05,"Get out and express yourself today, but try to avoid creating any unnecessary drama in the process. Although you may be at odds with your own feelings, observing your shifting moods as they change throughout the day can bring much needed perspective on a practical matter. You don't have all the answers yet. Remember, being conscious is more important now than being right."
virgo,2012-09-05,"You may want to reconsider recent decisions now because they are back on the table for discussion. There is no time like the present to sort through all the possibilities. Your practical skills are growing by leaps and bounds, but you must put them to use as soon as possible. You can't reap the benefits if you don't take initiative today."
libra,2012-09-05,"Although you normally try to make everyone feel comfortable, you might assume that others are doing better than they actually are today. Unfortunately, someone may take your apparent lack of interest personally, believing that you are ignoring them when they need you most. Thankfully, you can minimize any possible hurt feelings by keeping the communication channels open. Making sure that others know you care is what matters most."
scorpio,2012-09-05,"You've been somewhat erratic lately, but now it looks like your emotions are beginning to settle down. You are establishing steady rhythms in your life so that your relationships at home and at work can stabilize. However, remember that you can't do it all by yourself. You need to collaborate with others -- friends and family -- as part of your personal transformation. Giving and receiving support creates a healthy network you can count on."
sagittarius,2012-09-05,"You made a commitment recently and now you can't stop thinking about all there is to do. This is a career-focused phase, and even if you've had a few days of reprieve, it is time to plan your next moves. It could feel like a game today, but there are serious changes coming down the road and you need to be ready for them. Prepare for the future by attending to details in advance."
capricorn,2012-09-05,"You are receiving positive encouragement from all the planets in Earth signs now, including the Sun in analytical Virgo and the Moon in sensual Taurus. Creativity is natural at this time because brilliant ideas come easily. But it's not just about your intelligence; it's also about exploring how to work with your current resources. Find a way to get the job done, no matter what. The satisfaction you feel at the end of the day makes the extra effort worth the trouble."
aquarius,2012-09-05,"An extra layer of stress pushes you to make choices today, yet you cannot resolve the differences between your head and your heart. It feels as if you must neglect a part of yourself either way, but this is just a temporary illusion. Go ahead and make your decision the best you can by following your instincts. And, most likely, as the planets continue to move and the pressure lifts, you will discover that you did the right thing."
pisces,2012-09-05,"Your feet are back on the ground today, enabling you to make a concrete plan and then put it into motion. Although you could run into a bit of opposition early in the day, you're able to convince others that your way makes the most sense. But there's no need to waste words in endless arguments. Ultimately, your actions will state your case better than anything you can say."
aries,2012-09-06,"You are on an emotional journey now, even if you don't think you have enough time to explore your feelings. Nevertheless, you are ready to turn a corner today when happy-go-lucky Venus dances into your 5th House of Love. Don't hold yourself back; explore the pleasures that you seek even if only in your dreams."
taurus,2012-09-06,"It's unsettling when you're not in control of your feelings, yet satisfaction grows even more elusive if you start to worry. Your ruling planet Venus enters your 4th House of Security today, encouraging a more practical approach in love. You may be tempted now to shake up everything for the sake of change. But be careful of overreacting or your inflexibility can create unnecessary problems. Be open to meeting others halfway or you might miss out on the love that's already in your life."
gemini,2012-09-06,"Your love life receives a boost when popular Venus moves into your busy 3rd House of Communications today. It's easy to talk about how much you like your friends, rather than exposing your vulnerability with a more intimate emotional involvement. There's no need to fret over how to best express your feelings. Simply let go and have fun while flirting with the edge; don't worry about going over it for now."
cancer,2012-09-06,"You could gain a new perspective about love by looking back over the past several weeks to re-evaluate what the planet of romance and beauty has brought into your life. It's time to build on what you already have now as Venus moves out of your sign and enters your 2nd House of Resources. Although this is most often a time to stabilize relationships, you may still be tempted to start up a new one. Breaking out of your routine might feel good today, but don't forget to leave a trail of breadcrumbs so you can find your way back."
leo,2012-09-06,"There's no reason to hold back your feelings today. However, it's crucial to make sure that your current agenda is the best one because it's all too easy to get carried away with your desires now. Pay attention to how you present yourself, for you could be more flirtatious with friendly Venus influencing your 1st House of Self. But the choice is ultimately yours; don't shut down a potential admirer before you know how you really feel."
virgo,2012-09-06,"You could miss a chance to express your desires if you're afraid of negative consequences. Luckily, all is not lost since there will be new opportunities ahead. Nevertheless, you increase the likelihood of success if you can transform your attachment to personal love into something more spiritual, as sensual Venus moves through your soulful 12th House for the next few weeks."
libra,2012-09-06,"You might mistakenly believe that you have something to hide today, but expressing your desires is easier and more enjoyable than you expect. Your key planet Venus is opening your heart in new ways as expansive Jupiter boosts your confidence to new levels. It's tempting to take a feeling too far, but acting in a responsible manner averts a potential mess later on."
scorpio,2012-09-06,"You could put on quite a show now that Venus is drawing attention to your 10th House of Public Status. However, you aren't certain about how much effort you should give to a current project. Still, you have to juggle conflicts between your personal desires and professional obligations. You may receive recognition from others who only know you through your work. Don't compartmentalize the different areas of your life now; just accept the feedback wherever it appears with the appropriate amount of gratitude and humility."
sagittarius,2012-09-06,"If you have been working too hard lately, you may try to coast through the day. But your unchecked desires can take you on a detour as it gets tougher to maintain the balance between fantasy and reality. Your heart and your head might pull you in different directions, but don't be afraid to share your personal struggle anyhow. Ultimately, your vulnerability makes you more loveable. There's no need to give up on the idea of fun just because you don't know what to do next."
capricorn,2012-09-06,"You may think that your life will fall apart unless you act maturely. But there is a time and a place for letting go of responsibilities, too. Don't be so rational today; instead, explore your true desires. You have already done your fair share and now it's time to adopt a more playful attitude and release your inner child. There's no need to judge yourself negatively just because you want to have a good time."
aquarius,2012-09-06,"You could fall in love, whether or not you're looking for romance today. Flirty Venus dances into your 7th House of Relationships and harmonizes with jolly Jupiter. You can feel the buzz from giant Jupiter, overwhelming your need for stability. Go ahead and explore all the possibilities. Listening to your heart empowers you to make the best choices for your future. Nevertheless, there's no need to complicate a lovely day with too many promises."
pisces,2012-09-06,"There's no magical escape route today, so you might as well buckle in and get busy. Thankfully, pleasant Venus makes work easier after she moves into your 6th House of Employment. Nevertheless, you might scheme and dream about breaking free to avoid your obligations. Ironically, you could actually enjoy helping someone else now even more than fulfilling your own needs."
aries,2012-09-07,"It may feel as if you're less in control today than you prefer. You might overcompensate by taking bold action, but on the inside you aren't nearly as confident as you appear on the outside. Becoming more aware of your feelings enables you to react with less fear. Although you can think on your feet better than most, it's smarter to take extra time for contemplation now rather than responding impulsively."
taurus,2012-09-07,"The Sun in your 5th House of Play is pulled slightly off center by gigantic Jupiter today, making it difficult to express yourself objectively. You want to share everything you feel now, but this level of disclosure might be a bit too much. Although you may claim that you're protecting someone else from getting hurt, you're also making things easier for yourself. If you're going to be stubborn about anything, be determined to grow from your current experiences."
gemini,2012-09-07,"Although you might not be a flag-waver, you still may become so attracted to a political ideology now that it plays on your need for emotional security. If your intentions are pure, almost nothing will stop you, especially if you are willing to bring your own shortcomings out into the open. However, having correct information is crucial, so take the time to familiarize yourself with all the issues before joining the cause."
cancer,2012-09-07,"Your self-confidence is running strong, making you believe that you can overcome nearly any obstacle today. Every invitation sounds like an opportunity you cannot turn down. However, you might say yes to so many activities today that you don't have time to keep up with any of them. Good intentions only count for part of the battle; setting priorities is just as important now."
leo,2012-09-07,"Your social life gets a boost today, yet the attention you receive endures if you stay true to your own values. This isn't about resting on past achievements. There may be powerful forces at work that you don't completely understand. It's better not to confront them head-on just yet. Have faith that you'll know when it's time to act."
virgo,2012-09-07,"You're often able to logically decide what's best, but this doesn't mean that you're immune to bad decisions. You may make a choice today for all the wrong reasons. Don't put your career aspirations ahead of what you know to be good for you personally. Try to keep it all in perspective now, otherwise you could take on more than you can handle. If you do, you'll just have to go back and start all over again."
libra,2012-09-07,"Today's Sun-Jupiter combination lures you toward over-indulging, even if you are doing your best to avoid extremes. Your desire to do what's right makes your life more complicated than you wish, but you really don't have much of a choice. You need to do what resonates with your imagination now that your key planet Venus aligns with fantasy-prone Neptune. Be brave and move confidently in the direction that you want to go in your life."
scorpio,2012-09-07,"It's difficult to find balance when you're being tempted by so many interesting possibilities. But even if your desire to create harmony in your life is strong now, you still don't want to miss the social opportunities that are showing up. A strong connection with friends is highly favored today. Don't get discouraged if the peace you seek seems elusive. It will come in time."
sagittarius,2012-09-07,"Your key planet Jupiter is so stressed today that you could do something foolish. However, you can also express Jupiter's power in a productive manner by being motivated to make something positive happen. Your ability to think big is both your strength and weakness now because you may be tempted to put your efforts toward a project that is better left undone. Thankfully, applying a little bit of common sense works wonders for you at this time."
capricorn,2012-09-07,"You are concerned about getting everything completed that you accepted responsibility for doing. But distractions can change the landscape of your day as opportunities appear that look too good to be ignored. Normally, you might be able to keep yourself on track. However, you don't have a balanced perspective today, making it difficult to determine what is most important. Keep in mind that bigger isn't necessarily better."
aquarius,2012-09-07,"It might be difficult to harness the power that you have now. Unfortunately, you may have to venture into less comfortable emotional realms to make the most of today's potential. Although navigating through your feelings isn't as straightforward as untangling your thoughts, this is where your creativity is born. Letting go of control allows your heart to express more naturally -- and this is a step in the right direction."
pisces,2012-09-07,"People may enter your life now to bring you a variety of options, but you could have an unrealistic understanding of the current situation. Try as you might, you won't likely be able to see what's truly happening. Don't stress unnecessarily; the right opportunity will give you the time to think it through. You're not going to solve the problem today. Be as mellow as you can and see where things take you before making a final decision."
aries,2012-09-08,"If you have already gone too far, it might be time to pull back. Unfortunately, any form of retreat won't be likely today as your plans become even larger in scale. Keep in mind that details count as much as the big picture. If you choose to avoid what's important now, you may have to pay for your poor judgment sooner than you think."
taurus,2012-09-08,"You might not get as excited as everyone around you, but you can sustain your enthusiasm for extended periods of time. It takes you a while to warm up your energy, and now it could take even longer to settle it back down. However, the optimism that rises to the surface must be grounded in reality. Make the most of your positive attitude today by inviting participation from others."
gemini,2012-09-08,"Your key planet Mercury is activated by buoyant Jupiter in your sign today, encouraging you to believe that your thoughts are much more significant than they actually are. It's not that what you say is irrelevant; it's just that you're more effective if you integrate everything you know into your plans. Don't set aside data just because it doesn't justify your ideas. The danger isn't about what you are thinking. Instead, it stems from what you are avoiding."
cancer,2012-09-08,"You may have an opportunity for a spiritual opening today. On the other hand, you might just enjoy a special camaraderie with your friends. Good fortune is possible in either case, yet there is a warning that comes along with the day. Even if you know that you are right, the negotiation process is more important than getting what you want. It's better to create an outcome where everyone makes progress than it is to be the exclusive winner. No one needs to finish in second place."
leo,2012-09-08,"Opportunistic Jupiter dynamically squares Mercury in your 2nd House of Values today, encouraging you to communicate your point of view in a big way. You may believe that your perspective is worth more than anyone else's, but arrogance can quickly turn others against you. Don't pretend that you're listening while shutting someone out. Instead, pay close attention to what everyone is saying, for adapting to new information now could make the difference between failure and success."
virgo,2012-09-08,"Your key planet, communicator Mercury, often assists you in separating useful data from irrelevant information. However, stress from overpowering Jupiter now can negatively influence your normal orientation toward details. If you're distracted today, your thinking might grow sloppy, especially when you concentrate on the generalities rather than the particulars. Keep your feet on the ground and use your common sense."
libra,2012-09-08,"You might surprise yourself as you make decisions based upon what feels like crystal-clear vision. In fact, you're anything but wishy-washy now. You really can take in the whole picture better than usual, but it's crucial to overcome the biggest potential pitfall of the day. Be certain that you have all the facts at hand and not only those that support your decision."
scorpio,2012-09-08,"Your ability to reach your goals is directly affected by the power of positive thinking, so pay careful attention to where your thoughts take you now. It's not that you manifest everything you visualize, but it just might feel that way. Remember, this false sense of confidence is a trap. Your plans could quickly fall apart if you overextend yourself. On the other hand, if you don't reach a little farther than usual, no progress can be made. An extra push will be rewarded as long as you don't go too far."
sagittarius,2012-09-08,"Your key planet Jupiter goads you onward as other people distract you from your chores. Jupiter's square to talkative Mercury prompts you to talk your way through some pretty slippery territory. But Mercury can be like a coyote when he's in his trickster mode of expression; be careful, for things are not as they appear. Don't overinflate the balloon or it will surely pop."
capricorn,2012-09-08,"You have an opportunity to overcome even the toughest of challenges now by being completely objective about your problems. If your foundation is based upon solid thinking, you will be able to build an empire. But if you don't pay attention to all the details, then your world might just fall apart at the seams. Integrity of data is crucial. Speak the truth and you should be able to convince others to join you in your quest."
aquarius,2012-09-08,"Someone you like might present an idea to you today that seems too good to be true. Before you become involved, make sure to discuss all aspects of the plan. If you don't explore every possibility, you could discover that you overlooked something obvious in your haste to be a part of something big. Don't be a fool and rush in without proper analysis. Waiting may be the smartest thing you can do now."
pisces,2012-09-08,"It seems as if the sky is clearing today, revealing fair weather ahead. Unfortunately, the sailing may not remain as smooth as you wish. Nevertheless, you can make everything perfect within your imagination, even if your fantasy has little to do with what's real. However, it might be best to stick to your daily routines as much as possible. If you don't slip off the edge of reality you will be able to capitalize on the good fortune coming your way."
aries,2012-09-09,"You might be impressed by your own cleverness today, but others may not be so amused with your quick repartee. Although you can often express your thoughts in the moment, you may choose to keep more to yourself as the day wears on. Nevertheless, you don't need to withdraw completely in order to create the space you need. All you have to do is be discerning when making decisions about your schedule throughout the day."
taurus,2012-09-09,"You really want to be around people now, but, paradoxically, you may not want to let them into your heart. Your emotions can grow so strong today that you feel the need to protect yourself against being too vulnerable. Hiding behind a lot of clever words or confusing actions can keep others guessing about your real intentions. Conserve your energy; there's no need to engage in any diversionary activities. Initiating an honest dialogue is more useful than playing games."
gemini,2012-09-09,"The Moon's current visit to your 2nd House of Values encourages you to do whatever makes you feel good about yourself. It's time now to build upon what you have recently started. Increasing your self-esteem should be a top priority; if you are not in alignment with your inner self, you won't be able to be as productive as you wish."
cancer,2012-09-09,"Withdrawing from the outer world might be your perfect fantasy this morning with the Moon still hanging out in your 12th House of Privacy. However, you don't really want to be alone. The Moon's midday shift into your sign increases your desire to share your feelings with someone you trust. Nevertheless, conversations may not go as expected. You could end up going in a completely different direction than you originally planned. Keep your eyes open for the surprises ahead."
leo,2012-09-09,"If you are hurt by someone's inconsiderate actions, you may sink into sulking about it today instead of getting it off your chest. But holding in your emotions can also be the beginning of an important process. You could learn a lot about yourself as you compare what you have to what you want. Nothing is gained by being hard on yourself for not speaking your truth now. Have faith that you will say what's on your mind when the time is right."
virgo,2012-09-09,"You receive quite a bit of assistance from your friends today, but you must be open to learning something you didn't already know. Help may arrive in an unusual manner and could catch you off guard. You won't get as far now if you only rely on your analytical abilities. Let your imagination roam and then respond accordingly once you have had a chance to develop a more concrete plan."
libra,2012-09-09,"You are in a very serious frame of mind today as you try to bring every new idea to fruition in a practical way. Unfortunately, staying grounded becomes more difficult as the day progresses. Even if you start out knowing exactly what you want, so many alternatives appear that you might not be able to choose which path to follow. Instead of announcing your final decision too soon, remember that being cautious in communication works in your favor now."
scorpio,2012-09-09,"You may spend much of the day lost in your dreams as you conjure up a perfect vacation retreat. But you might struggle to concentrate on the mundane tasks before you. The more you try to focus, the more your mind wanders. Allow yourself the luxury of doing both. There are no limits to your imagination now. Whatever you dream can manifest if you remember to live up to your responsibilities in the real world, too."
sagittarius,2012-09-09,"You may be a bit uncomfortable today as your feelings are drawn into a deep and magical place. You prefer doing your work in the real world, but the current attractions are in the emotional and metaphysical realms. Don't fight against taking this contemplative path, for it can enrich your life if you just let go and follow the changing currents."
capricorn,2012-09-09,"The sensitive Cancer Moon is now visiting your 7th House of Partnerships, inviting you to take a highly emotional journey. However, you might find yourself dealing with others who are uncharacteristically worried about you. You could fall into a trap of believing that feelings are obstacles to finishing whatever work needs to be accomplished. This is faulty reasoning; push through your resistance and accept what others share with you at face value."
aquarius,2012-09-09,"You do not feel any sort of restraint at home today, even if you have to start the day by facing unfinished chores. Thankfully, once you have met your obligations, you're free to explore a more artistic side of your character. The weirdest thoughts and desires become the fuel for your creative process. But don't intellectualize what's happening; just jump in and experience it."
pisces,2012-09-09,"Trusting your instincts can add more stability to your life and deepen your connection with the future. You are following your hunches by intuitively feeling your way down the road, without relying on too many facts and figures. Even if you want to keep your inspirational visions to yourself today, at least make sure to record them for future reference."
aries,2012-09-10,"You're eager to share your thoughts about working in a more productive environment, even if you aren't usually very methodical. Unfortunately, your unconventional approach may create conflict between you and your co-workers. Engaging in an honest dialogue today might ultimately lead you to see that your assumptions might not be correct. Thankfully, a lesson learned now empowers you to work more closely with others without sacrificing your independence."
taurus,2012-09-10,"It's difficult to be yourself while also living up to someone else's expectations. However, your interpretation of what's happening might be slightly off now. It isn't anyone else's judgment that's causing you to worry; it's your own beliefs that are problematic today. Instead of assuming that you know what others want, ask them. Be specific with your questions before jumping to any erroneous conclusions."
gemini,2012-09-10,"You are trying your best to focus your attention today, but may feel scattered anyway. It's difficult to get much done because you want to do everything just right. Acknowledging your lack of concentration is helpful now even if you don't want to admit that it's hard to settle down. Talking about your frustrations enables you to figure out what you must do next. Don't delay since the window of opportunity won't remain open for long. Find a sympathetic friend and start sharing your story."
cancer,2012-09-10,"You may be pulled in a variety of directions today, and it's OK if you can't decide which feelings to act on. Fortunately, your need to choose a path becomes less pressing as the day unfolds because circumstances make your choice pretty obvious. But don't turn your life upside down yet; waiting for a better time to assert your will increases your chances for success."
leo,2012-09-10,"You might think that communications are clear now, only to discover that someone heard something quite different from what you said. Instead of trying to go back to untangle the misunderstanding, focus on the present moment and go forward. Although you still may run into a detour that temporarily derails your progress today, something valuable can be gained in the process."
virgo,2012-09-10,"Don't just assume that everyone knows what you want now, even if it seems totally obvious to you. Keep in mind that others cannot really read your mind and they will jump to an erroneous conclusion if you don't say anything at all. It's up to you; taking the time to share your thoughts today should help diffuse a conflict before it ever gets off the ground."
libra,2012-09-10,"You may become the center of attention today in spite of criticism from friends or associates who are concerned about your participation with the group. Of course you have the right to withdraw if you desire, but ignoring your workmates might be even more difficult. Either way, you have some explaining to do, and clearly stating your intentions can greatly simplify the situation. A little light goes a long way to alleviate the dark."
scorpio,2012-09-10,"Get right to the point today because others are listening carefully to what you say and will take your message to heart. But don't be overly dramatic because this could alienate those who already support you. In fact, if you let your feelings run amok, your message could get lost or turned around so that you are misunderstood. Success is likely when you contain your emotions while still communicating with conviction."
sagittarius,2012-09-10,"Your unconventional thoughts about beauty could take others for an adventurous ride today, but just because your ideas are far out doesn't automatically make them better. Instead of going on and on, spinning tales of far-off lands, try to keep your thinking process closer to home. Talking about your feelings and your needs will encourage intimacy between you and your loved ones instead of increasing the distance."
capricorn,2012-09-10,"Although you may think that what you have to say is important, don't turn it into a major drama today. Some things are best talked about with a quiet respect. When it comes to the hidden mysteries of your soul and the inclinations of your heart, your words will have more impact now if you speak softly and keep an open mind at the response."
aquarius,2012-09-10,"You may be overwhelmed by something that you hear now, and you need some time by yourself to process your feelings. Unfortunately, you might not be able to escape the current situation. Don't waste your energy resisting, for an intense conversation you have today could teach you something significant about your core values. There will be time later to sort everything out."
pisces,2012-09-10,"You may get so caught up in the minute details of your plan that you can't convey it to anyone else. This communication breakdown can be quite exasperating, especially if you have something important to say. Part of your problem stems from talking too much when you are excited. Being prepared helps; write down your main thoughts and use this as an outline to help you stay on track."
aries,2012-09-11,"You have stepped into a parallel universe and memories of your dreams could be quite intense at this time. However, there's no need to think that your fantasies will come true just because your recollections are so vivid. It's always wise to give thought to anything that flows from your imagination. Working extra hard to actualize your potential is still your smartest move no matter how captivating your imagination may be now."
taurus,2012-09-11,"Your key planet Venus receives an otherworldly kiss from ethereal Neptune today, lifting your desires from the physical world into the spiritual realm. Acknowledging your dreams is the logical next step to making your wishes come true. Metaphysical teachings remind you to focus your attention on what you want, but then you still must let go of your attachments and simply trust in the power of the universe."
gemini,2012-09-11,"You're ready to share your worries with someone today, but you could inadvertently shift the blame on to the other person, creating a misunderstanding in the process. Unfortunately, you're not feeling very motivated to work on your own issues now and may end up projecting your fears. Instead of being judgmental, consider taking some time off for contemplation before you get down to the serious business of personal disclosure."
cancer,2012-09-11,"You want to be as objective as possible today when telling a trustworthy friend about a problem at home. Your companion will probably be eager to listen to whatever you need to share, but he or she might not be able to offer you the advice you seek. Instead of expecting more from everyone else now, find what you need from within."
leo,2012-09-11,"Your love life may sparkle and shine today as beautiful Venus lures you into rich fantasies. Her connection to surreal Neptune replaces the reality of your relationships with whatever is in your imagination. Although an idealistic dream could bring a smile to your face, your view of the world is colored by your desires now. Be careful about assuming that things are as you see them. Enjoy the reverie while it lasts; just remember that this is food for inspiration and not the absolute truth."
virgo,2012-09-11,"You could experience a sudden meltdown today and then recover just as quickly. Obviously, your daily life isn't unfolding as you expected. Your logic can only take you so far now, so set rational language aside for a while. Thankfully, your emotional involvement won't lead you into dangerous territory. Instead, sharing your feelings soothes your nerves, turning this into a time to connect with others."
libra,2012-09-11,"You are very sensitive now that the Moon is in empathic Cancer, tempting you to play a role as the artist or poet. Pull out your craft supplies or musical instruments and get busy. But this is more than just a reminder to create or perform; it's also about contacting your subconscious through your meditations and dreams. Anything that keeps you in touch with your spirit guides will ultimately bring you closer to your desired destination."
scorpio,2012-09-11,"You have a lot going on within your head today, yet you're not so quick to share your fantasies with others. You can be very clever at avoiding a discussion about anything you want to keep to yourself. But don't worry if some information leaks out because you will be able to handle the consequences in your own special way. Your charm is irresistible now so use it wisely."
sagittarius,2012-09-11,"It's tough to find a place of balance that moves you past feelings of jealousy today. Naturally, you want to talk about what's going on, but once you open your mouth, you could say too much. If someone seems to be pushing your buttons, you might become so reactive that you forget what you initially had to say. Spending some time alone now will give you the chance to gain objectivity on the situation."
capricorn,2012-09-11,"You might not feel very comfortable today if you are confronted with facts that can't be rewoven into a coherent story. You could have so much information at your disposal now that you aren't sure how to best integrate it. Even if you try, you still won't be able to make your point. Just do the best you can while also respecting everyone else's right to do the same."
aquarius,2012-09-11,"Don't spend too much time trying to turn an assumption of yours into a political debate since it's futile to defend your position with opinions rather than facts. Your smartest strategy now is to have all your research in neat and tidy packages so you can find it quickly when needed. Nevertheless, it may be necessary to change your mind once you consider the alternatives."
pisces,2012-09-11,"You may express your heart's desire today in a manner that isn't exactly light and breezy. This is not the kind of day when you can forget about the complicated ramifications of passion, jealousy and control. However, there's no need to worry about how others will respond to your feelings. Just make sure to be honest and kind when talking to those you love."
aries,2012-09-12,"Both ends of the spectrum are energized simultaneously today. You have a yearning for freedom and are drawn toward anything that will fire up your adrenaline. Your nerves are on edge and you don't want to stand still. However, you're also hypersensitive now and can't help but worry about offending those you love. Go ahead and take a walk on the wild side. You can get away with more than you think."
taurus,2012-09-12,"It seems like your actions are caught between doing something your way and doing them by the book. You are perfectly willing to move cautiously now. You may commit to some of the rules, yet you also have the freedom to make your own decisions. Be careful how you use this energy since you could end up being the very authority figure that you want to rebel against."
gemini,2012-09-12,"You are attracted to the edge of your comfort zone today, but the buzz may not be satisfying unless you go over the point of no return. You want to feel the powerful jolt, but you aren't interested in causing any harm. However, you don't really care if your behavior shocks anyone else as long as it feels good to you. Nevertheless, everything you do has consequences, so remember that you're not acting in a vacuum."
cancer,2012-09-12,"You might feel cozy and safe within your protective shell, but the circumstances of your life won't just leave you alone now. You can't escape by hiding behind a rock or crawling deep into your dark cave. Although all the excess energy makes you nervous, the lightning is flashing and the show is too exciting to miss. Live in the present moment; you can always retreat and rest later on."
leo,2012-09-12,"The emotional stress can be pretty intense today. Although the energy will settle down in a few days, it's crucial that you don't burn yourself out in the meantime, since there's a lot of high-strung excitement around you. Oddly, your confidence level is high; you know that you'll enjoy the buzz. Make time to rest so you are good for the long haul and not just a one-time performance."
virgo,2012-09-12,"Today's energy pulls you in two different directions. On one hand you feel very responsible and want to be taken seriously. On the other hand, you are itching to break out of your everyday routine, no matter what others might think. The good news is that you can follow a middle path that honors the best of both worlds -- and this, in turn, should make you feel pretty good about yourself."
libra,2012-09-12,You're on a cosmic roll today as your key planet Venus slides into sweet harmony with outrageous Uranus. The weird and wild won't seem so far out now. You may enjoy sensations that are new and different from your regular experiences. You're willing to play the game in order to get what you most desire. Enjoy the excitement before it dissolves into the past.
scorpio,2012-09-12,"Your feisty behavior can bring some problems to the surface very quickly today. Circumstances may require you to work hard now, yet you want to do things your own way. Unfortunately, you might find that your intentions are being blocked. Be cautious; don't internalize your frustration. The solution is to take pride in your work, even if you believe that you have a better way to do it."
sagittarius,2012-09-12,"Managing your excesses today enables you to fly high and enjoy the fruits of your labor. Others may come to you with ideas that are even crazier than yours. The intrigue builds until you actually are thinking that your plan is quite sane. However, things might not flow exactly as you expect. Thankfully, your strategy can succeed and may even turn out to be fun."
capricorn,2012-09-12,"You need to go easy on others today. You can experience a bit of a metaphysical earthquake as something rattles your brain. If the surprise comes from someone close to you, don't lash out at her or him. Remember, the messenger just brings the news. Don't judge yourself too harshly either. Roll with the punches the best you can. If you let go of your expectations, you might be surprised by how much you enjoy the unexpected turn of events."
aquarius,2012-09-12,"You are on a rocket ship ride today, and anyone coming into contact with you now can tell that this is not just another day for you. You're feeling good about what you do that is different from what everyone else does. But it's not just about what makes you unique. Whatever you do at this time contributes to a bigger plan, and it's gratifying to be a part of something that you are helping to create."
pisces,2012-09-12,"You're ready to try something new and different today as beautiful Venus harmonizes with unconventional Uranus in your 2nd House of Values. However, you might be distracted by the high-frequency hum of your desires. The nets of your dreams can pull in big fish now, so don't waste your idealism on fantasies of personal gain. Focus on expressing your creativity now and long-term stability will follow later."
aries,2012-09-13,"Although you have a variety of chores to finish today, don't forget to make time for guilt-free fun. You are amongst the ones who are most often ready to join in the festivities, given an invitation. The problem now is that you aren't sure how much individuality you must sacrifice to participate in the social activities. The only way to find out is to take a leap of faith and jump in without knowing the outcome."
taurus,2012-09-13,"Even if you have to go to work today, it still feels like a stay-at-home day. Consider yourself lucky if you are among those who work where you live, since you might not want to go anywhere at all. However, if you must head out into the wide world, take a piece of your home along with you in the form of a daydream. Holding on to this visualization all day brings you a sense of comfort that you cannot get from anyone else."
gemini,2012-09-13,"You are buzzing now as you ride the energy of today's lively Leo Moon. However, your early warning system is already picking up on a mosquito-like annoyance of the changes that are just around the corner. You know a major storm is on its way, and there is an undercurrent of excitement to the anticipation. Nevertheless, you're ready for action. Don't make your move too soon; your efficiency will improve if you can wait until tomorrow."
cancer,2012-09-13,A creative approach to finances can improve your situation now. You may suddenly figure out a way around an obstacle that has been preventing you from buying something you had your heart set on. Don't worry if you haven't thought your plan through carefully because you don't need to iron out every detail today. Investing in something of value is a good idea as long as you're not trying to fool yourself into thinking that it's something you really need.
leo,2012-09-13,"Others may be reading your feelings now as if you are wearing them on your sleeve. You aren't necessarily one to tuck away your heart in a deep dark corner, but now that the moody Moon is in your sign, it's as if your emotions are being broadcast on the midday news. Don't withdraw from interacting with others since the give-and-take can help you clarify what you really want."
virgo,2012-09-13,"You aren't saying everything that you're thinking today, but you have your reasons. Someone may assume that you're telling all, but there is a danger in jumping to conclusions. Still, it's smarter now to hold the conflict within yourself than to lay it out into the open where others need to deal with your unresolved feelings. You can always share more once the intensity begins to subside."
libra,2012-09-13,"You may feel as if everything is going to change today, but you cannot yet fill in the details of what's ahead. You're approaching the end of something, but you don't yet know what it is. Tie up as many loose ends as possible because there's just one week left of summer. Lightening your load now enables you to be ready for whatever begins to unfold around the next corner."
scorpio,2012-09-13,"You are facing a dilemma as you try to resolve the conflict between your head and your heart. Logically, you already know what to do and are ready to play your hand accordingly, but emotionally you're feeling uncertain. You know that this isn't the right time to turn everything upside down just because you are unsure of which path to follow. Patience is your friend now; fortunately, you have more time than you think."
sagittarius,2012-09-13,"You must be your own boss today since you may not be able to convince others to follow your lead. On one hand, this is fine because you are at the top of your production game. Unfortunately, you could go off on some half-cocked crazy idea and ultimately get the go-ahead, even if your idea is without merit. Do the responsible thing; stop yourself before you do something that you will soon regret."
capricorn,2012-09-13,"You aren't content to hang out in shallow waters today; you long for the deeper places, where the search for meaning can overshadow reality, itself. These are not simple times; past hurts and pains -- emotional and physical -- might come back to haunt you. But, there is a blessing in the current process of discovery. If you're willing to do the work and face the issues, healing can occur on many levels to change your life for the better."
aquarius,2012-09-13,"Everything you say and do today creates an immediate reaction. And the fallout from following your intuition isn't always what you expect. You must deal with things as they happen, even if it takes time and energy from other activities. Resistance is futile; as annoyed as you might be by the unfolding situation, there may not be much you can do to change its course. Fortunately, everything seems to get easier once you loosen the reins of control."
pisces,2012-09-13,"You may go overboard today trying to make up for someone else's shortcomings. Even if you're committed to the group effort, there's still a part of you that wants to be recognized for your special contribution to the project. Don't be overly concerned if others are receiving all the credit now. The tide will turn and you'll emerge a hero if you continue to do your job well."
aries,2012-09-14,"Even if your performance at work is quite important, don't lose sight of the creativity that still must be expressed for you to feel fulfilled. You have something original to say now, but you need to be careful about being too forceful as you share your ideas. Pay close attention to the specific tasks at hand and save the hard sell for some other time. Channel your enthusiasm into being more productive, instead."
taurus,2012-09-14,"The common sense that you now have at your disposal won't prevent you from enjoying yourself. In fact, you might choose to continue stalking the pleasures that were attracting you yesterday, whether or not you really have the energy. However, be wary because you may find that the time you waste today on a passing fancy could be put to better use creating something that will have lasting value."
gemini,2012-09-14,"You might be at odds with yourself now as your feelings retrace a recent experience over and over again. You're unable to move on to whatever is next until you fully understand what is happening in the present. Even if you are holding on to the past, your resistance may be a last ditch effort to delay the inevitable. Take one good look behind you before letting go of the memories and moving boldly forward."
cancer,2012-09-14,"You're driven by your thoughts today, which are paradoxically based upon your feelings. You have moved through a period of grandiose thinking, but have the sense to be more logical now. Even if you're influenced by your emotions, at least separate out the negative ones while concentrating more on the positive side of life. But remember that turning into a blind optimist isn't the best strategy, either. Balancing your head with your heart is the smartest route to success."
leo,2012-09-14,"You're ready to build on a project you already started, yet you still must be careful about initiating action on something entirely new. Acting impulsively seems like a good idea until it lands you into trouble. You are more easily distracted now, so concentrate on what is most important, rather than what's the most fun. Pleasure will come and go. Taking care of business, however, has enduring results."
virgo,2012-09-14,"You receive an energetic boost from the Moon in your sign as she harmonizes with relentless Pluto today. Even if you are experiencing resistance, you have the stamina to tackle the obstacles in your path. But don't put all your confidence into a plan that's unstable; be prepared to make a new one if necessary. Thankfully, thinking through your actions in advance assures better odds for success."
libra,2012-09-14,"Don't try to prolong a project that's coming to a natural end. Excitement may be just around the corner, but you must trust the process of letting go in order to get the most from today. You might feel eager to charge ahead, but a little prudence goes a long way. Even if the path before you looks wonderful, don't charge forward until you are really certain about where you want to go."
scorpio,2012-09-14,"Your values are changing and there isn't much you can do to stop the process. Today, everything looks better as you finally get a glimpse of the new direction you want to take. Keep in mind that you don't have to make any decisions yet; just dreaming about the possibilities may be enough for now."
sagittarius,2012-09-14,"The emotional intensity is building up again, but you probably believe that you can power your way through the hardest parts. Slow down and use your intellectual prowess to decipher the complexities of your heart. It's not that thoughtful contemplation is more important than feelings; it's just that both work and play could benefit from a bit of logic to help you maintain a healthy perspective."
capricorn,2012-09-14,"If you are working out logistics in your relationships, it's time to finish up with the details. You are preparing for a new phase of expression, but everything might appear simpler than it is in reality. Don't lose sight of what must be done right now. Tie up as many loose ends as possible before moving on. Pay close attention to your feelings because they have the power to inspire you to even greater heights."
aquarius,2012-09-14,"It might seem as if you missed your chance, but by tomorrow you should be ready to try again. Nevertheless, don't let an opportunity pass by today without giving it serious consideration. Even if things don't pan out as expected, the process of thinking about the possibilities could fire you up with a wave of enthusiasm. Perhaps you need something to propel you forward. Don't worry about the outcome now. Just be ready to act with clear intention when the time is right."
pisces,2012-09-14,"If anyone comes to you with an idea that conflicts with your plans, just take it in stride today. It's easy to get into an argument over something that isn't as important as it seems. Remember that you are looking at others very objectively now and your uncharacteristic impatience creates more problems than it solves. Self-reflection and caution can save you from more frustration down the road."
aries,2012-09-15,"The Virgo New Moon in your 6th House of Daily Routine focuses your attention on all the little things that you've recently overlooked. Unfortunately, you don't always clean up as you go and details left untended may come back to haunt you now. It is easier to make your list and start on it today than in a couple of weeks when the stakes will be higher. Trust your instincts and get to work."
taurus,2012-09-15,"You may feel extra creative today as the Virgo New Moon emphasizes your 5th House of Self-Expression, but you cannot be relied on to make things happen on schedule. Paradoxically, your need to be organized can actually slow progress. You have to work harder now to accomplish your goals because it's easy to waste time preparing, rather than actually doing anything. Your best strategy is to be lighthearted, even playful, while still being practical. Take yourself seriously enough so that others do the same."
gemini,2012-09-15,"You need to face up to the deeper emotional issues in your life today since the Virgo New Moon lands in your 4th House of Security. Resolving power struggles in your home and immediate environment requires clear communication and, fortunately, interactive Mercury is ready to play his part now. Talking through your concerns with your partner clears the air and leaves everyone feeling better about what's ahead."
cancer,2012-09-15,"Today's Virgo New Moon occurs in your 3rd House of Communication, highlighting your daily routine and those you interact with on a regular basis. Instead of aiming for deep and passionate conversations, concentrate on working out schedules, arranging meetings, transporting the kids and returning phone calls. Naturally, these activities are always happening in your life, but now require more time and attention. Don't fight it; just keep your calendar synchronized to the events in your real world."
leo,2012-09-15,"Today's Virgo New Moon falls in your 2nd House of Income, initiating a phase where finances take on an increasing level of importance. But this is more than just about paying your bills. Think about your possessions and make decisions about what is of value to you and what is not. Ultimately, your cash on hand is less important now than how you choose to relate to the material world."
virgo,2012-09-15,"This Virgo New Moon is yours, indicating that you are at the beginning of a significant emotional cycle. It's time to look back over the last few months, reassess your needs and then project forward a few months. Imagine how you can get to where you want to be, both in the emotional realm and in the physical world. Take action now, while it matters most."

Now is your chance to shine the light on your own shadows in order to free yourself from the chains of limitations."
scorpio,2012-09-15,"The Virgo New Moon lands in your 11th House of Community, setting into motion deeply rooted conflicts that play out within your social world. Your values may be brought into question and it's up to you to decide what's most important in your life. There's no need to convince others of your worth; this journey is about loving yourself. If you discover that what you cherish is changing, accept this as part of your evolution and move on."
sagittarius,2012-09-15,"Today's Virgo New Moon focuses your attention on your 10th House of Public Status, initiating a cycle that requires you to redefine your niche in the outer world. You are the champion of the big picture and often have difficulty in managing all the finer points. But now your career may depend upon your ability to keep track of the details and to follow through with them. It won't be as difficult as it sounds if you just make a sincere commitment to your long-term goals."
capricorn,2012-09-15,"You are in your element today, happily making ambitious plans as the hardworking Virgo New Moon falls in your 9th House of Future Vision. However, this isn't about attempting to pull off some grandiose scheme. Your dreams might be bigger than life, but your feet are planted firmly on the ground now, giving you the realistic mindset to pull it off. You're able to scale mountains as long as you have a concrete strategy. You may not be a superhero, but it could seem that way to others."
aquarius,2012-09-15,"The Virgo New Moon highlights your 8th House of Deep Sharing, emphasizing the complexity of relationships, but this isn't just about one-on-one partnerships. The interrelationships between people who bring particular resources or capabilities into your network are strongly affected now. Pay attention to what others add to your life so you can maintain a healthy flow of give and take. Offering a little extra appreciation never hurts."
pisces,2012-09-15,"The Virgo New Moon falls in your 7th House of Others, focusing your attention on the closest relationships in your life. It is more difficult at this time to accept those you love, for you really want them to be at their very best. You might even be expecting them to compensate for your own shortcomings. Forgiveness is typically one of your strengths. Today you may need to forgive yourself for being human so that those you love can live up to your expectations."
aries,2012-09-16,"Although you want to shout your plans from a mountaintop today, everyone seems too distracted to hear you. Their lack of interest may be annoying and can even make you angry enough to prompt unnecessary risks as warrior Mars aligns with bombastic Jupiter. However, your hot temper could interfere with an otherwise workable solution. You are better off remaining silent until your feelings settle down. Channeling your enthusiasm into direct action is your best strategy for now."
taurus,2012-09-16,"Confronting an overly intense situation head-on today sounds like a smart idea, but you could make matters worse by coming on too strong. Although it's wise to turn down your volume, it's not helpful to just let the issue slide. However, if you're overbearing in your approach you might complicate things by projecting your anger onto the current situation. Instead, be gentle but firm as you share your concerns. A little diplomacy goes a long way."
gemini,2012-09-16,"You may be feeling insecure about your job today, prompting you to overcompensate and try to take on too much extra work. Displaying your competence is a wise strategy as long as you don't overdo it. However, putting on a show without substance won't solve anything because others will see through your facade. Even if you try to hide your worries, you still have to face the music in your own head. Performing to the best of your abilities is the simplest solution now."
cancer,2012-09-16,"You may have to perform in the spotlight today even if you prefer working behind the scenes. You would like a chance to express your deeper feelings, but in a more private setting. The problem is that you don't want to bury your emotions by putting a positive spin on everything. Thankfully, you don't have to deceive anyone if you are working for a higher cause. Instead of wasting energy trying to hide now, imagine what can happen when you shine your truth for all to see."
leo,2012-09-16,"You're really busy, but it doesn't seem as if you're getting much accomplished today. Your frustration could provoke risky behavior as you attempt to plow through the resistance that seems to be preventing your progress. But impulsive actions won't be rewarded now; it's better to keep your rebellious attitude under wraps and adopt a steadier pace for the next couple of days. Find a healthy physical outlet to work off any extra stress."
virgo,2012-09-16,"You could push yourself too hard today as you attempt to reach a lofty goal. But finishing what you start may be less important than doing your best, even if it feels as if you're running in circles. It's crucial to stay on course; veering off track might be rather confusing because the closer you get to the finish line, the farther away it seems. Relax; you have more time than you think."
libra,2012-09-16,"Relationships seem too intense for you today, especially if you get into a serious disagreement with someone. Your nerves are on edge now and you may quickly grow annoyed by comments that you would normally just let pass by. There's no need to struggle, even if you get hooked by your own drama. Don't exhaust yourself by overextending your energy worrying about things you can't control. Spending time on your own gives you a chance to gather your thoughts and listen to your heart."
scorpio,2012-09-16,"You are ready to begin a new project as optimistic Jupiter aligns with enterprising Mars in your sign. However, you may not be able to convert your intentions into direct action as quickly as you wish. Unfortunately, your chances for success will diminish if you try too hard at this time. You might be better off retreating now in order to make your final preparations. Even if your imagination is racing ahead, taking a more methodical approach is your best bet."
sagittarius,2012-09-16,"You might feel as if you are driving through a minefield as action-hero Mars energizes your key planet Jupiter. You want to slow down but Mars revs up your engine and takes you for a wild ride. You may realize that you're moving too fast and talking too loudly with no solutions in sight. In order to make the journey successfully, you must figure out how to decrease your speed and tone down your rhetoric. Apply the brakes gently and listen to the advice of someone you trust."
capricorn,2012-09-16,"It's a challenge to stick with your regular routines these days as adventurous Jupiter moves through your 6th House of Habits. However, once you are sure that your recent changes are really improvements, be ready to explore new territory. Don't try to spin your wheels too fast because you are already doing better than you realize. Fortunately, your cool competence enables your talents to shine wherever you choose to go next."
aquarius,2012-09-16,"It's a very busy day as action-hero Mars aligns with your key planet Uranus. Career-related pressures are already motivating you to think about next week. But you also crave the sense of adventure that comes from going on a long trip, engaging in a course of study or committing to a spiritual practice. You may reach a point today where you think you're ready to jump over the edge. Instead of visualizing your future, get busy and make it happen."
pisces,2012-09-16,"You have been in a long-term planning mode for a while -- more concerned with next year than with tomorrow. Fortunately, you have the determination to succeed even if there's a long way to go to reach your goals. Nevertheless, a sense of urgency may overtake everything else now, requiring you to deal with an immediate crisis. It's time for you to swim in the pond of the present moment. Trust your intuition to lead you in the right direction."
aries,2012-09-17,"There are times when you know specifically what you want and you go directly for it. However, your actions are muddled by Neptune's fuzziness today. You may think that you're saying what you mean, but when the words come out jumbled your meaning is lost. Instead of approaching conversations with a fixed agenda, opening your mind to a new perspective helps you get through the days ahead."
taurus,2012-09-17,"Family dynamics can be a bit confusing, making it difficult for you to get everyone on the same page. You may feel strongly about what you want today, yet others seem to misunderstand your intent and therefore might stand in your way. Unfortunately, knowing what will satisfy you won't be enough now. Let go of your expectations and soften your stance; you might be pleasantly surprised by what happens when you are not trying to control everything in sight."
gemini,2012-09-17,"Although you might be very certain about what you want, this doesn't mean that you will actually ask for it with any sense of clarity. If you're writing an email, there may not be a lot of resemblance to your original intent by the time you're done with it. Even if you state your case succinctly in person, you still could be misunderstood. Your best bet now is to stick with the simplest and most direct message. Leave the flowery language and excess verbiage for another day."
cancer,2012-09-17,"This isn't the best day to make practical plans because your fantasies might seem as if they are real. You may think that you're being objective, but it's all too easy now to project your desires onto the blank canvas of the future. There's nothing wrong with having big dreams as long as you wake up and put your feet back on the ground before setting off in the real world. Let your imagination wander today; reality will be waiting for you tomorrow."
leo,2012-09-17,"You may have your day mapped out in great detail, only to discover that you underestimated the amount of time it would take to finish your chores or to clean up from a recent project. Once your schedule falls behind today, it's nearly impossible to get it back on track. Instead of frustrating yourself by trying to stick to an arbitrary timetable now, let your day unfold organically. The real limitations you currently face may be more self-imposed than you think."
virgo,2012-09-17,"This isn't the best day to work on your finances because it might be nearly impossible to make all the numbers add up correctly. It may be smarter to set aside the most exacting mental work for another day. Instead, use the magic available to you now to manifest your dreams in a more imaginative manner, like creating a special moment with a lover or a friend. You can always return to your accounting tomorrow when your ability to concentrate is back to normal."
libra,2012-09-17,"You have an overabundance of charm today that could be used to get whatever you want. However, you must be careful because it is easy to mislead someone unintentionally. Pay particular attention to any feelings of attraction or unspoken desires, since emotions can cloud even the clearest of situations. Be objective; engaging in honest discussions gives you more clarity on the complexities of your heart."
scorpio,2012-09-17,"Normally, you're able to manage the details of your day and concentrate on the tasks at hand. However, it's not so easy to remain focused today. Save the sharp thinking and in-depth analysis for tomorrow. Instead, give yourself permission to escape for a bit. Even if it's a workday, find a little time to recharge your imagination by listening to music, reading a book or looking at pictures. You can get down to work once you have had some time to dream."
sagittarius,2012-09-17,"You want to be amongst your friends and supporters today, so set aside your responsibilities for a while and do something fun. However, keep in mind that you still have obligations to honor so pay attention to your limits. Don't overdo food or alcohol now, even if it is in the name of celebration. You'll be happier in the long run if you're able to successfully balance work and play."
capricorn,2012-09-17,"It's crucial to acknowledge that you might not see a situation today as clearly as you think. Reality is being filtered through a blurry lens, but this doesn't mean that your perspective is incorrect. The issues aren't about right versus wrong. Honoring your dreams is what's most important now, whether or not they are practical. Conscious exploration of your fantasies can actually lead you in the direction of fulfillment as long as you remain unattached to the outcome."
aquarius,2012-09-17,"It's your biggest ideas that can bring you the most complications now. It might seem as if your needs aren't worth the trouble, but don't dismiss your desires prior to giving them a fair chance. Since you're already under the spell of your irrational emotions today, go ahead and sketch out your perfect future in your imagination. Oddly enough, you can be quite happy by holding on to your vision until it becomes real."
pisces,2012-09-17,"This can be a confusing day because you may have trouble controlling your desires and they could pull you off course. Don't fret, for you can blaze a new trail wherever you decide to travel. Take time to explore territory that's off the beaten path while allowing the hard edges of reality to mellow. And most importantly, don't try to put a value on your experiences now; just bask in the joy of living life to the fullest."
aries,2012-09-18,"You may be eager to disagree with someone today just to stir up a lively debate, even if you don't really want to create lasting conflict. Nevertheless, you should be careful about inappropriately misdirecting your feelings or you could find yourself in a volatile situation before you know it. Being aware of the intensity of your reactions now can help to minimize unnecessary drama."
taurus,2012-09-18,"Although you might prefer taking a simpler approach, it now feels as if you're heading out into a sea of complexity. Powerful emotions could rise to the surface today if someone confronts you about something you recently did. Defending yourself by justifying your actions could turn out to be a waste of energy, whether or not the accusation is true. An apology is in order if you are guilty, but just let it go if you're not."
gemini,2012-09-18,"Even if you get up on the wrong side of the bed today, life grows brighter as the day wears on. You may need to deal with an obstacle that has been placed in your path by your boss or some other authority figure. However, you don't have to confront the problem head-on yet; you can simply acknowledge it while dancing around its edges. You will be better equipped to handle the situation in a few days once the intensity settles down."
cancer,2012-09-18,"You could find yourself in the midst of a fierce emotional confrontation today that pulls you into deep waters. However, if you try to avoid the issue, you may inadvertently make matters worse. Pay attention to your intuition, for the shadows won't hide the truth from you now. You might even discover a treasure in a difficult situation if you have the courage to stick with the process when it gets messy."
leo,2012-09-18,"Intense interactions with a family member or close friend may open the floodgates of unexpressed emotions today. You might even sense that an unavoidable power struggle is on the way. You could agitate things even more now by revealing a surprise of your own. However, it's wise to think before you speak or you will only complicate matters even more. Take the high road and just walk away from the drama with a smile."
virgo,2012-09-18,Your analytical mind is working overtime today as you furiously seek a simple fix to a complex problem. Part of your frustration stems from not being able to separate one situation from another; everything seems to be interrelated now. It's pointless to keep going over the same details again and again. Things will begin to make sense when you accept that logic won't bring you the solutions you're hoping to find. Fire up your right brain and practice a little creative self-expression.
libra,2012-09-18,"You might wish that the current relationship tensions would just go away now, but they won't vanish until you face the issues that are bothering you. You may have to stand up to someone who is more powerful than you are; fortunately, you can hold your ground today as long as you act consistently with your feelings. Push through your anxiety and self-judgments; just show up and be true to yourself."
scorpio,2012-09-18,"You can sense a subterranean current of feelings running deeper than any you have recently experienced. On one hand, this is quite exciting, since you're attracted to the intensity and believe that you're getting closer to discovering something very significant. On the other hand, you are fearful of losing yourself to this powerful flow. Nevertheless, it's safe to let go once you know where you stand in your heart."
sagittarius,2012-09-18,"Your anxiety motivates you to take care of unfinished business early in the day. Although you wish that you could get everything done, at some point you may need to postpone tasks that are still incomplete. Ironically, once you relinquish control you might even find enough time to relax for a bit. Thankfully, a quick escape can rejuvenate you with sufficient energy to come back to tie up the loose ends later on."
capricorn,2012-09-18,"You may feel pressured to do something with a group of people today, even if you would prefer to be by yourself. But don't turn your penchant for privacy into a major conflict, or you'll just end up exhausting yourself in the process. Save your energy for something more important; instead, relax and resign yourself to fulfilling your social obligations without a fuss. Your positive attitude could turn time with friends or acquaintances into a treat rather than a chore."
aquarius,2012-09-18,"You could be at odds with anyone who is wielding authority today, even if he or she doesn't deserve your negativity. Others may attempt to manipulate you, but you could provoke another set of issues if you fight back. Unfortunately, it's tough to stop a conflict once a debate is started. Go ahead and make your stand now, but stay focused on the main issue so things don't go awry."
pisces,2012-09-18,"You might not feel very efficient today, especially if you have menial chores to perform. It's challenging to keep your thoughts focused on repetitive tasks; however, you could be very productive now, if you stretch your mind beyond the present moment. Give yourself permission to dream while you work; visualizing the future creates a more meaningful path for you to follow."
aries,2012-09-19,"You might be rather inflexible today as something that has been bothering you for a while comes close to erupting. You feel the waves of trapped emotions pushing to the surface now, yet there may not be an obvious way to express your unresolved conflicts in a constructive manner. Impulsive aggression can get you into trouble, so make sure to think before you act. Find a healthy way to let off some steam without hurting anyone else in the process."
taurus,2012-09-19,"Although you might actually believe that what you did was for the best, there's some emotional cleanup that needs to be done now. Suppressed feelings come into play, possibly triggering someone's anger. A new set of circumstances may be even more intense than what happened before. If you are embroiled in a conflict today, stand back to let the energies settle before engaging in the very same unproductive dance all over again."
gemini,2012-09-19,"Nearly every interaction seems overly dramatic now, but don't let that stop you from doing your work. Events are unfolding in ways that can bring an unexpected shift into your life. You can try to resist the changes or you can roll with them. Just remember that the easy way out is currently not your best course of action. Settle into the emotional process today even if it's uncomfortable at first."
cancer,2012-09-19,"Complicated relationship issues can't hijack your day if you stick to your highest ideals. Perhaps you've been holding on to a secret for too long. Or maybe you have feelings that have not yet been outwardly expressed. Either way, an intense emotional struggle could demand your attention today. No matter what happens, don't get dragged into an unnecessary standoff, since there will be no winners if you do. The best thing you can do now is listen to your heart."
leo,2012-09-19,"Issues are coming to light today that you might not have previously noticed. Conflicts between you and someone at work could be emphasized -- perhaps because you are so strongly driven at this time in your life. Your ambition might be nearly out of control unless you keep your ego in check. Moderating your goals with flexibility makes your life easier now, and possibly more fulfilling."
virgo,2012-09-19,"It may feel as if others are undermining your efforts as they reject your latest ideas. Take time to consider your current motives and what you might have done to arouse such opposition. Even if you have to confront someone about what's happening today, it's to your advantage to modify your own course, too. If you don't make adjustments, the resistance will just return again later. Listen to the feedback you receive with an open mind and then rework your thoughts into a winning strategy."
libra,2012-09-19,"You realize that you need to take direct action now, but you're not quite sure how to proceed. Discussing your plans isn't going to get you where you want to be, but it might be a sensible start. Be ready to fight for your beliefs. Take the initiative, for your perspective may not be obvious to everyone else. Acknowledging what's most important is a good start, but you also have to make your move to earn the respect of others."
scorpio,2012-09-19,"Your key planets, Mars and Pluto, are forming stressful aspects now, elevating your energy and supercharging you with feelings. Your emotions might be more than you want to deal with today, but deal with them you must. Nevertheless, if you're at odds with someone, don't push the conflict to fruition. Take the high road and walk away from an unnecessary drama. Instead, channel your intensity into something more productive."
sagittarius,2012-09-19,"You may encounter unexpected resistance today, but you still believe that you can move mountains if they are between you and your desired destination. Since you're ready to do whatever it takes, be careful that you don't go to extremes. You can exhaust yourself by trying to accomplish the impossible now. Others might be impressed, but you are better off saving some of your energy for whatever is next."
capricorn,2012-09-19,"You are being offered a special opportunity now to work through your fears, especially if you're willing to feel the pain of a past emotional hurt. Often, you minimize your discomfort by distracting yourself with your lofty ambitions. However, it would be a mistake to just go out and make something happen to ameliorate your anxiety. Nevertheless, now it's important to focus on your internal transformation which will ultimately help you feel better about yourself."
aquarius,2012-09-19,"You understand the true power of community, but it may feel like you are doing battle with your comrades today, rather than collaborating with them. It's not a black and white situation; however gray is particularly difficult for you because you can see the problem without being able to offer a solution. Work toward the collective vision with your usual passion without having to be in control of the outcome."
pisces,2012-09-19,"A power struggle over money may be developing on the horizon now and you don't see a way to circumnavigate the storm. Passions are aroused and conflict is brewing. It might seem as if the problems in your life are external, but the real disagreements are within the confines of your own mind. Look for ways to change your attitude before you try to change the opinions of others."
aries,2012-09-20,"You don't necessarily like what happens today if you have to defend yourself against someone with an agenda that's different from yours. However, everything may not be as intense as it seems now. If you feel like you're being pushed to a breaking point, try changing your mindset first. Once you find your center you won't need the approval of anyone else."
taurus,2012-09-20,"You naturally prefer a day filled with simple pleasures, yet you might have to spend a lot of energy rearranging your schedule today because of events out of your control. Unfortunately, there's not much margin for error now; you still must fulfill your work responsibilities before taking it easy. Trust in the process; ultimately everything will work out OK if you avoid getting caught up in someone else's drama. If you lay low and keep busy, the pressure should ease over the weekend."
gemini,2012-09-20,"Your key planet Mercury could overwhelm you with too much information today. However, your biggest challenge may involve choosing which tasks to postpone for a later date. It isn't that you made too many promises; instead, it's others who are asking too much of you at this time. Do whatever you can to help, but don't be concerned about someone else's judgment once you have established your limits. Setting healthy boundaries enables you to do your best work."
cancer,2012-09-20,"You might have made a commitment that is weighing heavily on your mind now, and there seems to be little you can do to satisfy someone who could end up disappointed. Don't doubt yourself as you try to figure out what to do next. The current stress is not meant to point out your weaknesses; its purpose is to highlight just how much you currently have on your plate. Rely on your emotional strength to navigate through this situation."
leo,2012-09-20,"You may be stressed in ways that make it hard to get in touch with your inner spirit today. Fortunately, you have a deep reserve of determination and resolve. However, others seem to be standing in your way, regardless of your tactics. Undermining authority won't help, since this strategy only impedes your forward movement. Instead, simply acknowledge whoever is in control and then get on with whatever you need to do now."
virgo,2012-09-20,"You may feel as if you are stuck between two uncontrollable forces without an apparent way out today as your key planet Mercury locks horns with powerful Uranus and Pluto. Unfortunately, the more you struggle, the worse it gets. Instead of trying to escape now, stick around and learn the truth, even if you think it could be unpleasant. Your ability to uncover the facts will steadily resolve the tension over the next few days."
libra,2012-09-20,"Hidden motives come to light now, adding to the stress between you and someone else. Others might not like what they learn today, but the unpleasant energy should begin to shift once the truth is revealed. Whatever the disagreements of perspective, common ground can be found -- but it might require more time than you think. Have patience; the process of healing works best on its own timetable. All you can do is make it clear that you are ready and willing to do your part."
scorpio,2012-09-20,"You are often up for a good challenge when you know that you're doing the right thing. But now the Sun squares your key planet Pluto, so make sure that you're not being played as a pawn in someone else's game. If you think that you're being manipulated, it's smart to take a few steps back from the struggle and reconsider your next move. Temporarily disengaging from the situation enables you to detach from your feelings long enough to make a logical decision."
sagittarius,2012-09-20,"You might feel as if you're fighting a losing battle today. Nevertheless, holding on to your fading optimism may still be the best thing you can do. If you start questioning your long-term goals now, you could spiral downward into worry or despair -- and this won't lead to anything productive. Be aware of what's happening, but don't just focus on the dark side. There is a silver lining to this particular rain cloud that's yours to explore if you keep an open mind."
capricorn,2012-09-20,"You are passionate about your life today and are willing to work extra hard just to keep up with everything you have already set in motion. However, this isn't the best time to start something new, since it seems that loose ends are fraying faster than you can tie them back together. Stay focused, even if you feel overwhelmed. The positive impact of your current efforts will be seen in just a few days."
aquarius,2012-09-20,"Your nervous system is so wired today that it's nearly impossible to finish what you start because you can't stay focused. Your impatience prompts you to talk before you fully develop your thoughts as Mercury opposes erratic Uranus. Unfortunately your unconventional ideas may upset your colleagues, so it's wise to consider other people's feelings before you say too much. Using your common sense helps you avoid an unnecessary confrontation with someone who would make a better ally than enemy."
pisces,2012-09-20,"Uncertainty bubbles up from the depths of your subconscious and your first impulse now may be to clamp down on your fantasies and become uncharacteristically rigid. Unfortunately, this inflexibility won't help you get through the stresses of the day. However, when you accept that you don't need to know where you are going, then you will magically find yourself closer to your desired destination."
aries,2012-09-21,"Emotional pressures ease now that the Moon is in fiery Sagittarius, increasing your desire to go out and do something to rev up the adrenaline in your system. Even if you have been taking care of yourself, the urge for excitement and adventure outweighs the need for safety today. Nevertheless, it's important to demonstrate your intelligence by controlling your sudden impulses. A good idea will develop into a great one if you give it sufficient time and energy."
taurus,2012-09-21,A challenging issue may arise involving someone else's property or something that you own jointly with a partner. You could feel as if others are trying to manipulate your feelings now or entice you with material temptations. Choose your battles carefully. Don't even bother to engage in a fight if it isn't critical. There will be time for an honest conversation once the energy settles down. Walking away may be the best way to avoid a bad scene today.
gemini,2012-09-21,"Someone could suggest an idea today that's even more ambitious than yours. You might be eager to go for it, but fortunately your common sense could hold you back just enough to prevent you from attempting something too risky. Joking around about your current caution can effectively alleviate the impact of your negative response. Don't get involved in a new project now unless you're absolutely certain that it's worth your effort."
cancer,2012-09-21,"You may have to do things for everyone else today, which makes it nearly impossible to find time to take care of your own needs. Your best strategy now is to start at the top of your list and just cross off one thing after another, even if it seems like someone else has set your priorities. Ultimately, you're the one who stands to benefit the most if you stay focused and finish your chores. Get started right away so you have time to nurture your dreams later once your work is done."
leo,2012-09-21,"It could be a carefree day where your toughest decision is deciding which party to attend, what time to leave for the beach, or who you should invite out to play. Although your penchant for pleasure might be overstated, there is plenty of room to create memorable experiences now. No matter how much work you have to do today, make time to luxuriate in the velvety richness of your own mental playground."
virgo,2012-09-21,You may be intrigued by the possibility of making a grand emotional gesture within your family or close group of friends. You feel magnanimous today and you want them to take notice of what you are doing to help out in these tense times. But assisting others for your own selfish reasons will not turn out well. Make sure your intentions are pure and you will be recognized accordingly for your generous contribution.
libra,2012-09-21,"Some of your best ideas can be communicated with great ease today and you don't even have to make a big deal of it. You have a clear vision now, along with the necessary facts to back it up. As long as you don't confuse the two you can speak the truth straight from your heart. Maintaining a logical perspective goes a long way toward assuring your success."
scorpio,2012-09-21,"You might want to exaggerate your story today to bring more recognition to you or your favorite cause. However, if you let your feelings run the show, your plan may not work out as intended. You're better off making a change in your tactics sooner than later. Rethink your strategy and tone down your rhetoric if necessary. A rational approach works wonders now."
sagittarius,2012-09-21,"Hold your arrows of thought as steady as you can and make sure that your eyes are solely on your target. Then and only then, release your intentions and let your dreams soar into space. No matter what happens, you have taken a positive step toward realizing your goals. Sharing your experience with someone you trust could turn your process into a memorable and magical moment."
capricorn,2012-09-21,"Something that you are hiding from yourself or others may create problems today. You might be holding tension that stems from a feeling that you have kept private. However, there are no absolute rights or wrongs with respect to which emotions should be shared. Just remember that nothing can be gained if you're not willing to take a chance."
aquarius,2012-09-21,"Your future is contained within your dreams and now it's time to remember them more clearly than ever. But this isn't about a new vision; it's more likely about a familiar one that's been lingering with you over the years. Dust off your old fantasies so you can explore them anew, even if your feelings about them are mixed. Don't stiffen up with resistance or fear; instead, reclaim your flexibility and stretch into the uncertainty to see where your emotions lead."
pisces,2012-09-21,"A widening gulf between your feelings and your actions may cause major complications today. You want to demonstrate your positive attitude to everyone at work, but you could come across as scattered if you take on too many tasks. Keep an open dialogue with your colleagues and listen closely to the feedback you receive. Their good advice can help you set healthy priorities, enabling you to better manage your time and resources."
aries,2012-09-22,"Partnerships grow more demanding when the Sun enters your 7th House of Relationships today. Although you can be very generous, there are times when you simply forget about other people's needs. Stopping long enough to consciously consider what someone else wants helps to make things run much smoother throughout the rest of the year."
taurus,2012-09-22,"You may not realize how much others look up to you now, yet every little thing you do impacts them strongly. However, you could be less concerned with someone else's perceptions today than you are with completing your chores. It's tempting to narrow your vision and only concentrate on maintaining your regular routine. But don't let your need to focus on details get in the way of being fully present for your friends and family."
gemini,2012-09-22,"You may not feel very practical today, so it's wise to enjoy your fantasies without trying to turn them into reality. Thankfully, there's nothing wrong with losing yourself in your daydreams for a little while; this harmless escape can even be rejuvenating and inspiring. Just make sure you know the difference between the idle wanderings of your imagination and what's actually expected of you in the real world."
cancer,2012-09-22,"Your activities are likely to become more home-based as the Libra Sun moves through your 4th House of Roots. The next few weeks are ideal for nurturing yourself and your loved ones. You might even consider traveling -- physically or metaphysically -- all the way back to the place of your origins. Remember, going deep now strengthens your foundation for the months ahead. Learning something about your past enables you to be more successful in the future."
leo,2012-09-22,Your schedule is filling up fast and life is getting busier now that the Sun is illuminating your 3rd House of Immediate Environment. But complexities arise if you cannot manage your time effectively because your tight schedule can be quite unforgiving. Don't get discouraged if you fall behind; just be honest with everyone affected and continue to do the best you can. Your heroic efforts are appreciated more than you know.
virgo,2012-09-22,"Your uncertainty over a fundamental issue might have made a recent decision rather difficult. Now, a new wave of confusion can sour your actions with doubt as the Sun enters your 2nd House of Values. However, there's no need to change your mind or alter your plans today, even if you aren't sure of yourself. Hang tight; your confidence will return in a few days. In the meantime, sorting through your options gives you one more chance to make the right choice."
libra,2012-09-22,"Your clarity is acutely sharp now as the Sun enters your sign, enabling you to make intelligent decisions that are based upon your special ability to objectively see both sides of an issue. Fortunately, sentimentality won't lead you off course today. Just accept subjective artistic leanings as lovely muses; incorporate what you can, and leave the rest for another day."
scorpio,2012-09-22,The Sun's shift into your 12th House of Endings is a reminder to complete current projects and tie up as many loose ends as possible. There's no reason to waste your limited energy by starting anything new now. Lying low and avoiding the spotlight allows you to focus on the more personal aspects of your life. It's wiser to wait until the Sun enters Scorpio next month to make your next big move.
sagittarius,2012-09-22,"Your friends and family may be hard to read today, leaving you uncertain about their place in your current plans. Unfortunately, your ideas might not be as crystal clear as you thought, creating problems you haven't yet considered. Don't blame your lack of confidence on anyone else or you will just drift farther away from your real goals. Accepting responsibility for your attitude now inspires you to do something about it."
capricorn,2012-09-22,"Your career is on your mind now as you wonder about your future. Fortunately, your professional objectives may be clearly illuminated during the weeks ahead as the Sun moves through your 10th House of Public Responsibility. However, this emphasis on your work can strain your personal life as obligations distract you from your emotional connections with those closest to you. Just remember that establishing greater balance in your life might be more important than job success alone."
aquarius,2012-09-22,"You are pulled in two directions today as the Sun's shift into fellow Air sign Libra brightens your life with an easygoing feeling about your future. However, the Moon's stressful square to the Sun reminds you of all the things you wanted to do but haven't yet accomplished. Your best strategy is to remain optimistic without losing touch with reality. Staying in close communication with someone you trust can help you keep your dreams alive."
pisces,2012-09-22,"You may feel uncomfortable today if someone shares too much information with you. No matter how pressing the situation is, there's a part of you that doesn't want to deal with what's really happening. Although you might actually believe that whatever you don't know can't hurt you, it's just not true. Even unexpressed thoughts have their impact, so it's smarter to show your concern, ask questions, and listen to the rest of the story."
aries,2012-09-23,"You may be holding yourself back because you know that it isn't quite time yet to break free. But you are ready for a change, nonetheless. It's OK if you don't have any specific plans finalized now. There's no need to worry; the details will come together over the next few days. Instead of initiating action today; just imagine what freedom will feel like once it's yours."
taurus,2012-09-23,"Although you think that you're being practical enough to get what you want today, you might be unclear where reality blurs into fantasy. You could be dreaming of things that are beyond your reach. Nevertheless, you can work toward making the most of what you already have by walking in two worlds. One foot is stepping into your dreams and the other is right here in the present moment. Thankfully, your flights of fancy won't make you any less effective and may even inspire you to do great work."
gemini,2012-09-23,"You have an unrealistic desire to make everyone in your life happy today. You would like to be of service to others, but you cannot simply let go of your own issues -- especially if your intentions are at cross purposes to those around you. Unfortunately, compromise may not work at this time, so acknowledge the differences and accept that which you cannot change. Take care of your needs too, instead of only trying to minimize conflict."
cancer,2012-09-23,"You are surfing emotional waves that propel you along on a bigger ride than you expect today. You're likely to take everything very seriously when the Moon is in hardworking Capricorn, yet completion of any specific task may be elusive now. As your frustration grows, you become even more determined to reach the finish line; nevertheless, patience is your greatest virtue at this time."
leo,2012-09-23,"Your logical mind is bent on keeping your current commitments, but your instincts may be pulling you in an entirely different direction today. Your emotions are strong and it's a continuing struggle to keep your more radical feelings in line. On the outside, everything seems as if it's under control, but you are working overtime to make it appear that way. Be gentle with yourself; you are only human and you don't always have to save the day."
virgo,2012-09-23,"You are normally cool, calm and collected, but your rational self might be missing in action today. Others may be disappointed if they believe that they can rely on your logical approach to lead the way. There are other factors to consider now. Among them is the realization that analytical thinking isn't the only viable method to reaching a sensible conclusion. Sometimes, you just need to dance to the music you hear inside your head."
libra,2012-09-23,"It may be a busy day at home, but it's even more hectic within the confines of your mind. Think of ways to push the energy up toward the surface where it can be expressed, rather than keeping your thoughts all to yourself. It doesn't do any good to withhold your best ideas from the world. Sharing your plans now will bring you the encouragement that you need to put them into action."
scorpio,2012-09-23,"Even if you're aware of what's going on in your immediate environment today, you still could be in for a surprise. Although your romantic life may be very different from your expectations now, this detour isn't permanent. You are ready to respond to changing circumstances, but may not know which way to turn as feelings build in intensity. If possible, try not to make any big decisions yet; it's best if you can wait this one out."
sagittarius,2012-09-23,"It's easy to get lost in your inner world now without feeling the need to inform anyone of your whereabouts. Even if you don't say anything, someone might still sense your detachment. Be careful about withdrawing too much, for you can inadvertently precipitate the emotional meltdown you're trying to avoid. It may feel as if you are being careful, but your self-restraint could have the opposite effect from what you intend. Stopping long enough to consider the feelings of others is the first step to opening up the lines of communication."
capricorn,2012-09-23,"Your keen ability to visualize the future now is your greatest asset. You might feel as if you can manifest your dreams, regardless of the obstacles in your way. Unfortunately, you may have a slightly distorted view of your own capabilities today. Don't make any long-term decisions based upon your current perspective. Even if the weight of responsibility is on your shoulders, you probably have a few more days before you really must make your move."
aquarius,2012-09-23,"You might feel as if you have struggled long enough and you want to see tangible results today. Although your ideal payoff may still seem far off in the distance, a little more patience goes a long way to calm your nerves. Uncharacteristic confusion adds discouragement to the picture, but it will quickly fade once you stop trying so hard. Luckily, there could be a shift in the next few days that brings you closer to your goals."
pisces,2012-09-23,"You receive conflicting messages today as one situation asks you to focus your attention while another suggests that loosening your grip would be a better strategy. You are ready to jump into the fray yet your key planet Neptune makes it hard to know what's sensible in the moment. Consider the alternatives, but don't get tricked into thinking you must choose one or the other. The trick now is to successfully navigate your way between the extremes to reach your destination."
aries,2012-09-24,"This is quite a busy week for you, making it crucial to focus on the tasks you need to finish. But even if you try to keep your blinders on until you have made a dent in your list of things to do, other more disruptive forces are at work now. Accepting the distractions with a sense of humor reduces the stress. Nevertheless, extra concentration is needed today to keep you on track."
taurus,2012-09-24,"You may feel as if someone is not being cooperative today, possibly with respect to your romantic inclinations. If you are in a relationship, your partner might seem distant, as if he or she is setting up roadblocks to intimacy. Don't get too worked up about it; celebrate your cup being half full instead of complaining that it's half empty. Ironically, the resistance could dissipate once you stop trying so hard to make everything perfect."
gemini,2012-09-24,"You are concerned that you can't pursue all the intriguing curiosities popping up in your life now because your time and efforts are limited by circumstances beyond your control. A demanding situation at work may prevent you from being as independent as you wish. Surprisingly, your calendar could open up once you resign yourself to meeting your current obligations."
cancer,2012-09-24,"Your unfulfilled needs stand in the way of your satisfaction now, for it's unlikely that others will give you everything that you want. If you are already in a close partnership, you may have to negotiate before you are taken seriously. But this isn't as bad as it sounds because the real lesson is to learn what you can give to yourself. Clearly defining what you want from a relationship is a good start, but knowing how to fill in the gaps on your own is necessary."
leo,2012-09-24,"It might appear as if your life is going to settle down for a bit, but this may be a premature hopeful conclusion. Although you see progress at work, there are unexpected twists and turns in the path ahead of you this week. Use your time wisely now to get ready for whatever you might run into later on. And, if others offer their assistance today, don't let your pride get in the way of accepting help. Being gracious works well both in giving and receiving."
virgo,2012-09-24,"Your current creativity probably originates from your desire to achieve and get ahead rather than bubbling up from the wellsprings of inspiration. You know what you want to accomplish and, luckily, you have the ability to transform your playful or romantic urges into serious practical manifestations. Whatever you do today, make sure that it's done with a greater purpose in mind."
libra,2012-09-24,"An unexpected twist on the relationship path may not be such a problem now, since it's probably helpful to release hidden tensions. However, you would prefer to sidestep a sticky issue in order to keep the peace. But even if you are trying to maintain stability, conflict could work its way into the picture. Nevertheless, don't avoid an important discussion because honest communication is one of the primary ingredients of healthy change."
scorpio,2012-09-24,"Two separate issues could arise now. First, you are redefining your own boundaries, even if this means a bit of self-imposed isolation. Secondly, a stream of revelations prevents you from feeling sorry for yourself. You may even be amused by the melodramatic soap opera of your life these days. This healthy attitude gives you the necessary detachment so you can withdraw for a while to facilitate your continued personal growth."
sagittarius,2012-09-24,"If you are feeling critical of your friends today, examine your own behavior prior to making any false accusations. You may be uncharacteristically traditional now as you compare your values with those closest to you. But there's no reason to judge anyone else, even if someone acts in an apparently irresponsible manner. Let others know where you stand, but don't try to change them. Simply decide what's valuable to you and then work for what you want."
capricorn,2012-09-24,"A wave of uncertainty washes over you today but your tendency is to reinforce your walls to shut off the flow of the unknown. You could be scared that your whole world may be quickly destabilized if you acknowledge your lack of control. Just remember, the more you engage your irrational fears and express them to someone you trust, the greater the potential for positive change."
aquarius,2012-09-24,"You may feel as if someone is secretly trying to influence your behavior, and it's difficult to know the best way to react to the situation. There are unknown pieces to the puzzle today and you cannot effectively fight an unseen enemy. Instead of lighting the fuse and picking up the pieces afterward, try holding on to familiar healthy routines now. The truth will come out soon enough, still leaving you with enough time to act once it does."
pisces,2012-09-24,"It seems like you're being restrained from expressing yourself as freely as you wish today, yet this is likely more constructive than you realize. If you just say whatever is on your mind, you could end up offending someone who means a lot to you. Patience is your best friend now. Don't make any sudden changes; move slowly and with great intent if you feel certain about someone or something special."
aries,2012-09-25,"Your ruling planet Mars has you all fired up today and you are eager to swing into action to take charge of a tricky situation. Unfortunately, you might not be able to accomplish as much as you wish because relationship dynamics are more complicated than you thought. If you get angry with yourself because you didn't plan ahead, don't try to shift the blame to anyone else. Instead of overreacting now, be cool and focus on your long-term objectives."
taurus,2012-09-25,"You're tempted to address a current family problem today, but it's challenging to keep your anger under control once you bring up the topic for discussion. Even if you know that self-restraint is wise, you still want to get your feelings out in the open before the opportunity passes. Nevertheless, it's more effective to work off some of your aggression physically before sitting down to talk things out. Hold your ground without going to extremes."
gemini,2012-09-25,"You may be at the end of your rope today, but impatience isn't your most pressing problem. A bigger concern is how to process your unexpressed resentment. Starting an argument with a friend won't help to solve any of the underlying issues. Instead of disagreeing with everyone now, talk about the source of your current negativity. Focus on what's truly important rather than getting sidetracked by fear."
cancer,2012-09-25,"Although pressure from friends, a lack of cash, and an overly hectic schedule all may add to your stress, you still can maintain a sense of balance in the face of difficult circumstances. Instead of succumbing to your worries now, continue on your same path without making any rash decisions or sudden moves. Things should begin to settle back down tomorrow, so there's no need to panic today."
leo,2012-09-25,"Working off excess energy is crucial today because feisty Mars makes you hot under the collar. Taking a stand for something you believe in is admirable, but it could be an unnecessary risk. Nevertheless, you might be so frustrated by politics as usual that you lose your temper. However, if you remain flexible in your attitude, the demands of the day won't bother you as much. Seeking a diplomatic solution is healthier than adding to the conflict. Being the voice of reason now is your best strategy."
virgo,2012-09-25,"Acting on your feelings is often a challenge, while expressing yourself logically is your preferred path. However, intellectual communication isn't sufficient now; you need something more than the right words. Don't wait until your frustration is so high that you want to scream. Instead, take a risk and push through your fears. Letting down your walls isn't easy, but it's the only way anyone can truly know your heart."
libra,2012-09-25,"It's easy to surprise your friends today by doing something totally off the wall and out of character. Your desires can be rather unorthodox now that Venus is aligned with progressive Uranus. What's most unusual is that you are ready to take a chance and express what you want, in spite of potential disapproval from others. Ironically, it doesn't matter if you reach satisfaction, but it's imperative that you're willing to try."
scorpio,2012-09-25,"You may be stressed out today as your traditional ruling planet Mars provokes you to express what you've been holding back. You could feel threatened in some way, but things probably seem worse now than they actually are. Defending yourself is a smart idea, but lashing out at someone who isn't even aware of what they did is not prudent. Be positive and focus on your goals instead of getting swept up in fleeting emotions. Throwing yourself into your work might just be the easiest way to keep the peace."
sagittarius,2012-09-25,"You need to be clear about what's important to you today because someone close to you may otherwise misinterpret your behavior. You could even inadvertently offend a friend by acting rashly. You might try to take a more cautious route by monitoring your actions, but an impulsive reaction is still likely to slip out now. Apologize for your contribution to a misunderstanding, and then move on. Keeping the communication channels open is the best way to prevent any problems in the future."
capricorn,2012-09-25,"Avoid getting caught up in any negativity that comes your way today, even if you realize that someone is struggling. You may be able to see the source of the problem, yet there's nothing you can do to fix it. Your best strategy now is to be a compassionate listener while presenting your message of hope in a calm and collected manner. Rising above fear sets a clear example for others to follow."
aquarius,2012-09-25,"You may know more than you should now, and keeping a secret can fuel your anxiety. If you finally spill the beans, the way you do it could be more important than what you actually say. Don't dramatize your message by turning your disclosure into a full-blown performance. Just share the truth in a matter-of-fact way today without creating a scene in the process. Others will appreciate your rational approach more than you will ever know."
pisces,2012-09-25,"You're very logical when considering your long-term goals today, but you may be more emotionally involved when dealing with your day-to-day affairs. You might feel as if others want to control your actions, tempting you to escape into your fantasies. But it's critical to establish clear boundaries now instead of retreating from the situation. Once your position is clear, be prepared to meet others halfway."
aries,2012-09-26,"If anyone can get away with doing too much at once, it's you. You might discover that you spread yourself too thin today and there's no way to deliver on all the promises you made. However, you have an amazing ability to compress time and accomplish your goals when your back is up against the wall. Use your powers of concentration and you could get by, even if you're in over your head."
taurus,2012-09-26,"Your finances receive Jupiter's blessings today, but you still must do the work to reap the rewards. Even if you are uncharacteristically restless now, don't upset the order in your life just yet. It's better to hold on to the status quo than to fall into the trap of believing that the grass is greener somewhere else. Appreciating the people who love you is one of the easiest ways to multiply the joy in your life."
gemini,2012-09-26,"It feels as if you can do no wrong today, but danger could be lurking behind an intriguing opportunity. You may be doing so well that your confidence tricks you into taking on more than necessary. Remember that you have your limits just like anyone else. If you cannot set boundaries for yourself now, circumstances might throw you a curve ball to remind you to slow down. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure."
cancer,2012-09-26,"You may be required to give more of yourself in the community or on the job today. Fortunately, your actions can have an immediate positive impact on those around you, but it's crucial to conserve some energy for the days ahead. Don't attempt to finish everything all at once. Spread out the hardest work over the next few days for the best results."
leo,2012-09-26,"You're in synch with your coworkers today, even if you normally prefer a more independent approach. Thankfully, you stand to gain a lot from your interactions with others now. Even if it doesn't take an entire village to assure your success, it's much easier collaborating than doing it alone. Think big and harness the energy of your associates as you strive to reach your goals."
virgo,2012-09-26,"You aren't happy having to deal with so much extraneous information today. You would rather have less data and more facts, but instead you may feel as if you're being overwhelmed with noisy static that is difficult to analyze. Don't stress about the wrong things. Be open to whatever you're learning, but wait a few days before you try to put it all into proper perspective."
libra,2012-09-26,"You're riding a train of words today, even if you don't know where they might take you. Interpersonal communication is larger than life now. You could receive some sort of good news, but it may be tricky to sort it out from all the other incoming emails, telephone calls and conversations. Pay careful attention so you don't let a great opportunity slip through your fingers. Your next adventure is waiting for you to say yes."
scorpio,2012-09-26,"You have been on a roller coaster ride recently with your emotions swinging one way and then the other. Although today is likely on the upswing, optimism could make you uneasy because you're not ready to trust the positive feelings. If you feel like there's something else coming around the next corner, you're probably right. Be patient; your life is in flux and the alternating currents have not played out quite yet."
sagittarius,2012-09-26,"Someone might deliver the confidence boost you need today as your key planet Jupiter aligns with Mercury the Messenger. An uplifting comment from a friend or a colleague encourages you to develop a passionate idea into a real plan. On the other hand, your inspiration could motivate others to accomplish greatness. Dream your dream out loud, for whatever you believe can become part of your future."
capricorn,2012-09-26,"Don't be afraid to stretch beyond your normal limits at work now because you have an opportunity to learn in new ways. You are eager to experience the rush of adrenaline as you expand your horizons by doing things differently. But keep a bit of your famous Capricorn caution in reserve so you don't go too far, too fast. Trust your current optimism, but remember that inflated thinking will fall back to earth in the days ahead."
aquarius,2012-09-26,"New ideas come to you in bursts of energy today. It's as if the ceiling has been removed and your thoughts are free to reach the stars. However, there may be a price to pay if you don't know when to stop dreaming. Trouble comes from your over-extension. Grandiose aspirations make you feel powerful for a short time, but might not pay off in the long run. Write down your best thoughts and then wait until tomorrow to pick the most sensible one for further exploration."
pisces,2012-09-26,"You know that establishing stability is a good idea, but new temptations could make it difficult to stay on track. Your hopes are being stirred by the possibilities in front of you now, and your thinking might not be clear enough today to foresee the trouble ahead. Although the opportunities may be real, move slowly. Success is more likely if you allow time for the right situation to gel on its own, instead of attempting to push things ahead too soon."
aries,2012-09-27,"You are driven to pursue the object of your desires today, yet love could slip through your fingers if your expectations are not realistic. Unchecked fantasies can set you up for needless disappointment. Even if you're attracted to something or someone beyond your reach, don't let your current situation hook you emotionally. A little detachment now helps to resolve the tension without creating too much drama."
taurus,2012-09-27,"Red-hot Mars forms a pushy square to your key planet Venus today, triggering unreasonable demands everywhere you go. Try to resolve imbalances diplomatically. Your involvement might bother those who aren't interested in revealing their real feelings. Don't hide your displeasure if you run into resistance now; bringing a difficult issue out into the open can lead to easier times for all."
gemini,2012-09-27,"You have been extremely talkative recently and today is no exception. You could even drive someone nuts now with your endless chatter. Ironically, you might actually believe that what you have to say is the most important thing ever. Even if your message is critical, remember that saying it just once is sufficient for others to get your message loud and clear."
cancer,2012-09-27,"Although your focus is on others today, there's more going on for you than anyone else realizes. You may appear quite optimistic, but you're probably not saying what's really on your mind -- partly because your emotions are too complex to put into words and partly for fear of rejection. There's no need to force any issues yet; you'll know when it's the right time to open up."
leo,2012-09-27,"Unspoken feelings may prevent you from getting what you want today as hidden agendas reveal more about your life than you prefer. In fact, it's the words left unsaid that have the most significant impact. Unfortunately, even with all the sweet energy in your life, you still might not feel fulfilled. Working harder isn't the answer, and neither is escape. The first step out of this conundrum is to share what's on your mind without blaming anyone for your lack of satisfaction."
virgo,2012-09-27,You might not be able to relax today because you are over-stimulated with too many distractions. You could struggle to stick to your routine because everything you do opens doors to unexplored rooms that are ripe with potential. Stay focused; the biggest opportunity may arise from doing exactly what you are supposed to be doing right now.
libra,2012-09-27,"Relationships may be your primary source of pleasure, yet they could bring your values into question today. Your ruling planet Venus is aggravated by aggressive Mars in your 2nd House of Self-Esteem, provoking headstrong action. Unfortunately, impulsive behavior encourages you to do something you might later regret. Stand back and take a more philosophical approach to ease the stress on everyone involved."
scorpio,2012-09-27,"You may try to bury your feelings, but being secretive isn't a sensible way to avoid an unpleasant interaction. Your behavior can betray your intentions today, revealing more about you than you wish. Trust in the process, even if difficult issues come to the surface. Nothing is gained by attempting to sidestep a meaningful conversation; however, walking away for a bit to collect your thoughts is wise. It's easier to delve into a sensitive subject once you have regained your composure."
sagittarius,2012-09-27,"Fun and games may dominate your life today. Perhaps you want to express your inner child or just long for more spontaneity in your life. However, even if you're having a delightful time, you still want something more. Try turning your frustration into hopeful communication by writing down your thoughts or just sharing them with a friend. A good old-fashioned heart-to-heart can help you find the satisfaction you seek."
capricorn,2012-09-27,"A friend or associate may withhold his or her true feelings today. Although you want to confront the situation, you cannot find a way to begin the right conversation. Letting go of control can be a catalyst to start the process of resolution. Don't worry if things don't work out as you wish; keep your eyes on the long-term solution and not the immediate one. Offer your shoulder for support, but allow others enough room to breathe."
aquarius,2012-09-27,"Events push you into the public eye today no matter how much you might resist. Nevertheless, you still may withhold a vital piece of information, believing this could increase your power. On the contrary, keeping secrets only complicates matters. Controlling the flow of data is not to your advantage now; it's better to get everything out into the open and then let destiny do the rest."
pisces,2012-09-27,"Although you try to be available for your friends and workmates, it's difficult to maintain healthy boundaries while doing so. The hypersensitive Pisces Moon makes it difficult to separate your feelings from those of your closest companions. You are tempted to step outside of your comfort zone to demonstrate your leadership skills today, but it's smarter now to stay below the radar and quietly get your job done as best you can."
aries,2012-09-28,"A friend, partner or co-worker might appear to have all the answers today, even if you aren't asking any questions. Although it's great to receive help when you want it, the meddling can be bothersome if others act like they know more about your life than you do. Losing your temper won't make anything better. Instead, acknowledge other people's good intentions while gently informing them that you'll request assistance if you need it."
taurus,2012-09-28,"You may be eager to take the next step at work today, but first you must complete old business before moving ahead with your plans. You know you're on the edge of something big, but you're not sure how to start. Your biggest problem isn't figuring out how to reach your destination. Ironically, there are so many alternatives now that you need to eliminate the distractions. Once you narrow down your choices, the rest will fall into place."
gemini,2012-09-28,"Your friends might encourage you to push beyond your old limitations today, evoking caution on your part. You know your capabilities and don't appreciate it when someone tries to change your mind. Your impulse is to dig in your heels now, but on the other hand, you don't want to miss out on such an exciting opportunity. Listen carefully to what's being offered and make your choice based on your own intuition and not anyone else's."
cancer,2012-09-28,"Today's tug-of-war between social and personal responsibilities may tax your ability to remain flexible. You can see opportunities opening up at work, even if they aren't quite what you expected. But it's difficult to get excited when you have so many obligations in the present moment that you barely have time to think about tomorrow. Be patient and avoid making a final decision until things settle down a bit."
leo,2012-09-28,"You may shock your friends and co-workers today with risky behavior that could seem a bit extreme compared to what you've been telling others. But people don't realize that your current restlessness did not just happen overnight. You have been thinking about doing something big to stir things up for a while and, fortunately, now is your chance."
virgo,2012-09-28,"Maintaining control over your finances may continue to be a struggle, especially when an unexpected expense catches you off guard. But even if everything is running smoothly, you still might be tempted to purchase something you really don't need. There's nothing wrong with a little extravagance now if you can afford it. However, reaching too far beyond your means only makes the days ahead more difficult."
libra,2012-09-28,"It's not easy to accept the limitations that have been placed on you now. Luckily, as you finally acknowledge your role in a relationship or on the job, something happens that opens the door of possibilities to what you once wanted but have since let go. Naturally, this can be exciting, confusing and upsetting -- all at once. Take a few deep breaths while you consider your choices. Keep in mind that you have more time than you think to make up your mind."
scorpio,2012-09-28,"The dynamics at work are stressful now, and you haven't yet determined the smartest way to navigate through the uncertainty. However, push comes to shove today, forcing you to make a decision. The time for ambivalence is over. Whatever you choose will ultimately be more advantageous than continuing to sit on the fence. Trust your intuition and just go for it."
sagittarius,2012-09-28,"You have spent a lot of time analyzing the possibilities and thinking about where you want your life to go. Although your grand scheme may remain unchanged, your plan to create your ideal future continues to undergo radical change because of unexpected opportunities that have not yet come to fruition. It's difficult to know whether or not they are real, which, in turn, makes it harder to fix on one strategy now. Be patient; the truth is out there for you to find."
capricorn,2012-09-28,"You may have very specific work objectives, but they don't seem as important now as your creative aspirations. Fortunately, you understand the difference between the two. Your job pays the rent and puts food on your table, but your dreams feed your soul and without them life begins to lose meaning. Don't favor one over the other; the ultimate key to your happiness is in balancing both worlds."
aquarius,2012-09-28,"You might not be able to comprehend how your life got so hectic, but if things are running amok today, you're motivated to do something about it. However, impulsive radical action won't be of much help now, for there are consequences that could make your daily routine even crazier. There's nothing wrong with wanting results right away, but you're more likely to be successful by implementing change in small and manageable increments."
pisces,2012-09-28,"You may be bothered with an unexpected money matter today that can't be resolved quickly because you don't have all the information. Finding the answer might be as easy as locating a missing bill, calling the bank or balancing your checkbook. It's not a smart idea to cut corners by taking action until you know all of the facts. Someone else could supply you with everything you need now, so don't be afraid to ask for help."
aries,2012-09-29,"There may be disagreements in a personal or business relationship because your goals clash with someone else's. Unfortunately, the Aries Full Moon raises questions that have no easy answers. Instead of seeking a resolution now, find common ground. Ironically, if you can understand each other's point of view, your differing perspectives might actually provide positive motivation. You're on an emotional roller-coaster ride today so beware that you're prone to overreact. Take a deep breath and give everyone a break."
taurus,2012-09-29,"Today's energetic Aries Full Moon activates your 12th House of Fantasy, prompting you to seek ways to escape from your responsibilities. You realize that you're heading into a very busy time, so you're inclined to do less now to conserve your energy. Nevertheless, you gain steam throughout the day. Give up some of your downtime to complete as many chores as possible so you have less to do later on."
gemini,2012-09-29,"Put your best foot forward at social events this weekend to make the most of the enthusiastic Aries Full Moon that falls in your 11th House of Networking. Be open to an unexpected turn of events today, even if it's upsetting at first. Rather than trying to influence a situation that's beyond your control, change your response to it. You're not in charge of everything, but you are fully responsible for your behavior."
cancer,2012-09-29,"You might think it's not fair if you keep an open mind while someone else has such a rigid perspective that there's little room for discussion or compromise. Nevertheless, you're willing to talk about your feelings now that the enterprising Aries Full Moon culminates in your 10th House of Public Responsibility. Discuss the larger issue of negotiation itself to ensure everyone agrees that winning an argument is less important than cooperating for the good of all."
leo,2012-09-29,"Although you see the blinking red light ahead, you might not heed the warning. You're too impatient to wait now that the action-packed Aries Full Moon occupies your 9th House of Adventure, encouraging you to step on the gas before you know where you're going. But your long-term thinking runs into more immediate concerns if your day brings a surprising event or two. Even if you want to focus on the future, you're better off paying attention to what's happening this moment."
virgo,2012-09-29,"You may have too many ideas to put into action today, but as the day progresses you are able to hone in on the best ones. Your power to concentrate is strong now as the ardent Aries Full Moon in your 8th House of Deep Sharing dredges up forgotten memories. You could be surprised by what you discover from your persistent digging. If you keep an open mind and continue to trust those who have earned it, you can emerge from this process with stronger values and higher self-esteem."
libra,2012-09-29,"If you are struggling to establish your place in a significant relationship, your life may get even more complicated today. Whatever you choose to do could go against the grain now that the independent Aries Full Moon rattles your 7th House of Partnerships. You're not purposefully trying to be difficult or rebellious; you simply want to do what's right. Don't let anyone talk you out of following your instincts. Trusting your inner voice today will lead you in the right direction."
scorpio,2012-09-29,"Today's Aries Full Moon in your 6th House of Health and Habits is square ruthless Pluto, portraying a classic struggle between light and dark. As Lord of the Underworld, Pluto's domain is unconscious and hides in the shadows. It's not easy to bring up certain topics for discussion now, but you cannot afford to let them slide. Take the risk and follow the light of the Sun; awareness rather than denial opens a path toward peace of mind."
sagittarius,2012-09-29,"The excitable Aries Full Moon brightens your 5th House of Creativity, lighting you up with new ideas. You feel as if you're back on track and that recognition will soon be coming your way. Don't pump up your self-esteem too much because overconfidence is an invitation to crash on the rocks. Go ahead and make something special happen by inspiring others with your optimism and talent."
capricorn,2012-09-29,"You might want to hide out and let the world pass you by now that the reckless Aries Full Moon occupies your 4th House of Security. Meanwhile, the Sun's square to powerful Pluto in your sign can stir up fears about the possibility of failure. Retreating to the safety of your home could help you gain a better perspective on the weeks ahead. Instead of falling victim to self-doubt and worry, apply your energy toward your success."
aquarius,2012-09-29,"The air is buzzing from the enthusiastic Aries Full Moon's presence in your 3rd House of Immediate Environment. You are quite active now and probably have much to do, but you could benefit by taking time to prioritize all the possible activities. In the big scheme of things, today's dramas are not as significant as you may think. Try to step back from all the action rather than being swept up in it."
pisces,2012-09-29,"You may be short on time, energy or money today as the impulsive Aries Full Moon charges up your 2nd House of Resources. If you think you have mismanaged a project you might overcompensate now, bolting ahead early in the day. But your eagerness could stir up resistance from others, even if you're not sure why anyone would stand in your way. Hold on to your position and don't push the panic button. A steady and methodical approach works best in the long run."
aries,2012-09-30,"Your actions speak louder than your words, but your motives aren't very transparent today. A private investigator couldn't uncover what you're really up to now, but that isn't your problem. Your primary concern is getting on with your next project instead of taking time to explain yourself to anyone else. Let others draw their own conclusions from the results of your current behavior."
taurus,2012-09-30,"You can't use logic today to solve a personal problem that appears unsolvable. The answer is like a fruit that is blossoming but not quite ripe. Your chances of success are better if you give the process another few days; however, don't use this delay as an excuse to do nothing at all. Whatever steps you take now are better than inaction as long as you realize that the real breakthrough is still on the way."
gemini,2012-09-30,"You're normally comfortable holding multiple points of view, but today your adaptability may be taxed. You are intuitively connected to your own future now, as if you're somehow already living in it. Simultaneously, a partner or lover can anchor you to your past, making it difficult to move on. There are important lessons for you to learn before you are able to let go."
cancer,2012-09-30,"You may feel as if your world isn't able to contain you now because you're ready to shed anything that holds you back. Just as a snake outgrows its skin, you, too, have moved beyond your teacher, job or relationship that brought you this far. However, you can't escape before tying up loose ends. Give yourself a break and let your greater ambitions slide for a couple of days while you gain the closure you need."
leo,2012-09-30,"The pace of your life keeps increasing and you might feel as if time is running out. You know that significant changes are coming and a part of you is hungry for this transformation. Although you may try to hurry it along, another part of you is vested in the status quo. The truth, as usual, can be found somewhere in between the extremes. Go ahead and push for change now, but accept the fact that it will arrive on its own schedule."
virgo,2012-09-30,"It's difficult to relax today because you could become obsessive about buying something you really want. You might be excited by a beautiful item that you normally would pass by, but this doesn't mean that you should blindly follow your impulse. You may even be annoyed with yourself if you set responsibilities aside in order to have fun. Spend the morning doing your chores, and then claim some guilt-free recreation time as your reward."
libra,2012-09-30,"You are eager to help out a friend in need. However, someone's impatience with you could hurt your feelings today as the short-tempered Aries Moon visits your 7th House of Companions. Unfortunately, an imbalance in an interaction that you might normally let slide now stands out like a sore thumb. Thankfully, you can improve the dynamics in nearly any relationship by getting in touch with your feelings and talking about them. Don't forget about yourself while trying to make someone else happy."
scorpio,2012-09-30,"Sticking with your daily routine may be disturbed by an exciting sequence of events today. You're eager to engage in unconventional activities, but your sense of the overall picture will probably remain unchanged. If you're under pressure now, respond to the curves balls coming at you as quickly as possible. Eliminate the noise that is getting in the way so you can return to your original plan."
sagittarius,2012-09-30,"Your schedule is comparatively light today, enabling you to have a good time, regardless of the responsibilities that have been piled on you recently. You could effectively hide the serious issues and make it appear that everything is just fine -- even if it's not. If you have important things to handle now, take care of your business before you go off to have your fun."
capricorn,2012-09-30,"You are pulled in several directions now, but there are really only two alternatives. You can cautiously pull back or fearlessly leap forward. Just remember that retreat is not failure and could ultimately assure your success. If you are overextended today, stepping back may be the most intelligent thing to do. On the other hand, if you have a concrete plan, this can be the right time to push toward the finish line with confidence."
aquarius,2012-09-30,"You may feel restrained by tasks or chores that you have to finish, but your confidence is running strong. You think you can do difficult tasks with great ease today. Even with your fearless attitude, you still need to remember that you're only human and cannot do everything now. Cut back on your promises early in the day or else you might just have to eat your words later on."
pisces,2012-09-30,"You feel confused today, as you alternate between knowing exactly what you want and wondering whether or not you can actually get it. It may seem as if the fun in your life is slipping through your fingers, leaving you with heavy responsibilities and too much work. But don't fall into the trap of fear. Even if you must be serious for a spell, the good times will return before you know it."
aries,2012-10-01,"Hurry up and finish what you already started, or begin something new while you still have a chance. Either way, you're feeling the pressure to take action right away as familiar surges of urgency wash over you like waves upon the beach. Between moments of active inspiration, you also may feel somewhat moody until the evocative Moon leaves your sign this evening. Although allowing time for contemplation is healthy, don't let self-doubt hijack your day."
taurus,2012-10-01,"It's as if something is tickling your psyche today, yet it's difficult to tell exactly what it is or where it's coming from. You feel inspired, but you don't have a clear strategy for applying your creativity. Your daydreams may be so vivid now that you're standing on unfamiliar ground. Nevertheless, pay attention to your visions because they can help guide you through the days ahead."
gemini,2012-10-01,"You may think that there's no limit to what you might accomplish today, but actually there's only so much you can juggle at one time. You must make some difficult choices now if you want something of lasting value to come from your current efforts. Don't be a jack of all trades and a master of none. Setting priorities seems painful at first, but you'll feel a whole lot better once you do."
cancer,2012-10-01,"You want to make major progress at work now that the Moon is illuminating your 10th House of Career. However, it's difficult to stick with just one project because your thoughts are running in several directions. Instead of attempting to focus on the most practical tasks at hand, let your fantasies take you where they will today. A deadline might slip under the radar, and, luckily, others are willing to adapt to your schedule. Currently you are more successful if you work at your own pace."
leo,2012-10-01,"The pace of your life continues to settle down today. You Lions have been on the go for a while and it feels good now that you can grab a catnap or two. However, the focus isn't on sleeping -- it's all about dreaming. Your subconscious is releasing powerful messages, and you may learn something very significant about yourself if you take the time to decipher the symbols."
virgo,2012-10-01,"Although you might want to sit back and enjoy the day, you quickly grow anxious when you're idle for more than just a few minutes. Logically, you know you should be able to take some time for yourself, but you keep worrying about all the unfinished work that still needs to be done. Instead of trying to escape now, concentrate on your goals for the day. Thankfully, your extra effort pays off and you should be able to completely relax this evening."
libra,2012-10-01,"It's a rather noisy day and you prefer your life to be a little less hectic now. It's not that there are too many things going on at once. It's just that everything requires a little more of your attention than you expected. You wish that you could rely on others to help, but they have their own agendas to keep them busy. Get creative and take responsibility for your own destiny the best you can. Your calendar will become easier to manage as the week wears on."
scorpio,2012-10-01,"Although your intentions are good and you enjoy the appreciation you receive, you may feel overwhelmed if you take on too much work. You might be afraid of the proverbial straw that could break the camel's back -- and the camel is you. But there's nowhere to run. Take a deep breath and accept that you need to follow through with your word to the best of your ability. Fortunately, the cosmos comes to your aid and things could work out much better than you expect."
sagittarius,2012-10-01,"You feel driven today and have enough energy to do whatever must be done. You are moving into a highly optimistic phase where you might have a difficult time separating the reality of the situation from your belief that everything will be fine. Don't fall asleep at the wheel of consciousness now, or you could wake up to find yourself crashing into reality. There's nothing wrong with positive thinking as long as you accept the facts."
capricorn,2012-10-01,"Situations can manifest today that require your immediate involvement. You are great when it comes to organizing events, especially in the midst of dealing with minor crises. The problem is that your solutions may defy practical logic now. Make no mistake about it; this is a test and you can pass with flying colors if you trust your feelings and your intuition. Remember, the force is with you."
aquarius,2012-10-01,"The energy seems a bit more settled today than it did yesterday. However, you might not even realize that you're through the eye of the storm and are coming out on the other side now. The skies are clearing and clarity is returning. You are a survivor because your individuality prevents you from losing yourself completely to the agenda of others. You've had to fight for what is yours. Take time to reflect on your journey and appreciate your accomplishments."
pisces,2012-10-01,The currents of your feelings may be flowing too strongly for your taste today. You might be anxious because your emotions are in a state of transition. Don't panic; you'll be fine if you trust the process. Just think of yourself like a surfer riding the waves that arise from the depths of your imagination.
aries,2012-10-02,"You may be offered a chance to cool off and take it easy today. The problem is that even if you do create a mini-vacation for yourself, unexpressed emotions can build in intensity until you have to do something about them. Go ahead and share what's on your mind with a close friend or co-worker, but watch the tone of your delivery. There's no need to stir up petty disputes or blame anyone else for your feelings."
taurus,2012-10-02,"Take time to recharge your emotional batteries today. Although work duties may call, make space for a bit of relaxation, too. Don't fall into the trap of thinking that you have to stay productive all day. Even if there is potential trouble nearby, there's no need to make it worse now by throwing fuel on the fire. Instead, remain cool and collected; finding pleasure in simple things rejuvenates your soul."
gemini,2012-10-02,"Usually, communicating comes naturally to you, but something seems different now. You aren't motivated to say much today as you maintain your point of view. You might not even share anything at all, since you could believe that it's not yet important for others to know where you stand. Nevertheless, it is crucial to trust your inner voice today, even if it still takes a while for things to change."
cancer,2012-10-02,"You might be inclined to draw a line in the sand today. If someone rubs you the wrong way, he or she may get a lot more than bargained for because you will fight back to defend what is rightfully yours. However, your real strength comes from your tenacity. You can hold on longer than anyone else, so remember that time really is on your side."
leo,2012-10-02,"You might be feeling a sense of urgency now, as if you could lose your chance if you don't make something happen today. Your concerns reflect an element of reality since romantic Venus leaves your sign tomorrow. However, it's more likely that your current situation just hasn't yet reached fruition. Taking impulsive action may not be your smartest move. Do your best to smooth over any ruffled feathers and wait for the right opportunity to ripen."
virgo,2012-10-02,"You may not be very inspired today; in fact, you might feel downright lazy. Nevertheless, it's crucial to keep up with your basic routine because falling behind could make the rest of the week more difficult. On the other hand, it's not necessary to drive yourself harder than required. Do what you must, but reserve your energy while you can."
libra,2012-10-02,"An emotional issue may stubbornly work its way to the surface today as the Moon visits your 8th House of Deep Sharing. Even if you're not comfortable talking about your feelings, making an effort to communicate is a worthwhile endeavor. However, someone's expectations might not be reasonable now, adding to the tension. Remember you cannot please everyone, and you'll only make yourself unhappy if you try. Those who are your true friends will remain so, even if you cannot give them what they want at this time."
scorpio,2012-10-02,"Your closest friends mean a lot to you, but the obstinate Taurus Moon makes it difficult to accept the differences of opinions between you and someone who is trying to help. Even if you disagree with others now, remember that the real argument is not with them, but with an aspect of yourself. Once you accept your own irresolvable paradox, the external ones become more manageable."
sagittarius,2012-10-02,"It's tough letting go of the details today, even though this isn't usually a problem for you. Don't be overly hard on yourself about this penchant for the minutiae now because you don't normally allow little things to get in your way. Cut yourself some slack and take the time you need to get everything in order so you'll be free to tackle a bigger project with enthusiasm."
capricorn,2012-10-02,"You might feel as if your closest friend or partner isn't giving you the support you need now, yet you're cautiously optimistic, anyhow. You may be self-protective as you distance yourself from others to take care of business. Thankfully, you're able to make decisions that will be right for you in the long run as long as you keep your priorities straight and concentrate on the most immediate tasks."
aquarius,2012-10-02,"The cosmic energies are shifting again, reminding you to take action if you're dissatisfied with your most significant relationships. However, you might not have to say anything at this time. Real transformations occur within you as your desire for direct confrontation fades. You don't need to force any issues today. The river of change is flowing right on schedule."
pisces,2012-10-02,"Your level of comfort might be surprisingly high today, even if stress fades in and out all day. Although you probably have work-related obligations, it's still wise to set aside some time for yourself. Relationships may get confusing in the days ahead, requiring more time to straighten things out. Conserve your energy now so it's available later in the week when you need it."
aries,2012-10-03,"Often you know exactly what you want in love and you're ready to go for it. Now, however, your desires are not as clear. You tend to idealize your attractions today, which is a lot of fun as long as you don't try to relate them directly to reality. Too many concrete expectations could hinder your current journey. If, however, you can go with the flow, it may reward you with a very beautiful experience that has long-lasting consequences."
taurus,2012-10-03,"You may read an emotional situation incorrectly today if you aren't paying extra careful attention to what's going on. There might be some confusion with respect to your feelings about a developing relationship. However, allowing your thoughts to meander around in the realms of possibility is an enjoyable distraction that doesn't necessarily lead to satisfaction. Instead, focus on the most immediate issues in order to get the train back on the reality track."
gemini,2012-10-03,"Although you may believe that you expressed your needs clearly, others won't necessarily understand you now. Your words are easily misconstrued because you don't think it's necessary to explain the obvious. However, you can be much more convincing if you take the time to unfold your story methodically. Hold on to your dreams, but keep your feet firmly planted on the ground."
cancer,2012-10-03,"Your schedule can get messed up today because you don't allow enough time for everything that needs to be accomplished. You may not be as prepared as you prefer now because other people aren't sharing their expectations with you. Instead of muddling your way through the day in uncertainty, ask concrete questions. Your friends and associates might surprise you with their down-to-earth answers that can save your day."
leo,2012-10-03,"You feel extra close to your dreams today, but you may be living in a bubble of fantasies no matter how clearly you've been thinking. Facts are shaded by your thoughts and feelings now, and it's tricky to separate objective perceptions from subjective opinions. Thankfully, the potential for creating meaning in your life grows stronger when your intuitive visions are integrated into reality."
virgo,2012-10-03,"Normally, you excel at managing the details of a complex project and keeping them in order. However, you may be wiser to save the critical thinking for another day. Cut yourself some slack today and give yourself permission to space out, instead of trying to limit your thoughts. Your imagination is your greatest asset now; don't be afraid to use it."
libra,2012-10-03,"You're feeling a bit more introspective than usual today as your key planet Venus enters your 12th House of Privacy. If you must spend the day with others, you can still withdraw into your imagination while appearing as socially astute as ever. Balancing your previous obligations with your current need to be alone might be tricky unless you're willing to keep one foot in each world."
scorpio,2012-10-03,"You may have very particular ideas about activities you want to share with your friends now, but your work might not give you the freedom you need. You are not one to run out on your responsibilities, yet you can rearrange your schedule and finish up your work early today without negatively impacting anyone else. Following through on your word is important, but so is pursuing your dreams."
sagittarius,2012-10-03,"Conditions on the home front can be confusing, but they aren't your biggest problem now. Things are not as they appear to be and it's difficult for you to gauge the relative importance of a particular thought. Taking a simple idea and turning it into an overly complicated strategy doesn't make it any more effective. Misunderstandings that come to light in the next few days will make you glad that you strive for simplicity today."
capricorn,2012-10-03,"You could be feeling a bit confused if you cannot control your desires now, and they could pull you away from your previous commitments. There are days when you can build the road as well as travel along it. However, today is meant for exploring territories that are off the beaten track. Give yourself permission to wander around, knowing that you'll be back on the highway and heading toward your destination again in just a few days."
aquarius,2012-10-03,"You may think you know exactly what you want and how you're going to get it, but this confidence isn't what you're projecting today. People can see a gentler side of you as your hidden emotional softness slips through the cracks in the walls of your defenses. Instead of fighting it, consciously let others inside your otherwise impenetrable walls. Vulnerability is your strength now, not a weakness."
pisces,2012-10-03,"Today you might fall in love with a beautiful person, a spiritual teacher or a fleeting vision. Unfortunately, it's currently difficult to tell the difference between reality and fantasy. Nevertheless, fact and fiction can morph into a magical moment that opens your heart. Don't try to figure out what's happening now; just enjoy the experience. Untangle the threads in the tapestry of life on another day when things make more sense."
aries,2012-10-04,"Although it may be difficult to start a conversation today, the words and ideas should flow with ease once you get going. However, you won't be able to talk your way around the truth; any deviation from the facts could draw the wrath of instant karma. Don't try to outsmart reality; you can accomplish your goals as long as you maintain integrity in all that you say and do."
taurus,2012-10-04,"You don't like being pushed into anything before you are ready, yet you may feel as if someone is trying to pressure you to change your mind now. Your response is to dig in your heels and stubbornly hold your position no matter how persistent others may be today. You believe the stakes are high, prompting you to take your resistance very seriously. Nevertheless, you can overplay your hand; an adaptable attitude just might save the day."
gemini,2012-10-04,Everything is moving faster now that the Moon is back in your interactive sign. Your witty retorts are quick and you're having fun as you play fast and loose. But you may have to work the brakes or you could lose control on the curves. Don't wait until it's too late; be smart and control your speed today before you hit a wall.
cancer,2012-10-04,"A situation at home can take on larger-than-life proportions today, and you may need to jump in with the voice of reason. The good news is that the power of logic is on your side, so you know exactly what to do. Still, you might experience discomfort from the high level of mental activity and the need to reconsider decisions that you thought were already covered. Revisiting a recent conversation helps clarify your lingering confusion."
leo,2012-10-04,"Although you may appear to have a casual attitude about your friends now, you're taking yourself much more seriously than anyone realizes. Your desire to establish reliable communication channels motivates you to connect with others in a very profound manner. Make contact with someone who has been in your dreams, but not necessarily in your day-to-day life. You might be pleasantly surprised at what they have to tell you."
virgo,2012-10-04,"You have to call a situation just as you see it today because people at work are depending on you for a reality check. You didn't ask to be put in this position, nor do you want the spotlight to be aimed on you, but it is apparent that you want to take care of things on a very basic level. Nevertheless, don't be so sure that your perspective is the only one. Explaining the facts now is trickier than you realize."
libra,2012-10-04,"There are underlying tensions at work now, yet you still have opportunities to keep your life on a pretty even keel. There may be some miscommunications involving someone's interpretation of one of your ideas today. But a misunderstanding can actually bring about a conversation that leads to a breakthrough if you let go of control. A detour in a discussion could be the catalyst to positive change."
scorpio,2012-10-04,"You are receiving a direct download from the cosmos today, somewhat like a software upgrade. The recent confusion should fade soon and you might be pleasantly surprised how easily things go your way. However, you don't have time to relax now; big changes are underfoot and you're much wiser to conserve your energy any way you can."
sagittarius,2012-10-04,"A coworker or partner might come down on you hard now, but this situation isn't as serious as it first seems. In fact, there is likely a silver lining in today's dark cloud, and you'll be much better off if you can find it. No matter what you do, don't shoot the messenger. If you lash out, you can miss the opportunity to make significant changes in your thinking process."
capricorn,2012-10-04,"Today you're catching up on the emails that you didn't write all week, returning phone calls and, in general, doing a whole lot of little things you should have already done. However, you still might feel frustrated because it doesn't seem like you are making enough progress. But don't be so hard on yourself; if you work methodically, you will be just where you need to be by the end of the day."
aquarius,2012-10-04,"You may choose to put off unpleasant chores today in favor of distracting yourself with the more enjoyable tasks that are on your list of things to do. You might want to make something that allows your creativity to flow, even if it's of no practical value. Fortunately, you can probably get by now without worrying too much about tomorrow, as long as you give yourself a reality check to cover your bases first."
pisces,2012-10-04,"Complex emotions flowing in the waters of your mind can be reassuring, since you Fish are comfortable swimming in symbolic realms. Now, however, your words could wrap themselves around your feelings and tangle the nets of your own fantasies and illusions. There will be plenty of time for logic later on. Put this creative energy to work by writing poetry, doing arts and crafts, or partaking in activities that engage your spiritual nature."
aries,2012-10-05,"You may need to accept your current status in a relationship or on the job, especially if you set your goals so high that they are nearly impossible to reach. But rather than wallowing in disappointment or fear of failure, acknowledge your successes. Instead of setting a new course, shift gears and move ahead by building on the foundations you have already created. Your confidence will return as you focus on the work at hand."
taurus,2012-10-05,"Messenger Mercury and Taskmaster Saturn enter your 7th House of Relationships today, shining the spotlight on all types of relationships. Even if your life is in working order, a friend or partner might place extra demands on you now. Although your initial reaction may be to resist, keep in mind that everyone just wants to be happy. Take the high road and remain flexible to reduce the stress before it creates a problem."
gemini,2012-10-05,"Your personal agenda is top priority today with the chatty Gemini Moon in your 1st House of Personality. But instead of talking about what you want to do, create new routines that reflect your goals. Grounding your vision in concrete action is more useful now than rambling on about your plans. Dream big but don't leave success to chance."
cancer,2012-10-05,"Your need to express yourself now can get the creative juices flowing, but you must feel safe before adding your two cents to the general discussion. It's challenging to disagree with the consensus of the group if you're insecure with your current position. Having your facts in order enables you to speak with confidence. But even if you're unsure of yourself today, being true to your feelings is more important than going along with others just for the sake of peace."
leo,2012-10-05,"You have been running to keep up and you might not want to slow down long enough to acknowledge that summer's really over. However, once you put your unfulfilled expectations aside, you should feel better about your life. Nevertheless, it's difficult to balance your role as a fearless leader with your current desire for emotional security. Acknowledge your limitations; a realistic approach is better now than aiming for unreachable goals."
virgo,2012-10-05,"You are more susceptible to other people's claims now, even if their statements aren't based on reality. You believe that your reality filters are working fine because your logic is intact. However, it's challenging to separate your perceptions from your dreams today, even if you think you're using common sense. Fortunately, seeing the world through rose-colored glasses also allows you to entertain the possibilities that others may miss."
libra,2012-10-05,"You should be very proud of yourself for exercising patience today because cooling down your emotions prevents you from doing something you might later regret. However, you're not willing to just let go of a significant goal now, especially if you are dealing with complex financial issues. Untangle the intertwined threads before trying to figure out your next step."
scorpio,2012-10-05,"Serious issues are on your mind now that somber Saturn is back in your sign for the first time in nearly thirty years. You must hit the cosmic reset button and let go of those things you no longer need. Reconsidering your goals makes sense because logical Mercury also slips into no-nonsense Scorpio, but your thoughts don't easily translate into direct action. Everything is accompanied by an undertow of hidden emotions, so take your time and consider all your options carefully before picking one."
sagittarius,2012-10-05,"Others see you as naturally outgoing and able to express yourself with great ease. But today your tall tales and long stories can be a smokescreen that makes you appear forthcoming while you're actually hiding your true feelings. Don't let anyone cajole you into revealing more than you choose. Remember, doing what your friends expect is less important now than recognizing your own personal limits and standing by them."
capricorn,2012-10-05,"You aren't interested in what others have to say about your work style today and you may quickly get bored if they aren't willing to support their opinions with real assistance. A cohort's good idea can help you, but you reach a place now where you realize that talk isn't enough. Tell those closest to you exactly what you need, even if you don't expect satisfaction. Someone might pleasantly surprise you later on."
aquarius,2012-10-05,"You might be carried away with your feelings today, making them public prior to considering the consequences of your emotional disclosure. There's nothing wrong with sharing your inner process in a professional context when appropriate; it's just that you can't take back what you say once it's out there. Saying fewer words today is better than sharing too much."
pisces,2012-10-05,"You're confident that your current direction is consistent with your goals, yet others may disagree with your plans anyway. Being criticized is never fun, but today it's even more challenging because you believe that you're being misunderstood. However, don't waste energy responding to anyone else's negativity. If you work hard to achieve your goals, your positive results will justify your choices."
aries,2012-10-06,"In these uncertain times you now have a chance to feel certain. You are on the edge of a new endeavor and your key planet Mars is standing by ready to help you achieve your goals. However, the universe needs to know where you want to go before it can give you the necessary support. The best way to state your case is not necessarily by saying anything. Actions speak louder than words."
taurus,2012-10-06,"An unexpected twist in a relationship may have recently impacted the stability of your love life. Nevertheless, your common sense brings a new level of integrity into a partnership. But this opportunity for steady growth extends beyond romance, possibly involving a coworker or friend. On a pragmatic level, be sure to protect your personal assets and your position at work because your dreams can take flight if you keep your feet on solid ground."
gemini,2012-10-06,"You can see yourself in a variety of situations, but you need to stop and check your bearings today. Slowing down may be challenging if you are scared of making a choice that could limit your independence. Nevertheless, find a quiet place to think about what is most important to your success and then act on it. You might be pleasantly surprised how easy it is to eliminate the extraneous noise in your life at this time."
cancer,2012-10-06,"You are feeling very protective of your loved ones and may be fearful that you could lose control of the situation today.

Consider all your options carefully; trusting your intuition enables you to stabilize a crisis before it becomes critical. If you act with certainty, your choices can have lasting impact."
leo,2012-10-06,"The storms have temporarily subsided, allowing you to finally relax. Nevertheless, it's crucial to keep your eyes wide open today so you can make the most of your recent experiences. The radical ideas that crossed your mind during the past couple of weeks now need to be executed with careful conservation of energy to maximize your potential for success."
virgo,2012-10-06,"This can be a confusing time because your ability to stabilize your life is countered by temporary blind optimism, tempting you to overlook potential problems. Nevertheless, your management skills will see you through today if you don't overextend your resources. Planting your feet firmly on the ground helps you gain traction as you move through the obstacle course. Proceeding with caution increases your chances of reaching your destination on time."
libra,2012-10-06,"Jumping to quick conclusions today might land you in a heap of trouble. If someone presents you with an idea that seems too good to be true, listen to the whole story before making your judgment. At first you may think that the plan is crazy, but look for the foundation upon which a solid strategy can be built. Staying open to unexplored possibilities inspires you to turn a dream into something tangible as long as you use common sense as your final filter."
scorpio,2012-10-06,"Complex issues concerning your career objectives may cause conflict with personal responsibilities at home. However, acquiring more emotional security requires you to give up some of your precious independence. Don't be afraid of being perceived as very serious because you might need to assume an authoritative role to set things right. Creating balance in your life isn't easy, but you already have all the tools at your disposal to make it happen."
sagittarius,2012-10-06,"You have run after your share of unicorns, seeking their elusive magic, yet you grow tired of being disappointed now. Nevertheless, you are standing at a crossroads today and you must make something happen, since this isn't simply about manifesting your next possible adventure. Choose cautiously and wisely. Although change is in the air, nothing will transform unless you set realistic goals, formulate concrete plans and commit to doing the work that follows."
capricorn,2012-10-06,Today you might feel as if you're assigned to cleanup duty after a wild party. Everyone has gone home and there's quite a lot to do. You might even question whether or not the fun was worth it. Take advantage of jovial Jupiter's presence your 6th House of Daily Routine by applying your skills to the job at hand while whistling while you work. Finding a way to turn your chores into fun is a creative way to get the job done.
aquarius,2012-10-06,"Revolutionary Uranus has been operating in high gear recently with its unconventional brilliance stimulating original and unusual ideas. However, the practicality of your other key planet Saturn comes into the picture now, and you are likely to see things in a more realistic light. Sometimes it is challenging to integrate the suddenness of Uranus' effect, but today you can make radical changes that have enduring consequences."
pisces,2012-10-06,"You are usually capable of swimming with the currents, however deep they flow. Permanent redirection isn't easy since you intuitively understand that tides rise and fall over and over again. Nevertheless, you have a special opportunity to initiate action that adds real stability to your life. Don't try to do too much all at once, because it's the smallest improvements now that will have the greatest impact."
aries,2012-10-07,"You may grow bewildered today as you become aware of the widening gulf between your diplomatic intentions and your unspoken desires. If you're not super-confident now, don't take yourself so seriously. You can still learn plenty about your emotional nature if you don't push your feelings back into the shadows. Instead, embrace your uncertainty by bringing it right out into the open. Your true friends will rally to your support if they know you need help."
taurus,2012-10-07,"Initiating direct action may feel awkward today since your goals seem to be up in the air. You are at your best when you know exactly where you are going, but now your direction is a bit foggy. Instead of trying to gain clarity about your long-term plans, just deal with the most pressing issues in the present moment. If you can manage your current situation with grace and humor, the future will fall into place on its own."
gemini,2012-10-07,"The pace of your life slows down now, giving you time to reflect on the hectic energy of the past few weeks. But processing your feelings isn't easy because your moods keep changing throughout the day. You have moments of interacting with others when you feel bubbly, but then you may slip into confusing self-doubt. Don't resist the rise and fall of your emotions because your heart has lessons to teach you today if you're willing to listen."
cancer,2012-10-07,"Cosmic relief is already on the way now that the Moon is back in your sign. However, it may still take some time for the changes to play out. You might feel as if domestic obligations are preventing you from doing as you wish today, tempting you to blame someone else for your frustrations. Take full responsibility for your own actions, instead. Once you finish your chores, find interesting activities close to home so you can do what you want and still be with those you love."
leo,2012-10-07,"Although you might be feeling comfortable with your own feelings, it's other people that seem to be the problem today. Losing yourself in a romantic fantasy is your preferred escape route now, but daydreaming won't change the source of your concerns. Instead of hiding your emotions, try talking about them with someone you trust. There's no need to get everything out in the open all at once; take your time and let the discussion unfold naturally."
virgo,2012-10-07,"You are usually quite skilled at fine-tuning the adjustment knob on your own reality, but it's difficult to keep the most important things in focus now. It might even feel like someone else has taken control of your dials. Although it's hard to know today what's real and what's not, you tend to keep trying to figure it all out. However, once you stop the endless analysis, your imagination will reveal what your logic cannot."
libra,2012-10-07,"Conflicts in your family or community continue to make demands on you for the next few days. You usually do nearly anything that's required, but there may be more personal sacrifice needed than you're willing to make now. There aren't any quick and easy fixes today, so sink deeply into your feelings and make the most important decisions directly from your heart."
scorpio,2012-10-07,"A new wave of unexpressed feelings washes through your awareness today, bringing uncertainty to your current decisions. Although you probably have time now to be at home and reconnect with your family, there is still a major balancing act going on between fulfilling responsibilities and relaxing with loved ones. The immediate stresses may ease soon, but this improvement doesn't remove the necessity to deal with the underlying long-term dilemma of work versus play."
sagittarius,2012-10-07,"You could become somewhat uneasy today with the Moon's presence in your 8th House of Intimacy, increasing the volume of your feelings as they grow wider and deeper. This emotional emphasis might normally go unnoticed, but now it's combined with your current confusion. One solution is to think of your experiences in the intense shadows as an exciting journey into the unknown. This way you won't be so resistant to the transformational work on your plate."
capricorn,2012-10-07,"It might seem as if someone is getting in your way today, but this feeling isn't necessarily based in reality. Reality is tricking your mind now as surreal Neptune, the master of illusions, pulls you off course. But you're the one who is blocking your own vision, so there's no need to be frustrated with others. Look within for your answers. Question authority, especially if it's you."
aquarius,2012-10-07,"Pay attention to everything that happens today, for you could be holding on to old habits that no longer serve you well. Resistance is created by your unwillingness to change, even when it's a good idea. Follow your instincts now, even if you are afraid to trust your irrational feelings. Although you might not know exactly where you're going, listening to your heart is a good place to start."
pisces,2012-10-07,"Familiar feelings rise up from within your subconscious today. Your imagination is on overdrive now because action-hero Mars squares your key planet, spiritual Neptune. Remember, just because your emotions come into awareness as fantasies, they are not any less important. However, it doesn't mean that they are real enough to justify action. Check out your intuitive hunches before you make your next move."
aries,2012-10-08,"You're in a tough position now because you know what you want but cannot have it at this time. You might be willing to accept temporary defeat, but you aren't clear why your desires are being thwarted. Don't waste your time feeling discouraged today. Just visualize your life as you hope it will be in the future. Then, move on because success at your next endeavor is waiting for you."
taurus,2012-10-08,"You may feel rather tender toward a coworker, partner or friend. You might even want to express your feelings, but the current situation doesn't necessarily allow for this level of intimacy. However, anxiety could surface if there isn't a way to connect what's going on in your heart with whatever is happening in the real world. Nevertheless, accepting a low level of tension today can ease the pressure and make everything seem more palatable."
gemini,2012-10-08,"Important issues demand your attention today, especially in relationships at work. Perhaps you're trying to hold on to a point of view, yet conditions are forcing you to let go of it. Or maybe it's just that you feel that others are trying to exert subtle control over you. It's not yet the right time to fight back. You will know when to be more assertive since the solution should be obvious once it appears."
cancer,2012-10-08,"You're holding back your emotions, even if you are talking to someone you trust. Others may think you are a team player and that you are willing to change your mind for the good of the relationship. However, nothing is as simple as it appears today. Someone could be reading your motives incorrectly, even though you're merely trying to avoid a power struggle. Don't try to keep your real feelings hidden. They're going to come out into the open sooner or later anyhow."
leo,2012-10-08,"You may be feeling optimistic about the days ahead, yet something still isn't quite right in the present moment. The good news is that you're able to talk about your concerns. However, others might not understand the subtleties of your thought process. Don't push your ideas on to anyone else. It's best to keep some things quiet for a few more days."
virgo,2012-10-08,"Your curiosity may get the best of you today, because you truly want to understand whatever isn't obvious. You can usually wade through the incoming information, sift out the noise and then act on the best of what you learn. However, something might be amiss now; the more details you acquire the murkier the situation seems. Wait a day or two and the circumstances will change enough for the paradox to disappear."
libra,2012-10-08,"Your key planet Venus is now moving through your 12th House of Spirituality and Dreams. But you may feel high-strung nervous energy that doesn't let you fully relax. You could nurture your senses without shutting them down by going outside for a walk in nature, getting a massage or listening to your favorite music. Do something special that calms your nerves and feeds your soul."
scorpio,2012-10-08,"You may be experiencing very strong desires today, even by your extreme Scorpio standards. You probably think that you would be better served by keeping your feelings to yourself. However, you can talk yourself into sharing them now in the hopes of receiving immediate gratification. Don't rush the process; you are better off waiting for a more opportune time to express what's in your heart."
sagittarius,2012-10-08,"On the surface everything seems fine between you and your friends, but there may be hidden tension that you don't want to address today. Perhaps you're uncomfortable about something you want to do now, especially if you think you'll be judged by others. However, there's no reason to be overly concerned because this is a great time to explore the possibilities of your next adventure. You might be pleasantly surprised when you receive more support than you expect."
capricorn,2012-10-08,"Work continues to be demanding, and now someone throws you a curve ball that you may not be able to catch. If you have to deal with other people's feelings, look back over the past couple of days for clues as to how you should respond. Try to find a balance between only seeing things your way and compassionately accepting alternative perspectives. Remaining open to new ideas greatly improves your chances of finding true satisfaction."
aquarius,2012-10-08,"You might not accomplish a lot today, but you have a sneaking suspicion that you can get enough done at home to squeak by. Unfortunately, you could feel tired now and you cannot figure out the reason why. Although you may be required to show up for work, take each chore as it comes. Finding time between tasks to replenish your energy helps you to be much more effective tomorrow."
pisces,2012-10-08,"You're feeling a bit confused today, especially if a friend or partner is overly critical of your behavior. Your enthusiasm only exacerbates the stress, making it more difficult to express your emotions. Even demonstrating your love can be tricky now because your actions are easily misunderstood. Stay positive, for this is just a temporary phase. Strive to keep your intentions clear and all should turn out for the best."
aries,2012-10-09,"Your unbridled enthusiasm takes you to new heights as your optimism soars. Look carefully at whatever is going on to ascertain that you're not just avoiding underlying tensions that you can't shake. You won't likely succeed if you totally ignore what's real, but then again your positive attitude can probably overcome much of the negativity by your intentions alone."
taurus,2012-10-09,"You may be pulled in two directions today as you struggle to stay on a comfortable middle path. On one hand, you have responsibilities that must be addressed, even if you prefer to let them slide. On the other hand, you're displaying a smile because you realize that your life is easier these days than it has been for a while. Keep your attention on the brighter side of life, without going into denial about your chores. Taking care of business is a pleasure compared to the alternatives."
gemini,2012-10-09,"Cautious optimism is your mantra today as you delve into a perplexing puzzle. You feel as if you're making real progress on specific tasks, but you are still concerned about the whole picture. Even if you can avoid the rigors of detail now, don't let yourself waste time in idle daydreams. Put what you've learned to good use since practicality will pay off quicker than you expect."
cancer,2012-10-09,"You may seem more cheerful and positive today, yet you still have a serious tone to all that you do. You understand what's happening so well now that others might just think you are lucky. Contrary to everyone else's perceptions, your current success is not accidental; you have earned the rewards you're now receiving. Aim high and hold your present course no matter what you run into on your journey."
leo,2012-10-09,"Waves of positive energy are washing into your life today, allowing you to perform at your best. However, you may appear overly dramatic now that the Moon is back in your outgoing sign. Others might not appreciate your exuberance and you could overwhelm them with your direct approach. Try to be considerate of their feelings, but don't let that stop you from realizing your potential. Whatever you begin now can bear fruit in the weeks ahead."
virgo,2012-10-09,"Trust the validity of your thoughts now, even if self-doubt creeps into the picture. However, keep in mind that the current Jupiter transit encourages you to make sweeping generalizations that could lead to trouble unless you tone down your rhetoric. Fortunately, today's decisions should prove to be good ones in the long run as long as you make choices that uphold your values."
libra,2012-10-09,"You have good intentions to create something today that others will appreciate, but you still might have a problem keeping yourself motivated. Your enthusiasm encourages your visions and widens your perspectives. However, too much confidence encourages you to become complacent, even lazy. You can see the larger patterns in your life now, but it's up to you to turn this awareness into action."
scorpio,2012-10-09,"You are quite comfortable with the high level of emotional intensity now, even if today's Venus-Pluto trine traps you between a rock and a dark place. However, your current philosophical outlook on life enables you to pull yourself up by your own bootstraps into new realms of positive thinking. There's no need to resist the changes as you are lifted out of the shadows and into the bright light of the Sun. Follow your feelings because they are leading you to a better place."
sagittarius,2012-10-09,"There isn't much you need to do today except enjoy the effects of jovial Jupiter's wonderfully harmonious boost from the Sun. And although this is one of the most positive aspects possible, you could forget about an important obligation if you become swept up in good feelings. Nevertheless, your cheerful attitude has lasting impact on the current circumstances of your life. Initiate the changes that make the most sense since the planets indicate success through intelligent action."
capricorn,2012-10-09,It's easy to find balance now between working hard and enjoying the rewards that come your way. You might not want to exert yourself too much -- and you could likely get by just coasting through the day. Consider that whatever you do or don't do will have very powerful consequences. Today is an opportune time to begin a new project or to alter your current direction. Be courageous and follow your bliss.
aquarius,2012-10-09,"You're feeling magnanimous today and your open heart can teach others special lessons about life. If you remain receptive, you could gain a new perspective about relationships. A change in attitude opens your horizons, but success does not happen on its own. You need to do your part; be fearless and take bold action. Your enthusiasm assures the opposite of Murphy's Law. If anything can go right, it will."
pisces,2012-10-09,"Be ready to welcome a supportive ally that comes into your life today. Although your relationship with this person isn't necessarily romantic, it's surely possible. Prepare yourself to learn and grow. Additionally, travel could be on your mind now, whether it's in the outer world or in your own mind. Make sure your passport is current, and be open to having a companion for your upcoming adventures."
aries,2012-10-10,"You are on the go again with the Moon back in a fellow fire sign, but something is different today. Instead of just barging ahead, you're combining the best from two worlds now. On one hand, you have a sense of the fundamental integrity of the outer world. On the other hand, your imagination is fully supporting your actions. Being creative isn't just about expressing yourself in new ways; it's about making your dreams come true."
taurus,2012-10-10,"Others sound more serious than you prefer today and their criticism of your plans might feel over the top. However, it's wise to remain open to any feedback you receive now because it could contain enough truth to improve your performance. Instead of putting up unnecessary defenses, push past your old limitations and recognize that nearly anything is possible if you put your mind to it."
gemini,2012-10-10,"Some of the more pressing issues in your life have probably eased up a little by now. And although the circumstances have not likely changed much, your new-and-improved attitude makes all the difference in the world. As long as you haven't picked a path of escapism or denial, you can deepen your sense of spirituality as you encounter big changes at home and on the job. Don't worry if you're flying by the seat of your pants; your plans will continue to solidify over the weeks ahead."
cancer,2012-10-10,"You might find yourself in the spotlight today, whether or not you asked for it. Thankfully, you have a powerful ally who may ride to the rescue now. Although, the present helpers who have come into your life are quite real, they could be from another dimension or a parallel universe. But even if they are mysteriously otherworldly, gratefully accept the good vibrations that surround you at this time."
leo,2012-10-10,"This is an exciting week and you feel as if you're in the swing of things. You aren't quite sure exactly how today will unfold, but it starts off like a day at the races with you charging ahead. Just be aware that your friends and associates expect a lot from you now, yet they might lose faith in you if you exaggerate your story. Everyone will take you more seriously if you cut to the chase. Tell it like it is; there's no need to paint a picture that is different from reality."
virgo,2012-10-10,"You hold more power than you realize today. Other peoples' feelings can easily influence you now, making you less sure of your own position. It requires real practice to keep your heart wide open while at the very same time concentrating your energy on the work that must be done. Give it your best and you'll soon be feeling victorious, while also gaining respect from others."
libra,2012-10-10,"You may feel a bit feistier than usual, not that you want to pick a fight or anything. It's just that you know what you want and are willing to do what's necessary to make things work. Don't get caught up in someone else's big ideas because you don't need that kind of inflationary distraction. Maintaining singular focus enables you to accomplish more than you thought possible."
scorpio,2012-10-10,"You are standing at a crossroads and have big choices to make today, even if you think you can put them off for another day. You might feel like you could really use some peace and quiet, but you probably won't find it now. Instead of trying to escape from your responsibilities by fantasizing about a perfect future, concentrate on finding the most practical path that leads to your dreams."
sagittarius,2012-10-10,"You can be emotionally productive today, but remember that you are under the dispersive influence of Neptune. Fortunately, the slower pace should allow you time to address complex relationship issues in a proactive manner. You have had your share of fun recently; now, regardless of your social inclinations, it's time to get back to the tasks at hand. Keep in mind that working with someone else helps to turn your chores into a more enjoyable activity."
capricorn,2012-10-10,"You may be feeling like you're at the peak of your power cycle now so you would be well served by concentrating your mental acuity on work-related tasks. Even though you might be overly concerned about your future, you can benefit from also considering the needs of others and supporting their interests. Remember, you are not separate from those in your community; you further your own cause as you help your brothers and sisters."
aquarius,2012-10-10,"Say exactly what you mean today. But, think twice before speaking so you also mean what you say. Your friends and associates see you as the creative one now, yet you're probably much more practical and rational than they realize. Pare back your ambitions to what's most realistic and limit your activities to those that advance your progress. Your inventive style works to your benefit as long as you don't get carried away with your own big ideas."
pisces,2012-10-10,"Focus on trusting your common sense because the next few weeks will require you to show up with your feet on the ground, even if your head is floating in the clouds. However, unfinished business can prevent you from reaching your goals. Complete the projects in front of you because gaining closure now ensures that your actions have positive and enduring effects."
aries,2012-10-11,"There's not much of an opportunity to rest today if you left too many tasks undone. Don't be overly concerned; just get busy with your chores. Even if you don't have any pressing obligations, you might still be too serious to enjoy yourself. Keep in mind that you will have plenty of time to play later on. The sooner you get started with what's on your plate, the more likely you are to finish."
taurus,2012-10-11,"Although you're very methodical in seeking pleasure now, you may need to wait until later to get what you want. It helps to set a goal early in the day and then doggedly pursue your destination. Even if others think that you would be happier doing something else, you can still derive sweet satisfaction from staying focused on what you consider most important."
gemini,2012-10-11,"Life shouldn't be so difficult, but you cannot avoid feeling annoyed if you're blocked from pursuing your dreams today. Your natural tendency is to scatter your ideas like Johnny Appleseed; however, it's more effective now to keep them to yourself until you know you have found the most fertile ground. Then, take your time to share your thoughts in detail and carefully nurture them until they reach fruition."
cancer,2012-10-11,"You could be overly protective of those you love as you attempt to balance your concerns with their needs. You might not even notice that you have overstepped your role. Although you want to initiate action for someone else's benefit, consider that your interference may not be in their interest. Sometimes a temporary setback or emotional hurt is the best teacher. Ease up on the reins and let others take more responsibility for themselves."
leo,2012-10-11,"Your life may already be in flux because a significant cycle is reaching a turning point. You want to narrow your focus now but you're receiving mixed signals from the cosmos. Instead of fearfully closing down your mind, think about whatever makes you happy. You don't have to do anything about your fantasies today if you commit to executing your new plan tomorrow."
virgo,2012-10-11,"Your anticipation level is high, but you may not be confident enough to fully trust your impulses today. Instead of taking a risk, play it more conservatively for now. After all, you aren't interested in an easy come, easy go solution. Demonstrate your wisdom by building on your previous accomplishments while still progressing on your long-term goals."
libra,2012-10-11,"Although you're eager to balance work and play, enjoying yourself can be challenging today until you complete your unfinished business. Free-floating anxiety may plague you now, especially if you know that you are running out of time. Fortunately, this impending deadline is more flexible than you think, so don't waste your energy panicking; just continue doing the best you can."
scorpio,2012-10-11,"Your friends may be making too many demands on your time these days. They might not think twice before asking you for what they want, even if their neediness poses an inconvenience. It's hard to tell if they are aware of the impact of their behavior. However, your loyalty is so strong that if a close friend requests your help, you will be there. Keep in mind that setting healthy boundaries won't detract from supporting those you love."
sagittarius,2012-10-11,"You're more concerned now about what others think, prompting you to do what is right in the social sphere today.  However, you're not insecure with your judgment if it differs from the crowd. It's just that you really want to be a team player and will sacrifice some of your needs for the good of the family, group, or community. Good intentions bring positive results."
capricorn,2012-10-11,"You may be a bit ornery today, especially if an acquaintance is pushing your buttons. You're short on patience, especially when it comes to situations that aren't your immediate concern. You're not willing to waste your time on trivial matters just because someone else does. But don't be too harsh when judging others; paying attention to social etiquette now will serve you well."
aquarius,2012-10-11,"You are ready to jump to conclusions now, unless you consciously slow down your mental process. But there's a trick to making this work; you don't have to change the speed of your thinking. Instead, just increase the time between a thought and the moment you respond. You'll be surprised at the difference you can make if you just count to ten before saying anything."
pisces,2012-10-11,"Someone might obstinately stand in the way of your satisfaction today as the Virgo Moon in your 7th House of Partners squares feisty Mars. Instead of glossing over a potential problem, find the courage to talk about it in a nonthreatening manner. Nearly any complex issue is easier to resolve once you commit to handle it together, but it takes two willing participants to make a relationship work."
aries,2012-10-12,"It might not matter if you make a list of everything you want to do today because someone else's agenda is likely to throw you off course. Although you know better and try to stick to the tasks at hand, the dreams of a friend or co-worker may speak louder than your responsibilities. However, doing anything that gets you closer to finishing your day's work is your smartest course of action. A little progress is better than none."
taurus,2012-10-12,"You may be more interested in play than work today because your impulse is to forget about your responsibilities. Unfortunately, others will remind you of your obligations, so you can't spend the entire day building castles in the sandbox. However, you still should be able to enjoy yourself no matter what you do, even if you wish that you were doing something else."
gemini,2012-10-12,"You might want to start your weekend early even though you're still on the job. You really do need some time to recuperate because you have been  working so hard lately. You could be thinking about your feelings, issues at home or memories from your past. You may even consider taking the afternoon off if you can't keep your mind from drifting to personal issues. Nevertheless, it's wiser to fulfill your promises before making your great escape."
cancer,2012-10-12,"It may feel as if you're lingering in a dream state and time is slowing down. It could even seem as if progress is coming to a standstill. However, this is just a temporary illusion and, fortunately, the planets continue to move around on schedule, even if you're not getting anywhere fast. Fine tune your plans now while there's still time; your current efforts will pay off in the near future."
leo,2012-10-12,"If you're feeling pressure to make improvements at home, consider your financial condition before you start spending money. It's not that you're overly extravagant, but you might be inclined to buy whatever you think you deserve, regardless of the cost. Watch your cash flow carefully now or your domestic project could jeopardize your short-term stability."
virgo,2012-10-12,"You may be stuck in an odd situation. On one hand you're emotionally available now, willing to share your feelings with those closest to you. On the other hand, your actions say one thing while your words reveal something else. Avoid overreacting to defend yourself, since you might not be seeing things clearly today. Your perspective  will straighten out, but it may take a few days before you know what's really happening."
libra,2012-10-12,"Your hidden agenda or someone else's secret can have a strong impact on the dynamics of what's going on now. Unfortunately, it may be quite a challenge for you to put it all together and to make sense of the current situation. After all, significant information is obscured, and until the facts come out, you're playing along without really knowing the rules of the game."
scorpio,2012-10-12,"You might be very picky about whom you socialize with now, but your circle of friends is still a significant part of your world. You may withdraw from a group today as you attempt to create much-needed boundaries. But don't retreat too quickly even if it currently sounds like it will just be extra noise. Luckily, you're in a position to receive intangible benefits from just hanging out with your peers."
sagittarius,2012-10-12,"Your career is in the spotlight now as you perform tasks that create an environment which is emotionally safer for you and your coworkers. If you are not currently employed, contemplate your role in the outer world. Think about the obstacles that may be in the way of your success, but keep in mind that the resistance is as much within you as it is out there. Acknowledging your fears is the first step to overcoming them."
capricorn,2012-10-12,"You continue to do your job as required, but today you might not be so sure why you try so hard. You are less concerned with your day-to-day responsibilities and more interested in long range planning. Still, problems may arise if you're not paying attention to your current obligations. Don't let anyone else talk you into skipping out on your job. A lazy day could cost you more than you realize."
aquarius,2012-10-12,"You may be drawn into a mystery today and it might interfere with your productivity. Your responsibilities could suffer if you become fascinated with a spiritual philosophy,  metaphysical topic or any new idea. However, you can glide your way through the unfolding circumstances as long as you maintain clarity about your priorities."
pisces,2012-10-12,"A co-worker or a friend might come to you with a problem today and present it as if it were yours alone to solve. This could stir up issues of anger or resentment, making it difficult to bring your feelings out into the open. Alternatively, it may be someone else who is frustrated with you for what you say. Thankfully, a current conflict will likely resolve if you remain compassionate, even if there seems to be no immediate solution."
aries,2012-10-13,"Start your work early in the day so it won't interfere with any opportunities for pleasure that come your way later on. Even if you run into unexpected detours, follow your original plan as best you can. Thankfully, by the time evening rolls around, you should be able to take it easy and enjoy the company of others."
taurus,2012-10-13,"You are quite clear about what you need today, but you must be careful about how you express yourself if you want to avoid an embarrassing situation. Instead of making social decisions on the fly, plan a romantic liaison in advance. If you don't have a date, set up an evening out where you have an opportunity to meet interesting people. Take a chance and make a new connection without worrying about where it may lead."
gemini,2012-10-13,"It's never easy to sit still when your mind is somewhere else. You might find it exceptionally hard to concentrate today as your thoughts buzz around like a fly. Add some variety to your day instead of working on one big project. This is a great day for brainstorming, so let your ideas roam freely without trying to connect them into a coherent plan. It's fun sharing your dreams with a friend now, especially if you don't have to put them into action."
cancer,2012-10-13,"You have all the right words to express yourself today. Revealing your inner life isn't normally easy for you, so be sure to talk with a trusted friend or write about your thoughts before the day is done. Additionally, a combination of clarity and compassion makes you a valuable counselor now to a pal in need. Find a private place where you both can speak freely and cherish the camaraderie that you share."
leo,2012-10-13,"You may be primed for an argument today, so make sure a cause is worthy of your commitment before you make any ultimatums. An unnecessary conflict could erupt if you can't find an appropriate outlet for your excess energy. Physical activity is a useful way to dissipate some of your stress. Avoid going overboard and pushing your views too far by finding a healthy outlet for your feelings."
virgo,2012-10-13,"You may be moving so fast today that you make an uncharacteristic mistake. Before you arbitrarily head off in a new direction, be certain that everyone else knows where you're going. It's challenging to slow down when your speedy mind is on the run. Look twice now before leaping so don't lead others astray."
libra,2012-10-13,"You need a bit of quiet time now to step back and take a long-term view of your current circumstances. Although you may feel tempted to rush into a situation, it's smarter to temper your impulses for the time being. Think it over before you jump in to help out an acquaintance, because the story that motivates you might not be completely accurate. Double-check all facts first so you don't choose the wrong course of action."
scorpio,2012-10-13,"Pushing beyond your normal limits today enables you to reach new levels of efficiency and power. However, it's crucial to keep your emotions in check now so that you channel your intensity effectively. Don't be baited by someone whose offhand remarks get on your nerves. Maintain a sense of humor and you can make progress while balancing your important work with a playful spirit."
sagittarius,2012-10-13,"Your competitive juices are flowing today, and you  may unintentionally overpower others while having a good time. However, it's wiser to contain your joyful enthusiasm so you don't rub someone the wrong way. Demonstrate your leadership skills by moderating your tone. Fighting with those in power might be exhilarating in the moment, but it's really not the smartest way to get ahead."
capricorn,2012-10-13,"You have the capacity to commit yourself completely once you have your mind set on a goal. Oftentimes, someone else can motivate you, especially if you respect the person. However, you might resent the pressure you're feeling today because you don't trust the source. Instead of mumbling under your breath, face this individual and express your thoughts calmly. Once everything is on the table, you can return to your previous agenda with a clear conscience."
aquarius,2012-10-13,Your innovative approach to a problem can help resolve a complex situation today. Your mind is zipping all over the place now that logical Mercury is activating your key planet Uranus. Your unique perspective untangles mental knots and finds solutions where others cannot. Don't be afraid of a wild idea; it's okay if you miss the target once in a while. Just keep shooting out those concepts and one of them might end up being right on the mark.
pisces,2012-10-13,"You might receive assistance from an unexpected source today, but you still need to do your part by describing what you need as precisely as possible. Don't complain; there's no payoff in feeling sorry for yourself. Just give a simple explanation of your situation and ask for the help you desire. If you can stay open and listen to the advice you receive in return, you might learn something that is well worth your effort."
aries,2012-10-14,"It could be difficult to trust those who are being very accommodating to you today because you wonder what they want in return. However, your suspicion says more about you than it does about anyone else now. Don't let your unexpressed feelings get in the way of a friendship. If you're worried that accepting help might limit your freedom, it's best to get your fears out in the open. Initiating an honest dialogue may be enough to set things right."
taurus,2012-10-14,"It's frustrating if your anticipated day of relaxation turns into a string of surprising events. Fortunately, all the excitement can be quite stimulating, but it's challenging to let go of your expectations. Trying to regain control of your day could be a losing cause; instead, be as adaptable as possible. Your flexibility just might turn things around and ultimately bring you what you wanted in the first place."
gemini,2012-10-14,You have a lot of creative ideas today and you may be eager to turn them into reality. But your day could start on a difficult note as your agenda clashes with someone else's. Don't just bury your feelings and pretend that everything is fine. Abandoning on your projects before they get off the ground only adds to the unspoken stress. It doesn't have to be one hundred percent your way. Your willingness to negotiate is crucial to everyone's happiness now.
cancer,2012-10-14,"You won't be able to escape the intensity of someone else's demands today, even if you would prefer that everyone just left you alone. Unfortunately, isolating yourself from others isn't your true intent anyhow. Your real desire is to know that you have the freedom to retreat when you want the time and space to recharge your emotional batteries. Setting clear boundaries early in the day may require extra effort, but it is what's needed to keep the peace later on."
leo,2012-10-14,"You want to keep your options open today, which can create problems if someone else chooses to make plans. It's not that you have something better to do; it's just that you prefer to reserve the right to change your mind at the very last minute -- even on a whim. There's nothing wrong with being in control of your own destiny as long as you're willing to pay the price. Don't expect others to bend for you if you're not willing to do the same in return."
virgo,2012-10-14,"You may be ambiguous about making a purchase today that you have been considering for a while. Even if you thought the decision was already made, now you're not so sure. Continue to weigh the pros and cons, and remain open to new information that will help you in making your final choice. There's no need to push harder; you'll know what to do sooner than you think."
libra,2012-10-14,"You cannot control the behavior of others, but you might wish that you could today. Unfortunately, a close friend or partner may do something that's totally out of character -- at least to your way of thinking. Don't be so judgmental; instead take the time to understand your reaction. This is a chance to explore your own insecurities or fears rather than just assuming someone else is wrong."
scorpio,2012-10-14,"You might appear to be annoyed with a close friend today, but you're much more forgiving than you seem. Even if your feelings are hurt, you can still see both sides of the issue. Your memories are flooding into awareness and it's difficult to separate the past from the present. Don't dwell on your personal history; the tension will settle down if you keep bringing your attention back to the here and now."
sagittarius,2012-10-14,"Although your morning might get off to a rough start today, your confidence builds as you become more accepting of your emotions. By the end of the day you could be so sure of yourself that you're ready to take a risk for the sake of expressing your freedom. You have already waited a long time, but don't initiate action too soon. Tomorrow will be here before you know it."
capricorn,2012-10-14,"It may be a day of rest for many people, but you're probably looking forward to reaching your goals next week with great anticipation. Thankfully, you can make the most of your current ambitions with proper preparation today. However, your intense drive to succeed doesn't come without a cost. Moderate your need to get ahead by expressing a softer and more vulnerable side at home. Save your cool and calculating attitude for when you need it most."
aquarius,2012-10-14,It's challenging to handle your responsibilities when you're also looking to have a good time. But there's no need to take your serious demeanor too far; you can meet your obligations while still finding time for fun activities with your friends or family. Steer clear of extreme reactions that require absolutes. The world is not black or white; it's countless shades of gray.
pisces,2012-10-14,"You might grow frustrated if you try to please someone today because your values don't necessarily conform to the norm. Although you want to cooperate with others, it's not a good idea to compromise your integrity by saying yes when you really mean no. Being compassionate deepens your spiritual nature, but that doesn't mean you should assume responsibility for everyone else's happiness."
aries,2012-10-15,"You are ready to let loose now that feisty Mars is trine irrepressible Uranus. Fortunately, the Libra New Moon falls in your 7th House of Partnerships, increasing the likelihood of receiving support for your impetuous behavior. However, you could end up frustrated if you believe that you can escape your obligations. Nevertheless, finding ways to express yourself without going to extremes may bring the satisfaction you are seeking."
taurus,2012-10-15,"Someone may present you with a complicated situation at work that eludes resolution. Thankfully, the fair-minded Libra New Moon activates your 6th House of Employment, enabling you to emotionally detach yourself from the unresolved problem. Although you can't fix it, you can't set it aside either. You can help most by just listening to your friends. Showing compassion by lending a sympathetic ear now might be more important than offering a quick answer."
gemini,2012-10-15,"It's typically not easy for you to handle your own feelings; it's even more challenging when you must deal with someone else's erratic emotions. Fortunately, you can skate over this bumpy territory by maintaining a playful attitude with today's Libra New Moon's presence in your 5th House of Fun and Games. But stress won't drop out of sight just because it's inconvenient for you. A more radical strategy is your best bet now; face the issue head-on as objectively as possible."
cancer,2012-10-15,"Taking a sentimental journey through your personal history isn't a new behavior for you, but today's Libra New Moon in your 4th House of Roots raises issues that you may not have previously considered. Thankfully, you have an upbeat attitude, making it easier deal with the emotional complexities that arise now. But don't get lost in the nostalgia. It's more productive to remain in the present moment, instead of traveling back in time."
leo,2012-10-15,"You may think you know what's best for you today, but today's accommodating Libra New Moon encourages you to also consider what others need. Although you might not normally be so dependent on someone else, it's challenging to fill in your schedule now before talking to those who work closely with you. Being extra attentive to your friends allows you to coast more easily through the day. Don't allow your current enthusiasm to trick you into thinking that everything will turn out fine just because you're feeling lucky."
virgo,2012-10-15,"You must make a significant decision about your finances now, yet it's challenging to reach a definitive conclusion as today's ambivalent Libra New Moon emphasizes your 2nd House of Money. You may waste time wavering back and forth, without being able to finalize your choice. However, it's not useful to be too self-critical. Wait a couple of days to see where the new wave of energy carries you before committing one way or the other."
libra,2012-10-15,"Today's Libra New Moon triggers a helpful break from your recent past. You're eager to put your new intentions into constructive action, but first you need to express your desires clearly enough to create the impact you want. Although focusing your thoughts on a specific goal can set you into motion, enthusiasm isn't enough to assure success. You must still follow through with perseverance to reach your goals."
scorpio,2012-10-15,"You're usually a champion at keeping secrets, but something you are hiding now could spell trouble. You want to tell someone what you know, especially if the information can be of help. However, you won't likely spill the beans if it means breaking a promise. This predicament is stressful if you believe there's no right answer. Put off your final choice until the Moon enters insightful Scorpio later this evening and then let your instincts be your guide."
sagittarius,2012-10-15,"Even if your social calendar is busy, the energy shifts as today's Libra New Moon emphasizes your 11th House of Long-Term Goals. You're marching to the sound of a different drummer now as you pull away from others, and your friends may think you have gone mad. Although stress is exacerbated by awkward relationship dynamics, all you can do is continue to be true to yourself. Your interpersonal dance grows more fulfilling as you take care of your own needs first."
capricorn,2012-10-15,"You are taking your responsibilities even more seriously than usual with the peace-keeping Libra New Moon occurring in your 10th House of Social Status. Your professional objectives are emphasized, but it's not wise to take on more busy work today. Accept additional tasks only after you weigh and balance the pros and cons of having to fulfill another promise. Delegating duties enables you to achieve success."
aquarius,2012-10-15,You are eager to learn new ways to expand your world view as today's creative Libra New Moon lands in your 9th House of Big Ideas. Even gathering information about possible educational programs could inspire you to make a decision if you're considering a new course of study. But don't restrict yourself to work-related subjects because it's time to break out of your shell by exploring something totally different. Free your mind and enjoy the ride.
pisces,2012-10-15,"Your sensitivity to someone else's emotions can be the key that opens a door to intimacy now that the lovely Libra New Moon is activating your 8th House of Deep Sharing. But there's no need for concern because your intuition will keep you from getting lost in the unknown waters. You should be able to maintain clear boundaries today, even while diving into the uncharted shadows of an evolving relationship."
aries,2012-10-16,"Even if the past few days have been memorable, you still want to make the good times last as long as possible. Luckily, the stars are in you favor, but you're able to turn on the charm so effortlessly that you could lose credibility. Keep in mind that everyone can tell when you're exaggerating, so be honest and stick to the facts. Speaking the truth won't interfere with your fun."
taurus,2012-10-16,"Your trusty senses are picking up reliable data today, but you can't concentrate enough to take it all in. Nevertheless, you could easily step over the edge of reason if you don't listen carefully. You may let loose, but later realize that it wasn't worth it. Even if you're eager to have a bit more fun, keep track of when it's time to get back to work."
gemini,2012-10-16,"If you are overwhelmed by too many lovely distractions today, it may be time to figure out how to stop wasting your time and energy. Unfortunately, this is easier said than done, for you aren't likely to say no if you think that the potential for pleasure is in the picture. Moderation is your current key to success, even if it's an elusive goal at this time."
cancer,2012-10-16,"You might need to learn how to keep your emotions to yourself in order to be more effective in the professional world. Just remember that containing your moods won't make you feel them any less. In fact, you could be more inclined to stay in touch with your passions once you realize that you don't have to reveal your preferences to anyone else. Instead of worrying about what you don't say, share only what you want when you're ready."
leo,2012-10-16,"You may continue to hide something important, yet the pressure to come clean now is driving you to the edge. You are probably ready to share what you've been keeping secret with someone you can trust, even though it might not be easy to tell all the details. Nevertheless, the emotional rewards can be worth whatever stress you feel along the way."
virgo,2012-10-16,"Your legendary ability to stay on track at work is tested today, but surprisingly you would rather have fun now than do the responsible thing. A conscious change of attitude may be required now because you can see possibilities for pleasure everywhere you look. You really want to discover where your choices might lead. Put on your blinders if needed; you can always explore your options another day."
libra,2012-10-16,"Unfinished tasks pull you out of your reverie today, yet the depth of your new awareness is up to the whims of trickster Mercury. It's even tougher than usual for you to walk away from sweet pleasantries. But it might take days to dig your way out if you let yourself fall into a self-indulgent trap. It's healthier to flirt around the edges and save yourself from the embarrassment of going too far."
scorpio,2012-10-16,"You might be a slave to your commitments now, since you have probably taken on more than you can accomplish. But don't be overly concerned; you're beginning an industrious cycle where you are more capable than others imagine. However, you may also have an inner dialogue going on today, giving you permission to have fun. Go ahead and enjoy yourself; you'll return to your work refreshed and energetically ready for the next round."
sagittarius,2012-10-16,"Although you are riding waves of unrestrained optimism now, you can still land in a pile of trouble. You may see inklings of a more realistic perspective, but you aren't willing to give up your piece of blue sky. Denial might put a smile on your face for a short while, but it won't make you happy in the long run. Face the truth with courage, even if you must moderate your fun-loving ways for the cause."
capricorn,2012-10-16,"Perhaps you think you can escape a relationship problem by going back to work now, but there may also be issues with your coworkers that must be addressed. You can hide your head in the sand and only consider the positive side of a situation, but you'll be better off if you can face the negative feelings, too. Being honest today should improve both business and personal interactions."
aquarius,2012-10-16,"You have things to do that cannot be delayed, but you still might try your hand at procrastination if you think you can get away with it. Thankfully, your easy way with words works in your favor now, enabling you to convince others that your approach is a viable one. However, overplaying your hand is a bad idea because you could lose the support of a trusted ally. Maintaining your integrity is more important than making yourself look good."
pisces,2012-10-16,"Although you want to enjoy yourself, you're torn by a familiar tug-of-war between having fun and being responsible. Your lack of motivation now makes it even more difficult since you can think of a million other things to do before you get down to business. There's no need to struggle with self-judgment because your energy will be different tomorrow, making it easier to catch up on anything you didn't finish today."
aries,2012-10-17,"If something goes wrong today, it may remind you of other times in your personal history that have caused you heartache. Old forgotten hurts return to haunt you and you cannot make them go away by sweeping them back under the rug. You can resolve the past by feeling the pain of the present. However, it's important to discern which is which so you're clear about what you want in your future."
taurus,2012-10-17,"You may be rewarded for your previous efforts if you're up for the challenges this week. The current stress isn't only about work, since love and relationships are also in the mix. Keep in mind that your fantasy life is in the spotlight now, so it may be difficult to separate reality from your wishful thinking. Thankfully, taking your obligations seriously enables you to concentrate on what's real."
gemini,2012-10-17,"You have been on an intellectual trip recently, exploring a variety of creative activities. However, ripples that defy verbalization come floating across your pond today. You simply cannot put what's important into words as hard as you may try. Appreciate the present moment; sometimes that which cannot be said is the most magical."
cancer,2012-10-17,"It may be hard to hold back a stream of big ideas that flood into your consciousness today. You're tempting yourself with the possibility of something that hasn't yet demonstrated real potential, but this probably won't stop you from taking chances. You may not really want to travel to a foreign country or a distant galaxy, but imagining it now can bring you a much needed sense of freedom."
leo,2012-10-17,"You would like to be evenhanded in how you interact with others now, but you realize that it is difficult to play the role of an unbiased observer. There are complex emotional issues bubbling up from the hidden depths of your subconscious and you may feel pressure to do something about them. Act on your intuition, but remember that practicing compassion is more important than being a hero."
virgo,2012-10-17,"Your energy continues to shift today, drawing you into a conflict that stems from a difference of perspective rather than from an incompatibility of goals. It's likely that you both want the same result, even if that's not readily apparent now. Use your analytical powers to find common ground and work from there. Taking the high road invites a cooperative approach to a healthy resolution."
libra,2012-10-17,"In spite of your intense emotions today, you're feeling pretty good about everything that's going on. However, your optimism is about to change for reasons you may not completely understand. You are rather aloof now and might choose to withdraw instead of expressing your desires in the heat of passion. Remember, you can always retreat if you want some time alone. Temporary isolation could be just what you need to heal."
scorpio,2012-10-17,"There is a certain beauty to your inner life these days, regardless of the difficulties you may be facing in your outer world. You are usually able to lock the door to your subconscious mind when it presents challenging material. Now, however, images seem to seep into your awareness in symbolic messages that you can decipher. Trust the guidance of your inner voice to find the missing pieces of your future."
sagittarius,2012-10-17,"You want to protect your feelings today, but this process can be confusing if your emotions are in discord with your actions. This lack of clarity isn't as bad as it sounds, for you might grow more philosophical when your head and heart are not aligned. Don't bury the conflict. Work out the general principles and then deal with the specific issues as they arise."
capricorn,2012-10-17,You can't afford to be lazy today just because you believe that something will work out to your advantage. You are in a major career phase now and this is your chance to effectively use casual communications to strengthen your position with your coworkers. Don't worry about the rules; just say what's on your mind. Others are interested in knowing your opinions more than you think.
aquarius,2012-10-17,"Set aside your analytical approach for a while; you can fall back on it again soon enough. Meanwhile, do a bit of guilt-free daydreaming to explore the amazing possibilities ahead of you. Logic can only take you so far. Carefully guide your own creativity to co-produce the show; you can visualize whatever you want to do next. Sketch in the basics and let your imagination do the rest."
pisces,2012-10-17,"Your current need for adventure is at odds with your desire for emotional security. Although you may be successful at finding a balance between the heart and the head, your friends and associates will probably advise you to play it safe by maintaining the status quo. Assuming the role of a responsible adult today allows your spirit to shine brightly."
aries,2012-10-18,"Waves of certainty wash over you today, confirming what you already know. But then, reality bites back and you must contend with a situation that you didn't expect. Take a chance to bring something that was hidden into the open because it's better when secrets are out of the closet. Be kind in your approach, loving in your actions, and eager to embrace the changes that come from being emotionally aware."
taurus,2012-10-18,"An element of unconsciousness on your part may allow you to tuck an unpleasant feeling deep out of sight, even if you believe that you are fully aware of what's going on today. But this isn't a great day to keep a secret, for others will probably know that you are withholding something even before you realize it. You're coming into an exciting creative phase now, so don't waste energy trying to avoid the truth. Lighten your baggage so you can create space for your future."
gemini,2012-10-18,"A mild jolt of awareness runs through your system today as emotions give way to a more detached outlook on your current circumstances. Even if you are engaging in discussions with others, you won't likely feel restricted by them in any way. To the contrary, relationships can now be the source of newly found freedom if you're willing to jump into an intense conversation to clear the air of lingering negativity."
cancer,2012-10-18,"An overly assertive person at work may offend your sensitive nature today, giving you good reason to retreat behind your protective walls. But it won't be that simple, for every little motion you make to withdraw is matched by an event that pulls you further outside of your shell. This process might not be very comfortable, but it's an effective way to keep you involved in what's happening around you. Don't hide your light; you have something special to offer if you let others in."
leo,2012-10-18,"You have been dealing with your fair share of emotional stress lately, possibly stemming from your desire to do one thing while being required to do something else. However, this tension begins to settle down today as you become more at peace with your emotional needs. It pays to be less demanding, even if you want something that you believe is yours. It may be difficult to share with others now, but being part of a supportive group can be just what you need."
virgo,2012-10-18,"You might be concerned that you're attracting the wrong kind of people into your life if someone is acting inappropriately today. Fortunately, you may end up having a fine time anyhow if you can find a way to go along with the flow -- even if doing so takes you places that make you feel uncomfortable. However, if you're resistant to new experiences, then today could be quite a challenge. The choice is in your hands."
libra,2012-10-18,"You are apt to be busier now as your life fills up with mental distractions and many things to do. However, all this activity isn't necessarily a problem because it can lift you up out of the doldrums and bring much needed inspiration. Even if you don't have too much on your plate, your restlessness still probably prevents you from getting the relaxation that you need. Don't court frustration by trying to escape; instead, jump in with both feet and attempt to accomplish as much as possible."
scorpio,2012-10-18,"Your personal values are brought into the light today as sparks fly and light up the shadows within your subconscious mind. Although the shock of awakening may only last a moment, you cannot go back to sleep once you know what's going on. Consciously use your enlightened perspective to fuel a new cycle of growth. Whatever you do, don't let your awareness scare you back into the apparent safety of your denial."
sagittarius,2012-10-18,"The Moon is back in your sign for its monthly visit, bringing a feeling of instability as your moods intensify. But your emotions are being distorted by the high frequency of your nervous system today, so rather than just liking something, you love it or hate it. Move from the extremes toward the center and don't make any final decisions for a few days. There's no room for middle ground if you force issues into black or white."
capricorn,2012-10-18,"You are ready to break free of the responsibilities that weigh upon you, but you can't just walk away from your commitments today. You probably wouldn't bail even if you could since it's not your style to escape your duties. You may, however, get a bit of time off for good behavior. Put your imagination to work because in your mind you are free. You can travel anywhere you wish and still fulfill your mundane obligations at the same time."
aquarius,2012-10-18,"Your dreams seem so close today that you feel as if you can actually reach out and touch them. Your friends may encourage you now and tell you to go for it. However, you could snap out of your reverie and crash back to Earth, realizing that your head was in the clouds. Either let your idle wanderings remain fantasies or start making them real. Ultimately, your answer must come from within."
pisces,2012-10-18,Events at work could be making demands on you now that require you to become more accountable to others. But you can't hide beneath the veneer of your outer appearance today because you must respond to a pressing situation. This isn't the right time to be working on your own internal conflicts. Just be honest and deal with the circumstances as they unfold. You can return to your more personal issues once your work is done.
aries,2012-10-19,"You might still be feeling gleefully optimistic, but reality will show itself again sooner than you think. In the meantime, enjoy the opportunities for fun that come your way. You have a lot of leeway with respect to your schedule now as long as you don't totally ignore your previous commitments. But don't try to squeeze in too much activity or you might exhaust yourself. Make sure to get enough sleep so you are ready for the adventures of tomorrow."
taurus,2012-10-19,"Sharing your feelings might sound like a good idea today, but your current environment on the job may not be as supportive as you wish. Instead of focusing on your needs now, see if you can draw out the strengths of others by being a good listener. Remember, your success partly depends on the emotional well-being of those around you. Creating a friendly atmosphere enables everyone to enjoy their work more."
gemini,2012-10-19,"Beware of people sharing big ideas today because you could be pulled off track from your goals. You may not be content if you drop everything you are doing just to dive into someone else's project. Don't expect others to satisfy your need for diversion. Instead, do something on your own that allows you to get the adrenaline rush you crave without straying too far from your work at hand."
cancer,2012-10-19,"One minute you are enthused about the potential in your life, but the next moment you could be teetering on the edge of self-doubt. It's likely that you're optimistic for most of the day and grow more somber later in the evening. In the meantime, utilize your current confidence to tackle unfinished business while you still have a positive outlook. Your accomplishments will speak for themselves at the end of the day."
leo,2012-10-19,"You may feel a strong attraction to someone special today and yearn to do something dramatic about it. But it might be difficult to take action on your desires because you are concerned about breaking the rules of social etiquette. Although doing something adventurous with a romantic companion sounds like a great idea, you may have to proceed slower than you prefer. Don't put unnecessary pressure on the situation; paradoxically, you'll make more progress as you let go of your expectations."
virgo,2012-10-19,"You may try to be more direct about communicating your needs today, since you intuitively know that you can accomplish quite a lot if you let others know what you want. You could even be overbearing if you're too enthusiastic about your goals. Keep in mind that staying aware of your impact on others now helps you avoid the rough spots. Knowing when to change the topic is key to your relationship success."
libra,2012-10-19,"Lots of action could have you running in search of a quiet place, but you might not find much peace wherever you go today. The more you try to withdraw, the more impossible it seems to get away from it all. Instead of working yourself up into a state of frustration, it's simpler to just accept the noise and save your retreat for another day. Changing your attitude immediately improves your day."
scorpio,2012-10-19,"Your self-esteem is on the rise, but you need to be careful not to let casual criticism send you into a tailspin. Although Saturn's two-year visit to your sign means that you're willing to work hard for whatever you want, you may be more sensitive to other people's feedback than you realize. Ultimately, your commitment to excellence speaks louder than someone's unconscious words. Keep your eye on your goal and don't let your confidence slip."
sagittarius,2012-10-19,"Although your feelings may be a bit erratic today, they will settle down later in the evening. However, controlling your changing moods might not be worth the effort because the Moon in your sign now can overpower your most convincing logic. Your best strategy is to let your emotions run their course before assuming that you really know what's going on in your heart."
capricorn,2012-10-19,"You have a lot of big ideas today, but they may be so grandiose that they don't fit in with the current situation. As concrete as your plans seem, they might have to wait for another day and a different set of circumstances for expression. Paring back your thinking to the basic essentials now is your best ticket for success."
aquarius,2012-10-19,"Your friends and associates may be the source of lighthearted fun today, but their plans can also distract you from what you should be doing. If you decide to go along with the group, just remember that you still must meet your previous obligations. Even if you think you can get away with avoiding responsibility now, it's not in your best interests to simply run off and escape. Luckily, you should be able to balance work and play if you don't go overboard on either end."
pisces,2012-10-19,"It's challenging to stay on track today because you tend to be very idealistic when you dream about the potential of your career objectives. However, you may feel quite restrained by the present circumstances once you start progressing toward your destination. Thankfully, you can make the most of any obstacles that appear in your path by using your frustration to fuel your drive. You could accomplish more than you think if you're willing to work within your means."
aries,2012-10-20,"There may be an unpleasant confrontation today between your boss and one of your co-workers. You might not want to get involved, but you still could end up playing a significant role to help resolve the problem. Your direct approach allows each person to be heard by the other one. Maintain objectivity the best you can as you strive to create common ground."
taurus,2012-10-20,"You may need to alter your plans today, but don't waste energy brooding about it. You will be much better off if you let go and just make the necessary adjustments. There's no reason to take the changes personally; no one is trying to ruin your day. If you can be more forgiving you may find joy where you least expect it."
gemini,2012-10-20,"An intense discussion about your feelings could result in a sudden change of priorities for you. You want to understand more about the hidden patterns in your life now so you can bring more meaning to everything you do. However, you must make a commitment in order to reap the fruits of your efforts. Sacrifice one of your less essential interests in the name of success. You gain power when you learn to focus your energy on what's most significant."
cancer,2012-10-20,"You may assume that a relationship is heading in one direction, but today it might suddenly turn another way. If you are thinking about a partner in one light, everything could change, requiring you to release your old expectations. Questioning your own assumptions enables you to connect with someone in a different way. Your flexibility opens the door to new possibilities for happiness."
leo,2012-10-20,"Although you would like to be more productive today, it's challenging to turn your creative ideas into finished products. Rather than just jumping into a new project, learn a useful skill to apply later on. Find an experienced teacher to show you what you need to know, but don't take any shortcuts. Your self-expression can benefit now from your patience and commitment."
virgo,2012-10-20,"You may be hesitant to express your feelings today. However, some of the more traditional rules about love and romance can be tossed out the window if your intentions are good. Of course, you won't be able to set aside your high standards. It's just that the fussier aspects of your personality don't need to get in the way of finding what you want."
libra,2012-10-20,"Even if your home environment feels well organized, you still might want to move furniture or rearrange pictures today to prevent boredom from setting in. But making changes in your living space isn't to be taken lightly because it could act as a catalyst for larger shifts that need to occur. This is more about creating movement than producing something that will endure. The vision that you express now can bring new energy to other areas of your life as well."
scorpio,2012-10-20,"Your perceptions are particularly sharp today and your tongue might be even sharper. Your comments are likely to be particularly pointed these days and may elicit a defensive reaction from others. Oddly, the more accurate you are with your choice of words, the more difficult it could be for someone to accept your remarks graciously. Go easy on those around you and be gentle with yourself while you're at it."
sagittarius,2012-10-20,"It's hard to restrain yourself from expressing your opinions today if you're feeling serious and judgmental. This somber approach to the world might seem a bit awkward now, but don't be hard on yourself for your strange moods. Problems may arise if rigidity sets in, so stay loose and enjoy the whole spectrum of feelings that carry you through the day."
capricorn,2012-10-20,"You may be caught between the expectations of others and what you want to do for yourself. Normally, when faced with this kind of existential dilemma, you respond in a mature and responsible manner. However, it's smarter to do something out of character now like going for a drive without a map. Follow your heart in the moment without setting a goal. Even if you can't slip away, dreaming about an escape is an admirable place to start."
aquarius,2012-10-20,"You are embarking on an adventure into unknown territory where you can meet interesting people who have something significant to teach you today. Luckily, you're perfectly equipped to appreciate the incredible diversity of the human species, even when some of the individuals are surprisingly strange and wonderfully weird. Have fun on your little excursion to other worlds and beyond."
pisces,2012-10-20,"People seem eager to place trust in you today, especially if you are non-judgmental in your reactions to their revelations. Your boundaries may not be very clear, allowing you to connect with individuals who otherwise might not let anyone close. Fortunately, you can learn a lot from others now as long as you are willing to expand your own range of expression. Opening your heart works both ways."
aries,2012-10-21,"Your need to concentrate on career issues now doesn't necessarily mean you will be successful in all that you do next week. Frustration may accompany disappointment if you don't achieve your goals soon, so it's important to remember that this delay is not an indication of failure. Everything might seem to take longer than you expect, yet it's just a waste of your energy to be overly critical of yourself. Practicing patience improves your chances of reaching inner satisfaction."
taurus,2012-10-21,"While those around you may struggle as they face obstacles today, you are more likely to just take them in stride. You still could make matters worse if you don't pay attention to the signals you receive. If you push too hard, then someone is likely to push back. Back off just enough to let others have their space. Retreating for a while gives everyone room to breathe and reconsider their options."
gemini,2012-10-21,"You cannot jump from one topic to another today as you often enjoy doing. It's as if there is something attaching your emotions to everyone you encounter now and your clever wit and lighthearted attitude aren't enough to shake it. Even if you are resistant to sinking deeper into a particular issue, don't fight against your feelings. You won't make anything easier and you'll still have to deal with the situation before moving on."
cancer,2012-10-21,"Others may be placing too much responsibility on you recently. Thankfully, you don't need to accept the extra load unless you so desire. But establishing clear boundaries can create a problem if the ensuing negotiation isn't successful at first. You might feel resentment if you give in too quickly. Just be aware that the tension will dissipate in a couple of days if you choose to hold your ground."
leo,2012-10-21,"Do your chores in a responsible manner, especially the ones you want to avoid. You might even end up making your day more complicated if you try to put off your current work. A situation, possibly with children or in romance, can be inflamed by your inability to separate your desires from reality. To get the true message, listen consciously to every word that's said. Instead of exaggerating, stick to the facts. Being honest makes life a whole lot easier in the long run."
virgo,2012-10-21,"You are behaving as sensibly as you can by taking responsibility for what's yours. You have an uncanny ability to know what needs to be done and the perseverance to do it. Nevertheless, your strong drive and likelihood of success could prompt someone close to you to resist your efforts. If you run into trouble, soften your approach and then try again. Behaving in ways that are less threatening to others might turn them into admiring supporters."
libra,2012-10-21,"You might be particularly self-critical now as you assess your performance at home or your relationships with your family. Perhaps others think you should be doing more. You may want to help your aging parents or your growing children, but don't always have sufficient time or resources. Thankfully, your good intentions can lead to positive outcomes, but probably not until late next week."
scorpio,2012-10-21,"Although trivial matters may cause you great annoyance today, you might do well to keep your feelings to yourself. Others could be quite obstinate and if you share your frustration, it can just make them even more stubborn. The way to ease the tension now is to be more flexible with the details. Changing your attitude is a good place to start."
sagittarius,2012-10-21,"It's difficult to find a steady rhythm today if you're preoccupied with the emotional intensity around you. You may be weary of the drama, but there's no easy way to avoid it. Nothing you do seems quite right. Be careful about growing obsessed with any one goal. It's best to wait a few days before making significant choices."
capricorn,2012-10-21,"You are more sensitive to what everyone wants now that the Moon is back in your sign; however, you're even more attuned to your own desires. But you may not be able to address your personal needs today, for your emotions could very well be out of line with the preferences of those around you. Acknowledge your cravings, but don't necessarily share them with anyone unless it feels natural. In the meantime, focus your energy on nurturing those you love."
aquarius,2012-10-21,"You may hide your feelings out of necessity today because you believe that emotions only get in the way of your overall efficiency. This logical approach adds to your frustration, which could be serious enough to last for a couple of days. There is so much happening in your life now that you might not have time to focus on your personal desires. Fortunately, letting go of your expectations can save you from a bit of unnecessary trouble."
pisces,2012-10-21,"Issues of social responsibility encourage you to reconsider your actions, especially if you've been thinking about getting more involved in a cause. Whether this is about political activism or a personal commitment to be more environmentally conscious, it may not be that easy to act on your good intentions. Don't worry about follow-through yet. For now, just change your mind and the rest will follow."
aries,2012-10-22,"Giving up is not an option today because you have already worked too hard to get this far. Thankfully, you have the ability to see your future through a new lens now. Pay attention to how your perspective is changing, but don't try to put your thoughts into action until later in the week. Keep in mind that your world is not going to be quite what you expected once you embrace the unknown."
taurus,2012-10-22,"You are eager to make steady progress, but it could prove to be elusive for a while longer. Don't try to fill in too many details yet. One of your current challenges is to keep your life in motion without necessarily knowing exactly where you are going. Trusting in the process isn't easy for you, but your faith can smooth out the rough spots along the way."
gemini,2012-10-22,"Although you may think that you know what needs to be done, turning your ideas into reality now could be difficult. Don't blame others if you feel frustrated; it's a good idea to reflect on a past action that has contributed to your current dilemma. But it's hard to concentrate, so don't struggle if you cannot put all the pieces together yet. Practicing discipline today is more important than working hard."
cancer,2012-10-22,"Make time for meditation, but don't worry if nothing very productive comes from your contemplation right away. You can still receive great benefit from focusing on your spiritual practice now. Subtle changes within your imagination will work their way up into awareness through next week. Ultimately, today's inner journey will positively affect your outer world."
leo,2012-10-22,"You can consciously move your energy in a new direction today, but don't get cocky because there still may be obstacles in the road ahead. Take it slowly now and remember to review recent events in order to be more certain about your current choices. Building your foundation with integrity and authenticity enables you to withstand whatever pressures come your way."
virgo,2012-10-22,"Allow yourself to feel uncomfortable for a while, especially if you're thinking about things that cannot be changed. Thankfully, the energy is shifting in big ways and others may ride to your rescue sooner than expected. Don't be concerned if you are lacking answers; solutions will present themselves just in time. And remember, there's nothing wrong with relying on a friend to give you a gentle nudge when you need it most."
libra,2012-10-22,"It's tough to be serious enough to meet all your obligations today, but nevertheless, this is what you must do now. Accept the inevitable and do whatever you can without wasting energy by complaining or whining. Thankfully, working with a positive attitude empowers you to accomplish your goals with less effort than you think."
scorpio,2012-10-22,"Although it may be back to work for you now, a little retreat still sounds good and you would be well advised to squeeze in some personal time if you can. Cut yourself some slack and don't try to accomplish more than is absolutely necessary. Even if someone appears to be on your case, avoid any direct confrontation until you have finished enough of your chores and are ready to take responsibility for your actions."
sagittarius,2012-10-22,"A high-frequency buzz may develop today as your day unfolds, but it's not necessary to turn any of your thoughts into practical applications for now. Still, it's a good idea to take the first step on one simple project, instead of biting off more than is required. Just keep the energy moving forward and watch where it takes you over the days ahead."
capricorn,2012-10-22,"Your self-worth might be called into question as you re-evaluate your relationships with friends and family members. It's not that you aren't fully capable of doing what others want; it's just you could be uncertain about what's expected of you today. Don't try to solve all the mysteries now; instead, let the current events take their own course until you gain clarity about your position once again."
aquarius,2012-10-22,"The Moon's creative power inspires you to share what's on your mind while she is traveling through your sign. Whatever you feel early in the day could set the tone for the entire week, so it's crucial to stay aware of your emotions. Don't waste time entertaining negative thoughts or self-doubt. Your positive intentions are like a steady breeze that can carry you further than you expect."
pisces,2012-10-22,"Finishing leftover chores early in the workweek is a smart idea so you can be ready for what's next when the Moon enters your sign on Wednesday. Keep in mind that your sensitivity is heightened, making it difficult for you to focus on your tasks. As the day wears on, concentration continues to become more problematic, so save the latter part of the day for rest and relaxation."
aries,2012-10-23,"Everything is simple if you don't allow the facts to get in the way of having fun. The problem is that although the truth usually shines through, fantasy continues to rule your world now. Luckily, if you can imagine something today, you might actually be able to manifest it. It's easier, though, if you cooperate with reality instead of avoiding it."
taurus,2012-10-23,"You can't see your strengths and weaknesses clearly enough now, but your lack of definition won't get in the way of your current success. Even if your role in the world is muddled, it can be based more on your ideal vision than on the actual reality of your life. Give yourself permission to do a bit of dreaming, but try not to lose track of the truth in the process. Incorporate the most useful parts of your fantasy into your daily routine."
gemini,2012-10-23,"Try your hand at writing poetry today or find a poem that touches your soul and read it aloud. It seems that you are ready to escape into the beauty of some intellectual creation, whether or not you have a captive audience. Lose yourself in the moment by consciously inviting your imagination to reveal something you don't yet know. There are riches waiting for you beyond the rational world."
cancer,2012-10-23,"This is a wonderful day for meditation, but be aware that too much contemplation might inadvertently lead you into a rut now. This mental trap is strong, luring you into deep feelings that haven't yet bubbled into awareness. If you become overwhelmed or sad, get outside to enjoy a walk. Gentle movement prevents your imagination from tilting in a negative direction. Your spirituality can be the source of great inspiration."
leo,2012-10-23,"A close friend might send mixed signals today, making it difficult to decipher what is expected of you. Your confusion can impact an intimate relationship or a group dynamic. Don't waste energy worrying about what others think. Your most sensible course of action is based upon combining compassion with responsibility."
virgo,2012-10-23,"You may see your entire world through rose-colored glasses today, challenging you to admit that you don't really know what's going on. Your routine might fall to the wayside as you are tempted to step beyond the narrow confines of your responsibilities. Relax; you have more time than you realize. You can always finish up your chores tomorrow when your clarity returns."
libra,2012-10-23,"You're motivated to create more harmony in your life today by ensuring that everyone around you is having a good time. Although others might see you as lighthearted, you don't feel easygoing at all. Maintain a hopeful attitude even if you aren't sure that things are going your way. Above all, remember that the power of positive thinking can help you get through the tough spots."
scorpio,2012-10-23,"A current relationship dilemma stems from how passionate you feel now. You would like to share your emotions with someone you trust, but everyone seems to prefer it when you hang out in the shallow end of the pool instead of swimming out into the deeper emotional waters. Nevertheless, you can probably get what you need by talking about your concerns, as long as you're gentle in your approach with others."
sagittarius,2012-10-23,"You thought you knew what was going on, but now you realize that something may have been lost in the translation. Toss your old schedule aside because it's already irrelevant to the current circumstances. Everything should work out fine if you can be flexible enough to go with the flow. Whatever you do, don't try to force reality into your predetermined agenda."
capricorn,2012-10-23,"If you are considering a major purchase, think carefully about it again because you may be short on common sense today. Even if you go ahead and open your wallet now, remember that you can easily misjudge the value of what you are buying. Finding something that is aesthetically pleasing is half the battle, but don't pay more for it than it is worth."
aquarius,2012-10-23,"It's a perfect day to fall in love with the idea of love, but there might not be an easy way to make it last. Beauty appears all around you, but it's also within your mind. Be careful about confusing your subjective experience with the objective world. Maintaining a healthy perspective increases your chances of transforming your whimsical illusions into lasting reality."
pisces,2012-10-23,"Pay attention to every little thing happening on the home front today, since there might be a miscommunication that twists the day out of shape. Paradoxically, although confusing Neptune may run amok with your life, it won't necessarily lead to trouble. Even if you need to backtrack later in the day to clear up a misunderstanding, make sure you straighten out any wrinkles before moving on."
aries,2012-10-24,"You're often hustling on to the next task before you finish the current one. But today you can understand the positive side of slowing down and sticking with a job all the way through to the end. Accept delays as part of the process and follow through with whatever you start, even if you wish you could be doing something new."
taurus,2012-10-24,"You may be in touch with your own strength of purpose today, but overcoming inertia isn't enough. You must also respond to other people's resistance by working consistently toward your goals, however small your first step might be. But don't waste time procrastinating now; thankfully, your current actions will have lasting positive impact."
gemini,2012-10-24,"It's difficult to hide your feelings today because they are stimulated by real events. It may be easier to keep interactions within the safe bounds of rational thinking by steering clear of illogical emotions. Nevertheless, you might not be able to talk your way around the obstacles at work now. Slow down and review alternate strategies before automatically taking the course of least resistance."
cancer,2012-10-24,"This is a serious time in your life because the present circumstances may remind you of difficult relationship issues in your past. Your anxiety comes to the surface if someone's harsh words hit home. But instead of worrying about your possible shortcomings, be ready to move beyond your own personal history and do something brilliant. Thankfully, your imagination holds the key to your current success."
leo,2012-10-24,"Even if you think that everything is right on track, reality may startle you now with a few surprises placed strategically in your way. Instead of ignoring the messages, explore how these obstacles might actually be symbolic of your own feelings. Awareness is essential; if you find a way to understand your role in what's happening, then you can steadily break through to the other side."
virgo,2012-10-24,"It may seem as if the spotlight has finally found you; however, you still want to hide from public view. You might prefer to accept the responsibilities that are heaped on you now and withdraw quietly while doing your work. But if you have control issues and try to do it all by yourself, the whole thing can collapse around you. Acknowledge that you need positive working relationships to achieve your goals. Being part of a supportive team inspires you to accomplish more than you thought possible."
libra,2012-10-24,You're facing an odd mixture of Saturn's cold reality today and the wide imagination of the Pisces Moon. You are feeling very serious about your philosophy of life and might have to make choices that put you in an emotionally vulnerable position. Move into the real issues and transform a casual friendship into something more meaningful. Don't settle for less when it comes to your heart.
scorpio,2012-10-24,"You feel the weight of responsibility on your shoulders as the Sun joins heavy Saturn in your sign. Examine what past failures might have to do with your current willingness to help others who may not have asked for your assistance -- whether they need it or not. Your compassion is a gift, but co-dependence isn't a viable path to happiness. Heal others by first forgiving and healing yourself."
sagittarius,2012-10-24,"Don't be afraid to act like an authority now, assuming you know what you are doing. If you do find yourself involved in a struggle for control, take responsibility for only what is yours. You don't have to win an argument at any cost, for the price can be greater than you think. Make this an opportunity to learn something about yourself as you overcome the resistance within and without."
capricorn,2012-10-24,"You are a worker bee today and there are too many things for you to do around your hive. It might even feel like it's a day of judgment, and naturally you want to pass the exam rather than falling short of someone's expectations. Apply yourself diligently, but be gentle with the self-criticism; remember that you're in it for the long haul."
aquarius,2012-10-24,"You may believe that your relationship life is improving, even if you crash into a wall today. Unfortunately, you won't likely see the trouble coming before it's too late. Don't be discouraged now if you have to deal with disappointment. Remember, the current difficulties aren't as major as they seem. Take advantage of the minor setback by re-evaluating your next move."
pisces,2012-10-24,"This may be a cooling off phase as you reconsider what you want from your close friends. You are more analytical than usual and less emotionally attached to the outcome. Don't give up, even if you are confused about your role in relationships. But loosen your grip on the reins by acknowledging the futility of trying to control that which is not yours to manage."
aries,2012-10-25,"You may be overly concerned about the restrictions put on you by a close friend or lover today. Although your worries could be based on reality, your own fears complicate the situation. The problem deepens if you try to avoid talking about your feelings. Thankfully, overcoming your resistance and initiating a dialogue is the first step toward resolving the discomfort. It might be difficult to start the conversation, but it will quickly get easier once the ball is rolling."
taurus,2012-10-25,"Someone may be overly critical of your stubbornness today, but your inclination is to entirely resist the label. Instead, you believe that your integrity depends on your ability to hold on to your values, even in the face of differing positions. Nevertheless, all forms of self-defense require rigid behavior to some degree. State your case clearly, but don't try to convert others to your point of view."
gemini,2012-10-25,"You're probably working too hard now that the ambitious Sun-Saturn conjunction falls in your 6th House of Employment. Fortunately, you get what you deserve today, so don't try to avoid the process. A methodical approach enables you to take an emotional gamble without jeopardizing the gains you've already made. Weigh the potential rewards against the possible risks before you invest your heart."
cancer,2012-10-25,"You could have pressing responsibilities today, but your ingratiating style enables you to talk your way out of working too hard. You might even be able to persuade someone to postpone your deadline if you can muster up enough courage to ask. Your obligations won't just disappear on their own; however, giving voice to your intentions now could be enough to shift the energy in your favor."
leo,2012-10-25,"You're willing to apply yourself toward a specific goal, but your co-workers may not notice your ambitious behavior today. Perhaps your desire to get ahead is not measurable in the real world because your current destination is a spiritual place and not based on any sort of observable accomplishments. Don't worry about what anyone else might think; just stick to your agenda the best you can and let others draw their own conclusions."
virgo,2012-10-25,"Although you may be tempted to make a plan and execute it without any deviation, your flexibility is warranted if circumstances shift. In fact, your willingness to respond to unexpected schedule changes can alleviate a problem before it reaches crisis level. Pay attention to your mood swings, but don't act on your feelings until they stabilize. In the meantime, being sensitive to the needs of others allows you to play superhero for the day."
libra,2012-10-25,"A political squabble at work today might have you throwing your hands up in disgust because you don't know which side to support. Unfortunately, your dreams blend into reality and there's no simple way to discern the facts from your fantasies. You might believe that you know what's real, but it changes if you just wait a few hours. See where the situation goes before playing your hand."
scorpio,2012-10-25,"Romantic fantasies assume a significant role in your day, yet you might choose to channel your desires into productivity rather than focusing on relationships. Instead of giving your dreams free reign, concentrate on the work you need to do. You may be surprised with all the practical ideas you have today once you make up your mind to apply your creative process to your job as much as possible."
sagittarius,2012-10-25,"It may feel as if you have reached a turning point, and the circumstances that were holding you back just last week now seem to be fading into the past. Your enthusiasm is growing but it's unrealistic to think that everything will change overnight. Big events are coming your way; however, your patience is required as you move through the current transformation."
capricorn,2012-10-25,"You are a force to be reckoned with today as the Sun joins your key planet Saturn. However, you must apply yourself to the task at hand or you might get distracted by a group of your friends. Rather than taking an all-or-nothing approach to the work/play dilemma, try to aim for the middle of the road. Steering clear of extremes makes a lot more sense than you realize."
aquarius,2012-10-25,"You might feel as if you're being dragged into a conversation today that you would rather avoid entirely. But it's not wise to shirk your responsibilities; others are depending upon you to tell them what you think. If you cannot put your feelings into words, lead by example instead. In either case, give it your best shot by making certain that everyone knows exactly where you stand on the matter in question."
pisces,2012-10-25,"You may be sending contradictory messages today as the imaginative Pisces Moon encourages you to share your dreams with those closest to you. Meanwhile, the restrictive Sun-Saturn conjunction prevents you from wandering too far off the traditional track. But this narrow approach doesn't blend well with your more whimsical style. Showing up and being present with your feelings is all that's needed now."
aries,2012-10-26,"Your schedule seems to be more dependent than you like on the priorities and activities of your friends and associates. You prefer answering to no one but yourself; unfortunately, this self-reliant behavior isn't supported by the current circumstances. Interacting with people willingly can enable you to accomplish a lot today. However, if you try to avoid working with others, you may not be able to get far at all."
taurus,2012-10-26,"Your energy might be opposite of what others expect now as the Sun's presence in your 7th House of Others moves you outward into your environment. You have something important to say about your current relationships, but what you share may not be all rainbows and unicorns. Have patience; your ideas will take time to gel before you can present them in a rational and balanced manner."
gemini,2012-10-26,"Today's positive influence of clever Mercury fills your head with a multitude of ingenious ideas. Although you may be even more adept than usual at communicating what's on your mind now, the things you want to share might raise complex issues. Nevertheless, you are able to cloak the intensity in casual conversation that allows others to speak their minds, too, ultimately giving you the information you need."
cancer,2012-10-26,"When issues grow too complicated, you tend to retreat until you decide what to do next. This is one of those times when it might be simpler to just slip quietly to the back of your cave and let the world go by. Unfortunately, hiding away isn't in your best interest today. Instead, sharing your most intimate feelings gives others the chance to support you in surprising ways."
leo,2012-10-26,"In order to process today's stress, you must respond to your current domestic situation with irrefutable sensibility. Don't even think about a complicated scheme; it won't work now. You have to keep everything as simple as possible. Don't waver from your chosen path while remaining open to the advice offered by those you trust."
virgo,2012-10-26,"You have direct access to your feelings today and your clarity helps you in ways that may not be obvious to others. What comes to the surface now might not be pretty, but your emotions can reveal something important about your identity. Maintain your sense of balance as you take this journey into the private world of your own heart."
libra,2012-10-26,"You are quite talkative today, but you're ready to discuss different subjects than the ones normally expected from you. Instead of keeping your conversations light and easy, you seem less afraid now to confront others with what's most important to you, even if it rocks the boat. Luckily, you can converse with your typical grace and style, enabling you to smoothly venture into uncharted emotional territory."
scorpio,2012-10-26,"Your work load may finally be growing lighter, but an open calendar doesn't mean that you plan on taking it easy today. To the contrary, having more time on your hands reminds you of all the projects you want to tackle. Don't wait until you're busy again with something else; initiate action now while you can, even if you cannot finish what you start right away."
sagittarius,2012-10-26,"You're riding an intense wave of feelings today, so it's smart to take a deep breath before diving beneath the surface. Trying to stay on top of it all will only exhaust you, so let go of anything that could impede your progress. Thankfully, with proper concentration, your stamina will last longer than you think. You'll have plenty of time to soak up the magical wonders that can only be discovered when you are swimming deep within the sea of emotions."
capricorn,2012-10-26,"Your playing field grows very interesting as it becomes apparent that more is happening than you previously realized. It's critical to make an extra effort in communicating now, so you can better understand and respect your friends and associates. You stand to gain much in your casual relationships, but you must go out of your way to be a part of the team rather than remaining on the bench. There's more to be gained by collaborating with others instead of going off on your own."
aquarius,2012-10-26,"You're quite fascinated yet also frightened by the unknown as you feel the energy shifting into a deeper and more mysterious space. If something springs into your life today that surprises you, don't push it away just because you weren't prepared for it. Fate will find the best way to nudge you along as you strive for success."
pisces,2012-10-26,There may be something magical about your current descent into the shadow realms. You're seeking meaningful answers to some pretty serious questions now about the purpose of your life and you aren't willing to settle for anything less. Make time to study spiritual matters because your interest in metaphysical subjects might continue to deepen over the next few weeks.
aries,2012-10-27,"Although this is another very busy day, you might just enjoy the rapid pace at which it unfolds. The spontaneous Aries Moon hooks up with wild Uranus, pumping adrenaline into your system. Instead of trying to harness the energy, let it flow without attempting to control it. An ingenious solution to a long-term problem may suddenly shock you with its simplicity. The less you resist change, the more you can enjoy the day."
taurus,2012-10-27,"You may remember when life was very simple, but today you cannot be certain that it was real. You are attracted to an illusion based on the way you wish things were rather than how they actually are now. You feel very passionately about your convictions. Forget about minimizing complications; just think big with respect to all relationship issues and tread lightly in your interactions with others."
gemini,2012-10-27,"It's rather annoying now that you have to slow down long enough to feel what's happening in your body. Your emotions are quite visceral now, and your thoughts are moving so fast that it's easy to forget about maintaining healthy habits. Don't try to avoid physical sensations, even if they are not pleasurable. Just remember to follow up by improving your lifestyle in small ways instead of trying to change everything at once."
cancer,2012-10-27,"This may not be an ideal day to stay at home, but it can be a memorable one as long as you don't go burying your feelings like a dog with its bone. The richness of your emotions only adds to making this day special, so don't hesitate to bring them out into the open. Keeping your feelings quiet increases your temporary sense of safety, but this strategy won't necessarily lead to personal growth or lasting intimacy."
leo,2012-10-27,"It's challenging to see what's lurking beneath the surface today, yet meditating on the unknown can be its own reward now. Contemplating all the possibilities could be your favorite theme for the day. But the real payoff is not apparent. It is not about the obvious things that you can see or touch. It's about the layers of imagination that will unfold when you quiet your mind long enough to let the magic happen."
virgo,2012-10-27,"You might feel the tension today if your thinking isn't leading you to the right conclusions. It's like you're picking up a radio station that you don't often hear, but in some strange way it sounds all too familiar. No matter how hard you try, you cannot tune out this station -- and that's what makes you uneasy. Rather than resisting, learn what you can from your current experience; it may end up being much more informative than you expect."
libra,2012-10-27,"Sometimes you have to adjust your own feelings in order to keep things running smoothly in your world. Today is one of those days. Thankfully, this protectionism is not a big deal -- and definitely not a life-changer. However, one adjustment won't do the trick; make several subtle realignments throughout the day as needed."
scorpio,2012-10-27,"There are two forces pulling at you in different directions today. One is calling you into the realms of imagination, inspiring you to stay home  and dream the day away. The other is encouraging you to tackle big plans for yourself and your family. Allow room for both worlds to coexist, since they are not as different as they may seem."
sagittarius,2012-10-27,"You have a wealth of powerful images at your disposal today, if only you can determine what's actually happening. It may seem like communication is muddied, yet the lack of clarity doesn't need to bring you down. Keep returning to your imagination, even if your visions don't make sense yet. Your subconscious has an important story to tell you now if only you would take the necessary time to listen."
capricorn,2012-10-27,"You Mountain Goats are known to be among the most reliable signs in the zodiac. However, you may feel less responsible than usual, especially if you are distracted by your daydreams today. An impractical opportunity might come your way now, and thankfully, there's no harm in letting your imagination run free. You don't have to actually do anything right away as long as you indulge in the fantasy. If you can dream about something, you can also make it real."
aquarius,2012-10-27,"You may not feel like living up to your responsibilities today; however, putting them off is not a good strategy. This is a great day to get lots of things done, even if you would prefer to take the day off. However, before you start, think about how much you will be able to accomplish if you don't make each molehill of a task into a mountain of work."
pisces,2012-10-27,"It's difficult to gauge how much you should apply yourself to reaching your goals today. Although you might believe it's going to be a productive day, nothing happens as fast as you expect. If you try too hard, you might end up frustrated because you don't get much done. It's tempting to escape into your dreamy illusions, but you could take your fantasies too far. Balancing your wishes with a pinch of reality along the way prevents you from falling victim to your own sense of perfection."
aries,2012-10-28,"An exciting engagement with a teacher or a mentor might go a long way toward making a dream come true. Even just thinking about something you want to do could bring a smile to your face today. Don't put off planning your big adventure any longer; if you know what you want, just come right out and ask for it. As long as you aren't making outrageous assumptions now, there's no need to take it slow."
taurus,2012-10-28,"If you have been spending too much money or expending your energy with few results, you may finally realize today that you're overwhelmed and exhausted. Nevertheless, you might try to rationalize your current behavior because of your optimistic outlook of the future. But even if your career opportunities have grown recently, you're still tempted to inflate the potential beyond what's real. Play it safe; you may be sorry later on if you over-commit your resources now."
gemini,2012-10-28,"Your eagerness to learn more about the world around you can push you well past your old comfort zone. Although it's not time to retreat out of fear, it's also not wise to surge ahead without acknowledging how much work there is in front of you now. Reassess your goals in light of the new information you discovered. Today it's better to be realistic than idealistic in all that you do."
cancer,2012-10-28,"Even if some aspects of your life are running smoothly, you may still feel disenfranchised from the results of your actions. You expect the absolute best and you might slip into denial if everything doesn't turn out according to your plan. It's challenging to find balance now; you want it all and have trouble accepting less. Since you could inadvertently set yourself up for disappointment, strive to maintain a healthy perspective throughout the day."
leo,2012-10-28,"You really want to remain open to good news today, but it may be a smarter strategy to show less exuberance for someone's exciting plan. Nevertheless, accept an unexpected invitation, especially if it involves having fun. Forget about your arbitrary self-imposed limitations long enough to say yes, but only if you truly mean it. The sheer enjoyment you experience can recharge your soul."
virgo,2012-10-28,"The pressure on your life may feel intense today, possibly prompting you to go to extreme measures. It all depends on how you respond to the current stress at work. Even if retreat isn't normally your style, it might be wise to consider pulling back if things seem out of control. Although the planets entice you to push forward, reserve your energy and resources for when you need them most."
libra,2012-10-28,"You often simplify complex dilemmas by remaining fair-minded when considering your options. However, you could overreact now and worry too much about all the wrong things. It may be difficult to believe that the outcome will be positive since you can see both sides of the issue quite clearly. Forget about being rational for once and be ready to take a risk. You'll never know unless you try."
scorpio,2012-10-28,An inflated sense of self-esteem might motivate you to ask for a raise or a date that could very well be overdue. But your demands for money or love may be unrealistic in proportion. Your tendency now is to overextend by pushing past socially acceptable limits. Don't get greedy or even those rewards that are within reach might be denied. Adopting a more appreciative attitude brings better results.
sagittarius,2012-10-28,"Significant challenges to personal and business relationships could seem a bit daunting today. Thankfully, your inner strength makes you feel powerful enough to overcome nearly any obstacle in your way. Unfortunately, your confidence might prevent you from seeing things as they truly are now. Don't spread yourself too thin or you may receive a rude wake-up call from the universe."
capricorn,2012-10-28,"It may not be easy now to balance a simple dose of basic common sense with your current unbridled optimism. Maintain a practical perspective and a healthy sense of humor today or you might encounter disappointment sooner than you expect. But if you've been paying attention to the facts along the way and kept your expectations in check, you could be close to realizing an important dream."
aquarius,2012-10-28,"It's not wise to give others the power to pull you off your intended course of action today. But even without someone's help, you can turn the smallest chore into a major project. Remember, your judgment may be a bit warped now, so exercise more caution than usual. This isn't the best time for risky gambling, even if something looks like a sure winner. However, taking a more moderate approach could lead to a significant payoff later on."
pisces,2012-10-28,"It seems like your professional success currently requires you to participate in a big project. You may prefer to work alone today, yet still could be drawn into a group effort because of the skills you bring to the table. Even if you don't want to be on a team, the firsthand experience can be quite profound now. In fact, you will likely learn a lot about yourself if you just say yes and trust the process."
aries,2012-10-29,"Unspoken tension may hang in the air today with the stubborn Taurus Full Moon occupying your 2nd House of Values. However, you are better off stirring up emotions rather than just allowing them to settle in. Don't get complacent and let the day pass without expressing the anxiety that you feel. However, make sure to communicate with integrity and kindness. Once you bring your needs up for discussion, the likelihood for positive change improves."
taurus,2012-10-29,"It's nearly impossible to avoid the emotional energy of this Full Moon in your sign as it dissolves the boundaries between reality and your subconscious mind. You may feel uncomfortable with your own intuition now, for you can sense things that are normally just out of sight. Instead of spreading worry and fear today, use your heightened awareness to sow the seeds of love and joy."
gemini,2012-10-29,"Consciously make time to explore the exciting potential that today offers or you could easily miss your chance for growth. This would be a shame, for there is valuable meaning buried in your dreams which are elucidated by the Taurus Full Moon landing in your 12th House of Destiny. You now have the chance to move closer to your personal goals, however fantastic they seem. Don't let this opportunity for enlightenment slip past you without taking a risk."
cancer,2012-10-29,"It's time to gently acquiesce by gradually giving up some of your control. But the Taurus Full Moon's presence in your 11th House of Long-Term Goals doesn't mean letting the changes unfold without any consideration at all. This is very tricky business since you need to clearly express what you want. However, once you speak your piece or write it down, you still have to release your attachment to the outcome. Holding on too tightly will only limit your future possibilities."
leo,2012-10-29,"The conflict between your domestic obligations and your career goals may come to a head today as the Taurus Full Moon illuminates your 10th House of Responsibilities. This tension is not such a bad thing, since you finally have a chance to find the resolution that's been evading you. Luckily, you can use your organizational skills to improve your personal life now as much as your job, even if this isn't apparent to everyone else."
virgo,2012-10-29,"Life may be challenging now, even if positive changes are bringing you what you want. You can visualize your future today with the Taurus Full Moon lighting up your 9th House of Big Ideas. But nothing will happen unless you express your conscious intentions, followed by initiating focused action. Remember, even when you are lucky, you still must buy a lottery ticket to have a shot at winning the jackpot."
libra,2012-10-29,"You may find it difficult to jump right in to an intense situation as you consider someone else's response to your behavior, now that the Taurus Full Moon highlights your 8th House of Deep Sharing. But you really don't need to miss any of the action, even if your name isn't up there in bright lights. Be content with your current role and finish up old business so you are ready to begin anew in two weeks at the next New Moon."
scorpio,2012-10-29,"Today's Taurus Full Moon falls in your 7th House of Relationships, pushing emotional issues right to the forefront of your life. You cannot sidestep the obvious now, for the Full Moon opposite the Sun in your sign is reflecting your own feelings directly back at you from everywhere you look. The good news is that transformation is in the air and you should be able to turn your heightened awareness into the concentrated effort necessary for success."
sagittarius,2012-10-29,"Your idealism might get the best of you now as you express your opinions no matter what anyone else thinks. Unfortunately, you could inflate your own importance with communicator Mercury visiting your sign. But the sensible Taurus Full Moon activates your 6th House of Work and can promptly bring you back down to earth. Ultimately, today may feel like a rollercoaster ride, so get ready for the excitement. Don't try to rationalize everything you experience; there will be time enough for that later on."
capricorn,2012-10-29,"There can be a world of difference between feeling in love and being loved. Naturally, it's wonderful when both happen simultaneously. If you are experiencing one without the other now, the earthy Taurus Full Moon in your 5th House of Romance could bring the change you're seeking. Let your heart be open to surprises; a playful attitude may be just what's needed to set the stage for something magical to happen."
aquarius,2012-10-29,"You may feel as if your home life is weighing you down now, but your fear of change could be the real culprit of your troubles. Others might even see you as rather stubborn today, but dynamic shifts are underfoot and you won't be able to hold back the tides. The Taurus Full Moon illuminates your 4th House of Domestic Conditions, reminding you that you're not in control of everything. Go with the flow and let the currents take you where they will."
pisces,2012-10-29,"You are likely to overcommit with the Taurus Full Moon in your 3rd House of Immediate Environment. If you're currently busier than you prefer, turn down the volume on your overall level of activity. Take advantage of the evocative Full Moon's magic to start eliminating excess emotional noise. Being conscious of what you no longer need now helps you invite what you desire most into your life."
aries,2012-10-30,"Watch your spending today since it will be all too easy to make a foolish purchase that is based upon a whim. Instead of buying an item that just gives you an endorphin rush, invest in something more meaningful. Using your time and money to learn a new skill is wiser than distracting yourself with pleasure in the present moment."
taurus,2012-10-30,"You will feel better about your productivity if you don't waste too much energy today on details that won't matter in the long run. The Moon in your earthy sign reminds you of the importance of following through with your commitments. However, you can still derive pleasure by consciously opening your senses to enjoy good smells, sights and sounds, even while getting your work done."
gemini,2012-10-30,"Think about the consequences before you open your mouth or click on the send button, since it's all too tempting to share what's on your mind today and then quickly regret it. Inappropriate gossip or incorrect information can now slip right past your mental security guard, so practice self-restraint to avert unnecessary trouble. Use your quick wit to spread a positive message wherever you go."
cancer,2012-10-30,Your desire to please your friends and family might provoke complicated explanations that don't lead anywhere positive. Spend your time with people who will accept you without requiring a song and dance. You may be better off leaving the verbal justifications for another day since there's just too much going on now to fit it all into words.
leo,2012-10-30,"You naturally see yourself as in charge because others so often look to you for leadership. However, you may not want to take on additional responsibility at this time because there are so many things that already feel out of your control. Instead of making yourself crazy by trying to handle more work, you could be happier going your own way for a while. You don't always have to live up to someone else's expectations if you're living up to your own."
virgo,2012-10-30,"You enjoy learning effective ways to get ahead, and usually you are quite a dedicated student. Unfortunately, your desire for such knowledge might not be fully satisfied today. Try as you might, the information you acquire now doesn't seem logical. You can turn your mind in every direction to make sense of what's happening, but this may not be the best time to stick to your regular routine. Be open to change and return to the tried and true only when you run out of options."
libra,2012-10-30,"You often enjoy being the accommodating one in a relationship, yet you expect others to return the favor on occasion. After all, it seems fair to compromise for the sake of harmony. Now, however, you may run into someone who is particularly stubborn. Keep in mind that the messages you're receiving might not be the real source of the problem. Ask different questions, dig deeper, and you'll get closer to finding the answer."
scorpio,2012-10-30,"A strong connection with someone can make this a delightful day unless a disagreement gets out of hand. Savoring the simple sweetness of a loving partner or a good friend may be enough to smooth over the rough spots. Fortunately, you won't have to resort to struggle or trickery to have a good time. All you need is the willingness to open your heart."
sagittarius,2012-10-30,"Finding pleasure in work around the home makes sense for you today with the dependable Taurus Moon in your 6th House of Routine. But don't worry about getting a specific task done, for the secret to your current success is to indulge your feelings rather than just doing the first thing that comes to mind. Experience the present moment in its entirety now, instead of trying to meet your goals. Beauty is the guiding force that can make this a very sweet day."
capricorn,2012-10-30,"This can be one of those delightful days that remains in your memory for a long time. Still, it's up to you to turn something mundane into a special event by sharing it with someone you love. If this option isn't available, just be as playful as you can. Allowing yourself to express your inner child enables you to fully experience this opportunity for joy."
aquarius,2012-10-30,"Spending quality time with those who are near and dear to you can make this a special day. In particular, tender moments with family members feel precious, especially if you still need to head out to work. You're not necessarily the sentimental type, but today may be an exception. You don't need to be overly ambitious now, for you are capable of finding great happiness close to home."
pisces,2012-10-30,"You are in your comfort zone today, yet it's important to make sure that your positive outlook is not based upon a faulty illusion. If a conversation doesn't go according to your plan, quit attempting to control it. Go with the flow and don't frustrate yourself by trying to get anywhere special. There will be plenty of time to follow your pursuits later on. In the meantime, keep gathering information to clarify your position."
aries,2012-10-31,"Put your excess energy to good use today while you can. Unfortunately, you may be attracted to many different activities, making it possible to fritter away your time. Establish clear priorities so that you can take care of the most important tasks first. Rambling conversations with friends are fun, but they might just be more distractions when you can't afford to fall behind in your work. You need to ramp up your productivity if you want to be taken seriously by those who matter most."
taurus,2012-10-31,"Invest your time in accumulating practical information today. Purchasing a book or a magazine could be enough to get you moving in the right direction, but don't be afraid to take another step like signing up for a class or doing online research. Concentrate your efforts on acquiring useful knowledge. Remember, there's more than one right answer to most questions. Mental flexibility is an invaluable asset for you now. Following your curiosity can lead you to some very interesting places."
gemini,2012-10-31,"You are probably even more talkative with the Moon back in your sign, which makes it crucial to watch what you say. There could be someone lurking nearby now, ready to harshly judge any mistake you make. Choosing the wrong words might adversely impact your credibility and productivity. If you need to give a presentation today, make certain you brush up on your facts so you don't invite unnecessary criticism. A little preparation in advance goes a long way to proving your competence."
cancer,2012-10-31,"You might be feeling on edge today because your current dissatisfaction makes it difficult to sit still. Instead of letting your frustration build throughout the day, apply this extra energy to help a loved one who may be in need of special attention. You can deepen your sense of purpose by supporting someone who seems lost or confused. Ultimately, assisting others is also a positive way to nurture your soul."
leo,2012-10-31,"Being part of a team is quite enjoyable today and may even boost your self-confidence along the way. A productive relationship with a clever co-worker or partner gets the job done more quickly and effectively now than you could do by yourself. The key is to listen to everyone's input, for leadership is as much about understanding and appreciating others as it is about telling them what to do. A creative collaboration can a wonderful way to achieve success."
virgo,2012-10-31,"You are able to deconstruct complex situations better than most, but you still need to be careful today because you could miss a critical piece of information right in front of your nose. However, your perspective may be a bit skewed now, so make sure the problem truly requires your attention before you get too concerned about something that's not ultimately all that important."
libra,2012-10-31,"Setting long-term goals is an essential key to your success now, but try not to make any major decisions yet. Take time to do the research first, discuss your plans with your friends and consider all the possible options. Additional education at this time in your life is invaluable since it can help you advance further professionally as long as you don't lose track of your original objectives."
scorpio,2012-10-31,"If you are feeling irked with a loved one today, go ahead and bring up what's bothering you. Continuing to sidestep a problem causes more trouble than it's worth. Share your thoughts, but don't point blame if you really want to improve the relationship dynamics. You have an opportunity to fill in the missing information that can help you appreciate the other perso,n as long as you don't allow the dialogue to turn into your personal rant. Opening your ears is just as important as opening your mouth."
sagittarius,2012-10-31,"You are able to speak to nearly anyone about almost anything today, so set up the necessary meetings to pitch your ideas. It's a day when you can effortlessly impress others with your knowledge and enthusiasm. Just remember that the devil is in the details. All the charismatic charm in the world won't be enough to close a deal unless you have the solid facts to back up your ambitious plans."
capricorn,2012-10-31,"Ironically, your flexibility may be more valuable now than a solid game plan, so be ready to change directions at a moment's notice. Playing the role of an authoritative manager with a tight control over everything would be a drastic mistake because this could turn out to be a tough day if you are too rigid in your attitude. By relaxing a little, you'll find new strategies that can be very effective for you both professionally and personally."
aquarius,2012-10-31,"Your intuition is particularly sharp now, enabling you to pull metaphysical rabbits out of imaginary hats. You can miraculously come up with the right answers as if by sheer magic. However, your spiritual channels will open wider when you simply enjoy yourself and live in the present moment. Maintaining a good sense of humor enables you to turn this into a socially successful day as well."
pisces,2012-10-31,"You may feel a bit scattered today, especially if family issues make it difficult to concentrate on work or school. Don't make any serious decisions or major commitments unless you are feeling fully confident about your current direction. Although it might be tempting to say yes in order to make someone else happy, reacting quickly isn't a wise move. Giving your thoughts time to develop before responding allows you to accomplish more in the long run."
aries,2012-11-01,"You are often limited by your fast reactions, but now you have an opportunity to open your horizons and move in an entirely new direction. Your goals may not be fully clear yet, but give them time to develop and the edges of definition will sharpen. Although you might be eager to run the race, wait until you hear the starting gun before you take off."
taurus,2012-11-01,"You're imagining a variety of possible pleasures now, although you might not be able to take advantage of what you see in your mind's eye just yet. Your intuition may distract you from a previously chosen course of action, leaving you slightly apprehensive and uncertain about what to do next. Don't hurry; instead of trying to rush your decision, let the process unfold naturally over the next few days."
gemini,2012-11-01,"Lightning is striking all around you and everything seems to be in transition. Fortunately, you're ready for change, but the grip that circumstances have on your life isn't loosening as quickly as you want. You're itching to go somewhere, but your feet seem to be stuck in quicksand. However, there's no need to be overly concerned since you're about to be set free. Nevertheless, you still must choose your next move with care."
cancer,2012-11-01,"You may have a difficult time with your freedom now, for it might not sit right with your idea of emotional security. Circumstances seem out of whack as relationship tensions drive you close to the edge of your tolerance. Trust your sense of self-restraint even if others are encouraging you to take initiative. You're the only one who truly knows what will serve you best."
leo,2012-11-01,"It's nearly impossible to maintain your position today, even if it feels like resistance to change is a good idea. Although you might try to stay quiet as long as possible, something has to give. Nothing will be gained by slipping into denial, so let your heart do the talking. Instead of falling back on blame or threats, just say what's on your mind and prepare to back up your plan with firm action."
virgo,2012-11-01,You may be at the end of your rope with little left to try that you haven't already done. The good news is that you have a bit of metaphysical magic up your sleeve today if only you can let go of the ways in which you normally restrain yourself. Relax and you might just find a solution in the nick of time. You could happily surprise yourself if you don't try too hard.
libra,2012-11-01,"You haven't arrived at your destination yet, but you may feel so close that the anticipation is driving you crazy. You might have to wait on pins and needles, yet you realize you're part of a larger process that you can't control. Rest assured you are being asked to slow down for a significant reason -- even if you don't yet know what it is. Be patient; the energy is about to break loose and you might just reach your goal sooner than you think."
scorpio,2012-11-01,"You may be feeling as if your energy channels are being blocked. But don't lose faith now because something big is about to happen. An unexpected shift is going to blast you into a new universe, but you have to initiate the change by realizing your own power. Allow your perspective to transform slowly and watch the world around you respond with lightning-fast speed."
sagittarius,2012-11-01,"Your confidence has returned but you still may have difficulties regulating your overall energy level. You could vacillate between over-the-top enthusiasm and cautious pessimism today. You might make people around you crazy with your mood swings unless you can temper your extreme feelings. Thankfully, your emotional reactions are neither as negative nor as positive as you think."
capricorn,2012-11-01,You might feel like a thoroughbred horse in the starting gate before the race. You have completed so many practice runs on this track that you know every inch of the way and you could do it with your eyes closed. But your frustration can get the best of you before the contest even begins. Learn to play the waiting game now and victory will be yours in due time.
aquarius,2012-11-01,"Things are getting a bit more nebulous now, and no matter how clever you think you are, your path won't clear for a while. Allow yourself to move beyond logic, even if you're not so comfortable in the subjective realm of feelings. Remember that the irrational world is safe, and can even be nurturing, if you just have the courage to let go. If you're still feeling lost, keep in mind the confusion will subside in a few days."
pisces,2012-11-01,"You may not know which way the shifting tides will ultimately carry you, for current movement is an illusion; things are not changing as you thought they would. However, your own inner world is transforming now as your imagination grows richer with new ideas. Let them flow and enjoy the fruits of your fantasies instead of worrying about the restrictions of reality."
aries,2012-11-02,"Memories of old emotional wounds may surface today, impacting your productivity by reminding you of your weak spot. These thoughts only stand in your way if you allow yourself to get hooked by the insecurities they bring up now. Confront your fears without resistance while acknowledging that your current situation is different than the ones in the past. History can teach you valuable lessons but you must make decisions based on what you want for your future."
taurus,2012-11-02,"You're not bothered by the weird energies floating around today. Some people may have a difficult time making sense out of what's happening, but you just keep moving your projects along toward completion. Even if you are determined to stay on track, be open to unexpected changes for the sake of growth. You never know what wonderful things might happen when you temporarily relinquish control and let destiny take the wheel."
gemini,2012-11-02,"The Moon is back in your sign today to recharge you with the emotionality that you often try to set aside. Although you have established an admirable path toward respectability, your authority may be challenged now in ways you didn't prepare for and you could be caught off guard without a response. Don't try to fake it. Honesty and integrity are your best weapons for success."
cancer,2012-11-02,"Your fantasies are kicked up a notch now, and you might not feel as if you have a choice in the matter. Your dreams may get your heart racing because they seem so real. But there is a deja vu quality to your life today, especially when you are performing repetitive chores since the regularity triggers your hidden memories. Rest assured you haven't been here before; this is new ground -- and that's what makes it overwhelming at first."
leo,2012-11-02,"It may feel as if you are trapped by uncontrollable circumstances; however, helpers are standing by today, ready to jump in if you just ask. It's just good to know that your co-workers or friends will come to the rescue now and you are secretly relieved by the fact that you aren't fighting a losing battle alone. But don't play the role of a martyr; accept the good intentions of those you trust at face value. Assistance in any shape or form might just be enough to enable you to turn things around at the last minute."
virgo,2012-11-02,"Although you might have to take care of others on the job today, remember your first responsibility is to make sure you are feeling secure enough in your skills that you have something constructive to offer. Don't try to act smarter than you are. No one will believe what you say unless you tell the truth from the beginning. Having the courage to set your own priorities enables you to feel more confident in what you do."
libra,2012-11-02,"You may find it difficult to relax today because you sense something big approaching on the horizon. It's doubly challenging to know how to respond when people at work don't conform to your expectations, especially when you can't figure out what's motivating their behavior. Continue gathering information and let your feelings solidify before you initiate direct action. Fortunately, you have more time than you realize before you must take a stand."
scorpio,2012-11-02,"Your curiosity may get the best of you now, but the day's energy has the potential to take you far beyond learning something new. It also involves sharing your ideas with others. Your thoughts could even create sudden illumination, awakening those around you. Nevertheless, don't be too concerned about the effect you might have on someone else. Your personal experience is the most important part of the journey so stick with your process and see where it leads."
sagittarius,2012-11-02,"Relationship dynamics are rarely simple, but now they seem to intensify your life in several ways. There is an inherent instability in your interactions, but don't let this social awkwardness slow you down. Go ahead and spend time with others today, but stop over-complicating things with your expectations. Just accept the changes as they occur with the best attitude you possibly can. A healthy sense of humor may be your saving grace."
capricorn,2012-11-02,"You might not feel very happy today if there are too many subtle influences tugging at your life from different directions. You prefer not to have so many distractions so you can clear your path to concentrate on your goals. Examine any extreme feelings that come to the surface now, but don't act on them yet. You can make better choices in a few days once you gain a more objective perspective on the current events."
aquarius,2012-11-02,"You may be at the top of your career game now, but some of this success might just be the luck of the draw. You could even be a reluctant leader, nostalgic for times of less responsibility. Nevertheless, you have a gift and it's important to wield it wisely and with good intention. Your people skills are so convincing today that you can talk nearly anyone into joining your cause. Use your power of persuasion carefully or your plans could quickly backfire."
pisces,2012-11-02,"Your previous efforts may be gradually coming to fruition, but you might not be able to reap your rewards just yet. Whatever you do today, don't assume you've failed just because your success is delayed in some fashion. You will do fine once you accept the fact that experiencing the journey is just as important as reaching the destination."
aries,2012-11-03,"You may destabilize a significant relationship today by expressing something that you would normally keep to yourself. Even if it's challenging to talk about difficult issues, your inclination is to jump in because you are all fired up with passion. Be careful because you might be motivated now by fear instead of by love. Focus only on what must be said and save the rest for another day when your emotions have settled down."
taurus,2012-11-03,"Your ruling planet Venus is under intense emotional pressure from Pluto now, heightening your perceptions and activating your desires. You don't feel so easygoing today and may be willing to fight with someone, if necessary, on your quest for satisfaction. Think again before you take a big risk. Consider temporarily pulling back until you can regain your perspective, especially if your sense of urgency is great."
gemini,2012-11-03,"You are interested in discovering what drives others to seek power at work or in love. You may be ready to delve into the intense world of hidden feelings, a place that you often avoid. Now, however, you are willing to overcome your resistance, even if you're not comfortable with the thought of what you might encounter. You are on the right track and will surely feel relief once you know the truth."
cancer,2012-11-03,"Powerful emotional currents pull you into unfamiliar waters today and you aren't necessarily a willing participant. Your attempts to maintain a positive attitude help, yet you still might scare yourself into the shadows of your subconscious. Don't fight the process; healthy change can be your reward. Once you have completed your inner work, resurface and make good use of your new awareness."
leo,2012-11-03,"Your emotions aren't easy to manage today and you may be stuck in one particular way of looking at intimacy. Your love life might feel more like a field of battle than the palace of pleasure it's supposed to be. As hard as it is to see now, the real conflict is within and not with anyone else. Thankfully, everything can change for the better if you are willing to shift your perspective in a positive direction."
virgo,2012-11-03,"Relationship issues are complicated now, especially if there are money problems getting in the way. Keep in mind that resolution becomes easier once you acknowledge the truth you previously tried to deny. Stress works in your favor today, especially if it motivates you to initiate overdue changes. Don't get sidetracked by trying to be right; everyone loses if you play the blame game. Fortunately, you can increase your chances to heal the current rift if you are willing to forgive without expecting anything in return."
libra,2012-11-03,"Your desire for stability in a relationship may give way to the need for change. Unfortunately, verbal communication might not work in your favor because your emotions can be quite passionate now, making others question the validity of your perspective. Detach yourself from any desired outcome by stating your case and then letting it go. No matter what happens next, flexibility is more important than holding on to the status quo."
scorpio,2012-11-03,"You are ready to gamble on your heart today, especially if you've run out of patience and feel like you have no alternatives. Romantic Venus is tensing up against your key planet, Pluto, provoking the expression of overly intense emotions. You are living in the realm of extremes now, with little gray in between the black and the white. Your desires could be distorting your perspective, so put off the most important decisions for a few days."
sagittarius,2012-11-03,"Your unexpressed fears may have more of a hold on your relationships now than you realize. Nevertheless, you are driven to tackle complex issues, even when common sense tells you there are no quick answers. There is great potential contained in your current challenge, but you can't just take the easy way out. If you can be less of an optimist for a while, you will have a better chance of seeing things in their true light."
capricorn,2012-11-03,"It may not be appropriate to use your strong managerial abilities to take care of business in the current emotional situation. Your attempts at controlling the flow could get in the way of the raw feelings that need to be expressed. This is not the time to be demanding or stoic; instead acknowledge your negativity, guilt or shame since showing your vulnerability is the key to a positive transformation."
aquarius,2012-11-03,"Power struggles may arise if your dreams of the future differ from those closest to you. It's hard to find common ground today and the emotional discomfort that stems from social pressure tempts you to retreat from intense interactions. Unfortunately, this avoidance technique won't likely lead to success. Fortunately, the resistance dissipates if you move directly into the uncertainty without trying to force your solution on anyone else."
pisces,2012-11-03,"You might feel as if you're losing something important today, but nothing is actually being taken from you. It's just that relationship dynamics are shifting and you don't want to end up with less than you have. However, you may be overreacting due to old fears or insecurities. Don't waste your energy struggling against changes you can't control. Keep your heart open by expressing your appreciation for others without expecting anything in return."
aries,2012-11-04,"A familiar dilemma of yours -- impulsive action versus strategic self-restraint -- is back for another short visit. Your natural tendency is to immediately convert your feelings into actions, but this spontaneous approach isn't always appropriate. Unfortunately, it's nearly impossible to find any middle ground today; almost anything you do or say is too much. Stay aware of the pull in both directions and steer clear of the extremes whenever possible."
taurus,2012-11-04,"You want to catch up on your chores today, but good intentions aren't enough to guarantee that you'll accomplish your goals. Although you have sufficient energy to get a lot done, you're easily distracted from your responsibilities because of your current desire to contemplate your direction in life. Even if you're very busy now, give yourself some alone time to recharge your spiritual batteries."
gemini,2012-11-04,"It feels as if the pressure is easing up today, but there are still some lingering annoyances that don't seem to go away. Unfortunately, it's difficult to keep a clear perspective about which details are most important. You want to use your communication skills to solve the problems, but there might be so many loose ends that it's difficult to know where to begin. Your best strategy is to think small. Strategic baby steps are better than uncertain giant ones."
cancer,2012-11-04,"You could be overly sensitive now that the Moon is back in your sign. Sometimes you hide behind a self-made wall so others cannot tell how vulnerable you really are feeling. The best way to handle any insecurity today is to find time for retreat, even if it's only for a short while in the evening. Put on your headphones and relax to your favorite music or get lost reading a good book. You don't need to justify your behavior to others if you just want to spend some time in your own inner world."
leo,2012-11-04,"You have obligations that must be met today, even if you would rather be doing something else. Your mind just isn't focused on the practical details in front of you. However, you won't get off that easily, even if you're longing for a lazy day. Don't make such a big deal out of your tasks. Dig in your heels and concentrate; you can catch up on your relaxation when your work is done."
virgo,2012-11-04,"You're being lured away from promises that you made by the rich rewards of social pleasures. The problem is that the timing may not be exactly right. You could spend too much energy trying to avoid your chores so you can play. It's not that you aren't serious about your commitments, but you also want to enjoy yourself for a change. If you don't let the details slow you down, you'll be able to finish your work in time to still join in the fun."
libra,2012-11-04,"Circumstances might require you to take care of the needs of others now. Normally, this isn't a problem for you and you would eagerly do whatever is required. But today your mind may be stuck on the practical logistics of your own situation. Honor your priorities, even if it's challenging to balance the current social obligations with what you think you really must do for yourself."
scorpio,2012-11-04,"You may feel waves of uncertainty wash over you today, but it won't change your vision of the future. Be cautious and hold back your feelings because expressing what's on your mind now might not produce the effect you want. Don't panic and suddenly change direction, even if you have temporarily lost your bearings. Take a deep breath and stay on track; clarity should return tomorrow."
sagittarius,2012-11-04,"Although you are in a phase of outward growth, a wave of emotional depth and passion comes over you today, and it's rather disorienting. It's not that you're an unfeeling person; it's just that you're adept at putting an optimistic spin on personal issues. Positive and negative feelings must work hand-in-hand, so don't try to filter them. Relax and let your emotions swirl around without trying to cover them up or push them out into the open."
capricorn,2012-11-04,"Emotional conflict may be part of your life now, but meaningful confrontation can be an important source of personal growth. You are in a phase of rigorous thinking as you attempt to figure things out. However, the closer you get to a sensible solution, the more complicated the dilemma becomes. You try to explain yourself to others, but they might not understand your thought process. Don't push your point of view yet, as you are still sorting out the best course of action."
aquarius,2012-11-04,"You might feel anxious today without being able to get to the source of your worry. Routines may seem more important than your feelings, making it difficult to know what to do with your emotions. Keep in mind that this uncomfortable Cancer Moon that's bending you out of shape shifts into expressive Leo tomorrow. Hang on; relief is on the way."
pisces,2012-11-04,"It's not easy to find the right mix of security-driven feelings and logically considered actions. Your emotions may run deep now, yet you also feel more hopeful and more playful than before. Unfortunately, a stack of unfinished errands could prevent you from having as much fun as you wish. Luckily, you should be able to get everything done if you intersperse your chores with enjoyable diversions throughout the day."
aries,2012-11-05,"It's challenging to motivate yourself now, for you might believe that you have been working so hard recently that you deserve a break. Unfortunately, your emotions are running all over the map, further distracting you from your responsibilities. Rather than worrying about what you should have accomplished earlier, just get started on being productive today."
taurus,2012-11-05,"There's no reason to struggle to hide your emotions today, even if you're feeling sullen or withdrawn. Others may take it upon themselves to lift your spirits if they sense that you're emotionally retreating. Unfortunately, someone's generosity might arrive with its own baggage attached. You may be happier working alone now to avoid unnecessary entanglements, however subtle they may seem. Let everyone know you appreciate their concern, but you need to figure this one out on your own."
gemini,2012-11-05,"You're not the miserly type, but you might have a sudden attack of stinginess today when you realize how much money is slipping through your fingers. However, the best way to increase your net worth now is not by earning more. You must attack this problem from the other side of the fence by saving what you already have. A practical plan will pay off, but it could take a while before you can count the tangible results."
cancer,2012-11-05,"Your possessiveness may stand between you and relationship satisfaction now because dependence is very different from love. Instead of making yourself indispensable, nurture a family member or a loved one without requiring them to lean on you even more. You can quickly improve your day by changing your attitude so you are comfortable with a higher level of detachment. Giving yourself some of that tender loving care is good for your soul."
leo,2012-11-05,"Instead of trying to get most of your work done in the morning in order to have time for a more relaxing evening, consider turning your calendar upside down if you can. Taking it easy early in the day increases your energy and puts you in a better frame of mind for what you have to do later when the Moon returns to your sign. Once you find your optimal pace, don't let any obstacles discourage you; your dogged persistence will produce positive results."
virgo,2012-11-05,"Be prepared to set your regular responsibilities aside for a while if you are asked to come to the aid of a friend today. Thankfully, even in the midst of a minor crisis, the pace of events is slower now, giving you ample time to accomplish more than you expect. Don't waste your energy questioning what may or may not be possible. Move through your insecurities or fears quickly so you can jump right in and help. Your kindness will not go unnoticed."
libra,2012-11-05,"Your focus is on your career today, yet others still might think that you are more ambivalent than you actually feel. Meanwhile, you're executing a well-considered strategy now, which could even include temporarily downplaying your role. This clever tactic allows you to build momentum while remaining out of the watchful eyes of others. But this can be a tricky dance because if you do it too well it may be a challenge to be seen once you are ready."
scorpio,2012-11-05,"Sometimes it's easier for you to swing into action once your emotions have kicked into gear. Now, however, you continue to be laid back, enjoying the fruits of the watery Cancer Moon for much of the day. Nevertheless, don't let comfortable patterns or plain laziness prevent you from taking initiative. Even if you're slow to start today, make an extra effort to be as productive as possible."
sagittarius,2012-11-05,"You may lose confidence in yourself if you believe others are undermining your efforts. Interpersonal dynamics are complicated now, making it tough to get to the bottom of the situation. Trusting your intuition is wise today, but trying to prove that someone is working against you can be quite difficult. There's no reason to waste energy substantiating facts when you already know the most sensible path to follow."
capricorn,2012-11-05,"You have recently been surrounded by overly sensitive people and the underlying tension might still take several more days to settle down. Others will probably be more forthcoming about their true feelings later in the day once the Moon enters expressive Leo, but emotional disclosure won't necessarily solve anything yet. For now, the best thing you can do is listen and wait; the answers will arrive on their own timetable."
aquarius,2012-11-05,"Although you often enjoy working with others, you really don't want them too close because emotionality on the job makes you uncomfortable. Keep in mind that processing your own need for intellectual detachment can teach you lessons about yourself now. Ironically, observing your changing moods helps you stay more open to the ideas of your co-workers."
pisces,2012-11-05,"Making use of your creativity at work would be a dream come true, but if you're stuck in a more mundane job now, put your self-expression in motion later on when you get home. However, it may be tough to recapture your earlier buzz. If so, don't fret about it; instead of trying to impress anyone with what you can do, just begin a project that makes you happy."
aries,2012-11-06,"Your current interest in metaphysics deepens now, possibly taking on many different forms, including studying religion or practicing meditation. This is also a great time to delve into the subconscious mind through dream work or therapy. Although your approach may be through direct action, it could be helpful to give yourself time to assimilate your experiences. Nothing is gained by trying to rush the spiritual lessons you're learning."
taurus,2012-11-06,"A problem may arise from a misunderstanding with a close friend or intimate partner today. Instead of just brushing it aside, it's wise to investigate the source of the disagreement and initiate a frank discussion about it now while the situation is still fresh. Thankfully, once you see where you went wrong it should be easier to clear the air and move on."
gemini,2012-11-06,Every person represents another opportunity to be distracted from what you really need to be doing today. But it may make more sense to stop running around and avoiding your commitments. You won't accomplish much unless you make a conscious decision to settle down. Concentrate on your most immediate tasks or you'll have to go back and redo what you should have done the first time around. Paying closer attention to details now prevents delays later on.
cancer,2012-11-06,It can be quite enjoyable when fantasies overtake reality today as long as you know when to call it quits. The key is to enjoy your mental meanderings without taking them too seriously. Don't act on your feelings now; you could run into trouble if you treat a dream as if it is real. There's nothing wrong with entertaining yourself in your imagination if you don't let it take over your life.
leo,2012-11-06,"You want to get things out into the open, but you may be fighting an uphill battle as a family member or someone close to you seems to be holding back something. The feeling of not knowing what's actually happening is confusing, but you might not want others to know you're disoriented. A vicious cycle of non-disclosure can only be broken when you boldly decide to openly share what's on your mind."
virgo,2012-11-06,"You need to be extra careful now as you plan your schedule because you can't afford to get behind. Nevertheless, your best intentions can fall short of your expectations due to an uncharacteristic inattention to the details today. Compensate for your current absentmindedness by writing everything down so you don't forget what you need to remember. Once you have the logistics of the day under control, you'll have more time to relax and enjoy yourself."
libra,2012-11-06,"You might not be able to prevent your mind from wandering all over the map now, even if you try really hard to concentrate. You may be distracted by adventurous dreams or social interests. However, it's not worth making yourself frazzled by biting off more than you can chew. Don't worry so much about what you accomplish today. Give yourself a gift and explore an enjoyable diversion instead."
scorpio,2012-11-06,"You want to do what's right today, but others may be trying to change your mind. It's great to be able to jump in and help someone with your skills, but not if you must sacrifice your core beliefs in the process. Be clear about your boundaries without issuing an ultimatum. Initiating an honest discussion could lead to an agreeable compromise for all involved."
sagittarius,2012-11-06,"Mercury turns retrograde in your sign today, creating the illusion of suspended time. However, your overconfidence may lead you to believe that you can accomplish nearly anything now. Unfortunately, you're likely to underestimate the complexity of a job and then might be disillusioned when you don't reach your goals. Be gentle with yourself and don't be overly concerned if everything takes longer than you think it should."
capricorn,2012-11-06,"You are a study in contradictions today as your thoughts soar into the highest spiritual realms of your imagination. However, you are simultaneously pulled into the shadows where you aren't nearly as confident. Paradoxically, you can be in both places at once, so there's no need to choose one path or the other. If you do, your reverie might come to an end and you'll be plunged back into the mundane world. Meanwhile, entertain all possibilities without becoming too attached to any one of them."
aquarius,2012-11-06,"Friends or coworkers can make trouble for you now, especially if you are impatient with them. You don't want to interact with those who might get in the way of your productivity, but avoidance may not be possible, either. Others are merely reflecting your own subconscious tendencies, so let go of your goals for a while and enjoy the ride. Surprisingly, relinquishing control today could help you accomplish more in the long run."
pisces,2012-11-06,"Instead of pushing forward on your career path today, it may be smarter to take a breather while you integrate recent experiences. Allowing yourself time to regroup and consolidate your resources during the weeks ahead is your best use of this Mercury retrograde phase. You will ultimately make more progress if you have the good sense to relax now while you can."
aries,2012-11-07,"Your desire to please others can lure you into complex conversations that ultimately don't go anywhere, so you may be better off focusing on your own happiness today. You have more to explain than can be put into words now. Everyone wants facts, but all you have are feelings. Spend your time with people who don't need fancy explanations or embark on an exploratory journey alone."
taurus,2012-11-07,"You see yourself as someone who is in charge today, and others may look to you for leadership, as well. Unfortunately, you might not want to be responsible for anyone except yourself because there are too many things out of your control. Rather than becoming frustrated by trying to manage everything, establish priorities and choose which activities could be set aside. Simplifying your life is the most critical thing you can do now."
gemini,2012-11-07,"You want to learn things that will help you get ahead, and you can be quite a dedicated student now. Your efforts to find such information, however, may not work out very well today. Try as you might, the facts just don't seem logical, yet this might not be the right time to dwell on analytical solutions. Instead, rely on your intuition until the rational data is more convincing."
cancer,2012-11-07,"You like to be accommodating and expect others to behave in the same manner. It seems only fair to make compromises in a relationship, but you could run into a stubborn individual today who resists your efforts. However, what you're experiencing now isn't the real source of the problem. Dig deeper and you'll get closer to finding the answers you seek."
leo,2012-11-07,An unexpected connection with someone special can make this a delightful day. Save some time to savor the simple sweetness of a loving partner or a good friend. You don't have to work hard for fun now because the joy is right in front you with no reason for struggle or trickery. The only thing you need to be willing to do today is share your time and heart.
virgo,2012-11-07,"Finding pleasure in an activity that increases your self-esteem is a good idea today. There's no need to worry about perfection or even about getting the task done now. The secret to your current success is to indulge your feelings, rather than just analyzing all your options. This is not about meeting goals in the future, but fully experiencing the present moment. Beauty is the guiding force that can make this a sweet day for you."
libra,2012-11-07,"Although you may struggle for a bit, your persistence is rewarded today as you find friends who support your choices. You can turn this day into a special one by being open to unexpected twists and turns that pull you away from work and toward social engagements. However, even if you have a lot on your plate now, a brief escape to recharge your energy will do you a world of good."
scorpio,2012-11-07,"You may want to demonstrate your ability to work well with others, but you could run out of patience today before you accomplish your task. It might seem as if everyone is flying off in different directions without thinking about a common cause. Naturally, you can't fix everything all on your own, yet you could make yourself crazy trying. Go easy on your judgments; it's more important now to get along than to reach your goal."
sagittarius,2012-11-07,"You have an easy way of expressing yourself that gives others a sense of comfort. However, conversations won't likely go in the direction you desire today. You need to relinquish your control; things will change for the better if you can float with the flow instead of fighting it. Don't frustrate yourself by trying to finish what you start now. There will be plenty of time for that later on."
capricorn,2012-11-07,"You may be uncomfortable with the behavior of close friends or associates today, but attempts to straighten them out will only make matters worse. Instead of trying to control anyone else's actions, change your attitude. A more spiritual approach to life helps reduce the overall tension. When you accept others as they are, they will support you in return."
aquarius,2012-11-07,"Everyone seems to be putting on a show now that the lively Leo Moon is dancing through your 7th House of Others. However, you might feel as if they are overstepping your boundaries as they express their feelings. Although you like your personal space, being open to an unexpected conversation may lead to a new friendship. Magic can happen today if you leave your old assumptions behind."
pisces,2012-11-07,"Think twice before opening your mouth today, for it's all too easy to say the first thing that comes to mind and then regret it very quickly. However difficult it is to restrain yourself, it is wise to keep certain subjects off limits at this time. Whether it's inappropriate gossip or incorrect information, communication is both the problem and the solution now."
aries,2012-11-08,"Although you might not go anywhere special today, you will likely be thinking of journeying to faraway lands and distant galaxies as messenger Mercury in your 9th House activates your inner explorer. Watching a travelogue or enjoying foods from other cultures could be enough to satisfy your wanderlust now, so don't try to make your dreams come true yet. Knowing when to turn a fantasy into reality can make the difference between disappointment and happiness."
taurus,2012-11-08,"Big ideas about pursuing emotional interests sound intriguing on paper, but they may fade quickly if you actually engage in an emotional conflict. You want an easier exchange of feelings, but are confronted with a different point of view today. If you have the courage to stay in the conversation, you might just receive the intimate connection you were seeking all along."
gemini,2012-11-08,"A partner or a friend may tell you more about his or her opinions now than you want to know. Although others mean well, they won't necessarily stop long enough to find out if you are even interested in what they are saying. Sometimes, you are attracted to having as much information as possible, but today you could be wishing that you didn't know so much. Your best strategy is to politely change the topic of conversation when you get the chance."
cancer,2012-11-08,"You have to limit your thinking to things that really matter today so you can take care of your obligations. Nevertheless, you are still tempted to escape from the pressures of work by imagining what you could be doing instead. Luckily, your chance of finding a pleasurable distraction without negatively impacting your production continues to grow throughout the day."
leo,2012-11-08,Financial limitations might put a crimp in your party plans now that the Moon is dancing through your 2nd House of Money. It may be that you don't have enough funds to play in the style you prefer. But a shortage of time is another thing that could prevent you from spontaneously engaging in an activity just for the fun of it. Re-evaluate your resources before spending what you don't have. Generosity of spirit can be demonstrated in a multitude of ways without costing a cent.
virgo,2012-11-08,"Although you might want to have some friends over for a social gathering or head out on the town for some fun, family responsibilities will have to come first. Others are depending on you now and you don't want to let them down. Nevertheless, quit being so hard on yourself if you cannot fulfill everyone's expectations. Anyone who matters can easily tell that your heart is in the right place."
libra,2012-11-08,"You could toss your schedule aside today, preferring to be more spontaneous, but it will be difficult to drop your previous commitments. Others may not realize how much you have decided to take on, for you can appear quite cavalier about it all. Unfortunately, you are your own worst critic now. Finding a middle ground between being extremely productive and being totally lazy is your best strategy."
scorpio,2012-11-08,Today you're only interested in social interactions that deepen your understanding of life and your spiritual purpose. Build flexibility into your plans so you can change your mind at the last minute if you desire. It's not that you are avoiding others; it's just that enjoying a bit of quiet time may be more appealing than being with a group of people. Listen to your inner voice and don't let anyone talk you into something you don't want to do.
sagittarius,2012-11-08,"You may spend more of the day in service to others than you prefer, but there probably isn't a way to avoid your responsibilities today. Fortunately, mental Mercury's back-stepping in your sign helps you to maintain a positive demeanor. You'll likely be seen as the hero who saves the day by going the extra mile if you temporarily set your own needs aside."
capricorn,2012-11-08,"You are lucky that big things come in small packages today, for your attention span is limited by your previous obligations. Nevertheless, within this confined role, you still have an infinite amount of space to wander around in the far reaches of your imagination. Taking care of business can be productive, even when you are lost in your fantasies. Playing in both worlds fuels your creativity and your success at the same time."
aquarius,2012-11-08,"A fresh wave of energy washes into your life today and you may be feeling quite upbeat about upcoming social activities. Unfortunately, your cheery optimism runs into practical considerations that prevent you from doing everything you want. Don't let discouragement overtake your enthusiasm. Instead, just remember that good things come to those who wait."
pisces,2012-11-08,"It could be a real challenge to keep your goals in check as your plans for the next few weeks run away with you. Instead of arguing with someone who tries to help you see the folly of your ways, listen carefully to what they have to say. It's not that you won't accomplish much now; it's just that there's no need to bite off more than you can chew."
aries,2012-11-09,"Things are looking up today, but there may be background stress in your life that will not magically disappear. Even if you have too much going on now, you still should be able to find time for enjoyment without necessarily going into denial about everything else. You have a wonderful ability to be in the present moment. Use it wisely and prepare for what's coming instead of just frittering away your day."
taurus,2012-11-09,"You have everything in place to create a great day because your key planet Venus receives a fabulous trine from confident Jupiter today. Take the good times as they come now, for they won't last forever. However, there is no reason to be afraid of what is around the bend. Focus your energy on practical ways to make your life more bountiful. You deserve to be happy so soak in the positive vibrations while you can."
gemini,2012-11-09,"An unusual set of circumstances today is pulling you willingly into an emotional situation. Although at other times you might lightheartedly avoid this type of interaction, you are currently more than ready to express your heart. What you gain from engaging with others now supplies you with both pleasure and meaning that will stick with you for a long time to come."
cancer,2012-11-09,"Although you are riding a wave of unexpressed feelings that may be rising to the surface, they are not strong enough to pull you away from the sweeter side of life. However, negative expectations can prevent you from having a memorable experience. Remain open to the love that is all around you, even if you are wary of it changing into something different from what you ultimately desire."
leo,2012-11-09,"Good news is heading your way now, but you must be open to the message or it could pass by unnoticed. Romantic love may be involved, but the rewards are less emotional than practical. You might even be lucky enough to receive an unexpected cash windfall. Whatever the benefits, don't expect them to last. Everything can feel wonderful for a while, but it is transient -- so don't try to hold on to the feeling too tightly."
virgo,2012-11-09,"Even if you're stressing about your inconvenient feelings, you probably should go ahead and express them anyhow. Although emotional disclosure isn't your normal style, you feel safe enough now to take more of a chance with your heart. However, the problem is that once you begin to share today, it may be difficult to know when to stop. Start by stirring up whatever seems most stuck and your words will catalyze the process."
libra,2012-11-09,"It doesn't seem to matter what happens today, it will all turn out OK. Your key planet, sweet Venus, now harmonizing with permissive Jupiter, encourages you to indulge your senses. But don't just idly sit around eating candy and let this day float by. Manifest the beauty that lives in your dreams; pursuing a spiritual path opens a whole new world to your creative imagination."
scorpio,2012-11-09,"Even in difficult situations, your emotional awareness remains the key to your happiness. However, achieving material success can be a problem from time to time. Do whatever makes you feel good about yourself and the money will follow. There still may be some hard things that must be said today, but if you can express them with love, it should all work out for the best. Don't push your agenda; you'll know when the time is right."
sagittarius,2012-11-09,"Your key planet, Jupiter, is receiving a lovely boost of inspiration now from creative Venus. Even if you've been having a tough time recently, it's hard to stay in a negative place today. Additionally, others are more likely to be optimistic while in your presence. And, for this simple reason, they might seek you out, putting you on the most wanted list -- not for punishment, but rather for fun and games. Enjoy the heightened notoriety and kick up your heels while you can."
capricorn,2012-11-09,"A quiet sense of self-satisfaction temporarily releases you from the stressful situations you've been encountering lately. Your coworkers and superiors see you as more graceful and charming today. You are able to encourage others and this optimism is reflected back at you. Your people skills are now supported by a sense of good timing. Channel your positivity into collaborative efforts, and if others want to help you -- let them."
aquarius,2012-11-09,"This is an instant karma kind of day and reality will most likely rule in your favor. However, don't push your luck too far. If you take unfair advantage of anyone, the reaction may be swift. Give yourself permission to receive the love that's being offered now, without trying to turn it into something more. Find satisfaction in what you have, rather than longing for what you don't."
pisces,2012-11-09,"If unexpected events have recently shocked you awake, it's time to relax a bit now. Enjoy your newfound freedom by being receptive to the positive reinforcement and encouragement that is coming your way. Be grateful about the good news you receive today. Opportunity may be knocking, but remember that it is up to you to open the door and let it in."
aries,2012-11-10,"You may be very thankful for those friends and partners who support you even when you're acting like a pain in the neck. But others still demand a lot from you and they'll give you their opinions today, even if you don't ask for them. You are confident that you are doing the right thing now and don't want anyone to question you. However, remaining open to constructive feedback can help you achieve better results in nearly anything you do."
taurus,2012-11-10,"You may have a lot of chores on your plate today, yet find it difficult to get started. Part of your problem might stem from your easygoing attitude; you believe that you can easily accomplish everything because you tend to underestimate the time tasks will take. Ask someone to help you correctly gauge the job before saying yes so you don't find yourself in over your head."
gemini,2012-11-10,"Your hands-off management style works well for you today as long as your co-workers agree with your plan. However, they might not tell you if they don't -- and their reluctance to communicate can be problematic. You may go along believing that everyone is on board and supporting you, only to find out that your ship has been abandoned. Avoid unnecessary drama now by checking up on others often throughout the day."
cancer,2012-11-10,"You might not realize there are conflicts at home today until they develop into a minor crisis. Paying attention to the details can help you see past your illusions of perfection. Instead of avoiding unpleasant feelings, remember that you are not the only participant, even if you are intimately involved in the situation. Everyone has his or her own particular role to play in the drama."
leo,2012-11-10,"Your weekend is already in full swing and you're more than ready to enjoy yourself. Perhaps you have been burning the candle at both ends and now think that you deserve a well-earned rest. However, unexpected obstacles keep getting in your way. You will be better able to relax if you clear the responsibilities from your path first."
virgo,2012-11-10,"You can be too generous in your approach to finances today, making you a lousy negotiator. You might even be tempted to give away the bank. It's easy to forget that some decisions about money should not be made with your heart. Just because you like a particular salesperson, this doesn't mean you should pay more than a service or product is worth. Keep your wallet in your pocket until your logic returns."
libra,2012-11-10,"Even if you have been rather lazy for the last couple of days, you emerge from your go-with-the-flow phase today. You're more opinionated now and can overreact to others without realizing that anything is wrong. Nevertheless, don't be afraid of saying what's on your mind. Your perceptions are keen and you would be smart to trust your impulses as long as you remember to be kind in your delivery."
scorpio,2012-11-10,"You may feel pressured to tie up loose ends early in the day, and this does make good sense. But you probably won't want to work much now that the reflective Moon is visiting your 12th House of Escapism. You would be better off spending some quiet time alone, taking a nature walk or sharing an intimate moment with someone special. Even if it's challenging to settle down your emotions, it's easier to process them when you're not in a crowd."
sagittarius,2012-11-10,"Your social inclinations are strong today, yet you might have trouble deciding exactly what to do. You don't want to miss out on any fun now, making it difficult to commit to one event or another. You even have the ability to turn a relaxing interaction with a friend into something that's a lot more fun. Balancing work and play is smarter now than completely avoiding your responsibilities."
capricorn,2012-11-10,"You could play the role of a highly skilled diplomat today, because you can clearly see both sides of a complex issue. Additionally, you have analytical tools at your disposal to take what you know and shape it into a convincing argument. But don't fall into the trap of choosing sides now; instead, help all those involved reach common ground. Your objective outlook is the catalyst to positive change."
aquarius,2012-11-10,"It's challenging to keep your mind in the here and now when your thoughts are being drawn somewhere else. This futuristic thinking enhances your ability to make plans, but may not have anything to do with the chores you must accomplish today. Nevertheless, if you have been dreaming about taking a vacation, get out your calendar and start to make it happen. Just return to the present moment when reality calls."
pisces,2012-11-10,"Even a casual interaction can feel very intense today as the Moon in your 8th House of Intimacy dynamically squares relentless Pluto. You might wonder if something has changed because everyone seems more formidable now. Don't let the demands of others overwhelm you. Ultimately, delivering the goods is less important than you think. What counts more is your integrity and intention."
aries,2012-11-11,"You may try to patch up the torn spots in your life today, especially those concerning people you really like. Luckily, all interactions are easier  because the indulgent Libra Moon helps you to be sweet and gentle. However, you must be careful since you can eat, drink, or spend too much in the process of making amends. It's smarter to exercise a little self-restraint now instead of feeling regret afterward."
taurus,2012-11-11,"You have the potential for a quiet yet productive day, and could even enjoy keeping busy. The noise level has probably settled down and your thoughts are more internalized now. Be grateful that you can get on with the everyday tasks of your life, especially since returning to your normal routine may be a real source of pleasure."
gemini,2012-11-11,"It's a relatively lighthearted day, but even if you have more serious issues to resolve you can still find time for a bit of relaxation today. Fortunately, you are motivated to work through any difficult situations now because you don't like the tension that lingers from unspoken feelings. Once everything is out in the open, it will be much easier to enjoy the company of others."
cancer,2012-11-11,"It's hard to maintain a healthy perspective on relationships today because you have so many conflicting emotions pulling you in different directions. But instead of trying to analyze every feeling and choose one path through the confusing landscape, temporarily allow yourself to meander around without a goal. When you have no destination at all, you are OK wherever you are in each moment. Take your bearings and set new priorities again tomorrow."
leo,2012-11-11,"If there is something important that you were waiting to say, wait no longer. Make that phone call, send that email or schedule that meeting. Your ability to express your feelings is assisted by sweet Venus, enabling you to communicate about a difficult topic in a pleasant manner. Just keep in mind your energy may be more intense than your audience can handle, so you need to pay attention to your volume and tone. Coming across in a non-threatening manner minimizes the possibility of your disclosure stirring up a conflict."
virgo,2012-11-11,"An objective approach to finances today can help you sort through a complicated set of issues. Perhaps you have bills that are due and don't have the resources to pay them. Or maybe you are trying to make a decision with respect to an investment opportunity. Either way, be certain to review all the facts one more time before making any commitments."
libra,2012-11-11,"The romantic Libra Moon hooks up with sensual Venus today, highlighting your need to be appreciated by those you love. You may be at such ease in a supportive relationship that you lose your edge. However, once your defenses are down, someone's behavior could begin to grate on your nerves. Instead of trying to change anyone else, alter your own attitude now in the name of the common good."
scorpio,2012-11-11,"You could feel a bit let down today as the cosmic energies take a break from the high level of drama you have recently experienced. You might even worry that something has gone wrong, since intensity is your middle name. There's no need for concern; everything is exactly as it should be now. Let go of your preconceived notions and enjoy floating down the river for a while."
sagittarius,2012-11-11,"Although you probably have a lot going on socially now, you might feel lazy enough to just stay home and relax. Fortunately, this is a great time to smooth over some of the ragged edges in your life. You may not be so frantic or impulsive now; allow temperance to enter your life. It's a smart idea to establish equilibrium and harmony when and where you can. Instead of being hard on yourself for a lack of productivity, just enjoy the peace and quiet while it lasts."
capricorn,2012-11-11,"So much unfolds exactly as planned now, and this is a welcome change from the recent topsy-turvy rollercoaster ride that you've been on. You Mountain Goats like it best when life runs on a tight schedule. However, awkward moments still can occur if a chummy coworker or boss invites you to a social event. This might stir up discomfort, for you tend to feel safer when boundaries are clearly defined. Instead of pushing others away because of old fears, openly discuss your current concerns with someone you trust."
aquarius,2012-11-11,"The high-strung cerebral energy of the day can be rather enjoyable for you. You may feel as if you are at the top of your game today. Things finally look like they are working out and moving in the right direction. There seems to be a healthy balance between the old and the new. Situations are stable enough now, but don't sacrifice your freedom for the sake of convenience. Your happiness depends on balancing your desire to be with others and your need for personal space."
pisces,2012-11-11,"Your emotions may be temporarily drying up now, yet your experience isn't necessarily unpleasant. Your deep feelings have simmered down under the heat of intense interactions. Instead of idly daydreaming on the sidelines, you have become a player in the game. Don't worry; the waters will return. In the meantime, take advantage of your temporary ability to reflect on your life in a detached manner and plan for your future."
aries,2012-11-12,"You may be required to face the consequences of your desires today. From a positive perspective this process can deepen a relationship, allowing you to grow more intimate with another person. It's about going further than you normally choose to go. However, difficulties arise if you try to blast through resistance without taking responsibility. Make the most of your time now by slowing down to address the softer side of the story."
taurus,2012-11-12,It seems as if nothing is simple now as powerful feelings impact your connections with others. Your current inclination to peel away the layers of the onion to see what's underneath can be a welcome opportunity to take a relationship to the next level. But dissatisfaction might be revealed that leads to renegotiating a partnership agreement or even ending it. Be courageous and accept the changes that are inevitable parts of life.
gemini,2012-11-12,"A task that you thought was already completed could require additional work now. If you rushed through it the first time around, expect to put more effort into it again today. This is an excellent time to do some maintenance, even if you are not very excited about the idea. Cleaning up at home or at work can bring satisfaction if you pick one job and do it thoroughly, rather than spreading your energy too thin."
cancer,2012-11-12,"Intensity is the keyword for the day, and there's no way you just want to kick back and relax. Power and passion can bring fulfillment -- and this means taking risks with your heart, even if the situation is complex. Life doesn't have to be simple now to be good. Romance may shine brightly on your horizon today because you're capable of discovering new heights of pleasure with the right partner."
leo,2012-11-12,"Expect to face issues of power and control now, especially in family dynamics. You might see a potential conflict as a difficult situation that must be avoided, but it can also be a rare opportunity to break unconscious patterns that limit your choices. Be fearless and know that greatness comes from addressing the toughest issues with frank openness, rather than avoiding them as a matter of pride."
virgo,2012-11-12,"Sometimes strategically telling a secret is quite useful, but it can also be very dangerous. The risk is that while you get closer to one person, you might lose the trust of others who are not included in the conversation. The positive side is that you may receive objective insights from someone who has a very clear take on the issues. Use your keen analytical mind today to make sense out of a previously mysterious situation."
libra,2012-11-12,"Although it's the start of the workweek, your mind may be set on doing some serious shopping today. You have an eye for bargains that will help you spot a real deal. This is perfect for hitting thrift stores or buying antiques, and even if it's not your style to argue over prices, you can be an extra successful negotiator now. Put your money sense to work for you and buy something that appreciates in value and makes you happy."
scorpio,2012-11-12,"Although differences of opinion are normal, you don't need to escalate them into outright conflict today. You're the passionate type who doesn't take a half-hearted approach, giving you strength of vision when things get tough. But this intensity can also trap you in an extreme position now. Keep an open mind and a healthy sense of humor. Remember, it isn't worth damaging a relationship just to make your point."
sagittarius,2012-11-12,"Although your motto might be live and let live, it seems like you could lose some of your easygoing attitude today. Even a simple conversation can build in intensity and volume until tempers grow out of control. Naturally, you have a right to your opinions, but nothing is gained by getting upset now. Keep things on friendly terms or just drop the subject for a while. Make a peaceful exit from the scene before blowing your cool."
capricorn,2012-11-12,"Others seem to make situations more difficult today, especially if you are inflexible in your attitude. You prefer to stick with your plan, but should prepare yourself to make adjustments if you want to avoid conflict. Don't use force to get your way; instead, step back and try to understand the opposing viewpoint. You may not agree with the ideas, but you can maintain harmony now if you respectfully listen to what's being said."
aquarius,2012-11-12,"You are a great believer in freedom and individuality. Exerting power over other people might not interest you, but you have responsibilities today that require you to step up to the plate and be a leader. Working within specific structures can succeed if the rest of the group shares your enthusiasm for the cause. You may be able to accomplish the impossible now with a dedicated team effort."

Your faith and spirituality help create a larger context to balance a sense of loss. Although a situation may seem hopeless, your innate wisdom is comforting to those in need. Trust in your ability to reduce pain and suffering, even if you feel like you're not doing all that much now."
aries,2012-11-13,"Although today's Scorpio New Moon Eclipse stimulates your 8th House of Intimacy, it's still difficult to speak your desires aloud. However, what you don't say may have more impact now than what is actually said. If your feelings seem isolated from your conversations, make a conscious choice to include them in your story. Take a chance by telling a loved one what you really need."
taurus,2012-11-13,"You want to keep things simple now, but your most important relationships may be growing beyond your control. Your interactions have hidden layers of complexity as the magnetic Scorpio Solar Eclipse activates your 7th House of Partners.

cancer,2012-11-13,"Don't get discouraged today, even if it feels like everything has come to a standstill. Whether you know it or not, you are on the edge of a big breakthrough; however, you will have to take initiative to make it happen. The Scorpio Solar Eclipse polarizes your 5th House of Love and Creativity, suggesting that something exciting is about to open up on the romantic front. Even if you are eager with anticipation, remember that nothing happens overnight."
leo,2012-11-13,"Your emotions may be at odds with your actions today, adding tension to your most personal relationships. Your tendency now is to withhold deep feelings while you smile and just do whatever is necessary to keep the peace. However, the Scorpio Solar Eclipse rattles your 4th House of Security, making this a tough time if you don't acknowledge your current desires. Protecting your heart seems like a good idea, but you might regret it later on."
virgo,2012-11-13,"You have been planning long enough; it's now time to start talking about your ideas with others. The Scorpio New Moon Eclipse activates your 3rd House of Communication, so get your best thoughts out into the open because they don't do any good running around inside your head. There may not be a better time to initiate passionate discussions about what you want to do next in your life, so seize the moment before it passes."
libra,2012-11-13,"You can't share everything that's important to you without upsetting the stability of your life now that the Scorpio Solar Eclipse is shaking your 2nd House of Self-Esteem. Unfortunately, keeping crucial information to yourself creates a ripple effect, and the subtle disturbances can easily build into destructive waves. Once you better understand your own core values you'll know exactly what you want to say."
scorpio,2012-11-13,"This New Moon Eclipse in your sign symbolizes the initiation process you may now experience. With buoyant Jupiter in the picture, you could be feeling upbeat about the life-changing possibilities that are before you. But you cannot let go of the shadows on a whim, so analyze what you are holding on to and why you're still resistant to change. After you understand the source of your motivation, the next steps become even easier to take."
sagittarius,2012-11-13,The Scorpio New Moon Eclipse in your 12th House of Spirituality may keep you somewhat detached from emotional involvements because you recognize that your boundaries aren't strong now. You might be more vulnerable than usual and feel the need to protect yourself from others. Go ahead and retreat to do the deep soul searching that is required. Don't judge yourself harshly if you aren't ready to share your feelings with anyone else yet. Trust that you will know when the time is right.
capricorn,2012-11-13,"Focus your attention back on the outer world now that the Scorpio New Moon Eclipse activates your 11th House of Social Networking.

Use this personalized tool to stay on track as you move toward fulfilling your most vital dreams.
aries,2012-11-14,"You often want more independence, but you also need relationships to provide you with an opposing point of view. Now, however, you may be unsure of the validity of what someone tells you. Keep in mind that you could be missing an important piece of information today; don't be so quick to defend your position instead of just listening to what others are saying first."
taurus,2012-11-14,You may feel dazed and confused today when you realize that your feet are not as firmly planted on the ground as you like. You can't quite put all the pieces together into a sensible picture. Something is different and you might not be comfortable with the new emotional landscape. Don't push yourself to change everything all at once; give yourself time to adjust to the shifting circumstances.
gemini,2012-11-14,"The power of your positive thoughts can save you from a difficult situation today, yet it still might be hard to hold on to your dream. You may be concerned about taking a good idea too far now because your limits aren't clear and it's hard to know where to draw the line. Although you might be able to get away with a bit more than usual, nothing will be gained by projecting your reality on to anyone else."
cancer,2012-11-14,"It's tempting to become too attached to your opinions today, which could actually get in the way of having an in-depth discussion. Nevertheless, don't be so concerned with defending your ideas; just put them out there and then be open to the ensuing dialogue. Remember, your vulnerability is the key to a deeper and more satisfying connection."
leo,2012-11-14,"Doing the right thing today can quickly bail you out of a tricky situation at home, but you may also need to acknowledge your role in helping to create the mess. Even if others are involved, solving this dilemma is basically up to you. Make an extra effort to listen carefully and to say exactly what you mean when you speak."
virgo,2012-11-14,"Although you probably don't like being called picky, you have a propensity to be very analytical when you focus your mind on a sticky problem. However, the details won't likely interest you now as you're more enchanted with the spells of nebulous Neptune than you are with the minutiae. Instead of being logical today, immerse yourself into the touchy-feely part of life. You'll be more content once you relax and let your imagination wander."
libra,2012-11-14,"You would like to transform your feelings into creative expressions now that Venus is visiting beautiful Libra. However, you may lack common sense today while expressing your artistic side. Balance, of course, is your specialty, so it's up to you to find a way to get your feet back on the ground so you can make something of lasting value."
scorpio,2012-11-14,"Your unexpressed fears can be aroused by what you hear on the news today, yet it's not really these concerns that bother you the most. You sense that your feelings are sinking into the shadows and you might be afraid that circumstances are working against you. But they are not, so put your suspicions to rest. Trust the glimmer of hope that arrives now, for it reveals the shining potential just ahead."
sagittarius,2012-11-14,"It's difficult to acknowledge your insecurities today, especially if you are unclear where your fantasies end and reality begins. You may try to steer clear of all situations that make you feel unsure of yourself, but avoidance only increases your confusion. Thankfully, circumstances should improve once your feelings are out in the open. However, real change takes time to manifest, so try not to expect too much too fast."
capricorn,2012-11-14,"Your friends or coworkers may invite you to an event that appears fairly straightforward at first, yet the dynamics becomes more complex as you get involved.

aquarius,2012-11-14,"There are no obvious resolutions to a career-oriented problem that continues to linger, even if you think you can see a way out today.

pisces,2012-11-14,Avoid the temptation to fill in too many details on your calendar since planning ahead may not be as effective as you wish today. Taking time for spiritual rejuvenation is a smart idea and goes a long way to reducing your stress level. Have faith that your intuition will guide you to your proper destination at exactly the right moment.
aries,2012-11-15,"If you're invited to join others on an adventure today, it's tempting to just say yes when you really should say no. Naturally, you could argue that you deserve to overdo it a little when you are feeling good. This might be true, but a little intelligent self-restraint goes a long way toward saving you from a headache. Politely declining now doesn't mean you can't find a different way to have fun later on."
taurus,2012-11-15,"It's challenging to get into the groove of working today, especially if the anticipation of an exciting experience is already pulling you toward the weekend. Pursuing pleasure sounds like a good idea, but it probably won't pay the bills. Be your own boss; don't wait for someone else to tell you what to do. The fun will be waiting for you once your job is done."
gemini,2012-11-15,"Your friends and coworkers may be more positive in their current outlook than you, which can make it difficult to just go along with their plans. Your internal resistance might stem from fears of going too far, rather than any specific negativity. Nevertheless, reaching beyond your regular limits can be quite rewarding today. Perhaps the dark clouds really do have silver linings now."
cancer,2012-11-15,Conflicts between current responsibilities and your desire for long-term freedom can trigger your anxieties today because it seems the two are irreconcilable. You could relieve the pressure by deciding there is no need to choose one or the other. Take care of the most important details right away while continuing to plan for the future.
leo,2012-11-15,"You might have settled into a frustrating pattern where it seems as if others are not as clear with you as you are with them. This problem could be even greater today as your desires run into this same dilemma of uncertainty. Instead of leaning on someone's feedback for your direction now, just follow your own heart wherever it leads."
virgo,2012-11-15,"You like to be concise in your communications and precise in your definitions, especially when it comes to your job. Now, however, it's more difficult to know exactly what's going on. Even if the lack of clarity is bothering you, don't push for more specificity than is currently available. The details will become apparent just in time."
libra,2012-11-15,"Your key planet Venus encourages you to act nicely to everyone, but being an entertainment director only adds to your stress today. Thankfully, you should be able to turn the pressure into a creative flow. But this isn't necessarily about making something artistic; instead of focusing on production, work your magic in a relationship that needs your special attention now."
scorpio,2012-11-15,"Although you may have plenty of work already on your plate, your inner world is brimming with new ideas that can increase your income. Don't let yourself get so distracted by the demands of daily production today that you don't have time to think about ways to improve your life.

sagittarius,2012-11-15,"Even if you think that you have reached the top, a higher peak on another mountain comes into view today. If you believed that you already maxed out, now you might realize that even more is possible.

Stop for a moment and just be proud of your achievements, instead of trying to reach even higher."
capricorn,2012-11-15,"A political idea or a philosophical belief can become so important to you now that you start obsessing over it. You could even slip into denial about something quite important. It's possible to get yourself into financial difficulties rather quickly today if you don't pay attention to the bottom line. Don't let your imagination run away with your stability. Ultimately, you're better off trusting your innate common sense over temporary pie-in-the-sky dreaming."
aquarius,2012-11-15,"You may be feeling more optimistic about your long-term goals today, but your chances of getting exactly what you want aren't quite as good as they seem. Your tendency now is to avoid problems, even if it's by denial. Confronting the truth isn't always fun, but it's exactly what you need at this time. Act on facts, not fantasy, to achieve greater success."
pisces,2012-11-15,"Someone who appears to be your ally now might not be as friendly as you think. Tread cautiously because it's likely that you aren't getting the whole picture today. It's not that others are actually against you; it's more likely that they're waiting to see if you'll be able to deliver on your promises. Instead of worrying about who's on your side and who's not, just do the best you can to ensure that you'll receive the cooperation you want."
aries,2012-11-16,"You have been doing some serious thinking about your life recently. Although your inquiry isn't coming to an end today, your search for meaning begins to shift gears. Understanding the truth is a good place to start, but now the emphasis shifts to getting ahead as assertive Mars enters your 10th House of Career. The time for theory is past, so be ready to practice what you think."
taurus,2012-11-16,"Relationships might seem fated today as circumstances take on a life of their own. Your actions may require some time to build momentum, so don't waste energy exerting control over others. Instead of trying to prevent the inevitable now, embrace the upcoming changes. There are more exciting opportunities ahead than you can currently imagine."
gemini,2012-11-16,"You may not be able to escape the hard work that must be done now, so save the fast talking for another day. Your witty repartee might be misinterpreted as passive-aggressive behavior, even if you don't feel any anger at all. Instead of spinning your wheels on avoidance tactics today, just jump into your chores. The sooner you start, the more relaxation time you'll have later."
cancer,2012-11-16,"You know what you want to do now, but obstacles may prevent you from reaching your goal. Honoring previous commitments might limit your fun today, even if your idea of enjoyment is to simply hang out at home with a loved one. Don't fret if your satisfaction is delayed. Be assured that you'll receive your rewards, just not when you expect them."
leo,2012-11-16,"You're exploring fantasies today that may have unresolved hurt associated with them. Allow yourself the luxury of remembering your past without getting hung up on what caused you pain. You will soon be involved with new and pleasurable experiences, so just let your thoughts unwind freely for now."
virgo,2012-11-16,"It's challenging today to separate the useful items on your action plan from those that won't be as effective. Although everything seems like an urgent matter now, there's just too much to do. Even if setting priorities is hard work, sort through what you know and set aside everything but the most essential tasks. Relying on the basics enables you to make the best choices."
libra,2012-11-16,"If you have been delaying an important financial decision, it may be best to let the unfinished business take its own course for a while. Obviously, it's wise to pay your bills on time, yet it's not always smart to force a decision that can wait until you have more clarity. You are likely being drawn into a professional drama that could take a few months to completely play through. Let go of control and allow circumstances to show you the best course of action."
scorpio,2012-11-16,"Your intensity increases as your key planet Mars shifts into your 3rd House of Communication. Others may be hesitant to cross you in this powerful state, so they just might go along with your plan.

Nevertheless, ultimatums won't work; gentle persuasion is smarter, sweeter and more successful."
sagittarius,2012-11-16,"Partnerships may be growing stronger these days, but you still could have serious issues to confront. It's important not to let your frustration get the best of you as you stay focused on long-term goals. The days ahead mark a turning point as your subconscious mind sends you powerful messages about the future. Don't get too excited; steady persistence is more important this week than unrestrained enthusiasm."
capricorn,2012-11-16,Your somber approach to the world might feel more comfortable to you now than it does to others. Your pragmatic reserve brings up issues for those who would rather you act in a more happy-go-lucky manner. But it won't help if you put on a smiling face just to please someone else. Stick with what your instincts tell you and be yourself.
aquarius,2012-11-16,"Your actions may have more impact today than you realize, since you aren't even sure anyone is paying attention to you. Nevertheless, you could mislead someone with your words if your logic isn't supported by what you feel in your heart now. Still, you know you must speak your truth, for this is what matters most."
pisces,2012-11-16,"No one's going to be able to get anything past you today. Still, you wonder how deep to dig in order to uncover the hidden facts. Your attitude makes a big difference now, for it doesn't work to tell someone what you think they need to know. On the other hand, if you can demonstrate an alternative perspective without sounding self-righteous, then you can help others by expanding their horizons."
aries,2012-11-17,"Recent promises become more pressing today, requiring you to do the right thing, but your desires may distort your sense of reality. You think you know what to do, but your thoughts could be so overrun with irrational fears and desires that you head off in the wrong direction. Ask for advice and listen to it before you set your course."
taurus,2012-11-17,"You may believe that your mastery of detail is on point today, but it's easy to skip over a critical piece of data. Others will appreciate your sincerity even in the most casual interactions. Thankfully, you don't have to sell your ideas; instead, just imagine yourself as teaching people to better understand your vision of tomorrow. Keep an open mind so you can incorporate what you learn as you go."
gemini,2012-11-17,"You like having enough freedom to improvise, but you may not have this luxury today. You might possibly push back against authority, but you could wear yourself out in the process. This is like a training exercise that helps you develop your talents through a concentrated effort. A little self-discipline now enables you to grow more than you expect."
cancer,2012-11-17,"Balancing your needs with those of others can be a major issue today. You want to be caring and compassionate, but you also must establish clear limits. Unfortunately, this process isn't as straightforward as a simple yes or no. Exploring the full range of possibilities between the extremes makes relationships easier to manage now."

What's most important when facing your chores now is to be humble and just do the best you can."
virgo,2012-11-17,"Your natural sense of discrimination allows you to be very creative today by screening out extraneous distractions. The ambitious Capricorn Moon's presence in your 5th House of Play enables you to enjoy expressing yourself while still being productive. Go ahead and proudly demonstrate your skills. Even if you don't achieve your goal, you can still learn a valuable lesson by taking a risk."
libra,2012-11-17,"Take care of your basic needs today before doing anything else because this gives you a sense of much-needed security. Pay close attention to your family, as outsiders might distract you from what's most important. You may be able to impress others now, but don't make that your primary goal. Instead, stick to the essentials to get the most out of this day."
scorpio,2012-11-17,"Relying on your common sense is your best bet now, since it gives you the ability to see patterns where others see chaos. However, you might find it difficult to get anyone else to understand your intentions, so take your time and cover the details step by step. Fortunately, the Sun's conjunction with retrograde Mercury in your sign enables you to communicate your position effectively as long as you don't rush the process of telling your story."
sagittarius,2012-11-17,"The Moon's visit to your 2nd House of Resources reminds you that managing your money is actually a matter of self-respect. You may prefer to have the freedom to ignore your financial responsibilities at times. Nevertheless, when you take control of your budget, you might actually wind up having more cash to spend. Be patient; doing less is better now than doing too much."
capricorn,2012-11-17,"The receptive Moon in your hardworking sign prompts you to feel extra sensitive today. However, it also brings on feelings of heightened responsibility, possibly based on guilt. Although you're not immune to experiencing low self-esteem, an honest show of emotions could be helpful. Remember, revealing your vulnerability to someone you trust is actually a sign of inner strength."
aquarius,2012-11-17,"Your powers of observation are quite strong today, as long as you trust your instincts. However, there's no need to worry about every little thing down to the tiniest detail. Instead, back away from your regular routines so that you can gain a wider perspective on your life. Ask for help; wisdom might come from someone who you consider to be a valuable mentor."
pisces,2012-11-17,"Sometimes you exhibit more compassion for others than you do for yourself. Fortunately, you can be a great friend for someone you want to get to know better by offering calm and practical advice today. Remember, some of the difficulties you've recently had are now your most powerful sources of insight. Integrating your own experiences into the present moment empowers you to communicate with more conviction."
aries,2012-11-18,"Supporting a cause can be challenging and your abrupt actions may actually create some hurt feelings today. It's fine to have differences of opinion as long as your disagreements remain civil in tone. Mercury's retrograde prompts misunderstandings that could send a discussion in a totally unproductive direction, so listen carefully to what others are saying now before you go too far."
taurus,2012-11-18,"Your ability to act responsibly may be tested today, especially if your friends want to express their independence. But giving orders won't work because no one seems to understand your true motivation now. Everyone is looking for explanations, so be prepared to have valid reasons for whatever you do. Take your time and explain your strategy rather than bossing people around. Cultivating a team attitude is your current route to success."
gemini,2012-11-18,"Your busy brain has a life of its own today as it processes ideas that flood in from all directions. You enjoy the mental buzz, although you might not be very productive now as exotic people from faraway places prove to be quite distracting. Exploring other worlds is a worthwhile endeavor, even if it doesn't fit into your current schedule."

Set aside more serious demands and make it a priority to enjoy yourself now. Remember that life cannot always be measured in terms of what you accomplish. Sometimes it's simply about joyfully living in the moment and cherishing the people that matter most."

Tackle the toughest tasks now because you have the determination to resolve them and the fortitude to finish what you start."
sagittarius,2012-11-18,"You may have a fantastic idea that motivates you to change your priorities today. Being inspired is exhilarating, but try to maintain a healthy perspective or you could get carried away by an unrealistic vision. Before you create problems by promising more than you can deliver, make sure that your feet are on the ground and you know exactly where you're going."
capricorn,2012-11-18,"You might be uncertain about how to manage your money now because it's challenging to balance practicality with innovation. You could become obsessed with a new high-tech gadget, but the cost may not justify the upgrade. Find other ways to satisfy your desires without breaking the bank. An imaginative approach to using the resources you already have can open up new avenues of financial opportunity."
aquarius,2012-11-18,"New ideas are normally exciting, yet today could be an extra special thrill as you learn a significant lesson. A very smart person may challenge you with a new perspective that makes you uncomfortable at first. Nevertheless, you crave the intellectual stimulation.

Getting out in nature today may be a great way to find the relaxation you currently crave. Fresh air can lift your spirits and infuse your soul with much needed inspiration."
aries,2012-11-19,"You may believe that gathering more information is a smart idea today, but additional data won't help you make a better decision.

Even if it feels as if you can't start until you understand everything, you probably already know enough to get the ball rolling."
taurus,2012-11-19,"Your career objectives may have been clear in your own mind, but that was before you set your plan into motion. Now it might appear that you've made the situation worse.

cancer,2012-11-19,"You may not understand why everything isn't going your way today, but you might be jumping to the wrong conclusions.

Remember, your words impact others more than you realize, so hold your thoughts to yourself until they transform into a more positive outlook."
leo,2012-11-19,"You could feel as if you're fighting an inner battle now, yet it may play out in a current relationship. Don't withdraw; facing a difficult issue with a close friend or partner is the best way to conquer your fears.

Fortunately, your new ideas will likely have greater potential for success."
virgo,2012-11-19,"You may be bored at work today, but still need to fulfill your obligations. Instead of doing your job the same old way, it might help to take a new approach. Even if it turns out that your experiment isn't as efficient as you wish, you'll still feel better that you tried something different. Ultimately, your frame of mind is more important now than how long it takes you to finish your job."
libra,2012-11-19,"Even if you are receiving encouragement everywhere you turn today, you still might not believe the good news you are hearing. It's difficult to trust the optimism of others because you, too, may be trying to make things sound better than they are now. Take the pressure off of the situation and just roll with the waves. Acknowledging the limitations of your logic frees you from the consequences of any temporary negativity."
scorpio,2012-11-19,"You might not get everything you want today, yet there are still plenty of opportunities to make the best of current circumstances. Part of your problem may be your inflated hopes, leading you to expect things to fall magically into place. Try not to put too much stock in anything that isn't working out, for the immediate changes you make now can bring deeper satisfaction down the road."
sagittarius,2012-11-19,"You don't like to place all your eggs in one basket. However, you may be so focused on specific tasks that certain aspects won't likely work out as expected. There is, however, a silver lining to this cloud. You might be able to dream your way to success if you can find a way to keep all the facts on the table while honoring your creative imagination."
capricorn,2012-11-19,"Everything seems to be blown out of proportion today, so it's challenging to find the right pace and stick to it. Even the littlest problem could become an insurmountable obstacle. Ironically, the big issues may not be threatening enough until you've run into them head first. Don't wait until it's too late; bring your thoughts out into the open where others can see your internal process. They will be more inclined to jump in with the support you need if they know what you're feeling."
aquarius,2012-11-19,"Sometimes you can appear disconnected from reality, but others usually don't know how far out your thoughts actually are. Now, as the Moon moves through your sign, you can surprise everyone with your uncanny brilliance. It's your turn to be the hero by finding a solution to a problem that others can't solve. Don't hold back. Think big today, and trust the original ideas that come to you no matter how weird they seem at first."
pisces,2012-11-19,"If you are justly accused of a wrongdoing today, quickly admit your guilt and ask for forgiveness. Don't make excuses or slip into denial. On the other hand, if you did nothing to precipitate the emotional outburst, the situation can be a bit stickier. Wait until you know all the facts before responding, for something may be going on that isn't yet out in the open."
aries,2012-11-20,"Your feelings are a bit fuzzy today and every time you dip in to test the emotional waters, you come back up with a different reading of what's happening. You're not happy about something now, but it's difficult to put your finger on the source of your worries. Be courageous and share your concerns with someone you trust, even if you don't know where the conversation may go."
taurus,2012-11-20,"Just as the truth begins to dawn on you today, it slips away as if it isn't ready to reveal itself yet. There are serious discussions that must take place first. Nevertheless, steer clear of the emotional landmines that might trigger conflicts about control and power. Listen to your instincts before expressing your heart."
gemini,2012-11-20,"It's crucial to stay on top of the details today, especially at work. Little things can be buried in ways that make them seem less obvious, but they are more important than you realize. Don't try anything underhanded, for your motives will be all too transparent. Too much information may be coming your way, but if you pay diligent attention now you should be able to put it all into place."
cancer,2012-11-20,"Today the focus is not on your external world. You are in touch with a very wide range of emotions that have pulled you into the rapidly changing currents. You might feel as if you're in over your head, but only if you dwell on the past too long. Supportive people are on your side now and will come to your rescue if you need it. Go ahead and explore the deep waters of your feelings; it's much safer than you think."
leo,2012-11-20,"You may feel stress as you attempt to balance your outward appearance with your inner feelings today. You have a natural tendency to act your way through a difficult situation, but now your inner voice is telling you not to sweep your emotions under the rug. Although it might not be time to shake everything up, you can feel the pressure building. Don't rush the process; the time for change is near."
virgo,2012-11-20,"Relationship issues intensify today as the Moon enters your 7th House of Others. You may be driven to deal with an uncomfortable feeling that has been brewing for quite some time. There are thoughts that you've been hiding just beneath your awareness, probably because they are inconvenient to bring out into the open. Whether it seems opportune or not, today just might be your day to come clean."
libra,2012-11-20,"You may be feeling dangerously close to an emotional meltdown and there doesn't appear to be a quick fix to this uncomfortable situation. You want to tell it like it is today, but you might get discouraged when you consider the possible negative reactions you could receive. Don't get stuck by your desire to make everyone feel at ease. Being honest is more important now than being nice."
scorpio,2012-11-20,"You are coming into another phase of powerful changes this week. You are no stranger to transformation, although at times it occurs very slowly. However, things are likely to move much quicker now. Nevertheless, don't be lulled into inaction by today's dreams of living on Easy Street. Take control of the current situation by setting goals and building momentum as time goes by."
sagittarius,2012-11-20,"You may feel uncertain about your direction in life today, even if you think that all is well at first. You might be hurt by a situation that raises painful memories, so it's crucial to realize what's happening now is not the same as what happened in the past. Recognize your weak spots and take your time to uncover the origins of your emotions so that true healing can finally begin."
capricorn,2012-11-20,"Make an extra effort to share what's on your mind today with friends or coworkers. You could be feeling more emotional than you're letting on, which is often your style, but right now you have a perfect chance to reveal your softer side. Remember, vulnerability does not have to be a weakness. It takes a special kind of strength to be honest about your limitations."
aquarius,2012-11-20,"Your recent run-in with your own irrationality begins to fade as your emotions finally settle down a bit. But just because the clouds are lifting now, don't fool yourself into thinking that the issues are resolved. You would do well to reconsider your feelings of anger or resentment today. Perhaps you don't need to do anything about them yet, but awareness is a good place to start."
pisces,2012-11-20,"A fog settles over the land this afternoon, making your logic unreliable as a navigational tool. You aren't as certain about anything today. Although you can feel a rumbling beneath the surface, it's not strong enough to be an earthquake. Finding your way can be tricky, but you don't have a choice now. Trust your imagination while drawing the map that you need to reach your future destination."
aries,2012-11-21,"Happiness may be eluding you today, even if it feels very close. Unfortunately, when it gets near, reality doesn't measure up to your fantastic expectations. All the best of intentions won't ensure that everything will work out as planned, unless you are willing to live in a dream world now. Don't get discouraged; enjoy the beauty without trying to capture it and make it last forever."
taurus,2012-11-21,"You're normally not comfortable with uncertainty because you like to know where you are and where you are heading. Now, however, your key planet Venus is having a tough time getting her bearings due to fuzzy Neptune's influence -- and you might feel lost. Instead of struggling to continue on your path, give yourself the day to chill out without having to be anywhere at all."
gemini,2012-11-21,"You may feel a bit awkward in an intimate encounter if the intensity of emotional expression goes to an extreme. But this isn't necessarily about drama, since your feelings are probably quite contained. The difficulty stems from your inability to separate what you want from what you think you are experiencing. Analysis will not help today; let go and take the plunge. Given proper care and feeding, anything you imagine now can grow into something substantial over time."
cancer,2012-11-21,"You may feel as if the day has wrapped you in a soft velvety blanket of fantasy and you just want to curl up in your contentment. You feel very safe in your isolation, but it's not as easy when you have to interact with the outer world. Others aren't necessarily as supportive of your dreams now -- and this makes you insecure. Don't try to overcompensate with social niceties. Just be yourself and let others see the real you, complete with tender vulnerability."
leo,2012-11-21,"Relationships are now a source of great pleasure and also a bit of confusion. Although you can temporarily sidestep conflict by glossing over a disagreement with broad philosophical generalizations and sweet gestures, you must face the truth sooner or later. It's best to speak your heart today so that you don't mislead anyone. Avoidance will only increase any misunderstandings; honesty is the best policy."
virgo,2012-11-21,"Your words may be unintentionally hurtful today, precipitating a challenging emotional situation. It may be too easy to project your unresolved feelings on to the nearest person. Keep in mind that your imagination is working overtime now and you must do whatever is necessary to soften your own rough edges before saying anything you might regret."
libra,2012-11-21,"Your key planet Venus has found a sweet ally in dreamy Neptune today, so let your imagination soar to the greatest possible heights. Give yourself some quiet time to fantasize about whatever you choose. Just remember that it's easier to drift into the magical inner realms if you've already taken care of your commitments in the real world first."
scorpio,2012-11-21,"Loving Venus enters your intense sign today, continuing to lure you into hidden worlds and magical dimensions. This journey into the unknown is accentuated as Venus opens channels to surreal Neptune, making the beauty of your imagination even more apparent to others. Keep your thoughts on positive possibilities rather than letting them drift toward darker fears. You are more in control of your future than you realize."
sagittarius,2012-11-21,"Your desires are now being fueled by idealism as the Sun enters your adventurous sign and moves toward a creative square to inspirational Neptune. You aren't willing to settle for anything less than perfection now. Naturally, this attitude can create a real dilemma for your friends and associates, since no one can meet your unrealistic expectations. You are better off talking about your needs honestly so you can develop a proper sense of perspective before going any further."
capricorn,2012-11-21,"You may have a frustrating time establishing balance in your life today. You might need to relinquish control because the edges of your plans are dissolving into a changing set of circumstances. Events are unfolding that can shift your center before you realize what happened. No matter what, don't lose sight of your goals now, even if you have to close your eyes to get your bearings."
aquarius,2012-11-21,"You have free reign within your own mind today because external noises won't get in the way of your romantic fantasies. Without any sense of guilt, you can go wherever you want and travel on your wildest thoughts and desires. Unfortunately, this may not be such a great time to let your daily routine slip. Don't neglect your unfinished chores now, even if they are less pleasant than your daydreams."
pisces,2012-11-21,"Be careful, for your optimism could blindside you today, especially with respect to relationships. Your key planet imaginative Neptune receives a sweet love tap from Venus, tempting you to sugarcoat nearly any difficult situation. Let your visions inspire you, but remember, the more honestly you face reality, the better the outcome for everyone involved."
aries,2012-11-22,"Your clever idea might be just what the boss ordered today, but you must take a chance and communicate it to others. Your plan certainly cannot solve the problem if it stays trapped inside your head. However, you may be fooling yourself by thinking it will work magic all by itself. Unfortunately, you won't know what you can do until you try. Luckily, your positive attitude and persistent determination go a long way toward fixing a difficult situation at work."
taurus,2012-11-22,"You are in touch with your feelings today, and it's so easy to express them now that it just doesn't seem like a very big deal to you. Your message may seem relatively unimportant to you, but it could have a great deal of impact on others. Choose your words carefully because someone special might receive a much-needed boost from what you say."
gemini,2012-11-22,"It's difficult to capture your good ideas today because they come and go so quickly. You may try to get serious and put your most innovative thoughts into action, but even your most brilliant plan might not be very practical. If you do choose to take a chance, don't rush the process. A slow and deliberate approach now will get you further than trying to make everything happen all at once."
cancer,2012-11-22,"Normally, you might choose to keep your most sensitive emotions to yourself. Although your feelings could be growing deeper today, you are motivated to let those closest to you know what you're experiencing. Take a risk and share your needs with someone you trust; you may be pleasantly surprised with the response."
leo,2012-11-22,"Although you are inclined to talk about your concerns with your coworkers today, there could be an inner conflict developing around the current situation. You may feel possessive about someone you like and have difficulty letting go of your jealousy. Putting on a dramatic show won't necessarily produce the results that you seek. Express what's in your heart without letting your fears run away with your love."
virgo,2012-11-22,"You can have the impact you want by getting an idea out into the open today. Your current effectiveness in communication stems from the fact that you really do care about others, and this comes across in your words. Even if you're only sharing facts, you can do it so pleasantly now that people listen more than they might at other times. But don't jump to any conclusions before you lay the groundwork. Making assumptions will only create trouble down the road."
libra,2012-11-22,"You have an opportunity today to do some real emotional healing at home or with a member of your family. If there are things that haven't been said, now is the time to express your feelings as long as you do it kindly and without blame. A sensitive approach allows you to say something that might be hurtful at another time. Thankfully, it's unlikely that anyone will take offense with you if your motives are clear from the start."
scorpio,2012-11-22,"If things have been going well for the past few days, you may feel a wave of contentment now that sweet Venus is back in your sign. But if you have been experiencing emotional turmoil, today could be more difficult. Don't succumb to the temptation of letting off your steam at someone who doesn't deserve it. Instead, use this time to retreat and recharge. You'll be better able to communicate what's in your heart once you find your own center."
sagittarius,2012-11-22,"You may have to put on your listening cap if someone close to you really needs to talk. Thankfully, starting a conversation will be easy since others will probably be upbeat and want to tell you positive things rather than what is actually bothering them. Nevertheless, don't be afraid to ask direct questions to get to the core issue. Everyone will feel better if you discuss a subject that truly matters."
capricorn,2012-11-22,"You can be the one who saves the day, but you cannot be a hero by trying to maintain the status quo today. You must push through your fears and take a chance with your truth. You might think it's safer to stick with the facts, but it could be more productive to let your emotions become evident for others to see. Although you may think this shows weakness, it can actually work in your favor now. Make it real by coming from your heart rather than staying in your head."
aquarius,2012-11-22,"You are capable of projecting your most pleasant and loveable side today. You can be quite personable now without much effort. However, the danger is your temptation to turn on the charm as part of your agenda to avoid the real issue at hand. If you are looking to gain power or trying to control a situation, your cleverness may backfire and you might wish you didn't say anything at all. Take the high road and channel your good fortune in a positive direction."
pisces,2012-11-22,"Say what you think needs to be said today, even if you're afraid of how others may react. You are experiencing the intensity of the current circumstances now that the Moon is in your sensitive sign. Thankfully, you're optimistic about the future, even with powerful emotions swirling around in the atmosphere. Your access to your own feelings can inspire others to delve deeper to match your honesty and integrity."
aries,2012-11-23,"You may be feeling on-edge today and are ready to swing into action at the slightest provocation. Although you're eager to play the role of a super hero, you don't have to be aggressive to save the day. However, you still must find a positive way to release the pent-up energy that needs to be expressed. If you do it with compassion, everyone will feel better after the storm."
taurus,2012-11-23,"The Moon's passage through your 12th House of Secrets encourages you to hide your feelings. However, there may be too much happening now to keep your opinions out of sight. Just remember that what you want doesn't always point to the healthiest course of action. Don't let others provoke you and steer clear of conflicts that aren't your business. If you manage to stay out of trouble, today could be quite exciting and loads of fun."
gemini,2012-11-23,"Your cleverness is your best asset now, but your thoughts are moving so swiftly that they may add to the drama. If you feel as if you are in a rut, you might want to create some fireworks for a change of pace. However, your strategy of instigating instability won't work because once the light show is over, your same old thoughts return. Instead, invent new solutions that can set a positive tone for the weeks ahead."
cancer,2012-11-23,"You might put extra effort into resisting change because everything is happening so fast now and you may feel like you are losing control of the current circumstances. Fortunately, uncertainty on the job is also the source for potential success if you just capitalize on the moment. Don't hang on to the past; you can co-create your future by jumping into it with joy and hope."
leo,2012-11-23,"Even if you believe that you've been doing well recently, today's events might test your resolve. The most important thing now is to listen to the feedback that the universe is giving you and re-evaluate your priorities. What is about to unravel? What do you want to do, but don't think you can? Push forward ever so gently, but avoid the temptation to give it all you've got until next week. Exploring your options is the first step."
virgo,2012-11-23,"You have the practical side of reality wired for sound today, but the volume may be turned up so high that you can't hear yourself think. It feels as if there's little you can do to transform an extreme situation into a more manageable one. Instead of trying to be sensible, trust your hunches now. Don't be so analytically correct that you miss what's most significant on a spiritual level."
libra,2012-11-23,"You've been quite busy recently, and the pace isn't going to let up just yet. You might even feel as if your nerves are on edge today. But don't get pulled into any crazy drama, especially if it isn't yours. Keep your eyes on the goal in front of you, instead. You'll be able to finish what you start, but it's best that you remain flexible in your schedule. If you lose focus, just return to your original plan as soon as possible."
scorpio,2012-11-23,"You may feel as if you have already experienced these current events once before, but it might be that you have just played out the scenario in your own mind. The tide is picking up speed now. Don't fight it; float along with it for a while, even if it's not taking you where you want to go. Fortunately, the currents will change directions later; save your strength until you reach your destination of choice."
sagittarius,2012-11-23,"Concentrating on the ball when it's in play enables you to compete to the best of your ability. Don't get distracted now by the lightning on the horizon. It's not your storm, even if it comes close and sounds threatening. Although you Archers often like to dream about the big adventure, today offers you a chance to choose small over large. Think locally and act locally so your efforts aren't spread too thin."
capricorn,2012-11-23,"An interesting dilemma is quickly developing in your life now. You might feel grounded and stable, but you still cannot shake a jittery feeling that won't let you relax. You could be holding on to negative energy, and it can become uncontrollable if you don't express it. Talking things over with an objective listener will enable you to process your emotions in a positive manner. Examine your unexpressed anger and then release it once and for all."
aquarius,2012-11-23,"Your high-anxiety planet, Uranus, is feeling the intensity of Mars' heat today. You want to be seen and heard now, and nothing is going to hold you back, except your own logic. Don't do anything rash unless you can rationalize it. Remember, the planets don't create accidents, but they can distract you. Remind yourself over and over again to focus on what is happening in the present moment."
pisces,2012-11-23,"Although you may feel overwhelmed by the fast pace of the day, it's not all noise and chaos. There is something for you to learn within the hectic flow of events. Sure, you can slip right into party mode because you might be seeking ways to blow off some steam. Just remember that you are currently operating on high octane fuel, so it's best to be gentle with that gas pedal while rushing in to the future."
aries,2012-11-24,"You're excited by the idea of starting a new project today, but your efficiency may wane as you get closer to your final objective. Avoid becoming annoyed about delays because they probably won't stop you for long. Even if it seems like things are moving slowly, they are shifting faster than you realize. Luckily, you have a rare opportunity now to create stability in the midst of dynamic change."
taurus,2012-11-24,The emotional balance in a personal relationship is complex and you are ready to take direct action now to stabilize your love life. Unexpected changes on your social calendar have recently impacted your ability to have fun. But these surprises aren't necessarily negative because you can bring a new level of integrity into your life. Develop a concrete plan to make better use of your time so that you have more opportunity to explore your creative side.
gemini,2012-11-24,"If your energy is a bit erratic now you would do well to stop and reconsider your current work methods. More importantly, make certain that you're heading in the right direction. Find a place to sit quietly and think about what is most critical to you. You'll be surprised how easy it is to act on your answers once you take some time for contemplation. Make a commitment to continue on your path, even if you must sacrifice some independence."
cancer,2012-11-24,"Perhaps you recently encountered an unexpected situation involving others who were not playing according to your rules. However, you're gaining strength now as the dynamics continue to develop, empowering you to act in ways that have lasting impact. Trusting your intuition and making small changes can help stabilize the day even if you must go off on your own."
leo,2012-11-24,"Now that the storm is subsiding you must keep your eyes open wide so you can make the most of the recent lessons you've learned. However, the radical solutions that you discovered last week still need to be executed with precision. Careful conservation of your energy and resources enables you to maximize your potential for success."
virgo,2012-11-24,"If you want to be successful at making the improvements that you've visualized, you must trust your common sense more than ever. Unfortunately, you can easily mislead yourself and others today by rationalizing your logical conclusions to your advantage. Stay on the practical path now; moving forward with cautious optimism is your best strategy to make your wishes come true."
libra,2012-11-24,"Give others sufficient space to unfold their ideas before you make a premature judgment. You might think that someone's plan is crazy at first, yet there just may be a solid foundation on which it could be built. Stay open to change because innovative new approaches to the same old problems could give you the chance to create something really special."
scorpio,2012-11-24,"You can become so fond of an idea sometimes that you get stuck on it. Unfortunately, your stubbornness just means that reality has to yell even louder to attract your attention. There may be financial issues that are stirring up conflict. Being ready to give up a little personal freedom to get what you need is the right kind of compromise. Meanwhile, it's fine to be more serious than everyone else while you're setting things right."
sagittarius,2012-11-24,"It feels as if you are reaching a critical point in your life, but you may be annoyed about experiencing disappointment today. You desperately want to make something positive happen and are willing to try something new if you think it will help your cause. Fortunately, these desires are not just based on pipe dreams; you are preoccupied with self-improvement now. Although you're close to a big change, it won't happen unless you're willing to act on your feelings."
capricorn,2012-11-24,"Unfortunately, reliable structures don't seem so secure these days. The very same things you've depended on in the past have shifted somehow and your life isn't what it once was. It's hard to escape the stress now, but you might not even try, since you would rather just deal with it. Move past your fear of the unknown because your current journey can positively impact your life for a long time to come."
aquarius,2012-11-24,"Your key planet Uranus was rattled yesterday as its unexpected brilliance shook up the status quo and brought the potential for freedom. However, the stability of Saturn takes over today and you're likely to see things from a more practical angle. At other times in your life it may have been difficult to integrate the urgency of Uranus, but, thankfully, you can make major progress now without experiencing undue stress. Seize the moment and show the world what you can do."
pisces,2012-11-24,"Permanent change of direction doesn't come easily for you Fish since you intuitively understand that nothing remains fixed in the ocean of life. However, you have a chance to initiate action now that stabilizes your daily routine. Making an overdue decision can bring reliability back into your world. But don't try to do everything all at once; it's the small adjustments that will have the most power in the long run."
aries,2012-11-25,"You want to break free from scheduling restraints today, even if it means letting someone down. However, it might not be the smartest time to resist fulfilling your social obligations, even if it feels like a matter of principle. Instead of taking a stand, consider the other person's perspective before doing something you cannot undo. You don't have to turn your world upside down to prove a point; change will come soon enough."
taurus,2012-11-25,"The Moon's return to your sign is usually enough to settle you down; however, you're not quite sure what your heart wants now. Relationships are a mixed blessing today. On one hand; you desire to be closer to someone you love. But on the other hand, you don't like the complications that currently come along with the deal. Instead of trying to decide on an immediate course of action, let your feelings sit for another day or two because your dilemma will likely resolve on its own."
gemini,2012-11-25,"Instead of revealing what you want today, you might try to cover your desires by keeping yourself busy with an endless stream of little projects. Methodically moving from one task to another can distract you as long as you stay in motion, but your dissatisfaction rises to the surface as soon as you stop. The work will get done somehow, so leave time to share your fantasies with someone you trust."
cancer,2012-11-25,"It's wonderful when you can enjoy yourself socially, but having a friend you can rely on is more important now than having a playmate. Unfortunately, those closest to you might disapprove of your more serious side because they want to have fun today. Don't fake it by pretending everything is OK if it's not. You will feel better once your needs are acknowledged and supported. Connecting on a deeper level is more satisfying in the long run."
leo,2012-11-25,"Your friends and family members are able to talk to you about their concerns today because you seem to be able to take everything in stride. The unflappable Taurus Moon is highlighting your 10th House of Social Responsibility now, empowering you to take charge of a situation. Don't wait for others to act first; if you know what needs to be done, get started right away and lead by example. Others will appreciate your drive and follow in your footsteps."
virgo,2012-11-25,"No matter how patient you have been these past few weeks, you're champing at the bit today. However, you may need to wait for just a few more days. Allow yourself to feel your frustration, but don't let your impatience run the show. Take this time to fine-tune your plans; the more you are prepared for next week, the smoother the road to success."
libra,2012-11-25,"You may try to stretch your pennies now because you don't have enough cash to do everything you want to do. But instead of succumbing to feelings of low self-esteem, acknowledge the gifts you bring to any partnership. It's easy to get discouraged about a lack of resources today, but you have a lot more than money to offer in a relationship. Focus on your creative assets instead of the material ones."
scorpio,2012-11-25,"You may appear cool and aloof, but that's not how you're feeling today. It's more likely that someone has not been listening to you and you're tired of running into the same old wall of resistance. Rather than expressing what's on your mind just like previous times, you're considering what extreme measures it will take in order to be heard. Be patient; a major breakthrough is on the horizon."
sagittarius,2012-11-25,"It would be fine with you if you could do everything today exactly like you did last week. The idea of familiarity sounds comforting, but you still may get bored very quickly. Unfortunately, you don't know whether to bite the bullet and keep things simple or push against the status quo and let others know about your dissatisfaction. Going to extremes only makes matters worse now. Relax; it will be easier to initiate your desired changes later in the week."
capricorn,2012-11-25,"You want to show your friends how much you need them now, but you might be afraid of being rejected today. Don't turn the present moment into some kind of test; you could be sorely disappointed if you do. Instead, temporarily downplay your desires for the sake of strengthening a relationship today. You'll be in a better position tomorrow to reveal your vulnerability."
aquarius,2012-11-25,You could really use a day at home to rest. You might even consider canceling your plans so you can retreat from your social responsibilities. But your desires may need to be set aside in order to fulfill your family obligations. Do what you must to take care of those you love now; you'll have time later on for the relaxation you deserve.
pisces,2012-11-25,"Your long-term goals are up for reconsideration now because you might not be able to afford following through on your previous plans. Nevertheless, doggedly believing in your dreams could still inspire you to discover ways to make them come true. Don't take anything for granted; assumptions only land you in trouble today. Your determination enables you to accomplish more than you think, as long as you're willing to wait for success."
aries,2012-11-26,"You may have to hold yourself back today, but it's better than dealing with the aftermath of a lack of discipline. You have been getting by without imposing too much structure on yourself, but making a commitment now can bring you the support you need. Although you might want to congratulate yourself that you made it this far, you cannot continue in the same manner forever. It's time to reconsider your behavior and rein yourself in."
taurus,2012-11-26,"Be careful about negotiating away more than you should in order to enter into an agreement today. Even if you know what you want, you might not truly appreciate what you must give up until it's gone. Consider your limits before relinquishing something of value or losing your self-respect. You stand to benefit by seriously thinking about what you're about to do before you make a deal."
gemini,2012-11-26,"There's a quiet observer within you now who is making notes and plotting out a course of action, even if your hectic life is filled with craziness. Fortunately, your inner-strategist is not deterred by all the noise. Cultivate this adaptable aspect of your personality as you work hard to navigate your way through the turbulent seas that surround you at this time."
cancer,2012-11-26,"The stable Taurus Moon reassures you by reaffirming a practical choice you've recently made about your life. However, your feelings may still be in conflict with your decision. Even when you move beyond words, you can't sink fully into your emotions without being reminded of your dilemma. Give yourself plenty of time to let your head and your heart come into agreement."
leo,2012-11-26,"The pressure to change may continue to build until you discover a way to ease the source of the tension. You might choose to play the role of the rebel by stirring up every hornet's nest you find today. Although this brash approach frees you from having to play by the rules, it may not be the best strategy. Think your plan all the way through now before you do something drastic, or you might discover that you have crossed the line and you can't go back."
virgo,2012-11-26,"Your problems are still present today, but you seem to have a real sense of what commitments you can make and which ones to sidestep. Oddly enough, you are being quite practical by considering how each option could affect your feelings. Although you might believe that you understand the full consequences of your current decisions now, you probably don't. Wait a few days and then make your final choice."
libra,2012-11-26,"You can stand up and play your part with style today, even in the face of resistance. In fact, you may perform so well in these tough circumstances now that you can actually change the outcome, snatching success from the closing jaws of defeat. Nevertheless, this is a sobering time as your key planet Venus is held in check by responsible Saturn. Show your true colors by giving it your best."
scorpio,2012-11-26,"You're ready for fun today, but obligations at work may force you to delay a previously scheduled social event. Unfortunately, your resentment might grow and encroach onto areas of your life that were working fine. Thankfully, you can nip a problem in the bud if you're aware of it, so watch for signs of negativity before it surfaces. Facing difficult issues now enables you to emerge stronger and brighter from any situation."
sagittarius,2012-11-26,"You would benefit from the wise advice from someone you trust today, but you may have a hard time finding anyone who can meet your high expectations. Nevertheless, listen to the voices of experience, even if they don't have all the answers. Even a simple interaction at work could bring you the breakthrough you need as long as you're open to receiving the gifts of someone else's perspective."
capricorn,2012-11-26,"You may be feeling quite conservative today, but your current attitude isn't about politics or sex. Rather, your caution influences your finances, your emotions and your personal relationships. You are quick to see what's happening now, and you might choose not to take an unnecessary risk. Your methodical approach has its advantages. Instead of pursuing more excitement, stabilize what you already have so that it can last longer."
aquarius,2012-11-26,"The cosmic radio is playing your requests today, but the planets are singing along with conflicting messages. Try not to stress out if you can't decide whether to follow your need for long-term emotional security or an immediate impulse for affection. Hold both sides of the spectrum in your thoughts for as long as you can. Hopefully, reality will end up being somewhere in the middle."
pisces,2012-11-26,"You might not believe that you're receiving enough emotional support from your close friends now. You could even grow discouraged, but dwelling on negativity isn't the best use of today's productive transits. Instead, observe your current situation and isolate anything that makes you feel unhappy. Share your concerns with a trusted friend. Although the conversation might not begin smoothly, a good old-fashioned heart-to-heart should bring about positive change."
aries,2012-11-27,"Your ruling planet warrior Mars aligns today with penetrating Pluto, bringing up previously hidden emotions that might seem to come out of nowhere. However, anger springs forth from the depths of your subconscious mind; it's yours and you must own it. Avoidance tactics won't work. Be smart and share your hurt feelings so that your negativity doesn't turn into resentment. Bringing everything out into the light gives everyone a chance to process things and move on."
taurus,2012-11-27,"You could accidentally say something that upsets a friend today. Unfortunately, good intentions are not enough to get you through this tricky intersection. You will have to reach into your heart and find a way to express your feelings, however deeply they may be buried. Watch your tendency toward being stubborn, for inflexibility won't help when it comes to love. You must show courage and widen your perspective, even if you believe you already know the truth."
gemini,2012-11-27,"Even if you try to gingerly tiptoe around a delicate situation, a friend or partner may still present you with an unsolvable emotional problem today. It is unlikely that the tension will settle back down until you face the music. You must roll with the incoming waves of emotions now, but remember that you'll be feeling more at ease in just a few days. Don't withdraw, as you can learn a lot about yourself from others at this time."
cancer,2012-11-27,"Relationships can be a source of pain now, yet opening your heart in the presence of potential hurt could earn the rewards of intimacy. This is not an easy process, for your tendency is to protect your sensitive feelings from being wounded. Showing your vulnerability to someone you love is the first step on the journey to healing today."
leo,2012-11-27,"Your energy may be so flamboyant now that it can get in the way of your well-meant intentions. Others might not have the fortitude to stand up to your emotional onslaught today, allowing you to steamroll right over them. You are slated to become victorious in a hard-fought battle, but you could be the long-term loser unless you honor what others are feeling, too. Listen closely so that you can establish common goals that allow everyone to play a part."
virgo,2012-11-27,"You are on a wild emotional ride now as you feel the passion one moment and then detachment the next. These extreme feelings might be quite upsetting; it's important to get enough perspective on what's happening so you don't go too far over the edge today. Try to stay in the middle of the road, for that is where you can best respond to the oncoming changes."
libra,2012-11-27,"You might be facing a power struggle in your immediate environment today that involves coworkers or family members. It may begin harmlessly enough, but by the time you realize what's happening, someone has already made their move. As counterintuitive as it seems, relinquishing control now could benefit you in the long run. Don't take on any battles that you cannot win."
scorpio,2012-11-27,"Your two ruling planets, Pluto and Mars, are quite capable of fighting when they must. Today, these two planets come together to teach you another lesson about intensity, although you are no stranger to strong feelings. On one hand, this can turn on your love light, but on the other hand, you could become dangerously distant. Above all, use your focused willpower to keep your good intentions intact."
sagittarius,2012-11-27,"Today's alignment of hot-headed Mars and cold-blooded Pluto in your 2nd House of Self Esteem reminds you that not every thought is light and optimistic. Be strong now and reach into the dark and mysterious realms to discover the real magic. Even if you are frightened of what you don't understand, remember that the unknown transforms into an important ally as your awareness grows."
capricorn,2012-11-27,"You are showing your battle scars now with great pride as the Mars-Pluto conjunction occurs in your 1st House of Personality. You want everyone to know what you have endured to survive and thrive. But others are not eager to look at your old emotional wounds -- and rightly so. Go ahead and say what you need in order to clear the air today, but then be ready to move on. Stay in the present moment, rather than dwelling in your past."
aquarius,2012-11-27,"Social interactions are a source of unavoidable intensity today. Although you certainly gain a lot from conversations with friends, there is a severe price to pay. You may be required to set aside an important part of yourself now just to participate with the group. Be careful not to hold on to any annoyances or past regrets. It's up to you to let go of whatever stands between you and happiness."
pisces,2012-11-27,"Someone's power play might sweep you up in a volatile drama today, yet if your intentions are for the higher good you could come out a winner. Navigation can be a bit tricky, though, for as soon as you act with selfish motivations you will lose. However, if you keep the health of your family -- or even the entire community -- as your top priority, then you'll be able to move mountains on your way to great success."
aries,2012-11-28,"You might wish you could avoid the intensity today as the easygoing Gemini Full Moon is eclipsed in your 3rd House of Communication. Seeking comfort sounds like a good idea, as long as you can balance lighthearted pleasure with serious discussions. Unfortunately, moderation may be elusive now; everything feels like all or nothing. Before taking action, consider your emotions from the viewpoint of a few days ahead to help you gain a healthier perspective."
taurus,2012-11-28,"You may be attracted to experiences outside of your regular comfort zone as today's curious Gemini Full Moon Eclipse highlights your 2nd House of Simple Pleasures. Resisting strong desires might be futile now, but relinquishing control is just as challenging. Keep your communication channels open. Be ready to learn something significant about yourself, even if it's not what you were expecting to hear."
gemini,2012-11-28,"The Full Moon Eclipse in your versatile sign raises the volume on your emotions, yet it may be difficult to act on what you feel. The biggest danger now is a loss of perspective, since it's all too easy to blow something out of proportion today. Even if you're sure of your newly chosen path, let your feelings settle for a day or two before making any major changes to your overall plans."
cancer,2012-11-28,"Since you careful crustaceans are strongly influenced by the Moon, today's Lunar Eclipse in your 12th House of Secrets makes you acutely aware of what you're not sharing. However, the emotional high tides are strong now and the boundaries are changing between you and a close friend or sweetheart. Don't try to control the flow of feelings. There is no need to hide; you are fine just the way you are."

The sooner you take action the easier it will be to regain your footing on solid ground."

You wish the complexity of life's circumstances would settle down. Although you may want your simpler life back, it won't likely happen yet. Make the required mental adjustments to balance your goals with your reality. Ultimately, you don't have to settle for less, but you might need to temporarily accept the current situation as is if you want to thrive."
libra,2012-11-28,"Share your vision of the future with your closest friends and family today, and be receptive to their feedback. The restless Gemini Full Moon Eclipse stimulates your 9th House of Adventure, fixing your emotions on the wide variety of possibilities in front of you. Although this may not be the best time to make firm plans, explore the alternatives with a curious mind and an open heart."
scorpio,2012-11-28,"Today's inquisitive Gemini Full Moon Eclipse deepens your resolve to make the most of your current situation, even if it falls short of your ideals. Your mind is overactive as you run through every possible scenario. You understand what's happening around you, but it's still challenging to make practical changes now. Nevertheless, the magnetic Venus-Pluto sextile empowers you to hold on to your vision with fierce passion, even if it takes time to reach your goals."
sagittarius,2012-11-28,"The interactive Gemini Full Moon Eclipse in your 7th House of Relationships is opposite your Sun sign today, and you may feel influenced by the changing feelings of those around you. A close friend or partner might be the source of an emotional conflict that distracts you from what you want to do. Nevertheless, don't ignore the feelings that arise now because you have something important to learn from the differences of opinion."
capricorn,2012-11-28,"You may not know how you got yourself into a complicated situation at work, but you can't just walk away from it. Today's noisy Gemini Full Moon Eclipse falls in your 6th House of Daily Routine, and there are lots of details that need your attention. Unfortunately, you could be pulled in too many directions, making it difficult to know where to start. Take a deep breath and then take a small step. Take another breath and another step. You're already on the road to success."
aquarius,2012-11-28,"You must reconsider your recent commitments because you just don't have enough time for everything you want to do with the restless Gemini Moon occurring in your 5th House of Fun and Games. Unfortunately, you may have some apprehension since you know that today won't unfold according to your vision. You might want to run away from your responsibilities now, but escape isn't a good idea. Listen to your common sense since it will tell you which activities are just too important to ignore."
pisces,2012-11-28,"Even if your professional life is moving along well now, your stress level is high as today's unstable Gemini Full Moon Eclipse rattles your 4th House of Emotional Security. You may feel as if you must maintain control in the outer world, but you aren't quite sure how to do it when you're feeling so uncertain about so many things. Ironically, your anxiety could dissipate if you loosen your grip on reality. Ride the powerful waves of emotional change and see where the currents take you."
aries,2012-11-29,"You may be feeling your oats today since your key planet Mars receives a supportive nod from vivacious Venus, inspiring you to express your feelings to someone you like. Others will want to bask in the warmth of your good intentions. Don't hold back; be direct and tell someone special what you want. If you can be patient you might just get what you need."
taurus,2012-11-29,"A weight is lifting from your shoulders today and you are eager to express your pleasure to those who will listen. Your key planet Venus is supported by physical Mars today, prompting you to step outside of your comfort zone. Venus is reminding you that your friends and family will be there for you if you need them. However, others may not be able to read your mind, so don't be afraid to show your vulnerability by asking for help."
gemini,2012-11-29,"You are excited to get down to work today, only to discover that you first must redo a task you thought was already completed. Although your curiosity is receiving an energetic boost, you don't need to take a giant leap forward yet. Don't be in such a hurry; instead, take your time and attend to the details along the way. There's satisfaction to be gained from a job well done."
cancer,2012-11-29,"You might not be ready to come right out and say what you mean now, but thankfully, your actions can speak louder than any spoken words. Don't worry about explaining yourself today; just act with decisive clarity, even if you are feeling uncertain. Your current choices will be less important in the future as long as you do something positive in the present moment."
leo,2012-11-29,"Your confidence is strong, and you could inadvertently overwhelm others without even considering the consequences of your actions. You might think everything is copacetic, only to be confused by the unspoken resistance that you now face. Thankfully, managing your relationship dynamics is easy if you don't promise too much. Turn down your volume today and listen carefully to what others need instead of only thinking about yourself."
virgo,2012-11-29,"Although you may be dealing with serious issues, you can feel a calming influence now right in the midst of your personal turbulence. Sensual Venus in your hyperactive 3rd house is harmonizing with fiery Mars, and this delightful combination encourages you to act on your desires and move closer to your goals. Trust your instincts today and do what feels right."
libra,2012-11-29,"You're anything but indecisive about your emotions now. You're sure about what you want and will do whatever it takes to reach satisfaction. Today's wonderful state of affairs comes from several supportive aspects to your key planet Venus. This grace period won't last long, so it's perfectly fine to derive pleasure from it while you can."
scorpio,2012-11-29,"When sexy Venus is in your sign, you are even more inclined to delve into the shadows as you seek the magic that often is shrouded in darkness. Today you have a desire to go even deeper, as Venus dances with physical Mars. The only thing that can stand in your way now is you; buried treasure awaits your discovery so face your insecurities and start digging."
sagittarius,2012-11-29,"You may feel as if you're being pulled in opposite directions today as you slide into the unfamiliar realms of your emotions. You're intuitively guided to leave the world of logic to discover a deeper meaning that words cannot reach.

Don't succumb to the easy way out or you will miss an opportunity for a rich experience."
capricorn,2012-11-29,"Don't play the role of a controlling boss today, even if you have the authority to do so. Your recent efforts have clearly made your case and now it's time to let others integrate your guidance or go forward on their own accord. Either way, you must recognize the need to step back. Instead of trying to micromanage everything, take advantage of your free time to do something special for yourself."
aquarius,2012-11-29,"It's challenging to maintain a peaceful state of mind today, even if most things seem to be running smoothly. Your current problem may be exacerbated by close friends who could be exerting control over you. Your best strategy now is to talk about anything that is bothering you since bringing your fears into the open should help dissipate them, allowing you to relax and enjoy yourself more fully."
pisces,2012-11-29,"Even if you are criticized by your peers today, accept their feedback with a smile. Chances are they are acting out of kindness rather than hostility. However, your sensitive nature could get in the way of an otherwise positive interaction, so try not to take things so personally. Changing your attitude helps you appreciate constructive criticism which in turn enables you to be more effective in the days ahead."
aries,2012-11-30,"There is an upbeat energy to the day, yet you might periodically sink into the cold waters of isolation. However, between these bouts of discouragement your enthusiasm level is high, so make the most of feeling optimistic while it lasts. Balance your need for emotional security with your desire to express unusual feelings without restraint. Avoiding extremes makes it easier to navigate the changing landscape."
taurus,2012-11-30,"You might worry others now as you jump into the open seas of spontaneous actions. Luckily, you probably put on a life jacket when no one was looking. Accordingly, just make sure to reassure everyone you're prepared for nearly anything that comes your way. You may not be carried too far off course, but you could get soaked today by the storms of experience. Use your common sense to help you keep your head above water."
gemini,2012-11-30,"You could easily set the world afire today with your clever thoughts and easy charm. Sometimes your willingness to adapt to the needs of others works well for you, but now it may not. Stay conscious of your intentions or you might get sidetracked by someone else's agenda. Remember, it's better to exert control early in the game than to start something that you cannot stop."
cancer,2012-11-30,"An emotional encounter could stir up buried feelings today with the Moon in your sign. Still, you're not inclined to withdraw from interpersonal engagements; you have things to do and people to see. But your day may not go according to plan, so don't try to adhere to your original schedule. Keep in mind that your willingness to adapt to the outer dynamics enables you to maintain inner stability in the midst of a storm."
leo,2012-11-30,"You might consider treading lightly now, yet whatever you do will likely have a lasting impact on others. Unconscious patterns can overtake your day and circumstances may grow out of control pretty quickly. Unwrap your buried feelings with determination, for they bring sorrow when they're kept secret for too long. Sharing what's in your heart seems like an act of courage, yet it's also the most sensible thing to do today."
virgo,2012-11-30,"Your plans might appear to be unfolding on schedule today, but ultimately it won't be that simple. There is too much random energy floating around now and the intensity needs somewhere to go. But even with an element of surprise, current events won't seem too disruptive. In fact, you'll feel more alive than usual if you can welcome the unexpected and embrace the unknown."
libra,2012-11-30,"Grandiose thinking has driven you to make your plans bigger and bigger. Although you're still psyched for whatever comes your way, consciously scaling back your goals now is a smart strategy. It's amazing that you can be so practical even when you're feeling highly strung. Ironically, it's easier to express yourself in new and exciting ways if you keep your feet on solid ground."

It might seem as if you're walking on a tightrope between the new and the old, but you make it look so easy now that others will respect the path you choose to travel. Take a few deep breaths, don't look down and just keep inching forward."
sagittarius,2012-11-30,"Practical concerns require you to de-emphasize your craziest ideas, while still acknowledging that the wild dreams are not going away.

Don't waste your energy trying to reach an unrealistic goal. Moving ahead methodically creates the most progress now."
capricorn,2012-11-30,"You are wise to share your feelings today to prevent relationship dynamics from becoming imbalanced. If you are experiencing problems with a friend or partner it's probably best now to roll with the punches instead of fighting back. Something is about to change, and it will alter the way others see you. Don't assume that you know what's going to happen. Just allow the situation to unfold without attempting to fix the outcome."
aquarius,2012-11-30,"There is a lot going on at work today and it may prove to be a bit too much to integrate all at once. Nevertheless, you still might enjoy the mental stimulation as magnetic Venus activates your key planet Uranus. If life feels overwhelming, remember that the intensity will not last more than a few days. You have the potential for great originality now as long as you don't try to avoid the chaos."
pisces,2012-11-30,"Even if you would prefer to be invisible today, people will still notice you because they can't help but see you as more exciting and upbeat than you actually feel. You're running on intuitive energy and there's no limit to what's possible as long as you can imagine it. You will be happier if you pay less attention to what others think and concentrate more on the signs from your heart."
aries,2012-12-01,"The notion of being independent is different from actually expressing your freedom through action. It's one thing to talk about what you want to do, but your recent behavior has more direct consequences than a theoretical conversation. You may be motivated to explore your relationship options today, but don't spread your energy too thin or you might be left with less than you started with. Managing your time wisely now goes a long way toward finding satisfaction."
taurus,2012-12-01,"It's best to address an emotional situation with a close friend today, even if you prefer to just let it slide. However, you could come on stronger than you intend, so try tempering your approach with a bit of compassion. Don't make things more complicated than they already are by projecting your annoyance or anger on to the wrong person. Your chances of resolving the problem are better if you base your perceptions on objective reality rather than unsubstantiated fears."
gemini,2012-12-01,"You might be sitting on pins and needles today as you try to manage a tricky situation without overreacting. It may be wise to acknowledge your resistance because you really need to delve deeper into your emotions, even if you don't want to go there. Keep pushing up against your discomfort now; there are important lessons to learn by sinking into your own hidden world and touching the magic of emotional transformation."
cancer,2012-12-01,"You're feeling quite moody now that the Moon is back in your sensitive sign, but circumstances continue to draw you out of your shell. Although you might steer clear of large groups today, you feel comfortable when you're with someone you trust. Unveiling your feelings can strengthen a relationship as long as you don't go overboard. Knowing when to be quiet is just as important as having the courage to talk."
leo,2012-12-01,"You're not feeling very sure of yourself today because old fears are resurfacing from your subconscious mind. But past experiences have a tendency to go away and return, especially when something happens to remind you of a previous hurt. You can push through your current uncertainties, but you'll need to have faith, as blind as it may be now. Close your eyes, grit your teeth and reach for the stars."
virgo,2012-12-01,"You might spend too much time over-analyzing the data as you try to decide what to do next. You're sure that you're on the right path at first, but soon thereafter you could change your mind. It's all rather confusing since the closer you get to a final decision, the farther you seem from the solution. Once you recognize that there's no absolute correct answer, you're freer to make a choice and move on."
libra,2012-12-01,"Although it might seem as if someone is pushing your buttons today simply to get a reaction, you would rather sidestep a potential conflict. Instead of struggling to escape from an uncomfortable situation, find the courage to engage in a constructive dialogue. Obviously, you don't like getting into arguments, yet resolving the current tension will feel much better than allowing it to continue any longer."
scorpio,2012-12-01,"You may try to withhold your emotions because you're quite aware of the powerful impact you have on others these days. Although the Moon's visit to your 9th House of Big Ideas encourages you to go overboard when thinking about the future, you might not be able to meet other people's expectations if you share all of your dreams. Your best strategy is to take some time away by yourself today so you can set priorities and put your goals into a healthier perspective."
sagittarius,2012-12-01,"Your key planet Jupiter motivates you to overcompensate today and focus all your attention where you can be the most successful. But even with this exuberance you still may feel as if you're traveling through tricky territory. Chances are you're probably going too fast and might not know how to slow down. If you want the good times to last, ease up on the gas and reduce your speed. Coming in first doesn't necessarily win the race."
capricorn,2012-12-01,"Your progress continues to be uneven and it's tempting to blame your frustration on others. It might seem as if people are offering you opportunities, only to see them disappear before they come to fruition. However, you may be making more headway now than you realize, so avoid judging your success by what you accomplish today. Keep your eyes on the future and don't be deterred by anyone else's lack of follow-through. You are the master of your own destiny."
aquarius,2012-12-01,"These have been busy days and the hectic pace may reach a frenzied limit now. Straightforward actions should make your motives clear, but others have a hard time reading your intentions today, especially if you feel disconnected from what you are doing. Instead of brashly barging ahead, stop long enough to think about where you want to go before you end up in the wrong place."
pisces,2012-12-01,"You are in a long-term planning mode where you're more concerned with next week, next month or next year than you are with today. However, immediate action may be required of you to deal with a minor crisis. Fortunately, your current positive attitude can disarm obstacles quickly, enabling you to be effective in the present moment while still thinking about the future."
aries,2012-12-02,"If you have recently run into resistance putting a plan in motion, obstacles may seem to fall away today. You feel as if you're in tune with the entire universe and nothing can get in your way. Nothing, that is, except your inflated sense of self-importance. Even if everything is looking up, don't burn all your fuel now or you won't have enough energy left for tomorrow."
taurus,2012-12-02,Reflecting on the joys of relationships over the next few weeks can bring great satisfaction. You might benefit from working with a close friend or partner in order to increase your income or improve your overall financial condition. But don't get too hung up micromanaging your daily schedule since you'll probably be happier if you let yourself be more spontaneous in the present moment.
gemini,2012-12-02,"You are delighted by the opportunities presented by others now as the Sun in your 7th House of Partners opposes auspicious Jupiter in your sign. Although you might want to take it easy today, you'll probably still say yes when invited because there's too much potential for fun everywhere you look. You are at the peak of a manifestation cycle, so it's crucial to be clear about what you want. But don't overstate your desires or you could end up with less than you wish."
cancer,2012-12-02,"You need to shift gears now in order to put your dreams into perspective or they could grow out of hand. One part of you is still moving slowly, like the cautious Crab that you are -- especially while the Moon is still in your sign. But as the day wears on you can also see the wisdom in expressing your feelings. Confront your shyness and boldly beat a path to your desired destination."
leo,2012-12-02,"Practice time is over; the lights are on, the curtains are lifting and the show is about to begin. You're either ready for the main event or you will miss your chance to shine. The good news is that your jittery nerves should transform into an inspiring performance today, so let go of your insecurities. This is your time to bask in the light of those you love."

You don't know whether to risk being seen or hide out at home now that the Sun in your 4th House of Security is opposing auspicious Jupiter in your 10th House of Public Status. Temporarily set aside further analysis so you can take advantage of the amazing opportunities currently in your life.
libra,2012-12-02,"Someone in your immediate environment may confront you with an issue that was problematic at one time, but it just isn't very important to you today. Criticism that would normally upset you now falls away like water off a duck's back. Even if others push for a confrontation, use your diplomatic skills to charm your way through the situation. Avoiding direct conflict for a while actually strengthens your position. Save your energy for when you need it most."
scorpio,2012-12-02,"You can feel the spotlight's heat getting closer than you prefer, but you might as well enjoy the attention today while positive recognition is coming your way. Instead of minimizing your accomplishments because you don't want to be seen, stand tall and let others acknowledge you for the work you do so well. Even if a temporary loss of privacy is uncomfortable, you deserve to soak in the warmth of appreciation."
sagittarius,2012-12-02,"The Sun in your inspirational sign is opposing lucky Jupiter in your 7th House of Relationships, expanding your horizons as you interact with others. Confident people may share their ideas with you, enticing you to go along on their journeys. Although wonderful things can happen if you say yes, don't forget about your dreams in the process. Use your imagination and create an adventure right in your own backyard."
capricorn,2012-12-02,"If you're working too hard and feel overextended, step back from your ambitions today and reconsider your priorities. Although you realize how much you could accomplish, it's more important to relax now, even if doing less is difficult for you. Although you conscientious Goats normally don't like to take time off, it's healthy to recharge your batteries before it's too late."
aquarius,2012-12-02,"The conflicting messages you have recently received finally converge into a singular directive today: go for it. Now. If circumstances are creating trouble, withdraw enough to refine your plan and then try again. This is your time to express yourself and create the future that you desire. Your chances for success improve if you are confident that you will accomplish your goals. Believe in yourself and make your move."
pisces,2012-12-02,"You might not like being pushed into a new situation until you're fully prepared. However, reality isn't necessarily going to wait now. Ready or not, away you go. Resistance isn't a sensible strategy because you're being pulled into a powerful portal that is setting you on a new life path. Remain flexible; you may be happily surprised as the future begins to manifest just the way you imagined it."
aries,2012-12-03,"You are excited today as the storm clouds continue to clear, encouraging you to feel as if you can see forever. Although this is a great day to set long-term goals, the lively Leo Moon adds an element of playfulness to nearly anything you do. You can even come to terms with difficult emotions now, especially if you are willing to narrow your vision and move slower as you execute your plans."
taurus,2012-12-03,"You might reveal your innermost feelings today in a rather cavalier manner. Usually, it takes time for you to open up and verbalize your emotions, but self-disclosure seems like the simplest course of action now. Grab the opportunity to share while you can, since expressing what's in your heart sets a positive tone for the days ahead."
gemini,2012-12-03,"You may have so much to do today that you feel tired before you even begin anything. And although it's difficult to set a pace you can maintain throughout the day, getting started is half the battle now. Don't worry about the possibility of letting others down because you're not sure you can hold up your end of the deal. You might be happily surprised when you look back and realize how much you actually accomplished."
cancer,2012-12-03,"Everything at work seems to be moving along smoothly today now that the extroverted Leo Moon collaborates with the planets in your 6th House of Employment. Nevertheless, your emotions are more complicated than others realize, but you might be afraid to share them now because you don't want to create any drama. Ironically, expressing your true feelings will ultimately result in more harmony than if you remain quiet."
leo,2012-12-03,"Today's outgoing Leo Moon poses an interesting dilemma. You're more sensitive than usual, but you're also excited by original ideas and unconventional plans of action. Your world is humming an unfamiliar tune and you are ready to play along, yet there's a nagging voice that encourages you to stay within safe boundaries. Find a way to honor your vulnerability while still moving joyfully toward your future."
virgo,2012-12-03,"Newly acquired information must be integrated into your current perspective today, even if you think it will distract you from your real work. You might act impulsively, letting others know how you feel without regard to the consequences. Although there's no need to postpone action until another day, make sure your decisions are made in a methodical manner rather than shooting from the hip."
libra,2012-12-03,"Although today is an action-packed day, it seems as if something is holding you back from doing as much as you wish. It may be that social obligations prevent you from having the fun that you wanted. However, if you remain flexible, the potential for enjoyment might resurface later in the day in ways that you could never expect."
scorpio,2012-12-03,"Although several planets moving through Water signs heighten your emotional sensitivity now, a Grand Fire Trine empowers you to swing into action and overcome any self-doubt. There's still more work to do resolving issues regarding your own self-worth, but at least you can sense hope is on the horizon. Be patient yet persistent. Don't ease up on your efforts, but it's important to realize that it's going to take some time to achieve the results you desire. Your positive attitude can make all the difference in the world."
sagittarius,2012-12-03,"Your energy is building to a crescendo today, yet you must be careful not to over-commit so you don't waste the current opportunities in front of you. It's tempting to blindly trust your confidence now, but it's healthier to support your optimistic outlook with analytical skills and a concrete plan. Balancing your goals with a bit of common sense multiplies your chances of finding success."
capricorn,2012-12-03,"You can feel a shift into a new perspective, but you might still resist change. For this reason, the next few days may feel a bit strained as current circumstances require you to let go of the past. Meanwhile, now that the Moon is in expressive Leo, you need to take a risk to make the most of the situation. Nevertheless, watch your moods carefully, especially while interacting with people who stir up your emotions. It's perfectly acceptable to switch the topic if things get too intense."
aquarius,2012-12-03,"Social activities bring a lot of joy this time of year, but unfortunately, there is also a high price to pay. If you overextend your commitments now, you might find yourself too tired to do what really must be done. Your current practice should include moderation. If you curtail your activities just a little, you can conserve the energy that you need to fulfill your current obligations."
pisces,2012-12-03,"It might feel as if you're running around in circles today, as you think and rethink the same ideas. Your current mental loops may border on obsession, but they can also indicate that some information about a project at work is still missing. Nevertheless, shine your inner light for all to see. Don't waste precious energy trying to analyze what's happening; just trust that it will all make sense in due time."
aries,2012-12-04,"You may be feeling more positive now about what you are doing with your life. It's as if you're awakening from a sound sleep just as the lights are switched on. However, there is no need to overreact. If you work yourself up into a flurry of activity, you might have to retreat so that you don't go over the edge. Making slow and steady progress is better than trying to sprint to the finish line."
taurus,2012-12-04,"Being aware of the conflict between two facets of your own personality today doesn't mean you are able to arrive at a clear answer. The more you try to hold on to the status quo, the more difficult it is to make your choice. You might waste precious energy trying to figure a way out of your present dilemma, but the most useful solutions will come from remaining as open as possible to the changes ahead."
gemini,2012-12-04,"You can dance circles around everyone today because you feel as if you're at the top of your game. Others may think you are quite charming and witty, but you might lose your advantage if you overplay your hand. Don't act too sure of yourself or your plans could backfire pretty quickly. Enjoy the day, but resist the temptation to expect that everything should go your way."
cancer,2012-12-04,"Opening your heart to someone at work today may have you worrying about the appropriateness of your actions, especially if the situation makes you uncomfortable. Try to avoid getting caught up in other people's responses to your emotional disclosure. What anyone else thinks is less important now than what you feel; you will be better off expressing your vulnerability whether it is received with enthusiasm or not. You might be very busy caring about everyone else's needs, but that doesn't mean yours don't count."
leo,2012-12-04,"It's time to explore your emotions and show others what you want now that the Moon is back in your sign. However, you could be treading on dangerous ground if your motives are completely selfish. Putting yourself first is healthy as long as you also listen to and honor the requests of others. Communication is a two-way street so make sure to follow the signs as you move forward."
virgo,2012-12-04,"What others don't say now can grab your attention today, as if the unspoken words have more power because they are kept secret. This may manifest through a simple misunderstanding if you make a false assumption. Listen carefully to all the viewpoints of everyone involved. Discuss the most important elements of the current circumstances with those who want to work together to create positive change. Build a consensus and establish common ground to move things in the right direction."
libra,2012-12-04,"Good friends come to your rescue today, whether it's just for an enjoyable escape or a more meaningful interaction to share your feelings. If there is nothing already on your calendar, make something happen by getting on the phone and connecting with your social network. This has the potential for a really fun day, but it won't amount to much unless you step in and co-create it. Think outside of the box and anything is possible."
scorpio,2012-12-04,"You're likely to reveal more of yourself than you intend today, yet you still can act professionally at work now that the Moon is in your 10th House of Public Status. Maintaining your composure is probably a good idea, for your job should come first at this time. And even though it's not wise to leave your emotions completely out of the picture, don't say everything that you feel. Keeping some things to yourself now gives you more control of your life."
sagittarius,2012-12-04,"You might be feeling upbeat about what's happening, but don't bury significant information just so you can have a better time today. It's not that you will necessarily lean toward denial; it's just things may not be quite as clear as you prefer. If you find yourself drifting off into fantasies, pull yourself back to the ground and begin the conversation once you feel like you have returned to earth. Stick to the facts as much as possible and the rest should fall into place."
capricorn,2012-12-04,You may be working harder than ever since you realize that it's time to make a significant commitment to your career now -- especially if you are to succeed. But your nagging fear of failure could just be the surface of a deeper issue. Your critical judgments might stem from your uneasiness with actually reaching your goals. Examine what you're really afraid of before firming up your plans for the day.
aquarius,2012-12-04,"Although everything might seem to be going well now, a difficult interaction with someone at work could catch you off guard. If you're feeling uncertain about your responsibilities, ask your boss for clarification. It's better to know exactly what's expected of you today, so you can gauge your time accordingly. Just make sure to keep one eye on your long-term goals, even if others are encouraging you to take care of business in the present moment."
pisces,2012-12-04,"You may be asked to work in service now without receiving the recognition you deserve. This lack of attention could bring up familiar issues that make you uncomfortable. It's not that you don't want to be a team player, nor are you trying to avoid your job. You just don't want to vie for the spotlight and you could resent it when everyone else receives the applause. If this is an ongoing problem, letting others know how you feel should help to alleviate the tension."
aries,2012-12-05,"Projects continue to pile up around you now and you may begin to worry that you won't finish your work on time. You might even feel as if you could easily scatter your energy and will have little to show for yourself by the end of the day. Thankfully, setting priorities helps prevent you from wasting precious resources. Don't make yourself crazy trying to finish everything today. As long as you're putting in sincere effort, the rest of the world will understand."
taurus,2012-12-05,"You feel very creative today, yet you still may run into obstacles as you begin a new project. Generally speaking, it's time to push yourself into taking decisive action, but make sure that your head isn't in the clouds when doing so. You'll end up losing track of time if you drift off into fantasies. However, the more practical you are in your approach now, the more you will have to show for your talent."
gemini,2012-12-05,"Unexpressed emotions may follow you into work today, coloring your attitude and making it more difficult to focus your attention. However, you can consciously choose to acknowledge the thoughts that aren't directly related to your job, even if you choose not to tell anyone for now. Monitoring your own internal process helps you successfully cope with any stress you encounter at this time."
cancer,2012-12-05,"It may seem as if someone is picking on you today or somehow having fun at your expense. It's possible that you're being overly sensitive, yet there's no reason to simply remain quiet if you feel like a victim. Express your hurt so that your voice is heard, but then let go of any lingering resentment and move on. There's nothing to be gained now by holding on to the past."
leo,2012-12-05,A recent decision involving your home life comes under reconsideration one more time today. You may need to take concrete action to solidify your position. It's not that your current choices cannot be undone. It's just that you can't afford to expend the time and energy required to go over this again. Getting it right now prevents trouble down the road.
virgo,2012-12-05,"You may know exactly what you want one moment and then question your feelings just a few minutes later. The inconsistencies of your desires can be a thorn in your side now that the evocative Moon is back in your sign. Avoid getting frustrated if you're not as decisive as usual. Putting off final judgment for a few more days is the best choice for now. Play through the possibilities in your mind one more time, instead."
libra,2012-12-05,"Financial issues may be coming to a head, but you need more time to wrap your mind around all the variables. You want to retreat to a quiet place so you have the time and space to think, but this is a luxury you might have to forgo today. Even if you are being pushed to declare your position now, don't compromise your core values for the sake of expediency."
scorpio,2012-12-05,"Resist the temptation to criticize your friends now, especially if your true intention is to help them. They might not be amenable to your unsolicited advice or constructive comments. Setting the stage for a showdown isn't very wise today. If you sense any tension in the air, keep your thoughts to yourself for a few days until the energy settles down. Show your support by simply listening to the dreams of others without saying anything at all."
sagittarius,2012-12-05,"Your expertise could be required at work today, and you are destined to become a hero if you stay focused on exactly what must be done. However, you aren't seeking the spotlight now, so you might not accept the extra obligations being tossed your way. Instead of automatically declining responsibility, find a middle path so you can still save the day and tend to your personal needs at the same time."
capricorn,2012-12-05,"Your social life seems to be kicking up a storm, but you're also interested in using your personal connections to get ahead professionally. The good news is that you are able to combine work with pleasure more easily these days. Don't turn down an invitation just because it sounds boring; you never know who you could meet or what might happen."
aquarius,2012-12-05,"You may receive unexpected support from a powerful person today, but self-doubt could prompt you to politely decline the assistance. You might be unsure of other people's intentions now, even if they appear quite sincere. However, it could turn out that the only negativity is your own. Trusting in yourself is the first step to being open to listening to anyone else."
pisces,2012-12-05,"Your co-workers may catch you off guard today with what they are saying about you. Your first reaction is to reject their feedback, but they probably mean well and it might be to your advantage to take what they say to heart. In fact, seeking out an objective opinion is never a bad idea. The cues you receive from others now can be crucial factors in the decisions you make over the next few days."
aries,2012-12-06,"You may feel emotionally conflicted today because it isn't easy to restrain your impulses. Nevertheless, you have a feeling of inner power now and this reserve of energy is sufficient to stop you from wasting your talents by succumbing to your need for immediate gratification. Now, more than ever, you realize that waiting for the right moment can ensure you great success."
taurus,2012-12-06,"You are a study in inertia today, making it difficult for you to change direction. If you have been inactive, you want to stay that way. But if you've been having a good time, it's going to be tough to turn down the volume. Your sensual needs are strong now, and you won't be denied the pleasures that you seek. Don't let your fixed ways get the best of you, for this week brings change whether you are ready for it or not."
gemini,2012-12-06,"You could go through a minor meltdown today as you temporarily become a perfectionist. It's not that you are usually sloppy; it's just that you're often eager to let something go once you have completed it. However, you are driven to get everything correct now, and you're not willing to let any loose ends remain untied. Your tenacity can bring on a power struggle with someone who isn't as interested in your idea of making things right. Dig in your heels to honor your truth."
cancer,2012-12-06,"Your feelings are larger than life, but you are still an expert at maintaining a healthy outlook on reality. Even if someone tries to manipulate you, you can hold on to your point of view without budging. The danger is that by clinging so strongly to your perspective today, others may think you're trying to control them. Back off from any power struggles now. Ironically, the situation will take care of itself without you making such a fuss about it."
leo,2012-12-06,"You may have to go through several ups and downs today, but you should be able to find a place where your energies are in balance. Your feelings and actions are harmonized only for short bursts now, yet others might not even notice the difference. Being overly exuberant one moment and more cautious the next requires you to be completely honest so there are no unrealistic expectations."
virgo,2012-12-06,"Old problems that involve feelings from the past have been festering unnoticed beneath the surface. These could be your feelings or someone else's, but in either case it's probably a good time to talk it out. It may take an unpleasant encounter or difficult moment to act as a catalyst, but once the emotions are out in the open, there is great potential for resolving the problem. Visualize a positive outcome and it will be yours."
libra,2012-12-06,"You are close to making a breakthrough that concerns your deepest beliefs, but you might have to hold on to your horses for just a little bit longer. Perhaps you have been scheming and dreaming, but keeping it all to yourself. Now you are finalizing your plans before putting them into motion. Some of your ideas may leak out prematurely, but don't worry. The biggest obstacle to your potential success comes from glossing over details and spreading yourself too thin."
scorpio,2012-12-06,"You may be so enthusiastic that you lose perspective today. Oddly enough, it is your confidence that can get you into trouble now. Be willing to question your own values. Listen to what others are telling you without putting up protective defenses. You have nothing to fear if you let someone into your heart. It's only when you close people out that you have cause for worry."
sagittarius,2012-12-06,"Your vision extends wide -- after all you are the philosophers and travelers of the zodiac. However, your ideas are more carefully considered today, and this may make them become quite popular. It seems as if everyone can see your clear thinking at work and they want to climb on to your bandwagon. Make certain that your motives are clear. You will have better chances of meeting with success if you have the good of all in mind."
capricorn,2012-12-06,"There are times for action and there are times for planning. You may be less productive today, but your analytical abilities are still working at top notch. Don't worry if your physical energy is lower than usual. What you lack in stamina now is compensated by your practical organizational skills. For just a short while, forget about your shortcomings and focus on what you do best."
aquarius,2012-12-06,"You are more philosophical about love now. This is a great time to take care of any lingering emotional issues that are on your mind. Your current advantage is your ability to see what's happening with respect to your heart's desires. If romance is unsatisfying today, be rational about the reality of the situation so you can make intelligent decisions about what to do next."
pisces,2012-12-06,"Your current interactions with others are the source of both good news and bad news now. The good news is that opportunity comes knocking at your door. The bad news, however, is that you might be so entrenched with what you are doing that you don't stop to let it in. Opportunity won't just stand there waiting forever, so jump up and embrace it joyfully while you have the chance."
aries,2012-12-07,"Good intentions at work are not enough to get you through a busy day; you must make a plan and stick with it. Paradoxically, you need to trust your intuition when circumstances dictate a strategic change. But don't just give up when the going gets tough. Talking about a struggle as it unfolds can help you figure out what to do as long as you share your predicament with a trustworthy friend who will tell you the truth."
taurus,2012-12-07,"You don't want to do things today in the same manner as you did them before. In fact, you're interested in trying a new approach to nearly any activity you start now. Unfortunately, your co-workers and friends might not be so eager to support your uncharacteristic rebellious nature. Although the idea of working with somebody else sounds ideal, you may need to strike out on your own, anyway. The exhilaration you feel from reaching your goal makes doing it alone worthwhile."
gemini,2012-12-07,"You may be so bored at work today that you check out for the weekend early. However, even if you've already escaped in your mind, you might have to stick around anyhow until it's actually time to leave. Thankfully, you can turn your day around by adopting a creative approach to meeting your responsibilities. Use your imagination and find ways to make your job more fun, instead of just wishing you were someplace else."
cancer,2012-12-07,"Your friends may be counting on you now and expecting you to join up with them later. Although you might be looking forward to enjoyable social activities, you currently have to buckle down and finish your work before making your escape. Ironically, by the time you're done with your chores, you might prefer to just go home and relax instead of heading out for a night on the town. There's no reason to let anyone talk you into something you don't want to do."
leo,2012-12-07,You might start the day with your head in the clouds of your imagination. But your impractical approach to the day begins to shift as the changeable Moon enters your 3rd House of Immediate Environment. Don't be overly concerned about sticking to your plans. Choose excitement over routine to squeeze the most out of the present moment.
virgo,2012-12-07,"It's challenging to concentrate this morning, making it harder to complete whatever you start. However, your mind sharpens midday, enabling you to successfully revisit a mentally challenging task. Even if your thoughts wander today, gently remind yourself of your current goal. Persistence is the key to reaching your destination now."
libra,2012-12-07,"The Moon's entry into your sign today shifts your attention from the rational world toward a more subjective perspective. But you're not satisfied with the status quo now and could be motivated to take up a new course of study that involves a deepening curiosity in some unexplored area of art, psychology or metaphysics. Don't worry about applying your new interest to anything concrete; just see where your studies take you for a while."
scorpio,2012-12-07,"If you think that you've been missing a significant piece of information, today might be the right day to do some serious research. Messenger Mercury joins the karmic Lunar North Node in your sign, indicating the heightened importance of communication. Asking the right questions now should bring answers to your lingering doubts."
sagittarius,2012-12-07,"You might be unsure of your current destination, but a lack of clarity today won't stop you from continuing on a road to somewhere. Even if you start off without a map, you'll be able to better see where you're going as the day progresses. Trusting your intuition takes courage, especially if your conclusions are not supported by the apparent facts. Nevertheless, blazing your own trail is a more successful strategy now than following a path that is well-worn by others."
capricorn,2012-12-07,"Today's timing may be frustrating because you have high hopes about accomplishing a lot at work. However, the day gets off to a slow beginning, making it harder to finish what you start. Fortunately, the Moon's afternoon shift into your 10th House of Social Responsibility changes the game and gives your efforts a boost. Don't worry if it seems like too little too late; just do the best you can considering the circumstances that are beyond your control."
aquarius,2012-12-07,"It's hard to keep your feet on the ground today, even if you have very practical goals at first. Hopefully, you can fulfill most of your obligations before you lose focus because you won't want to look back once your key planet Uranus tempts you to cut loose. There's nothing wrong with pursuing the excitement of an adrenaline rush as long as your work doesn't suffer in the process."
pisces,2012-12-07,"You might struggle to pay attention to your everyday affairs today because your imagination is running wild. Instead of perceiving things as they are, you can envision them as you wish them to be. The power of your mind is so strong now that believing is seeing. However, reality won't necessarily support your fantasies unless you reinforce them with concrete plans that can produce tangible results."
aries,2012-12-08,"A creative approach to your chores today may not be great for efficiency, but you could have a lot of fun in the process. However, rushing to get things done quickly isn't as useful now as sticking with a project until it is completely finished. Fortunately, your key planet Mars in ambitious Capricorn acts as a taskmaster as long as your exuberance doesn't lure you into taking on too much. Slow down and set a pace that allows you to enjoy what you're doing while you're still doing it."
taurus,2012-12-08,"Being open to new ideas doesn't mean you need to give up your sensible approach. Thankfully, you're able to accomplish a lot today if you're willing to make concrete plans. But don't get too lost in the minutiae. Visualize the big picture and concentrate on your destination while filling in the details as you go."
gemini,2012-12-08,"You can reap rich rewards from slowing down and sinking into your emotions today, especially if there's someone special in your life with whom you can share the day. Although you're tempted to resort to clever words, idle chatter now will only lead to frustration. Even if the thought of leaving logic behind makes you nervous, push past your resistance so you get to the real juice."
cancer,2012-12-08,"You may grow annoyed if someone doesn't listen to you when you say that you want some time alone today. Unfortunately, you might have to express your anger for the other person to back off. It's not that you feel threatened or unsafe in any way; it's just that you really don't want to waste your energy trying to justify your desires. Be patient and communicate your needs as clearly and kindly as you can."
leo,2012-12-08,"You want to be with your friends today, but you prefer socializing on your own terms. You would like to be able to determine when and where you go, without letting others control your day. However, once you get involved in a group activity, you might not be the only one who wants to have a say in the planning. Ease up; sharing the leadership will make everyone feel a part of the team."
virgo,2012-12-08,"It's time to get out of your head and into your heart today as physical Mars stirs up your 5th House of Self-Expression. Words won't communicate your message now as clearly as direct action. Even if you're not certain about what you want, act as if you already know. Imagination clears the path for reality to follow."
libra,2012-12-08,"You're likely to change your mind many times now with the moody Moon visiting your thoughtful sign. But your enthusiasm may mislead others to interpret your optimism as certainty. Meanwhile, your decision-making process continues today as you gather more information and analyze your feelings. Moderate the effects of your unrestrained excitement by also letting everyone know about your concerns."
scorpio,2012-12-08,"You are respected as an authority figure because the knowledge you have is based on your own powerful personal experiences. But people might not notice that you're also questioning reality now that the objective Libra Moon is traveling through your 12th House of Spiritual Pursuit. Don't worry about the consequences of someone's premature judgment. You're not responsible to fill others in on your internal process. It's more important today to make time to meditate, pray and dream, instead."
sagittarius,2012-12-08,"You need to be around like-minded people today since the Moon is activating your 11th House of Social Networking. Ironically, you have a lot that you're not sharing now with several passionate Scorpio planets occupying your 12th House of Privacy. It's important to know where your boundaries are so you don't inadvertently divulge more than you intend. Try not to let a moment of unbridled optimism trick you into giving away your trade secrets before you realize what happened."
capricorn,2012-12-08,"Although you have your own personal agenda, you're able to set it aside for the good of the community now that the Moon is reflecting your 10th House of Status. You have earned respect from your peers and you intend to live up to your reputation. Confirmation of your social standing is important, but don't be cavalier with issues of the heart. Acknowledging your feelings is the first step; deciding if or when to share them comes second."
aquarius,2012-12-08,"You may feel more balanced than you did yesterday, but you still need to exercise caution or you'll make too much of a fantasy. Your imagination is running strong now and it can recharge your soul. Just don't assume that every passing whim is a good idea and should be acted upon. Keep some juicy ideas to yourself in order to feed your dreams and keep them alive."
pisces,2012-12-08,"Even if you have things to do and people to see, carve out some time to pursue a variety of activities at home today. Lucky Jupiter in your 4th House of Domestic Conditions is receiving a practical boost of energy from red-hot Mars. You could accomplish more than you expect by going with the flow and doing a little of this, followed by a little of that. Instead of focusing on only one project now, let each moment take you where it will."
aries,2012-12-09,"You may not be eager to give up your freedom, even in a trade for an easier path in life. However, you will likely choose being responsible today over being independent, although you might not be happy with your decision. Unfortunately, holding on to your annoyance can create problems. Expressing your negativity and then letting it go enables you to avoid resentment later on. Living an ordinary life in an extraordinary manner helps you achieve spiritual satisfaction."
taurus,2012-12-09,"You may be feeling stress today because of previous promises, and these commitments could prevent you from fully enjoying yourself. Although your goals might be quite straightforward, nothing seems simple with everyone making demands on your time. Unexpressed emotions can turn an easygoing situation into a tangle of intrigue. Don't wait to address the source of a problem if you understand what's going on. The sooner you start untying the knots, the smoother it will go."
gemini,2012-12-09,"Your passions are running deep, making you feel less than comfortable today. The intensity of relationship dynamics grows stronger as your emotions sink into the shadows of your subconscious. There isn't a lot of room for error now, so think through your plan before you initiate a process that can't be stopped midstream. Taking the time to consider what your heart needs empowers you to make the right choice."
cancer,2012-12-09,"Although the Moon's afternoon shift into emotional Scorpio reminds you that your feelings control so much of what you do, you may not be able to change the outcome of the present situation. You might attempt to see both sides of a relationship issue at first, but are forced to take a side later on. Listen to your inner voice, but also be certain that your plan makes logical sense before doing something you soon regret."
leo,2012-12-09,"Although there is still a lot of hard work to do over the next few weeks, you're thankful that things are beginning to settle down. Instead of trying to tie up loose ends, you're more inclined now to take the day off for rest and relaxation. Balancing your hectic schedule with a bit of peaceful solitude at home today may be the smartest use of your time."
virgo,2012-12-09,"You're able to easily incorporate big changes into your life now without too much difficulty. However, you're not interested in simply trading a relaxing Sunday for one filled with distracting busyness. Thankfully, making a commitment to express yourself creatively empowers you to realize your greatest potential. Share whatever comes to mind, even if it complicates things today. It really doesn't matter what artistic medium you use, just let your imagination be your guide."
libra,2012-12-09,"Although you can find the time to kick back today, you might trick yourself into thinking that you will get away without fulfilling all of your responsibilities. However, there is a difference between pursuing ambitious goals and simply honoring your promises. You may have to make up for lost time later in the evening if your laziness gets the best of you. Balancing work with play is a safer strategy than going to either extreme."
scorpio,2012-12-09,"You may be presented with a significant fork in the road today, yet your current maps aren't clear about where either path leads. Unfortunately, your decision-making process is a lot more complicated because of this ambiguity. Nevertheless, the Moon's shift into your perceptive sign later in the day triggers your final answer and emboldens you to paint your future just as you visualize it in your imagination."
sagittarius,2012-12-09,"It feels as if it's a whole new ballgame once you decide that you're ready to buckle down and get to work. Surprisingly, your procrastination may succeed for a while, yet the tide can shift so quickly today that you must make pragmatic choices or drift off course. Ironically, it's your dreams that reveal the most sensible strategy at this time. Integrating your creative vision with your current reality is an excellent recipe for success."
capricorn,2012-12-09,"Your social life continues to be highly energized today as the emotional Moon moves into your 11th House of Community. Although your friends may be overwhelmed with your relentless intensity, you just want to do the right thing. You're not interested in making mistakes that could send the wrong message. However, giving yourself permission to have fun is more important than anything else now. Ironically, you'll feel better and your connections will deepen if you don't try so hard."
aquarius,2012-12-09,"You may be enjoying the anticipation of what's around the next bend, but other people's demands can squelch the excitement today. The Moon's afternoon shift into your 10th House of Public Responsibility reminds you that you're not as independent as you wish. Establishing new priorities helps you navigate your way through tricky territory. But choose carefully because your current choices will likely have a lasting impact."
pisces,2012-12-09,You're not interested in casual conversations today because you may feel as if you're running out of time. You have no patience for social games that distract you from the real issues since you want to go for the emotional jugular vein now. Sharing a story about your personal journey can inspire others to take charge of their lives by choosing love over fear.
aries,2012-12-10,"You might pursue the path that appears to engage less conflict, even if you're willing to handle the intensity of your feelings. Although you are tempted to choose the easy way out, you probably won't be able to enjoy yourself until you address an unresolved emotional issue. Just don't expect an immediate solution; this one could take some patience and persistence to unravel."
taurus,2012-12-10,"A coworker or friend may react strongly to your stubbornness today, but an unexpected confrontation might not make much of a difference. Keeping your emotional turmoil to yourself makes the situation easier to manage. However, floating through the day without getting involved won't likely be an option. Stop fighting the inevitable; the sooner you face your own resistance and share what's on your mind, the easier it will be for everyone to accept your truth."
gemini,2012-12-10,"You don't need to wait until the end of the year to make a resolution. In fact, an important decision today could set you on a positive course that significantly improves your lifestyle. But instead of dreaming about distant goals, pick something manageable you can do right now and then get started. Living in a healthier manner begins in the present moment."
cancer,2012-12-10,"Your tenacity is one of your greatest strengths, so don't be afraid to hold on to a feeling that's important to you now. This need for emotional security can be the basis for enduring love, especially if you tend to worry about changes you cannot control. But don't waste energy being too judgmental of your cautious nature; your persistence will bring success in due time."
leo,2012-12-10,"If it feels like you're running into an immovable wall of emotion, don't think that you can crash your way through the resistance today. Navigating relationships isn't about getting your way; it's about recognizing someone else's desire to participate in controlling the course of events. Instead of automatically fighting for something you don't need, show your strength and just let it go. Think cooperation instead of competition."
virgo,2012-12-10,"Your highly focused passion can be a real lifesaver today because you don't have a lot of time to waste. You know exactly what you want and are ready to do whatever is necessary to get it. This no-nonsense approach may scare away others, but that's not your main concern now. Your current primary directive is to stay true to yourself and follow your bliss."
libra,2012-12-10,"You may feel as if you're caught between your desire to be real now and your natural tendency to put others at ease. However, your emotions continue to deepen today, even if you try to gloss over any unexpressed negativity. A wave of enthusiasm later in the day can raise your hopes, but you'll be happier in the long run if you are honest about your needs instead of attempting to please everyone else."
scorpio,2012-12-10,"Be as natural as you can today, rather than trying to fit yourself into someone else's expectations. With so many planets currently in your emotional sign, it's crucial to express yourself as clearly as possible. If you worry about what others might think now, you could lose touch with your own integrity. Don't forget that your guiding star shines from within."
sagittarius,2012-12-10,"You may be on the edge of spiritual renewal as rational Mercury enters your philosophical sign today, followed by the Moon tomorrow. But this metaphysical reawakening doesn't require you to go to church or practice specific rituals. Just acknowledge the magic of your inner world now. Take time for contemplation while you can since you might be pushed into the spotlight sooner than you think."
capricorn,2012-12-10,"You may start off fairly certain about what's happening, but grow less sure of yourself as the day continues. Even a little dance with doubt can make it progressively more difficult to separate your fantasies from your perceptions. Instead of announcing any significant decisions now, try to let the day slide by without changing your direction or surrendering your position. There's no need to make a move until your clarity returns."
aquarius,2012-12-10,"You should be able to maintain a clear perspective on your current reality now as long as you concentrate on outer events. It's always wise to set goals and focus on accomplishing them. Unfortunately, it becomes more challenging to follow through on your projects if you start to daydream. Keep in mind that staying on track and getting things done today will give you more time to relax tomorrow."
pisces,2012-12-10,"The thought of embarking on a trip is quite enticing now and you may be intent on finding a way to escape your responsibilities. However, you're less concerned about actually going anywhere in the present moment; you are happy just planning for the future. Keep in mind that it's not even necessary to follow through with your current dreams. The very act of imagining all the possible adventures today is like taking a mini-vacation in its own way."
aries,2012-12-11,"Although you're very motivated now to charge ahead, it's challenging to know what's really going on around you. Don't become distracted by the sideshows; although intriguing, they might draw your attention away from the real work at hand. Your words may touch others deeply today, so share a spirit of openness by talking about your heart's desires. Your message can be inspiring, even if it's not what someone expects to hear."
taurus,2012-12-11,"Your thinking can land you in a heap of trouble today, unless you are clear about what you want. You might enjoy the mental exercise as your thoughts run around in circles like a hamster on a wheel. Unfortunately, your compulsive thinking could slip into unproductive fantasies, which may not be so bad, except that you have more important things to do now. Set your goals early in the day and be singularly focused as you head for your current destination."
gemini,2012-12-11,"It is tempting to focus on external circumstances today because there are so many important interactions taking place. However, if you live only in the outer realms, you may find yourself in endless conversations that lead nowhere. On the other hand, you could discover an important truth that sheds clarity on a current relationship issue if you have the courage to look within. Remember the dance you do with anyone else is actually a reflection of your own issues."
cancer,2012-12-11,"It is one thing to experience your feelings as strongly as you do. However, it's an entirely different matter if you expect others to become as invested in your process as you are now. No matter how hard you try to keep an emotional discussion on a single track today, it will probably meander all over the place anyhow. You don't always need to control the outcome and others don't have to mirror your moods just to make you feel better. Exercising your subtle sense of humor is one way to lighten the energy for everyone involved."
leo,2012-12-11,"No matter how intense a situation grows today, staying calm helps you successfully get through it. Someone may be playing power games and you might be in on the action now without even knowing it. Although you just continue to run on an energetic high, pushing your own needs ahead of the pack, you might be barking up the wrong tree. Whatever you think you see isn't real; the ultimate meaning is in your heart and not in your head."
virgo,2012-12-11,"Your key planet Mercury receives fuzzy signals from nebulous Neptune today, and your typically logical mind might lose track of your purpose. At worst, you may be distracted by unimportant events. At best, you're eager to explore new meaning in your life that arises from your own personal mythic journey. Even if you are uncomfortable, keep in mind that the psychic nutrients being stirred now can nourish your soul."
libra,2012-12-11,"You're moving through a confusing intersection now as you're driven by your own impractical desires. Although you may silently luxuriate in the sweet fruits of your fantasies, sharing them with others adds higher levels of enjoyment today. Don't keep your thoughts secret since your enlightening dreams can also bring new awareness to your friends."
scorpio,2012-12-11,"Your confidence continues to grow now because you can see the value you bring to the table. Since you're often motivated by non-material goals, it's challenging to appraise your real worth. Nevertheless, it's also time to reap rewards from the seeds that you have sown. Don't worry about the significance of what's happening today; just gratefully accept the dividends with a receptive spirit and a humble heart."
sagittarius,2012-12-11,"You might feel pressure to say what is true versus what is effective today. You could find yourself in a situation where you're better off keeping your opinion to yourself. However, your words reveal what you're thinking as soon as you open your mouth. Talk softly because you can come on so strong now that others miss your point. If you let your thoughts wander without purpose, they will probably get you into trouble. Listen more than you speak for the best results."
capricorn,2012-12-11,"You need to take a leap of faith today. Even if the odds don't seem to be in your favor, you still might have to jump. Thankfully, your chances for success are better than they appear, for you may be basing a negative assessment on your fears of the unknown. Let go of your expectations and concentrate on what you can learn from this challenging situation. Breaking through the rational restraints that normally limit your progress could turn out to be an exhilarating process."
aquarius,2012-12-11,"A host of strange events is coming your way, yet your attachment to the possibility of what may happen could have you secretly smiling. Although you've embarked on your own private magical mystery tour, you might not want your friends to perceive just how weird you are now. Don't waste energy hiding your true self from others. They probably already know about your eccentricities and accept you for the wonderful person you are."
pisces,2012-12-11,"Although your imaginative thoughts could be too much to share with your boss today, your spiritual and emotional dimensions are opening wider than ever -- and you're enjoying the experience. Your intuitive radar is picking up faint signals from the cosmos, filling your world with vivid dreams. Even if someone misunderstands you, don't waste time wondering what to do next. For now, just pay attention to the signs that appear and be receptive to the messages they bring."
aries,2012-12-12,"Creative sparks fire your intellect today as the Moon joins Mercury in visionary Sagittarius. The next few weeks hold many adventures in store for you, but now they begin as a mere thought. Consider what you want to do and where you want to go as if you're viewing reality through a wide-angle lens to give you a sweeping panorama. You'll have plenty of opportunities to narrow your focus later on."
taurus,2012-12-12,"You feel as if your life is on track, even if you have some dissatisfaction with your current situation. This is a delicate transition though, since you're questioning surface appearances now as you look for the meaning behind the circumstances. Allowing yourself to wander in the realms of your imagination brings positive results, even if it seems impractical today."
gemini,2012-12-12,"Your ruling planet Mercury remains in your 7th House of Significant Others until the end of the year, encouraging you to communicate within the agreed limitations of your relationships. You're not as content being witty and clever now; instead, you prefer to explore abstract realms to expand your thinking. The further you reach, the more you will learn."
cancer,2012-12-12,"You may be on-edge during the next three weeks as your thoughts resist settling into the normally nurturing waters of your emotional world. You might even try to move your feelings into a more spiritual place; although your strategy seems sound, your moods have a life of their own. Don't let anyone, including yourself, keep you from experiencing what's in your heart."
leo,2012-12-12,"You are extra feisty with the Sun, the Moon and Mercury moving through fellow Fire sign Sagittarius and your 5th House of Playfulness. Burn off some of your mental energy by being more spontaneous than usual. You could even use your current creativity to promote a product or an idea. Better yet, believe that you can fly and let the power of your positive thoughts lift you over the walls of your self-imposed restrictions."
virgo,2012-12-12,"Your key planet Mercury may be problematic now as it visits expansive Sagittarius. Since you are often the Tamer of Details and Sagittarius is the King of Grandiose, there could be a tug-of-war that stretches you between the very big and the very small. Although staying in between can test your patience, it's exactly what you must do at this time."
libra,2012-12-12,"The pace of your daily life picks up during the next few weeks, and the busyness isn't just about the holiday season. You may find yourself taking a more philosophical approach to interactions with friends. You will likely try to do more than can possibly be accomplished, without much concern if you actually finish anything. It's all about your attitude these days. Keep it positive and you can get through even the toughest challenges."
scorpio,2012-12-12,"You may feel the energy lighten up as communicator Mercury leaves your intense sign for the more philosophical world of Sagittarius. The Archer controls your ideas now, aiming the arrows of thought toward the next great adventure in your life. Nevertheless, you seek to re-establish basic values that drive your life forward. Be practical, even when thinking about long-term goals, but don't be afraid to dream."
sagittarius,2012-12-12,"You are entering a highly active phase that persists until the end of the year. Your mind is on fire with new concepts and you're itching to share them in any way possible. All manners of communication seem urgent these days; it's a fantastic time to engage anyone with your ideas. However, remind yourself on a regular basis to also listen to what others are saying. You can learn just as much as you can teach."
capricorn,2012-12-12,"Your down-to-earth approach to life may have to take a back seat now to a more expansive and optimistic view. Pay attention to your daydreams because they can play a significant role in the coming weeks. If you remain clear in purpose and keep your heart open, you stand a strong chance of getting what you want, even if it doesn't happen right away."
aquarius,2012-12-12,"You're trying to do the right thing socially, but a conflict that hasn't been resolved may linger for a while longer. Thankfully, you have great use of your mental faculties now that Mercury is visiting your 11th House of Networking. However, if you appear overly confident, others might think you're trying to cover up the truth. State your case clearly without going over the top in order to receive the best response."
pisces,2012-12-12,"It's your time to step into the bright lights and receive the recognition you have earned. Whatever you say these days has great impact because your words hit home with those who look to you for guidance. Don't shy away from the attention, since you deserve any rewards that come your way over the next few weeks. Just be sure not to take yourself too seriously even when others are toasting your success."
aries,2012-12-13,"The Sagittarius New Moon activates your 9th House of Future Vision, opening your mind to all the possibilities ahead. But no matter what you imagine, the next few days will likely unfold differently than you expect. Don't worry about changing your strategy yet. Just be thankful for the little progress you make, even if it seems as if you aren't getting any closer to your goals. You may look back happily on these days when you realize how much you actually accomplished."
taurus,2012-12-13,"You might make a tactical error if you're moving too fast today, so take your time when dealing with an important issue. The big-thinking Sagittarius New Moon falls in your 8th House of Deep Sharing, inspiring you to be radically honest in your relationships. However, you may become so enamored with the big picture that you could leave out a critical detail. Be methodical and cover all your bases just in case."
gemini,2012-12-13,"The independent Sagittarius New Moon is in your 7th House of Others, where it can stress a variety of partnerships. Even an intimate relationship that seems stable should be given additional attention now to revitalize it. Your perspective is shifting, but attempting to control the changes is not a viable game plan. Instead, focus on the potential for success rather than worrying about what might go wrong."
cancer,2012-12-13,"You may have high hopes about accomplishing a lot today, but unrealistic work goals could set you up for discouragement as the visionary Sagittarius New Moon lands in your 6th House of Employment. Scaling back makes sense, since biting off more than you can chew won't necessarily make you any more productive. Breaking your tasks down into little steps enables you to rise above your current tendency to promise too much."
leo,2012-12-13,"Your most creative ideas can carry you beyond your expectations as long as you're having fun while the outgoing Sagittarius New Moon is in your 5th House of Play. Don't be afraid to show all your cards now, for there's really no reason to keep anything hidden. Either you will get what you want or you won't. Accept the consequences of your actions and move on to what is next when the time is right."
virgo,2012-12-13,"Today's Sagittarius New Moon in your 4th House of Security offers a fresh start with respect to home and family issues. However, you must be sure that your current direction is consistent with your long-term goals. Don't ignore your heart's desire, even if it seems totally irrational. Trust your gut instincts now because the answers you seek won't come from logical analysis."
libra,2012-12-13,"The Sagittarius New Moon excites your 3rd House of Immediate Environment, prompting you to feel as if your schedule is spinning out of control because you have so many commitments. You still may be busy even if you cancel an appointment or withdraw from a social activity. But the hectic energy can also be fun now. Don't worry; the intensity will settle down. In the meantime, make the most of the momentum while it lasts."
scorpio,2012-12-13,"You may find your core values being called into question as today's Sagittarius New Moon falls in your 2nd House of Self-Esteem. Although someone else's actions could trigger issues that raise your concern, there's a chance that others might actually be following your lead. Keep in mind that no one else can make you feel better about who you are; your self-worth must come from within."
sagittarius,2012-12-13,"Your life is continuing to transform and today's New Moon in your sign is your ticket into the next stage of ongoing personal growth. The opportunities that are presented to you now should be received as messages directly from the heart of the cosmos. It may take time to understand the significance of current events. In the meantime, gratefully receive the gifts that arrive on your doorstep with an open heart."
capricorn,2012-12-13,"Unanticipated events might throw you for a loop today, but the practical facts are ultimately more important than your idealistic visions. Nevertheless, the Sagittarius New Moon falls in your 12th House of Fantasy, indicating that your dreams have something crucial to teach you now, too. Don't ignore what you don't understand or life could become more confusing. But once you accept that there are no fast answers, you may grow in ways that make you wiser and stronger."
aquarius,2012-12-13,"The Sagittarius New Moon occurs in your 11th House of Long-Term Goals today, leading you into the future by shining the light of awareness on to your hopes. Thankfully, you're being guided now by your own inspiring thoughts. You possess great potential to see possibilities that were previously hidden, but your commitment is required. Keep your eyes open and focus on the road ahead rather than looking in the rear view window, reminiscing about the past."
pisces,2012-12-13,"Your career objectives are shifting today as the Sagittarius New Moon stimulates your 10th House of Status. Even if you're eager for the upcoming changes to start, don't overdo your reaction to what's happening. Taking it slowly and steadily works to your advantage as you navigate this tricky bend in the road. Don't become too attached to your present path, for you may need to modify your course as you go."
aries,2012-12-14,"You're ready for nearly anything today and if something really exciting doesn't happen, you might be willing to stir up a bit of trouble just for the fun of it. Paradoxically, the closer you get to taking action, the more you feel that you should be careful. Listen to both voices because acting on a brilliant thought may be just what you need. However, if you're taking a risk, at least start out slowly to see how it's going to work out before you jump in full force."
taurus,2012-12-14,"It may be difficult to settle down now, for your thoughts are running amok and leading you on wild goose chases all over the place. Instead of trying to solve the mysteries of the universe today, it might be smarter to concentrate on what's directly in front of you. The long-term dilemmas are not going to disappear, but you'll be better equipped to handle them in a less frenzied atmosphere. In the meantime, finishing your work before the weekend gives you a sense of satisfaction."
gemini,2012-12-14,"Your key planet Mercury is receiving unexpected instructions from electric Uranus today, enticing you to engage in edgy conversations that you might otherwise avoid. However, you may believe that you have nothing to lose if you tell others exactly what you think. Nevertheless, it's wiser to act with a bit of caution and compassion. Don't say anything hurtful that could make you wish you said nothing at all."
cancer,2012-12-14,"The Moon in your 7th House of Others highlights intense interactions, but you might bring more passion to the situation than someone else can handle. However, avoiding discussions is not a viable option. It's better now to engage intellectually rather than emotionally, so you don't scare others away with your unrestrained disclosure of too much information. Focus on the most practical issues and talk about your feelings another day."
leo,2012-12-14,"It can be challenging to follow through on your obligations because you have so many jobs you must do today. Mischievous Mercury trines irrepressible Uranus in your 9th House of Faraway Places, tempting you to daydream, instead. However, you also have enough enthusiasm to initiate action on a strategic plan that you keep postponing. There's nothing wrong with grandiose thinking as long as you don't mix up your fantasies with what's actually possible in the real world."
virgo,2012-12-14,"A fiery trine between interactive Mercury and radical Uranus today can prompt you to react before looking at a situation through your reliable analytical filter. You could be flooded with a wide array of wild and crazy ideas that actually appear viable at first. There's no need to block out any thought that pops into your mind now, but only take action on the ideas that are the most realistic."
libra,2012-12-14,"Clever Mercury trines innovative Uranus in your 7th House of Partners, indicating that working with others doesn't have to impede your progress. The encouragement you now receive from an exciting relationship also reminds you that reaching your goal is not enough. You need acknowledgment from your friends and associates, too. However, it's not wise to let your desire to be recognized stand in the way of your productivity today. Express your brilliant ideas without worrying about what others might think."
scorpio,2012-12-14,"Be bold and take a chance by demonstrating your willingness to do a job differently today, even if your unconventional approach makes you less efficient. The potential for a significant breakthrough is great, yet your most brilliant plans won't conform to comfortable routines. Nevertheless, you don't need to act on every brilliant idea. Pick the best one and then work to make it real."
sagittarius,2012-12-14,"A new project may have recently grabbed your attention, and now you're tempted to jump ahead before building a strong foundation. Your plans might be quite sound, but you still need to slow down or you will get too far ahead of everyone else. Just a touch of extra patience is enough to help you be more effective today, especially if you want to be the leader of the pack."
capricorn,2012-12-14,"You may feel deeply connected to your own needs, and this could make you difficult to get along with today. On the surface you demonstrate your readiness to work closely with others, yet your dissatisfaction is more transparent than you think. Your actions and your words might not be in step with each other now. Don't talk about what you're going to do; instead, just do it."
aquarius,2012-12-14,"Your key planet Uranus normally encourages you to behave unconventionally, but today it's logical Mercury that fills you with more ideas than you can express. You're inclined to tell everyone everything that you are thinking now, but doing so could scatter your efforts. Keep some thoughts to yourself or you'll dissipate your energy in each passing moment without leaving anything to show for your brilliance. A little self-restraint goes a long way toward saving the day."
pisces,2012-12-14,"Your eagerness to share an original idea is the greatest gift you can give someone today. Your self-confidence could appear contrived at first, but others will realize that you have plenty of practical logic to back up your point of view. It's unnecessary to play down your eccentricities now; you don't have to conform to anyone else's expectations. Just tell it as you see it and let the chips fall as they may."
aries,2012-12-15,"You may be feeling anxious today and ready to unload your building anger with just the slightest provocation. However, beneath the apparent aggression is an important message that could get lost in your intensity. Releasing the pent-up energy is a good idea. Just do it gracefully, so everyone can handle your unexpected emotional disclosure. Being bold and saying what's on your mind might just lead to a brilliant breakthrough."
taurus,2012-12-15,"You receive support from today's pragmatic Capricorn Moon, but she still might challenge you to act sensibly. Keep your mind on business now, rather than getting lost in personal dramas that are beyond your control. Try not to let someone provoke you; steer clear of emotional conflicts that don't concern you. This could turn out to be an exciting and productive day if you can simply concentrate on a positive message."
gemini,2012-12-15,"Your clever tongue is especially sharp today, but you might be more inclined to take direct action instead of just talking about your intentions. If you're in a rut, go ahead and create fireworks to change the mood. But once the light show is over, don't return to the same old comfort zone. Instead, try new solutions that can set the tone for an exciting year ahead."
cancer,2012-12-15,"Trusting your feelings is usually a sensible strategy, but now it's a bit of a trickier process. Your emotions are operating at a higher frequency and you're eager to spring into action. However, it may be too easy to get lured into a relationship drama that isn't even yours -- until you find yourself in the middle of a crisis. However, keeping your opinions to yourself today makes the day flow more smoothly. Minding your own business enables you to rise above the noise."
leo,2012-12-15,"You may feel as if you're being tested today as you attempt to do your job effectively. But even if you think you're doing well, someone might not agree. It's critical to listen to the feedback that others are giving you now. A situation could unravel quickly unless you tie up the loose ends. Take advantage of the present moment and be willing to compromise in order to move forward."
virgo,2012-12-15,"You may be feeling down-to-earth, but your behavior reveals a less sensible side to your personality today. Unfortunately, you can be frustrated in your unsuccessful attempts to convey how well you could manage a rather sticky situation. Perhaps this is because others worry that your solution might not fix anything. Don't be so sure of yourself that you miss what's most important."
libra,2012-12-15,"You are extremely busy this holiday season, and it won't likely let up through the end of the year. Nevertheless, you still have pressing choices to make now, so don't get completely sidetracked by the craziness, especially if you can avoid it. Keep your eyes on your goals and worry just a little less about everyone else. If you slip off track, just consciously refocus on your original plan."
scorpio,2012-12-15,"The present situation seems familiar, but it's highly possible that you only played through the scenario in your mind. Now it's time to live it out in reality as the currents of change pick up speed. You could exhaust yourself trying to fight it, but it's smarter to just go with the flow. Even if you're not heading exactly where you want to go today, remember that the tides can reverse directions suddenly. Save your strength for later on when you'll need it to reach your final destination."
sagittarius,2012-12-15,"You're ready to put your plans into action and probably feel confident that everything's going to fall into place now. But instead of concentrating on reaching your goal, focus on your deepest core values that inspire you, instead. If you have too many things to do on your list, you might not know where to start. However, if you have your priorities in order, you can make decisions moment by moment and still accomplish what you set out to do."
capricorn,2012-12-15,"You feel grounded with the evocative Moon still in your earthy sign, but there's also a lingering anxiety that won't let you relax as a complex  situation grows even more complicated. Any negative energy you are withholding might erupt if you don't vent it somehow. Take time to examine your buried feelings and then express them in a kind and loving manner. It may be stressful at first, but everyone will appreciate the chance to clear the air."
aquarius,2012-12-15,"You can feel the excitement turn into tension today as the Moon moves into your high-strung sign. You want to be seen and heard now, and will work to overcome obstacles that stand in your way. But don't do something rash unless you can rationalize it, because impulsive actions might create distracting situations. Sometimes it's wise to just observe what's happening without having to do anything about it."
pisces,2012-12-15,"Although you may feel overwhelmed by the demands of life, it's not just irrelevant noise that requires your attention today. You have obligations to fulfill and lessons to learn now from surrendering to the chaotic flow of events. Try slipping into the holiday spirit if you're looking for ways to blow off some excess energy. However, don't overdo it or you could sail by the treasure that's right in front of you at this time."
aries,2012-12-16,"You want to know about everything that's happening now, yet there's more occurring than meets the eye. Trouble may be brewing and your role in the situation isn't clear because your imagination is overtaking reality. You could be restless, even rebellious. Life is playing games with you today, but you might miss the action if your concentration lapses. Paying close attention to what is real is the most important thing you can do."
taurus,2012-12-16,"Although you might not be clear about your place in the outer world now, you're pretty sure that something feels good -- and that's enough for you to pursue it. However, your senses and your imagination are being overstimulated today, challenging you to maintain good judgment. If something disappoints you, this is reality's way of telling you what you need to know. Don't hold on to an illusion; uncovering the truth can feel surprisingly liberating in the end."
gemini,2012-12-16,"It's difficult to know who your allies are now because the signals are rather confusing. Someone close to you may be difficult to read today, making it tricky navigating your course through the weird circumstances that are playing out in your life. You could get so worked up that it's hard to find your way back to mental clarity. But instead of panicking and seeking an immediate answer, let the circumstances develop for a day or two until you have a healthier perspective."
cancer,2012-12-16,"Even if someone thinks you are acting a bit strange today, you still could be truly inspired. Your senses are so finely tuned now that you might be able to hear mermaids singing sea chants in an unintelligible forgotten language. Oddly, these strange sounds make perfect sense and you intuitively know exactly what they mean. The waters of your subconscious are rising but there's no threat of danger, so don't bother trying to hold back the flood."
leo,2012-12-16,"A close friend or lover may throw you a curve ball today and you might not see it coming. Thankfully, it doesn't feel all that unpleasant even if you do get broadsided by a surprising situation, especially if you're able to let go of your previous expectations. Instead of trying to regain control of your day, relax and see where the new path leads. A little uncertainty can inspire you to express yourself in a highly creative manner."
virgo,2012-12-16,"You're being drawn out beyond the comfort of your analytical mind today. The logical answers that you like to have at your fingertips are just beyond your reach now, prompting you to lose your rhythm as you go about your day. However, this intellectual fuzziness has a purpose; forget about the details and let your intuition be your guide."
libra,2012-12-16,"Your common sense may be temporarily unavailable, leaving you to feel as if you're on your own without any guidance. In this moment all you have is your next whim, so don't try to suppress these powerful products of your imagination. Nevertheless, acting as if every fantasy is real will only complicate your life. Enjoy your daydreams, but keep the facts separate from your creative fiction."
scorpio,2012-12-16,"You can delve into the depths of your own inner world today or become fascinated with someone else's. Either way, be prepared to go on a magical yet bewildering ride, since it may be impossible to know what is real as you are experiencing it. You might actually slip into a parallel universe for a while as you are entranced by a fantasy. If you have the courage to go on this imaginative journey, you'll return soon enough with a treasure from the distant reaches of your own subconscious mind."
sagittarius,2012-12-16,"You are often quite certain about your personal tastes, but can talk yourself into liking almost anything now. You are being pulled into a beautiful dream by an emotional craving that is stronger than your normal desires. You may gravitate toward someone or something, only to realize in a few days' time that your perceptions weren't real -- except within your own imagination. Exercising good judgment today prevents an unnecessary letdown just around the corner."
capricorn,2012-12-16,"You might be surprised at the power of your inner voice if you rely on your own experiences today. You believe that you're speaking with clarity of vision and strength of purpose. But even if others think that you are a force to be reckoned with now, you still should be careful with how you pursue your ambitions. Avoid taking any shortcuts or trying to mislead anyone. You will have the allies you need if your friends and family respect your integrity and your work."
aquarius,2012-12-16,"Your emotions may be bent out of shape today and it's difficult to know what to do about it. Whatever corrective action you choose, don't hold your uncertainty inside or you could explode like a volcano releasing steam. But even if you are confused about what you want, a dose of old-fashioned charm can soften the hearts of those around you, allowing you to make it through the day without incident."
pisces,2012-12-16,"Expressing your hopes about the future may be difficult today, prompting you to feel detached from your inner self. Do something eccentric or unusual to reconnect with your dreams or you might have to look for an escape hatch with more serious consequences. A mini-vacation or spiritual retreat could be just what the doctor ordered at this time. However, if you can't get away now, enjoy planning something special for the near future."
aries,2012-12-17,"You may talk as if you're on top of your game today, but you might be surprised when you realize the powerful effect you have on people in your immediate environment. Even if you are doing a bit of daydreaming now, consider making practical changes based on concrete experiences rather than some philosophical tangent. But don't attempt to fix everything all at once; take one step at a time."
taurus,2012-12-17,"Powerful people at work can totally overwhelm you with their grandiose plans today. It's apparent their ideas are misguided and they need to pay closer attention to the finer points. It may be your job now to gently remind others that even the greatest journeys are dependent on getting the details right. Instead of just saying yes, it's crucial to tell the truth exactly as you see it. Being the messenger isn't always easy, but someone has to do it and this time it's you."
gemini,2012-12-17,"You might feel as if you have promised more than you can deliver today. Perhaps you have lost focus and are overcompensating by trying to accomplish too much. The simplest solution is to be honest, but you may be afraid to admit that you're in over your head. Nevertheless, there's no reason to pretend that you have it all together if you actually don't. You will be better off in the long run by showing your vulnerability now and asking for help."
cancer,2012-12-17,"Fun and games sound better than hard work, but you're not in the mood to skip out and join your friends, even if it looks like they're having a good time. You are more likely to encourage everyone else to play while you stay behind to fulfill your obligations. It's not that you have such an impeccable work ethic; rather, you couldn't relax now knowing how much you have to do. Cover your bases first and then join up with your pals later."
leo,2012-12-17,"You may have to take a stand at work today; however, you might oversimplify a rather complex issue in order to make your point. There are conflicting opinions to be considered now, yet each person seems to be working with a different set of facts. Even if you believe that your solution is the most elegant, be prepared to let the group consensus override your personal position. Building trust with your community is more important than being right."
virgo,2012-12-17,"Although you're often the champion of details, today it's difficult to sustain your concentration. Even a quick phone call or short email could turn into a major project that distracts you from your goals. Every little thought opens a door to another journey of epic proportions. However, you don't have to go on every trip that's offered. Do yourself a favor by keeping your life as simple as possible until you're truly ready for something new."
libra,2012-12-17,"Normally you can avoid stress by talking out of both sides of your mouth until you muster up enough courage to begin a difficult conversation. However, today you may be eager to share your most intense desires. Your direct approach and willingness to go out on a limb could surprise others and possibly even put them off. Broach the subject slowly and wait for positive acknowledgment before going further."
scorpio,2012-12-17,"You may grow impatient in a relationship-oriented conversation today because the other person seems to take forever to say even the simplest thing. Maybe part of the problem is that you are sure of yourself when it comes to feelings, even if you choose to remain silent. However, once you decide to play your hand, you might dive right in. Paradoxically, you can speed things up by backing off and allowing others the time to put their emotions into words."
sagittarius,2012-12-17,"It may be challenging to keep your mind on your own agenda today when other people lure you into stories about their fantastic ideas. Nevertheless, it's crucial to remember that you are the one who is in control of your own thoughts. If you accomplish your assigned tasks first, then you'll have adequate time later on to get lost in your dreams or go along for a ride on someone else's."
capricorn,2012-12-17,"The intensity of your co-workers may become overwhelming today, yet listening to their crazy ideas can also be a major source for growth and fun. In fact, this could be a perfect moment to participate in team sports, join a club or get active in a social cause. Even if it's a workday, set your obligations aside for a while and make plans to enjoy the sweet company of others."
aquarius,2012-12-17,"You have something important to say today, yet it seems as if you don't have enough time to start the conversation. Activities at work may be pulling your energy away from personal matters, but it's critical to find enough balance so you don't ignore your home and family. Although you might not be able to tackle the entire situation all at once, begin by talking about what's most crucial and move on from there."
pisces,2012-12-17,"It feels as if others are leaning on you today, but you may not be very emotionally available to them. Someone might want to talk about a specific issue, but your overly optimistic mood motivates you to stick with generalities. This difference of approach doesn't need to be problematic as long as you're willing to give a little for the sake of lasting friendship. Opening your heart is enough to invite positive change."
aries,2012-12-18,"Your day could start off as if it was a dream, but you may quickly acknowledge the limits of your fantasies as other people's expectations become more real. It might be difficult to balance your inner and outer worlds because your enthusiasm builds throughout the day, tempting you to go the extra mile in search of success. Instead of trying to avoid the inevitable, let go of any resistance and ride the wave while you can."
taurus,2012-12-18,"You may be in an unsettled mood today, especially if you're distracted by someone you really like. Paradoxically, although you typically seek security from routine, you're excited now by the idea of doing things differently. Embrace your current sense of exhilaration since reaching many long-term goals is possible as long as you are willing to take a risk."
gemini,2012-12-18,"Your mood lightens up today, yet you could be carried off by the changing breeze if you're not somewhat careful. Your whimsical desires and clever witticisms are less constrained now by social conventions. You might even feel as if you can get away with anything. Go ahead and let your thoughts soar; just don't lose sight of your ultimate destination or you may end up making decisions that will delay your arrival."
cancer,2012-12-18,"Everything starts off lovely today and you feel strongly connected with your own emotions. This is sweet for you watery Crabs, but the energies shift as your comfort turns to worry. You know something big is on the way, but you can't discern exactly what it is yet. Be flexible and keep an open mind so you can see where you are heading before you arrive, and not after it's too late."
leo,2012-12-18,"Your creative expression kicks in early today, yet you might lose focus if you try to act on every good idea. It's smarter to pay attention to the symbols that arise from your imagination now rather than trying to over-analyze your dreams. Allow your fantasies to entertain and excite you, but be conservative with your commitments. Don't assume that you know what you want; it may turn out to be surprisingly different from your previous expectations."
virgo,2012-12-18,"If you have been experiencing differences of opinion with someone you love, it might be time to mend the conflict. A sudden resolution may come as an unexpected surprise, especially if no one has to give in to anyone else's demands. However, an out-of-the-box answer requires a lot of flexibility for everyone involved. You can get what you need as long as you remain open to all of the possibilities."
libra,2012-12-18,"Your life feels more unpredictable today, yet you don't really seem to mind. You may even be swept up in a tide of uncharacteristic enthusiasm as you consider an upcoming trip for relaxation or study. Your desires are pulling you into unfamiliar territory, yet you're open to the edgy experiences that this uncertainty suggests. Your natural talent can flourish in new ways, so don't hold back when it comes to expressing your creativity."
scorpio,2012-12-18,"There may be so much happening today that you cannot keep up with your own thoughts. However, there are very real issues that need to be addressed now, affecting situations in the outer world. But you could discover that you have made more promises than you can effectively keep. There's nothing wrong with getting caught up in your own exuberance as long as you remember to conserve some of your energy to make it last."
sagittarius,2012-12-18,"You continue to be a source of support and inspiration for others, even if your feelings are pulling at you from different directions. Your inner voice is reminding you to take care of your own needs; if you don't, then you won't have much energy to give to those around you. This is a challenging time because you must sustain multiple perspectives. Be patient; the longer you can postpone starting a new project today, the more equipped you'll be to do a good job."
capricorn,2012-12-18,"If your life has grown overly rigid, you may feel excess stress today as you dream about making radical changes. Your current opportunities at work are tests to see if you can loosen up enough to take advantage of the possibilities now coming your way. However, it's not just about maintaining a flexible attitude; it's also about setting priorities. Whatever you currently eliminate adds to the potential of increasing your freedom down the road."
aquarius,2012-12-18,"You are arriving at a high-energy intersection, and might feel the need to take charge and make something awesome happen. However, today's opportunities won't last long, so you have to be ready to jump in now if you want to capitalize on them. Initiate deliberate action to actualize your dreams before it's too late."
pisces,2012-12-18,"The past feels like a vortex today, and you're being sucked into it while simultaneously being pulled into your future. Weird energies that are invisible can add stress to your life as they float around you now. Nevertheless, your excitement is at a very high level. Don't try to avoid the tension; your best chance to resolve a lingering problem is to move directly toward its center. The way out is right through the middle of the storm."
aries,2012-12-19,"You feel a powerful need for excitement today and are drawn to anything that fires up your enthusiasm. You're on edge and cannot want for satisfaction. Fortunately, your spontaneity can be expressed creatively. Even if you're worried about offending someone special, be bold and take a walk on the wild side as charming Venus aligns with unconventional Uranus in your sign. This time you might just be able to get away with it."
taurus,2012-12-19,"Your current desires seem rather eccentric to you, but others may still believe that you're doing things by the book. Although you don't feel restrained by the rules today, it appears as if you're moving more cautiously than you actually are. Thankfully, you have the freedom now to make it up as you go along. Nevertheless, be careful how you apply your energy because you could wind up being the same authority that you're trying to resist."
gemini,2012-12-19,"Your day probably won't unfold according to your plan since you're riding waves of changeable emotional currents. Paradoxically, you won't likely be destabilized by any of the unexpected twists and turns in your path. Even if your behavior seems shocking to someone else, it feels like good clean fun to you -- so you may as well enjoy yourself while you can. If your actions are aligned with your heart, others might be more supportive than you expect."
cancer,2012-12-19,"You may feel emotionally secure within your own protective shell, but unstable circumstances at work today won't leave you alone. You might try to escape by hiding behind a rock or crawling deep into a cave, but it's not wise to miss too much of the action now. Although the intensity could make you nervous, the potential for progress is so great that you'll be glad if you take a chance and jump into the fray."
leo,2012-12-19,"Relationship dynamics can be pretty intense, but others may not realize how much you're going through now. Thankfully, a difficult situation quickly improves if you don't totally exhaust yourself with the volatile excitement today. You know something positive is happening, but it's not a good idea to get too cocky about it. Make time to rest because you need to be prepared for the long haul ahead and not just a one-time show."
virgo,2012-12-19,"Today's energy is a mixed bag with the dreamy Pisces Moon hanging out in your 7th House of Partners. Although fantasies may seem real, you're not willing to let surreal feelings dictate current events. You might be itching to alter your direction and break out of a boring routine, no matter what anyone else thinks about your vision. Ironically, your wildest ideas can lead you down a practical path."
libra,2012-12-19,"You have a potentially amazing day ahead of you as your key planet Venus dances in step with outrageous Uranus. Even the most unconventional ideas don't seem so crazy to you now. Be bold and give yourself permission to experience sensations that are different from anything else in your past. Fortunately, you can play whatever game is necessary to obtain what you most desire. Enjoy the excitement today before it fades into yesterday."
scorpio,2012-12-19,"You may find yourself thinking about things in ways that are usually outside of your comfort zone. You might not be able to keep your mind off sex today, even with the highest of spiritual intentions as the fantasy-prone Pisces Moon activates your 5th House of Love and Romance. But don't fall into the trap of believing that you must act on every thought. Fortunately, there is no harm now in enjoying them within the privacy of your own mind."
sagittarius,2012-12-19,"You can soar high above the clouds of imagination today while enjoying the fruits of your labor as long as you keep your excessive desires in check. Others may bring you crazy ideas now that aren't really as outrageous as they first seem. Even if an inventive idea sounds far-fetched, it still could be a viable one -- and, it might even be fun to pursue. Take a chance, but don't expect too much too fast in return."
capricorn,2012-12-19,"Go easy on those close to you, for your acceptance of others can catalyze an unexpected reward. You may experience an emotional earthquake if someone rattles your brain. But don't lash out at anyone, even if a real surprise is temporarily upsetting. Remember that the messenger only delivers the news. Roll with the punches, even if you don't like what you hear. Your flexible attitude makes all the difference in the world."
aquarius,2012-12-19,"Nearly everyone who comes into contact with you today can tell that this isn't just another regular day for you. You're feeling good about what makes you so unique now that sweet Venus aligns with your key planet irrepressible Uranus. Nevertheless, you're able to work closely with others while still expressing your individuality. Fortunately, whatever you do at this time is part of a bigger plan and you are thrilled with all the possibilities ahead."
pisces,2012-12-19,"You are getting an electric buzz today from magnetic Venus in your 10th House of Career as she trines brilliant Uranus. Luckily, the Moon in your sensitive sign enables you to imagine the best possible outcome. Throw the nets of your dreams as far as you can, and be prepared to pull in the big fish. No efforts go to waste; ironically, expressing your individual creativity now leads to long-term stability later on."
aries,2012-12-20,"You may be fired up, yet you could grow overly excited about the wrong things today. Your reactions might even be more impulsive than usual now that the Moon is back in your enterprising sign for a couple of days. Be particularly cautious if a friend brings you an opportunity that's too good to refuse. See how you feel about it in a day or two before making a final commitment. In the meantime, do your homework so you know what you're getting into with your eyes wide open."
taurus,2012-12-20,"You might actually convince yourself that you can keep your emotions hidden today, but they may leak out in ways you don't even notice. Others see through your casual attempts to play it cool now, so don't make matters worse by denying your feelings. Showing your vulnerability by telling someone your dreams could deepen your connection if you don't expect anything in return."
gemini,2012-12-20,"This is a great day to pursue a moneymaking idea as long as you don't try to take on the project all by yourself. Forging a working relationship with a powerful partner improves your chances for success. Remember, it's perfectly acceptable to lean on others for support and encouragement in the beginning. Thankfully, you shouldn't have to push very hard now before your friends pony up and give you what you need."
cancer,2012-12-20,"It's wise to proceed slowly today because you could quickly talk yourself into revealing more than you intend. Normally, you're inclined to keep your desires private unless you feel very secure. However, you're in a gambling mood now and may be ready to risk rejection for the sake of love. Take a chance, but don't aim so high that you will be disappointed no matter what happens."
leo,2012-12-20,"Reaching your destination is an uphill battle today because the serious life issues and corresponding responsibilities have not gone away. In theory, you're ready to leave with nearly anyone who has an idea for spontaneous fun. But in pragmatic terms escape isn't so simple. Differentiating between a sensible plan and an idealistic dream can be the difference now between success and failure."
virgo,2012-12-20,"You may feel as if you're ready to strike out on your own and do something exciting today, yet the best love and support come to you from the closest quarters. Your greatest admirer might be a family member or someone so close to you that you don't even see the treasure right in front of you. Choose the sweetness of familiarity for now over the potential thrills of the unknown."
libra,2012-12-20,"You might think that you can enjoy whatever you are doing today; however, you may quickly grow weary with any sort of repetitive work. Although your heightened restlessness could pleasantly surprise you, don't be seduced into thinking that this temporary phase will last. Avoid making long-term commitments until a more sensible outlook prevails tomorrow."
scorpio,2012-12-20,"Find a different way to do your routine jobs today because the Moon joins unpredictable Aries in your 6th House of Details. But don't be overly concerned if a new method doesn't work out as you expect; wasting some time now is a small price to pay for your mental health. Remember, if you try enough alternatives, one of them just might prove to be the timesaver you are seeking."
sagittarius,2012-12-20,"Turning on the charm today increases your ability to get away with a bit of mischief. However, it isn't smart to push limits or people may realize that your emotional veneer isn't sincere. You might be able to fool everyone for a while, but you won't get away with intentional deception. Be honest and be yourself instead of attempting to bend the odds in your favor."
capricorn,2012-12-20,"You cannot tell your friends and co-workers what you want today because it might alienate them and possibly make your goals less attainable. However, keeping your intentions quiet sends a signal to others that encourages them to share less, too. This is a delicate moment, since no one has all the facts necessary to make the right choice now. Reserve your final decision until you have more information at your disposal."
aquarius,2012-12-20,"You may feel energetically scattered today and might take on a busier schedule than necessary. Although you can derive joy from all the distractions, frustration will set in if you actually try to complete something you have started. It helps to recognize that nothing is as simple as it appears now. Avoid making commitments to finish anything until tomorrow to give yourself a little bit of breathing room."
pisces,2012-12-20,"An innovative way to tackle an old money problem is just what you need today to break out of a rut. Your current impatience with finding a solution only makes matters worse. However, a change of attitude has an immediate positive impact on your life in ways that you cannot yet imagine. Simply acknowledging the potential abundance of the universe may be enough to lessen the financial pressure, even if nothing else is different than it was in the past."
aries,2012-12-21,"Living up to other people's expectations may be a source of stress over these next few weeks. You mean well and you want to perform the duties properly, but obligations can stand in the way of your personal expression. Sometimes you think that life would be so much better if you didn't have to work. It isn't that you are lazy. In fact, your schedule is probably overbooked right now. You just wish you had time to do everything. Setting priorities today saves you from a headache later on."
taurus,2012-12-21,"You Bulls are practical and willing to work hard for what you want. The Sun's entry today into sensible Capricorn, another Earth sign, bodes well for you as new ideas and inspirations impact your life. Although you feel energized, you're not scattered. Use the month ahead to map out your life goals. But don't stick your head in the clouds or spend the next several weeks lost in dreams. Instead, visualize a clear path toward your own success and then follow it with determination."
gemini,2012-12-21,"The month ahead marks a time when even you normally lighthearted Twins need to be more serious about your life. You can successfully use this period to delve into psychological issues that you wish to better understand. Although you are quite familiar with diversionary tactics, this soulful exploration is not extracurricular now. On the contrary, it's the main course."
cancer,2012-12-21,"For the next few weeks the Sun hangs out in your 7th House of Others. Get ahead of the game and focus on the one-to-one relationships in your life. Use this time to learn about yourself through others. Don't try to venture off on your own; emphasize your strengths by working closely with a friend or partner. If you have to undertake a task by yourself, at least try to develop companionship with someone else along the way."
leo,2012-12-21,"The Sun's visit to dutiful Capricorn can be challenging, unless you figure out ways to entertain yourself without being on center stage. The weeks ahead are best spent doing hard work, but you may not receive the appreciation for what you do now, even if you deserve it. This is about taking care of business, yet it has nothing to do with recognition. Set your personal needs aside and get to work."
virgo,2012-12-21,"You feel at home now as the Sun moves through Capricorn -- another pragmatic Earth sign. There are many things you need to accomplish in your life, and, thankfully, you're ready to do them. You feel quite confident today, especially if you have been preparing for what's ahead. Let go of your fears, relax into the situation and have a little fun. Buckle up; it's going to be quite a ride!"
libra,2012-12-21,"The Sun is moving through your 4th House of Inner Security, emphasizing family activities, your private emotional life and your childhood memories. This sentimental journey can be stressful at times, since you need to keep up appearances at work. It may be that situations develop where you have pleasurable opportunities, but can't respond because of responsibilities at home. Regardless of how this plays out, give yourself the chance to settle into your own imagination. You'll be able to return to reality later with a bit of wisdom from the past."
scorpio,2012-12-21,Your thoughts set you on solid intellectual ground for the next few weeks as the Sun travels through responsible Capricorn and your 3rd House of Communication. You won't be writing lighthearted advertising jingles or singing silly love songs because this is a rather ponderous time. Think carefully about what you're going to say so your words convey exactly what you mean. Delivering your message clearly improves the odds of others taking your message seriously.
sagittarius,2012-12-21,"You may be drawn into the world of things now that the Sun is journeying through your 2nd House of Possessions during these next few weeks. You won't necessarily turn into a material girl or boy overnight, but you'll probably want to accumulate some specific items that can be quite valuable to you. Choose what you buy with great care. It's not that you shouldn't acquire something for your own enjoyment, but you will appreciate it a lot more if it is actually useful, too."
capricorn,2012-12-21,"If you feel more active than usual, remember that the Sun's return to your sign is both physically and mentally energizing. This is your astrological birthday month and you get an extra cosmic boost today as the Sun turns to shine its light on you. Instead of waiting for your birthday, think about what you want in your life today. Then light a candle, make a wish and blow the flame out. Doing this simple ritual daily can actually help you to clarify your dreams."
aquarius,2012-12-21,"Your personal astrological year of development is moving into its final stage as the Sun now shifts into your 12th House of Hidden Destiny. It's time to shine the radiant light of the Sun into the shadowy areas of your life that have slipped out of focus. Listen extra carefully to your dreams and write about your feelings in a journal. The more you can bring to the surface, the happier you will be. Get busy; you have just a few weeks until it will be your turn in the spotlight."
pisces,2012-12-21,"You watery Fish like it now that the Sun is visiting traditional Capricorn and your 11th House of Networking because it brings an emotional stability that feels good. Your friends give you enough support during the weeks ahead, to keep you on a relatively straight and narrow path. Fill up your social calendar, surround yourself with those who love you and don't be afraid to say yes."
aries,2012-12-22,Reality may not come through for you today in the way you expect. You need to pay careful attention to what's happening now because you can easily convince yourself things are better than they truly are. You're tempted to overstep boundaries and might even regret your lack of discipline unless you restrain your enthusiasm. Make decisions based on what you know instead of what you wish to be true.
taurus,2012-12-22,"Unavoidable obligations may be stacking up today, making it difficult to kick back and enjoy yourself. However, your desire for pleasure is strong now that jolly Jupiter is activating your key planet Venus -- and you see no reason to deny your fate. Just be sure to watch the quantity of food and drink you consume, for you can easily overdo anything that makes you feel good. A touch of moderation goes a long way as you attempt to experience the finer side of life."
gemini,2012-12-22,"You may be worried that your plan won't lead to success today, but that won't prevent you from going ahead with your idea, anyhow. Although uncharacteristic caution might have you playing the waiting game at first, your confidence builds until you're ready to take a risk in your search for pleasure. It's easier to believe someone who is encouraging you to follow your heart's desire than to resist. Nevertheless, a quick reality check does more to ensure your satisfaction than leaping before you look."
cancer,2012-12-22,"Your resistance to having fun today may originate from your desire to nurture others instead of yourself. Although wanting someone you love to feel good is an admirable trait, you can go too far with your efforts and possibly even discourage yourself in the process. You might end up resenting the very people you are trying to please unless you take care of your own needs first."
leo,2012-12-22,"Today is a day created for you Lions to purr and play like carefree kittens. Unfortunately, your fun-loving ways are not an excuse to escape from your responsibilities; nevertheless, you can still have a great time as long as you don't overdo it. Balancing work and play may be challenging, but it's your current key to finding personal satisfaction."
virgo,2012-12-22,"Following the rules of expected behavior is tricky today. Although it's normally easy for you to stay on track, you're intrigued by the alternatives now and might not be too concerned with the opinions of anyone else. This current way of looking at life could be transitory, but you have a unique opportunity to learn about yourself while having fun. Avoid self-criticism if it gets in the way of a potentially pleasurable experience."
libra,2012-12-22,"Sweet Venus, your ruling planet, forms a tense opposition to permissive Jupiter today, making it difficult to manage your desires. You feel as if you've waited long enough; you're ready to get what you want. There is no harm in this perspective now as long as you don't go too far in your self-indulgences. It's OK to have the second dessert. But think twice about the third or fourth helping before giving in."
scorpio,2012-12-22,"You might feel tired today, and may not want to spend your entire day trying to meet everyone else's expectations. You're eager to break the mold of responsibility and let others fend for themselves. It's time to satisfy your own needs by doing something memorable. Your previous commitments can be better fulfilled after you take some quality time for yourself."
sagittarius,2012-12-22,"You can turn a fleeting conversation into a long-winded philosophical debate or a passing celebrity crush into a major love fantasy because everything is taking on larger than life proportions now. Of course, you're enjoying this sweet phase while your key planet Jupiter inspires beautiful Venus. Don't be concerned if you waste the day engaging in pleasant social interactions and have little to show for it, except for fond memories."
capricorn,2012-12-22,"Pampering yourself can be somewhat disconcerting because you are overly concerned about how you could be more productive today. However, if you have been working too hard and doing all your chores responsibly, this may be a welcome day of rest. Allow yourself to indulge your senses a bit more than usual now, especially if you believe you earned it."
aquarius,2012-12-22,"An authority figure may remind you to complete your unfinished chores, but you aren't very interested in doing the right thing today. Loving Venus opposes jovial Jupiter in your playful 5th House of Romance, motivating you to have fun, wherever the opportunity arises. Go on and enjoy yourself now while you can. You'll have time next week to tie up loose ends."
pisces,2012-12-22,"You are being pulled in two directions today, and there's no need to try to resolve the dilemma right away. On one hand, you feel a growing sense of urgency to express whatever's on your mind. On the other hand, you want to sidestep any complications now so you can have time to relax. Even if the pleasant events of the day distract you from what you intended to do, there really isn't any harm in having a bit of fun while you have the chance."
aries,2012-12-23,"Even if you're longing for a less complicated life, you may have unfinished business to complete before you can separate yourself from the complexity you have created. Although your path appears clearer today, it could take quite a bit of determination in order to reach your destination. Be careful not to become overly complacent with the status quo because it's not time to let up yet. Putting in extra effort now helps to ensure that you'll have more time to rest later on."
taurus,2012-12-23,"Now that the Moon has returned to your sensual sign, it's time to soak in the emotional nurturing that is being offered to you. However, it may be a challenge to stop your mind from spinning today. You could be thinking about so many things that your thoughts zip by just beyond your reach. You might even make yourself frustrated if you try to put your fantastic ideas to work. Thankfully, it's not about productivity now; sit back and enjoy the process without worrying about the results."
gemini,2012-12-23,"You can't remain quiet and let something important slip by today without adding your two cents. In fact, you're driven to speak your mind now because you're very clear about your own convictions. But remember that you don't have to comment on every little thing; instead, pick and choose the most critical issues before stirring up controversy with your point of view."
cancer,2012-12-23,"The tension of unresolved conflicts is temporarily soothed by your flexible attitude today. You can release whatever was bothering you in return for a relaxing day of spiritual refreshment and social enjoyment. However, you may not be ready to completely let go of your unexpressed feelings. Nevertheless, set them aside for a while without judging yourself too harshly. You're not avoiding an issue; you're just waiting for the right moment to handle it."
leo,2012-12-23,"Today can be a day of contemplation that counterbalances your domestic responsibilities. You might wish that you could escape into a dream, but complications arise if you pay too much attention to your inner world before finishing your chores. But don't overcompensate by playing the role of a superhero. Just do what you can while still leaving some time to explore your imagination."
virgo,2012-12-23,"You might have planned a fun event today, only to realize that it's not going to play out as you wish. Fortunately, you can still enjoy yourself, even if a bit of confusion creeps into your life. There's no need to become overly concerned by details that won't be important in the long run anyhow. Instead, shrug off the minor problems and refocus on the basics."
libra,2012-12-23,"You could get all wrapped up in your thoughts now, although your stoicism may prevent you from talking about your worries with others. You wish that you felt more in the holiday spirit, but serious issues are weighing you down and they won't go away until you deal with them. Even with concentrated attention today, resolution probably won't come quickly. In the meantime, find a creative outlet for your irritation instead of spreading it to others."
scorpio,2012-12-23,"Although you are aware of life's simplicity today, you're even more conscious of its complications. The earthy Taurus Moon lures you away from work and toward the pleasure of play. Yet, as a transformational Scorpio, you're always attracted to a good mystery. Be careful if it appears that someone else can ameliorate your need for complexity, for this is just an illusion. Like it or not, your fate is completely in your own hands."
sagittarius,2012-12-23,"Returning to the basics isn't what usually motivates you, but simplification just may be the most critical issue in your life today. You can have positive impact on your immediate environment, but you have to shift out of the fast lane and on to a road less traveled by busy people like you. You're at an important intersection, and taking the high-speed freeway isn't in your best interest. A scenic detour might have much more to offer you now."
capricorn,2012-12-23,"You are rethinking some of your most basic strategies as you try to reinvent yourself these days. Although this transformation process isn't finished yet, it would be an intelligent exercise to review and re-evaluate your list of accomplishments. Tie up as many loose ends as possible over the next couple of days so you're ready for the new year."
aquarius,2012-12-23,"Inner conflict may be the source of additional stress as you reconsider a rational decision you recently made. Your feelings might not be following your good intentions as you assumed they naturally would. Your dilemma probably isn't apparent to others, but one special person could come through for you now. Be open to receiving good news, or at least an uplifting perspective, from a friend or family member -- for it can be just enough encouragement to nudge you along in the right direction."
pisces,2012-12-23,"Your current ambiguity may get in the way of making concrete plans. You would like to do what's best, but your intentions might go awry especially if your expectations are inflated. It's difficult for you to say no to anything that sounds like fun, even if it isn't very practical. Rely on a second opinion before making any commitments that you will later regret."
aries,2012-12-24,"Watch your finances today by avoiding impulsive spending. Instead of buying something you don't really need, take a quick moment to tidy up your accounts. However, money isn't the only issue now, since your values impact what you purchase. You may be surprised with positive results if you stop to consider why you might be swept up in the moment, splurging on what you don't need. Spending quality time with those you love is the most meaningful gift of all."
taurus,2012-12-24,"You think that you can explain exactly how you are feeling today, prompting you to express yourself without holding anything back. Although you want to be practical, your emotions are the most straightforward way now to share what you have been keeping to yourself. Revealing your feelings slowly and deliberately lifts a heavy burden from your shoulders. There's no need to isolate yourself from the ones you love."
gemini,2012-12-24,"You intuitively understand the truth today, but communicating it verbally is a completely different story. Just because you're well informed doesn't mean you can easily tell others what you know. Pleasurable distractions may test your maturity, even if you don't realize what's going on. Falling prey to your own guilt and confessing your sins -- however minor they are -- won't bring you happiness. Instead, take time to reconcile with your past before talking about the present."
cancer,2012-12-24,"Emotional security arrives now in the guise of support from your allies. Even if you have been struggling with your feelings, your friends appear to understand what you are going through today, so allow your vulnerability to be soothed by their kindness. And although you eventually have to return to your issues, at least you'll have a healthier perspective, making everything seem brighter than before."
leo,2012-12-24,"Today starts on a stressful note with numerous demands being made on your time, but other people's expectations may be exactly what you need to get your motor going. You have plenty to do and it's challenging to make the best choices if you just wing it as you go along. Instead, create a list of what you want to do and map out a rough schedule for the rest of the year. Even if you deviate from your plan, organizing your thoughts steadies your nerves and moves you in the right direction."
virgo,2012-12-24,"You may receive strong support from your family today and, hopefully, you can apply their good advice toward achieving your long-term goals. Although daydreaming is an important part of your process now, you still must remain practical even while being imaginative. If you want to be successful, keep your eyes on the road right in front of you at all times."
libra,2012-12-24,"Your search for meaning sinks to a deeper level today as you attempt to dig beneath the surface into hidden root causes. Although your new perspective helps you connect with people in a very direct and immediate manner, you might not appear to make much progress now. It's difficult to logically navigate through your feelings if you're afraid of the unknown. Fortunately, your willingness to look at the unseen world gives you a new sense of confidence."
scorpio,2012-12-24,"You are a champion when it comes to making your way through the shadowy realms of consciousness, but sometimes you forget about your strengths. Today, a simple response from a friend or partner reminds you of what you need to remember. You might get lost in your daydreams, but it's still critical to pay attention to the most obvious things. Getting back to basics is how you can most positively impact your future."
sagittarius,2012-12-24,"You're eager to start a new project if it grabs your attention; however, you can find yourself in over your head if you move too fast. Setting the proper pace is crucial now, since there's so much to do. Rely on your common sense today instead of on your lofty ideals. Pay close attention to all the details. Things will go your way if you take the time to lay a solid foundation."
capricorn,2012-12-24,"You can make progress on many fronts today, but don't take on too much in an impulsive grand gesture based upon false optimism. In fact, you're better off to lie low now instead of running around trying to get lots of things accomplished. Just remember, your integrity and determination are your greatest assets at this time. Use them wisely and you will be pleased with the results."
aquarius,2012-12-24,"Unfulfilled promises may prevent you from manifesting your dreams today. If your unrealized fantasies become tinged with negativity, your frustration has nowhere to go. It's crucial to keep your emotions from getting stuck now. Sharing your unexpressed feelings with a compassionate confidant discourages stagnation, alleviates the pressure and solidifies a friendship."
pisces,2012-12-24,"Although you can be happy swimming around without a purpose, things are different today because you have a specific direction in mind. However, knowing where you are going won't necessarily get you there any faster. Don't be distracted by currents flowing away from your destination. If you create strong boundaries and make wise decisions now, nothing will deter you from success."
aries,2012-12-25,"Common sense takes a back seat to enthusiasm because you want to let it all hang out. Oddly enough, exercising a little self-restraint can help you gain even more independence now that the willful Sun squares unconventional Uranus in your spontaneous sign today. Unfortunately, it may be easier to act first and then think through the consequences of your actions later. It won't hurt to count slowly to ten before flying off the handle."
taurus,2012-12-25,"You would like to demonstrate your dependability, but there could be a bit of a gambler in you now who wants to explore unusual possibilities. You are willing to go along with others, even if they encourage you to step out beyond your normal comfort zone. But it's of no value trying to be more responsible than necessary today. Take a leap of faith; something wonderful might happen if you follow your heart."
gemini,2012-12-25,"Getting along with others may be more challenging now because you're out to have a good time. Unfortunately, you could inadvertently offend an ally without even knowing what you did. Try not to overstep your bounds, even if someone eggs you on. Don't get involved in an unimportant argument or you could end up regretting the whole thing. Your sense of urgency is not as real as it seems. Change the topic or just walk away for the sake of keeping peace."
cancer,2012-12-25,"You have a strong need to partake in social festivities today, but too much irresponsible spontaneity could land you in big trouble. You're better off tempering your crazy ideas by checking in with friends and family first. Even if you have your own agenda now, try to integrate your expectations with those who are part of your day. Everyone will benefit from your flexibility if you can compromise and still bring joy to the party."
leo,2012-12-25,"You might think you know the best way to make things happen today, but being too rigid in your approach can precipitate an unpleasant conflict. Make sure that you're being stubborn for the right reasons because your efforts could be thwarted if you're on a power trip. Expressing your demands gently as preferences increases your chances of getting what you want."
virgo,2012-12-25,"You want to be everything for everyone today, but spreading yourself too thin isn't a smart strategy. You might become so overcommitted that you wish you could hide and just spend some time by yourself. If you discover an escape route, keep in mind that your solution won't likely be a permanent one. Nevertheless, you still need to blow off some excess steam. Once you express your feelings, come back and join the festivities with a lighter heart."
libra,2012-12-25,"Intense feelings continue to hold you in place today, even if you're actively trying to change your day for the better. Your smartest strategy now is to keep reminding yourself of what's most important. If you let your goals for the day become your guiding light, you'll make the best choices. However, if you get sidetracked by negative emotions or unmet expectations, even the best intentions may still lead you astray. You cannot change everything in your environment, but you can choose how you respond to it."
scorpio,2012-12-25,"The uncontrollable tides are swirling around you now, making it doubly important to maintain your emotional balance. If you are swept up in the moment, you might not be able to find a stable place to stand. Fortunately, someone close to you may unexpectedly come through, acting like the solid rock you seek. Let go of your fears and accept support when it is offered. Even temporary security can be the catalyst that allows you to completely relax and be yourself."
sagittarius,2012-12-25,"You act as if you are having a wonderful time, but the truth is that your heart may not be in it today. You are projecting your optimism, yet you might feel detached from your friends and family. But instead of pushing your agenda forward, it's more important now to pursue a spiritual solution to your dilemma. Your current happiness comes from letting your emotions flow and not from rationalizing everything in your head."
capricorn,2012-12-25,"You can have all the thrills you want today and still fulfill your obligations to others. Nevertheless, your imagination might still stir up issues of low self-esteem, tricking you into thinking that you're unprepared for what's ahead. However, you're probably in better shape than you realize. Keep your eyes on the big picture and let the details slip for now. Remain open to being surprised and kick up your heels while you can."
aquarius,2012-12-25,"Adopting a grounded sense of your responsibilities at home and in the community today goes a long way toward stabilizing the rest of your life in the days ahead. Although you're respected by your friends and family, you still must be practical to reap the rewards. Whatever distractions come your way now, lean on those you trust for the emotional support you need."
pisces,2012-12-25,"You won't be satisfied with anything less than a happy holiday today, but you don't necessarily want to leave home to experience it. You may have a plan for creating lots of fun without needing to go to some exotic destination. Thankfully, your friends come to your rescue now, especially if they realize how important your dreams are to you. However, you must give up control and accept the gifts as they are offered, even if they differ from your initial expectations."
aries,2012-12-26,"You may initiate action so quickly today that you don't even process your feelings. By the time your emotions have worked their way up into awareness, you have already moved on to the next wonderful thing. Instead of jumping from one experience to another, take extra time now to tune in to your heart. Although the message you receive could be inconvenient, it might just inform you of something important that you need to know."
taurus,2012-12-26,"You may be a bit detached from your actions today, especially if something you must do doesn't feel right. However, there's really no need to be afraid of expressing your desires, even if they differ from other people's expectations. But don't assume that you will get what you need just by asking. Avoid disappointment by visualizing a variety of outcomes and finding satisfaction with whatever happens."
gemini,2012-12-26,"Something strange occurs today that may catch you completely off guard. The wordy Gemini Moon prompts casual conversation while you avoid what's really on your mind. However, if your dreams are out of touch with reality, others will likely see through your facade. Unfortunately, you can't pretend that you're OK when everyone seems to know more about you than you know about yourself. Shift your focus inward and consider how you can modify your goals to make them more attainable."
cancer,2012-12-26,"It's relatively easy to bury your feelings, especially if they don't fit in with everything else that's going on in your life. Thankfully, you have an opportunity to bring these emotions out into the open, no matter how much you usually protect your heart. Have faith in yourself and trust that others will honor what you have to say. But keep in mind that you have to do your part by speaking the truth."
leo,2012-12-26,"Your anger feels uncomfortable as it lurks just beneath the surface, waiting for something to trigger it. Your emotions are like a radio station that creates a broadcast signal, yet you can't hear the song it's playing. Nevertheless, you know that a significant message is being communicated and you believe the voices are talking directly to you. Don't worry about the exact words, for they don't really matter. Release any negativity and let your intuition take charge."
virgo,2012-12-26,"You are eager to consider what your friends need today, as if you can empathetically sense what they are feeling. However, the dilemma is that you might not want to tend to others, for you are on your own path -- leaving little room to give anyone else what he or she wants. Think about the consequences of your actions before you refuse because there are more reasons to negotiate than you realize at this time."
libra,2012-12-26,"Even with the current conflict between your head and your heart, you can still feel a deep sense of well-being that is most welcome in your life now. It really doesn't matter what you should be doing today; self-indulgence might win out over your obligations in the end. So, why bother fighting the inevitable? Go ahead and make time to play since life is too short not to enjoy it."
scorpio,2012-12-26,"Take some time away from your personal responsibilities to think about what you want and what you're willing to do in order to get it. Fortunately, you'll experience even more pleasure pursuing your goals now. But it's tricky to see clearly when strong passions motivate your actions. Thankfully, the overall intensity in your life is settling back down. Wait a while longer and you'll have a much clearer sense of how everything plays out in the long run."
sagittarius,2012-12-26,"Your superhero powers are fully engaged this week as you attempt to express your needs. But it may be inappropriate to just put your feelings out there for all to see. It's more important to find an acceptable way to get the energy moving. Don't worry now if you can't figure out what the future holds. Simply, let your highest ideals guide you through the process. Ultimately, honoring your integrity has the greatest positive impact on your happiness."
capricorn,2012-12-26,"You're mentally alert and crackling like a live electrical wire today. You could even try your hand at expressing yourself poetically now, yet your efforts might fall apart as soon as you attempt to be logical. Nevertheless, it's still a wise idea to forget about the details for a while. Instead, be as creative as possible and fill in the rest of the story later on."
aquarius,2012-12-26,"Unexpected changes continue to unfold as you attempt to integrate them into the basic structure of your life. Thankfully, you may be offered a second chance today to break out of a restrictive situation. Even if this opportunity stirs up stress, act right away and deal with the consequences later. But don't try to sidestep the truth; being honest really is the best policy."
pisces,2012-12-26,"Make the most of your current energy buzz while it lasts; just don't assume you can have whatever you want. Your physical needs may be intense now, and you might be tempted to do something that you later regret. Remember that the fleeting enjoyment you receive from short-term pleasures will fade, but visualizing your long-term goals could be enough to pull you through with flying colors."
aries,2012-12-27,"You might start the day optimistically, but sink into the cool waters of contemplation as the day wears on. However, between moments of doubt, your energy level may be so high that you're ready to take on the world. Make the most of your confidence while you are feeling the positive vibrations. Find a healthy way to balance your need for emotional security with your desire to express yourself without restraint."
taurus,2012-12-27,"You may worry others today by jumping into a wild sea of bold actions. However, you might have slipped on a life jacket when no one was looking. Accordingly, you're prepared for nearly anything that might come your way. You won't drown or be pulled off course, but you could get soaked now by the storms of experience. Use your common sense to help you keep your head above water."
gemini,2012-12-27,"You can easily set the world afire today with your clever thoughts and easy charm, yet you may grow more subdued as the day progresses. Sometimes your flexibility works well for you and sometimes it doesn't. Now, however, you must stay conscious of your exuberance or you could overdo it. Thankfully, it requires less effort to exert a bit of self-control early in the game than to try to stop the ball once it's rolling."
cancer,2012-12-27,"You might have an emotional encounter that stirs up uncomfortable feelings when the evocative Moon moves into your sign this afternoon. Nevertheless, you're not inclined to sit in a corner, withdrawn from interpersonal involvements today; instead, you have things to do and people to see. Your day may not go according to plan, so don't try to stick to your old schedule. You can maintain stability and increase your sense of security if you are sincerely willing to change with the outer dynamics."
leo,2012-12-27,"You might try to tread lightly today, yet anything you do will probably still be quite noticeable. Unconscious patterns can overtake your day while circumstances grow out of control pretty quickly. Unwrap your buried feelings now, for they could bring you sorrow if they stay hidden within much longer. Paradoxically, being cautious is wise, but at the same time you must be prepared to act with courage. Listen to your heart and the rest will follow."
virgo,2012-12-27,"Your day may start as if it's going to conform to your expectations, but unfortunately, life won't be that simple now. There is too much energy floating around and the intensity must go somewhere. But somehow, it probably won't seem too disruptive even with a surprising twist or turn along the way. In fact, if you welcome the unknown with open arms, you'll feel more alive than ever."
libra,2012-12-27,"Brilliant ideas have propelled you into the realms of big schemes and grandiose proportions. Now, your energy level is running high and you are psyched for whatever comes your way. Considering how wired you are these days, it's amazing that you can still be so rational. Oddly enough, the more grounded you are today, the easier it becomes to express yourself in new and exciting ways. The right mix of creativity and practicality will lead you down the road to success."
scorpio,2012-12-27,"You might not feel like a rock of stability today, yet there is peace in knowing that you are free enough from tradition to embrace your vision of the future. It may seem like you are balancing on a tightrope between the new and the old, but you can make it look so easy now that others will respect the path you choose to travel. Take a few deep breaths, don't look down and just keep moving forward."
sagittarius,2012-12-27,"Real world obligations require you to downplay your craziest ideas while still acknowledging that the wild dreams are not going away. You may talk about your fantasies as you imagine your life unfolding, but don't place too much stock in any thoughts that lack foundation. If you do, you will look back at this opportune moment, regretting the energy that you wasted. Establishing a practical perspective now prevents major disappointment later on."
capricorn,2012-12-27,"Strong feelings may arise through relationship dynamics today and you'll be better off if you can share what's on your mind. If you are experiencing tension with your friends, roll with the punches now instead of fighting back. Something big is about to change, and it could alter the way others see you. Although it might be difficult, try not to anticipate what's going to happen. Just allow the situation to unfold naturally without attempting to control the outcome."
aquarius,2012-12-27,"There's plenty of activity going on at work now and all the stress can be distracting. Nevertheless, you might find that your creativity is rekindled by being in the midst of such colorful action. If life becomes overwhelming, keep in mind the intensity won't last more than a few days. You have the potential for great originality as long as you remember that chaos is the mother of invention."
pisces,2012-12-27,"Even if you want to fly below the radar today, you still may be noticed and admired because everyone sees you as more exciting and upbeat than you really feel. Although you're running on intuitive energy, you still must show up and do the work in order to be successful. Ironically, you might be happier now if you pay less attention to the rules of the road and more attention to the signs of your heart."
aries,2012-12-28,"Today's Cancer Full Moon may stress your life with career issues that motivate you to rethink your overall life path. One of your important considerations is the sacrifice of emotional safety you need to make to reach your goals. Asking important questions now can propel you into action. Although others might see you as acting too aggressively, do whatever you must to get yourself back on track."
taurus,2012-12-28,"If you are insecure about your communication abilities, today may be a great day to push through these self-limiting thoughts now that the Cancer Full Moon shines in your 3rd House of Information. It's not important what others are saying; how you feel about yourself is more crucial. If you start from a place of low self-esteem, then nothing on the outside will make you feel OK. Fortunately, doing the necessary inner work gives you a confidence boost and a much-needed attitude adjustment."
gemini,2012-12-28,"Your thoughts might be moving so fast today that you cannot even tell what you are thinking. You may have very sensible ideas, yet you can still ruin your chances of realizing a goal if you scatter your energy. The Cancer Full Moon in your 2nd House of Values is a reminder to focus on what is most important and allow the other activities to fall away. Don't talk about anything until you are ready. Then, discuss your plan with passion so that others will take you seriously."
cancer,2012-12-28,"The Full Moon in your sensitive sign might have you worrying that you are misunderstood. You want others to acknowledge and respect your desire for safety. Consider, however, that your needs may be based upon old insecurities -- and no one can fix this if you fear rejection or change. You might not be able to solve this dilemma overnight, but sharing your concerns with someone you trust helps you feel better about what's currently happening in your life."
leo,2012-12-28,"You really want to hold up your end of the deal but the Cancer Full Moon in your 12th House of Secrets may have you struggling in ways that no one notices. You realize that there are things you can do to help others, but you're already busy trying to fulfill your previous commitments. You can't do everything, yet your high ideals make it difficult for you to let go. Nevertheless, everyone will appreciate it if you don't promise more than you can deliver."
virgo,2012-12-28,The nurturing Cancer Full Moon in your social 11th House encourages you to be a supportive part of a team. But this group orientation conflicts with your desire to take care of yourself first today. You intend to accomplish your goals in a very practical way until you realize that you might hurt someone else in the process of being selfish. Others will figure out what you are feeling because actions really do speak louder than words. Demonstrating your generosity of spirit is a good place to start.
libra,2012-12-28,"It's a real challenge to know what's best, even if today's issues seem vaguely familiar. You might not want to put up with the same level of job-related stress now that the evocative Full Moon is flooding your 10th House of Career. If you have been withholding your feelings, take a deep breath and release them out into the open. Just remember to be kind in your delivery process, even if you become engaged in a power struggle. Ultimately, others will appreciate you going out on a limb to clear the air."
scorpio,2012-12-28,"The emotionally powerful Cancer Full Moon makes it difficult to walk away from a disagreement because it stimulates an internal frustration that just won't go away. Just remember that endless fighting doesn't lead to peace of mind. Instead, take your old wounds out of the picture and examine the situation from a fresh perspective. If you can find meaning in the midst of the current chaos, then everyone emerges as a winner."
sagittarius,2012-12-28,"You might not run from your feelings as fast as usual today, even if you wish an unpleasant situation would just go away. However, your current intensity prevents you from just dropping an issue that's important to you. Although rational Saturn helps you create realistic expectations now, the protective Cancer Full Moon floods your 8th House of Deep Sharing, cautioning you to hold back. Practicing patience and proceeding with determination prevents encountering disappointment in the days ahead."
capricorn,2012-12-28,"Your sense of reality may be tested now as you confront one of your most basic fears. The needy Cancer Full Moon stimulates your 7th House of Others, raising concerns that a relationship will pull you into unknown emotional territory. More than anything today, you don't want to fall victim to troublesome irrationality as you attempt to stay on the safe path of logic. However, it's crucial to balance the objective and subjective realms in order to have a healthy perspective."
aquarius,2012-12-28,"You may not be so self-assured today because the moody Cancer Full Moon lands in your 6th House of Employment, filling you with uncertainty about your job. Keeping your emotions to yourself could leave others wondering why you are more distant now. You might not want to tell them what's going on, even if they ask. Temporarily shifting your attention away from your feelings is a good idea, for it will be easier to express them in a day or two. Focus on the needs of those you love as you wait for your heart to sort itself out."
pisces,2012-12-28,"The nurturing Cancer Full Moon lights up your 5th House of Romance and Creativity today, helping you feel more positive even if you are a bit overwhelmed. You may grow concerned if the uncontrollable swirl of complex emotions is moving too quickly. However, these are well-traveled waters for you Fish and it helps to remind yourself that you are totally safe. The sooner you recognize your own feelings, the sooner you can re-establish your center."
aries,2012-12-29,"Although you might try to convince yourself that you're free from emotional attachments, there's a problem with this approach today. Little events throughout the day remind you of how much you love your friends and family. Ultimately, it's your choice; you could easily avoid upsetting your security by reining in your unrestrained behavior. However, you may alienate others if you hide your feelings. Sharing your uncertainty before you become annoyed can relieve the building tension."
taurus,2012-12-29,"A clash with a good friend could be circumvented today, but it will take some serious restraint on your part. You might feel as if someone is baiting you, but it's actually your own worries that create the biggest problems now. Rather than blaming anyone else for your lack of confidence, consider what you can do to boost your self-esteem. Remember, change won't happen overnight but you have to start somewhere."
gemini,2012-12-29,"You might have a challenging time explaining your feelings today because it's easier to just keep them to yourself. Even if you know what you want to say, the words just don't come out the way that you think them. Try not to jump around from one subject to another now or you will leave others in a state of confusion. However, telling your story succinctly and then following through with direct action gives the positive impression you wish to project."
cancer,2012-12-29,"You may be hypersensitive today with the evocative Moon back in your sign. But being around too many people can be overwhelming now and you're tempted to retreat in order to honor your own need for boundaries. Unfortunately, you might not be able to get out of a social obligation. Instead of focusing on your annoyance, just postpone your quiet time until things settle down. You could be pleasantly surprised at how good you end up feeling by the end of the day."
leo,2012-12-29,"You realize the necessity of making changes to your daily routine, but you might not understand just yet how big this shift will be. Don't expect everything to happen right away, since there are circumstances beyond your control that must play out before you can take your next step. Thankfully, you're willing to do whatever needs to be done in order to get through this transition. Be patient; there's a light at the end of the tunnel."
virgo,2012-12-29,"You want to break free at any cost, especially if you feel as if you're stuck in an unchangeable situation. You are ready for action since you've already spent enough time contemplating all your options. Unfortunately, forcing progress today is not recommended because the security-conscious Cancer Moon is visiting your 11th House of Long-Term Goals. Be wise and maintain the status quo for a little while longer. Trust your intuition; you'll know when the time is right to make your move."
libra,2012-12-29,"You could be feeling a bit uneasy today without knowing why you can't settle down. Your free-floating anxiety may not be connected to any one event; it might be related to a more complex set of emotions. Don't look for a quick fix because that will only put off the inevitable for a few days. Instead, take your time to find healthy ways to relax even in times of stress. Practicing meditation, laughing with your friends, or just dancing around when no one is watching can help lighten your heart."
scorpio,2012-12-29,"You're tempted to dig in your heels and hold out for exactly what you want, but the end game of your current strategy isn't dependent on your stubbornness. In fact, your lack of flexibility complicates things and moves you even farther away from your ultimate destination. Rather than being so sure of yourself, remain open to compromise now. Flowing with the give-and-take helps you feel good about the situation and increases your chances for success."
sagittarius,2012-12-29,"Although you could be eager to embark on your next great journey, it may be discouraging to admit you haven't even bought a ticket yet. Unfortunately, there are too many demands on your time now for you to think that you can leave on the spur of the moment. Be patient and don't let go of your dreams; there's still time to work out all the details before you have to choose your destination."
capricorn,2012-12-29,"Your current uncertainty could put you in a more conservative frame of mind, prompting you to question your ability to reach your long-term goals. But don't give up too soon because you might not have all the facts at your disposal. Although you may feel the pressure to make a serious career decision today, it's smarter to delay your final choice until after the New Year, if possible."
aquarius,2012-12-29,"You are thrilled about the possibilities ahead, but too much optimism may inspire you to act impulsively. This is no time for foolish obstinacy because it only amplifies the stress. It's wiser to acknowledge your enthusiasm while practicing self-restraint. Instead of thinking you can simply overpower the obstacles you face, try to learn what valuable lessons they have to teach you now."
pisces,2012-12-29,"You're still processing a lot of information that recently came into your awareness, but it's not easy to integrate so much data all at once. Nevertheless, you might feel as if a deadline is quickly approaching. Unfortunately, if you try to move too fast, you could end up hitting a wall. Ask a trusted friend for help today, so you have someone else to listen to your story. Any feedback you receive at this time can move you closer to your desired destination."
aries,2012-12-30,"You're driven to set personal goals for the year ahead, without worrying about helping anyone else. You may incorrectly believe that the possibility of your success could be jeopardized if others also have a chance of succeeding. However, this faulty assumption comes from your outdated belief in a competitive model where there are winners and losers. Thankfully, reaching your destination is easier now when everyone works together for the common good."
taurus,2012-12-30,"Your drive for adventure could become irrepressible as the Sun conjuncts unrelenting Pluto in your 9th House of Big Ideas. Your current sense of urgency won't likely disappear even if you try to relax. Consider how to satisfy your needs without upsetting your life instead of denying your current wanderlust. Fortunately, enrolling in a course of study expands your mind without distracting you with unrealistic dreams."
gemini,2012-12-30,"Steer clear of discussions about risky investments of time or money today while the Sun-Pluto conjunction rattles your 8th House of Shared Resources. You might believe that you will come out on top if you simply do your research. But flimsy schemes that promise fast fortunes should be avoided. Improving your position through a clever venture sounds enticing now, but greed could end up costing more than it's worth."
cancer,2012-12-30,"Today's magnetic Sun-Pluto conjunction attracts intense people into your life and they could be significant to your personal growth. Friends or associates may reflect a part of yourself that you don't want to acknowledge. Even if you want to hold on to the status quo now, dynamic changes are afoot. Relinquishing control enables you to flow with the strong currents, wherever they are taking you next."
leo,2012-12-30,"You might begin a new diet today, even if much of the world is happily indulging in holiday feasts. However, you're not in your usual party spirit now because you're thinking about cleaning up your act. It's not that you want to have less fun; you just know that you need to improve your health and you're highly motivated to do something about it. Relax; enjoying the magic of the season won't make you forget your long-term goals."
virgo,2012-12-30,"Feelings of jealousy or envy may fuel emotionally-exhausting melodramas that have you unexpectedly performing in a leading role. You're clear about what you need and have a sensible plan now to get it. Unfortunately, love doesn't play by your rules, so even a well-constructed strategy might not produce the results you want. Throwing away your agenda won't work, either. Paradoxically, living in the present moment leads to success if you can also keep an eye toward the future."
libra,2012-12-30,"The intense Sun-Pluto conjunction in your 4th House of Emotional Security distracts you from your career-related goals. However, you must manage the complexity of the current situation to realize your fullest potential. Sidestepping an interpersonal issue isn't a viable choice today because your frustration could lead to a crisis. Bringing secrets out into the open might be just the preventative measure you need."
scorpio,2012-12-30,"You're accustomed to high levels of intensity in your relationships, but occasionally avoidance is smarter than direct confrontation. Unfortunately, you can't dance around your wounded feelings today, even if you are not comfortable talking about them. Luckily, your prospects for real healing improve once your old hurts are acknowledged and shared with someone you trust."
sagittarius,2012-12-30,"You may be upset today if someone just assumes that your possessions are for communal property. You could overreact and even grow hostile if what you own feels like an extension of your identity. However, your current attachment to your toys isn't very sensible. If you can't share what you have now, then you probably shouldn't be playing with others. Setting clear boundaries is one thing, but there's no reason to be unkind to those around you."
capricorn,2012-12-30,"A passionate Sun-Pluto conjunction occurs in your 1st House of Self, giving you an apparently endless supply of energy. But feeling all that power is a double-edged sword today, for you may be driven by psychological forces that you don't understand. One strategy for handling your current intensity is to channel your intentions in a constructive manner. For example, writing down your goals and then stating them aloud is the first step to fulfilling your dreams."
aquarius,2012-12-30,"You want to care for someone special today, but it might not be such a good idea if you haven't been asked to help. An emotionally awkward situation could develop if you assist others who do not want your interference. If anyone refuses your aid now, just be gracious and politely wish them well. Don't hold on to feelings of rejection or all your good intentions will be for naught."
pisces,2012-12-30,"A conflict with friends or family today may lead to discouragement as others seem to be especially hard on you. Your participation in a group process could feel very intense as the Sun joins relentless Pluto in your 11th House of Social Interactions. Don't aim all your feelings at any one person; instead, disperse your current emotional charge over as many people as possible. Channeling your energy into positive action will help you more than you think."
aries,2012-12-31,"Although you want everyone to see that you are doing the right thing these days, demonstrating your good intentions can be quite challenging at times. Part of the problem is that you would rather be enjoying yourself than fulfilling previous obligations. Accepting your current place in the world isn't easy if it involves hard work; nevertheless, it's what you must do now. Playtime might just have to wait until after you prove yourself worthy."
taurus,2012-12-31,"You know what it takes to be practical today, but you don't really feel like doing it. Ultimately, your most workable strategy now starts with being aware of the divergent forces that are pulling you in different directions. Your natural desire to simplify your life could win out over an unnecessary emotional display, even if you want everyone to know what's on your mind. Remember, acting with maturity and patience will bring you more happiness than expecting others to cater to your needs."
gemini,2012-12-31,"It seems like you are dramatically running from one task to the next, but you may not be as busy as you appear. Your hectic pace is part of a strategy that lets others know they shouldn't ask more from you now. Unfortunately, they might not understand and make additional demands on your time, anyhow. Try a direct approach and just say you cannot take on anything else. Your true friends will appreciate your honesty and respect your limits."
cancer,2012-12-31,"Even if you are usually fiscally cautious, it's all too easy to forget budgetary restraints during the holiday season. Nevertheless, you might want to demonstrate that you are responsible with your money today, especially if someone has recently criticized your spending habits. Keep in mind that you don't have to spend a lot of money to feel good about yourself. Bringing in the New Year with friends or family could be all you need to lift your spirits."
leo,2012-12-31,"You may be quite moody now that the sensitive Moon is in your sign. You could even swing from being very upbeat to down and out in just a few minutes today. But don't take decisive action based upon your emotions, for they will continue to shift throughout the day. Enjoy the buoyant feelings while they last, but give them time to come to rest before making any choices that have permanent consequences."
virgo,2012-12-31,"You might choose to downplay your confidence now because you believe it's out of place in the current situation. Although compensating for your hidden optimism by acting with cool restraint is one tactic, consider the positive impact you might have on others by offering them a ray of hope, instead. There's no need to go over the top, but, at least, take a risk by spreading light instead of fear."
libra,2012-12-31,"Your kindness might win over a previous enemy, yet you could make matters worse if you are insincere. Friendly Venus, your ruling planet, is currently caught in a web of words and the more you say, the farther away from the truth you get. Although a magnanimous gesture may have a positive effect if you are well intended, don't attempt to explain your behavior. Verbalizing your feelings now only detracts from the clarity of your actions."
scorpio,2012-12-31,"Coming to the aid of those who look up to you sounds like a good idea, but your actions may not be fully appreciated now. Instead of expecting to be admired in the spotlight, try helping someone today without even being noticed. It's not about recognition, even if it's well deserved; it's about touching the hearts of those who need it most."
sagittarius,2012-12-31,"It's party time for you today, but at least you have the good sense to realize that the fun times won't last forever. You're eager to create a memorable event, whether on your own or in collaboration with others. But don't be disappointed if everything doesn't play out according to your best-case fantasy since there could be some unexpected last minute changes. There's no need to exert too much control because the new scenario could be even better than your imagined one."
capricorn,2012-12-31,"You have probably experienced your share of intense drama this holiday season with the willful Sun's connection to shadowy Pluto. Thankfully, the energy begins to lighten up today, indicating that the tide is changing in your favor. But instead of looking back and analyzing what has happened, shift your attention toward the future. Utilize your current creativity to visualize the year ahead. Paint in broad strokes and fill in the rest of the details later."
aquarius,2012-12-31,"The fiery Leo Moon is traveling through your 7th House of Others, tugging on your relationship axis today. You may be lured into discussions about what you want, but your desires might not fit into someone else's expectations. Luckily, you know how to detach yourself from an overly emotional conversation. Don't waste energy trying to justify your actions; convoluted rationalizations will only further complicate your life. Let your actions speak for your heart."
pisces,2012-12-31,"Trust your instincts when it comes to doing what makes the most sense today, even if it's counter to your logical analysis. You're receiving instructions directly from your subconscious now and it isn't necessary to understand the reasons for your current decisions. Your intuition is your greatest ally; just follow your hunches and don't forget to enjoy the journey along the way."
