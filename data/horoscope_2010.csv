aries,2010-01-01,"Although you may have looked forward to doing something special today, it may not sound so good as the time approaches. There's a part of you that just feels lazy and would rather be a couch potato. But even if it takes a while to get going, you'll feel better about everything once you are in motion. Give yourself enough time to rest, but don't let the day pass you by without burning off a bit of physical energy."
taurus,2010-01-01,"You are eager to kick back and indulge yourself today, but it may turn into a much more active day than you expected. A flash of inspiration could set you on a path toward a simple goal. But once you get started your project begins to grow. Be careful, for it's easy to think you are being practical when you are actually making your life more complicated than necessary."
gemini,2010-01-01,"You may want to get a jump-start on financial planning for the year ahead, especially if you just need some time to reevaluate your goals. But instead of dreaming about how you can make more money, it's smarter to consider ways to limit excess spending. Creating a budget based upon known expenses can help you figure out what your options actually are now. Even if you are only guessing at this point, it's still a great exercise to get you thinking in a more responsible manner."
cancer,2010-01-01,"If you want some peace and quiet today, you might have to come right out and tell someone to leave you alone. But how you deliver the message can be just as important as what you say. Make it clear that you are not rejecting others, because you may not get your much-needed silence if they take your request personally. You'll have more to give those you love once you get some rest."
leo,2010-01-01,This can be a great day to do something special for yourself that establishes a pattern for a new daily routine. Keep in mind that your gift doesn't have to be extravagant; it only needs to be healthy. Consider a small step that's related to exercise or diet that you can take now. You might be pleasantly surprised at how a little change can make such a big difference.
virgo,2010-01-01,"If you are feeling restricted by someone in your life today, an unexpected turn of events can release a bit of tension and loosen the reins. Paradoxically, this surprising twist might be provoked by a misunderstanding that forces you to talk about what's happening. Even if you are uncomfortable with where the conversation is going at first, stick with it. Luckily, unforeseen relief is on the way."
libra,2010-01-01,"Normally, you're a better team player than a solo act, but today you may be driven to show everyone how capable you are of managing things. Others might not realize what you're doing now, for you can be quite subtle as you exercise control over what's happening. Keep in mind that you can make it much easier on yourself once you realize that you don't have to take charge of everything."
scorpio,2010-01-01,"You can make it appear as if you don't want to participate in the activities of the day, yet you might still be hurt if you are not included. You cannot blame others if they believe they are doing what you prefer by leaving you alone. Fortunately, you can control the outcome by being very clear about what you want."
sagittarius,2010-01-01,It's difficult for you to establish healthy limits today as the Sun activates your key planet Jupiter. You mistakenly believe that if a small quantity is good then a larger amount is even better. But this kind of logic will land you in a heap of trouble if you have to deal with the consequences of overindulgence later in the day. Be smart and stop before it's too late.
capricorn,2010-01-01,"You have some serious magic working in your favor today, but you must figure out how to harness it. If you cannot find something constructive to do with all your energy, your frustration could build until you lose your temper at someone who probably isn't even the real source of your annoyance. Remember that others are relaxing on this holiday, so don't try to impose your ambitious plans on them just yet."
aquarius,2010-01-01,"You may not like it if someone is filling your day with activities and all you want to do is chill. You have your own set of goals, but you aren't driven to accomplish much of anything today. So it's not surprising that you could rebel against anyone who assumes that he or she is your boss. Find a way to say no without offending others."
pisces,2010-01-01,"You are a live wire today and should be able to raise the energy level at any social gathering. Your participation is greatly appreciated by others now, for you are able to set aside your personal preferences in order to facilitate a group activity. Even if your altruistic intentions are pure, don't forget to also take care of your own needs or you'll end up resenting others without knowing why."
aries,2010-01-02,You may suffer from cabin fever if you stick around the house all day. The Moon in your 5th House of Fun encourages you to get out and shake things up a bit. But putting your plan into motion may take a little more forethought than you've given it. It's time to be creative; out-of-the-box thinking will help you find a way to make it happen.
taurus,2010-01-02,"You could be so caught up in a dream today that you might miss an opportunity for fun happening right in front of you. But then again, indulging your fantasies can be just what you need. Don't worry if you lack motivation to get involved socially now; there's nothing wrong with taking some time to replenish your energy. Once you've had a chance to relax you may be ready to mix and mingle."
gemini,2010-01-02,"You could go out of your way to make it appear that you're having fun, for you want to set an example for others. Your reasoning is that if they see you enjoying yourself, they'll want to join in. But this line of thinking might not be your best strategy because playing games could alienate those you want to attract. Try being more straightforward from the start or you could be so clever that you outsmart yourself."
cancer,2010-01-02,"Your idea of fun today may not be the same as someone else in your family. Although it's not worth an outright argument, you should be careful about just burying your feelings or you could become very irritated with yourself for not speaking up. Go ahead and say what you want. Even if you don't get your way, you'll still feel better once you express yourself."
leo,2010-01-02,"You have a list of tasks that must be done today, but you aren't much in the mood to work. The Moon's return to your sign makes it difficult for you to hide your feelings now, even if expressing them doesn't help your day run any smoother. Instead of setting a positive example by being responsible, you are tempted to evade your chores. Nevertheless, it's wiser to get your obligations out of the way as soon as possible, or your resistance will continue to grow."
virgo,2010-01-02,"This can be a very enjoyable day even if there isn't very much going on. The simplest tasks can bring you great pleasure today, so don't go out of your way trying to make something special happen. Just settle in for some well-deserved rest and relaxation. Don't worry; your life will get busy again soon enough."
libra,2010-01-02,"Going out and doing something different with your friends sounds like a good idea today, but you might get so involved with a project at home that you reconsider your social plans. Finding a creative flow can be quite satisfying, but think twice before you just cancel an engagement. It may be hard to get out the door, but once you do you'll be glad you joined in the fun."
scorpio,2010-01-02,"You often like to work behind the scenes, but today you want recognition for what you are doing. You might even be tempted to dramatize your feelings so you know that you are heard. But coming on too strong can have the opposite effect from the one you desire. If you just remember that grandstanding is counterproductive, you won't need to hold yourself back."
sagittarius,2010-01-02,"Your ability to dream up future adventures for yourself today may be greater than your ability to actually make them come true. However, there may be a way to make your fantasies real. First, use your common sense and forget about all but the most practical ideas. Then, give yourself plenty of time to fine-tune your plans before you put them into motion. Think in terms of months rather than days to maximize your chances for success."
capricorn,2010-01-02,"You normally don't mind waiting for personal satisfaction, but today you could be frustrated because you don't have what you want. Even if your basic needs are being met, you might feel as if there's something missing, yet you don't know exactly what it is. Your irritation could get the best of you until you realize that there's no hurry and that you've been given the gift of a couple more weeks to sort it all out."
aquarius,2010-01-02,"Although you may have your hands full with plenty to do today, you still should be able to find time to escape. But you might not be able to spend your whole day hiding out because of previous commitments. Your best bet is to actually set aside a break during the day when you are unavailable to everyone else and do something that allows you to daydream."
pisces,2010-01-02,"Your mind may wander off course today and you could even lose track of time. Nebulous Neptune confuses you, making it tough to distinguish unrealistic dreams from concrete plans. Although you may not be able to keep your thoughts to yourself if you get excited about something in your future, it's not wise to share too much. Indulging in your fantasies doesn't mean you need to bring anyone else along for the ride."
aries,2010-01-03,"You might feel as if someone is challenging your right to say what you feel today. But upon closer examination it's apparent that you aren't being criticized for your opinions, but rather for how you express them. Something as simple as changing your tone of voice to soften your words may be all that's needed to take the aggressive edge off your message. It's surprising how quickly things can turn around when you focus on love instead of conflict."
taurus,2010-01-03,"You could sink into a bad mood today and have a difficult time working your way out of it. Part of the problem is that you have an excess of physical energy and it may tie you up in an emotional knot if you can't find a healthy way to express it. If going to the gym isn't your thing, jump into a project around the house. Or, if you aren't feeling so ambitious, try taking a walk. Thankfully, you'll feel better once you get moving."
gemini,2010-01-03,"Sometimes your acquaintances think you are too easygoing but you could surprise someone by how serious you become today. One moment you seem quite flexible and the next you are as immovable as the Rock of Gibraltar. All it takes is a bit of fear; if you think anyone is jeopardizing your position, then you will respond swiftly. Just remember to take time to consider whether or not the threat is real before you overreact unnecessarily."
cancer,2010-01-03,"Tension may surface in a relationship today, yet the apparent conflict is only a symptom of a deeper problem. For example, you could argue with your partner about whether to go out to dinner or stay home and cook. Meanwhile, the real issue might be a lack of cash, but neither of you are willing to open that can of worms. You don't need to resolve the underlying stress now, but it's a good idea to bring it into the light."
leo,2010-01-03,"You are so ready for a change that you could do something completely out of character today. But impulsive actions won't likely lead you to satisfaction now. It could take a couple more weeks before you begin to get clarity on what to do next. In the meantime, don't be close-minded; the more possibilities you entertain, the better your chances for success."
virgo,2010-01-03,"You might feel as if you aren't being heard today as your questions continue to go unanswered. You might even wonder if anyone is listening to anything you say. Although your actions really do speak louder than your words, it's tough because you may not be motivated to do much at all now. There's no need to be hard on yourself; rest assured that you will be back in the flow of things tomorrow."
libra,2010-01-03,"You may reach a point today when your frustration maxes out and you come dangerously close to losing your temper. Although you won't make any friends by being overly dramatic, a constructive conversation could clear the air of bad feelings, allowing everyone to get off to a fresh start. Just remember that it's within your power to focus on the positive potential rather than playing the blame game."
scorpio,2010-01-03,"You may be stressing about the work you see for yourself in the coming weeks. You might feel extra pressure as your two key planets, Mars and Pluto, engage in an anxious aspect today. The message from these tough planets now is ""no pain, no gain."" It's like working out; the more you put into it, the more you get out of it. Just remember not to succumb to self-doubt, for the emotional intensity will lessen over the days ahead."
sagittarius,2010-01-03,"You are flush with good ideas today, yet others may not be convinced that you are on the right track. You could spend a lot of energy trying to get them to see things your way, but you probably won't accomplish much in spite of your persistence. Instead of defending your logic, just keep gathering information; the research you do now could make a critical difference to the outcome of your plans."
capricorn,2010-01-03,"You normally don't mind it when someone disagrees with your plan. In fact, you welcome a healthy debate because it ultimately improves your chances for success. But it feels like someone is attacking your character now rather than your ideas, and that doesn't sit right with you at all. Your anger can be effectively used to fend off those who stand in your way. Taking the high road and sticking to the issues is your winning strategy today."
aquarius,2010-01-03,"You could turn out to be the hero today as beneficent Venus magically quintiles your key planet Uranus. For some reason your brilliant stroke of genius captures everyone's imaginations. The same idea on another day would probably be passed over as too crazy. But your timing is good and your unorthodox solution brings hope, whether or not it ultimately solves the immediate problem."
pisces,2010-01-03,"You may be set in your ways now and have a specific strategy about how to best do your chores. Unfortunately, someone else could have a very different idea. Although an argument is possible today, the conflict could easily escalate into a battle for control that goes beyond words. Keep in mind that there won't be any winners in a power struggle, so apply your spiritual teachings and graciously withdraw from any hostilities."
aries,2010-01-04,"You could state something that seems very obvious to you, yet someone else might be quite surprised by your perspective. Unfortunately, there could be a significant difference between your intent and what others hear. Even if you choose your words carefully today, the chances of a misunderstanding are great. Patience is your ally now. Don't overreact; take your time and talk things through until your idea is communicated accurately."
taurus,2010-01-04,"You might be a bit confused today if you find that you're having a replay of a recent conversation. You aren't sure why you need to go over everything again until you realize that the previous outcome wasn't as clear as you thought. Instead of being annoyed that you must review plans that you believed were already set, look at this as an opportunity to make a good idea even better."
gemini,2010-01-04,"You may be growing weary of the intensity of everyday life, but you are resigned to handle whatever concerns arise about a recent decision of yours. But you need to be cautious about taking things for granted now as your key planet Mercury conjuncts the Sun. You may feel telepathic, but others won't know what you are thinking unless you actually say the words out loud."
cancer,2010-01-04,"Your workmate or friend might have something important to tell you today, and you would be wise to listen. At first it could seem as if others are on your case and their words may elicit feelings of guilt. But that's not what this is about, so get over your emotions. There is a concrete issue that needs to be addressed now. Once you do this, you'll be able to let it go and move on."
leo,2010-01-04,"You may be resisting the inevitable and the more you fight your current obligations today, the harder it will be to fulfill them. Instead of thinking about what you could be doing, just grit your teeth and make the best of what's on your plate. Don't mince your words; being brutally honest in your communications now will be a service to all involved."
virgo,2010-01-04,"Sometimes creativity can be a playful interpretation of your ideas, but other times it is just plain hard work. Today you get the best of both worlds as your methodical approach to a project enables you to be inspired yet productive. Don't try to force your vision; just analyze what you know and express what you feel."
libra,2010-01-04,"It's easy for you to overdo whatever you start today because you are on a creative high and you're eager to show others your talent. But demonstrating your artistic abilities in order to increase your self-esteem isn't the best use of your current inspiration now. Unfortunately if you reach too far you can lose your sense of balance. Instead of trying to impress anyone for personal gain, just follow your imagination and let it take you wherever it leads."
scorpio,2010-01-04,"Others may think that you're capable of nearly anything today as you appear to pull a rabbit out of the hat by juggling schedules and somehow making everything work out according to plan. But you might be fearful that you won't be able to keep up this level of magic for long, even if it's assumed that you will. Nevertheless, if you don't underestimate your own abilities, you could surprise yourself with your performance."
sagittarius,2010-01-04,"It's all about narrowing your scope of operations today so you don't end up scattering your energy. Fortunately, you have the willpower to control your focus, but it will require constant vigilance. If you find yourself wanting to say yes, stop and think about the consequences of taking on more responsibilities before you complete what you already promised."
capricorn,2010-01-04,"This is a profoundly important time for you because anything you say now has greater significance than you realize. Communicator Mercury is aligned with the Sun in your practical sign, so you have common sense working on your side. But others may see you as overly ambitious which could get in the way of your progress. For best results, choose your words wisely and don't push too hard."
aquarius,2010-01-04,"Your perspective can change the direction of those around you, but not if you remain silent. You may be tempted to keep your thoughts to yourself today because you don't want to stir up animosity. But it's smarter for you to let others know what you are thinking now, even if you don't try to convince them that your plan is better than theirs. Ultimately, you'll have the most impact if you can remain detached from the outcome."
pisces,2010-01-04,"This is not a time for you to undertake a project by yourself. Even if it appears that others are resisting your efforts, excluding them now would not be wise. Instead, listen to the feedback you are receiving today and incorporate what you learn into your current plans. Be flexible enough to modify your strategy rather than trying to do everything on your own."
aries,2010-01-05,"Don't waste words trying to justify what you are doing today, for the more you talk about your motives and intentions, the less convinced others become. It's not that you are on the wrong track; it's just that you cannot explain yourself very well now. Save your energy to concentrate on your work, for it's critical that you live up to your commitments."
taurus,2010-01-05,"You are eager to round up the necessary support from your associates at work, but you might be so confident today that you ask for too much. Your charm can work in your favor as long as you don't take things too far. You should be able to get what you need if you respect other people's limits and acknowledge the constraints of the current circumstances."
gemini,2010-01-05,"Messenger Mercury may be messing with you today by leading you down the garden path. You might be thinking that all is well, but trouble is stirring if you casually glossed over an important fact. You can still save the day, but you must be willing to narrow your thinking enough to go back and tie up any loose ends."
cancer,2010-01-05,"Your workmate or friend could make promises today that are well intentioned yet difficult to fulfill. It's not that anyone is purposefully trying to mislead you, but it's easy to get swept up in a moment of optimism. Try to take commitments lightly now without assuming that others will follow through on what they say. Instead, check in with them again tomorrow, for then their words will carry more weight."
leo,2010-01-05,"You can make the most boring chore sound like a pile of fun today, but it will still be a drag, no matter how you dress it up. Your ability to embellish the truth can also be used to create an excuse if you want to avoid a task. Nevertheless, you need to be careful because you could stretch the truth so far that you end up getting caught in your own game."
virgo,2010-01-05,"Although you are normally very exacting in how you put the facts together, today you are tempted to bend reality in your favor. You might not even be aware of your current tendency toward subjectivity. Luckily, you are intelligent enough to aim for a more objective approach once you realize what you are doing. Don't exaggerate; the truth is more powerful than any story you could make up."
libra,2010-01-05,"Although your senses are stimulated, it's your attraction to an idea now that gets you into trouble. The beauty of your key planet Venus is filtered through mental Mercury today, so you are inclined to talk about what you like. But in doing so, you may gloss over a negative point while emphasizing the parts that sound good. You could be an effective salesperson, but keep in mind that you'll be confronted with tough consequences if your statements don't hold up to reality."
scorpio,2010-01-05,You are tempted to sugarcoat a hard truth today because you think you'll have a better chance of being heard if you do. But this strategy can be tricky because you are jeopardizing your credibility once you start to embellish your story. It's better to be rejected for bluntly delivering your unedited perspective than to be accepted for watering down the facts.
sagittarius,2010-01-05,"Your key planet Jupiter places its magnifying lens on your vision of the future, making everything appear more wonderful than it actually is in reality. The danger is that you could buy into someone's plan without considering the potential problems. It's easy for you to see the big picture now, but it's critical to also take a hard look at the details before you find yourself in over your head."
capricorn,2010-01-05,"Your uncharacteristic enthusiasm about a new project could stir a lot of interest. However, there must be real data to support your involvement or others will abandon you as quickly as they joined in. Do your homework first; if the opportunity is as sound as it appears, then you should feel good about spreading the word and mustering support."
aquarius,2010-01-05,"Following your intuition is normally a good idea, but today you might easily lead yourself into trouble. You are able to see the potential in nearly any opportunity now, but you could miss the more difficult issues because you are in such a hopeful frame of mind. However, it's crucial to analyze the problems as well as the promises. Don't be a fool and rush in; take your time and back up your decision with sound research."
pisces,2010-01-05,"Your faith in your friends can be a true gift to them, but today your confidence can go overboard. Although they will appreciate that you believe in them, they could ultimately let you down. Don't set yourself up for disappointment by thinking that others are infallible. Give yourself a reality check; recognizing the truth now can save you from unnecessary discouragement tomorrow."
aries,2010-01-06,"It may seem as if someone is standing between you and your happiness today, but this belief is merely your way to avoid personal responsibility for your dilemma. Instead of placing blame on anyone else, venture inward to better understand your role in the present situation. Paradoxically, making a shift in your own attitude is the most direct way to positively impact the current circumstances."
taurus,2010-01-06,"You may feel as if your options are limited today, yet you are willing to work within the current restraints until you can figure out how to make some changes. You have patience on your side now, but you won't be able to hold out for too long. You don't have to accept the status quo; be ready to take a risk if you truly know what you want."
gemini,2010-01-06,"The temptation to play is great today, but you may be unpleasantly surprised if you think that you will be able to take the day off. You won't likely have an opportunity to lower your guard now, for you are pulled from one unstable situation to the next without much time for recovery. Fortunately, you are able to have a stabilizing impact if you temporarily set aside your personal desires and focus on the common good."
cancer,2010-01-06,"Personal issues take center stage in your life now and dealing with them might make you less effective at work. You may attempt to show others how willing you are to cooperate today, but they could interpret your flexibility as a sign of your disinterest. Don't just take the course of least resistance. Explain your position as succinctly as possible before you relinquish control."
leo,2010-01-06,"A stalemate is declared in a game of chess when neither side has the power to gain a decisive victory. Today you may feel as if this aptly describes your current situation. You may not be able to leverage your position to come out on top now, but you won't go down in defeat either. However, keep in mind that this is your life and not a board game; there will still be time ahead for you to reclaim your advantage."
virgo,2010-01-06,"Your key planet Mercury is playing the role of trickster today and you might not appreciate the current instability. It may feel as if the rules of the game have changed, yet no one bothered to notify you. Even if you think you know what's happening, there's more going on than meets the eye. If possible delay making any long-term decisions now, for clarity will arrive sooner than you think."
libra,2010-01-06,"Although you may have a reputation for being indecisive, today you know exactly what you need. Don't be afraid to let others know your preferences, even if they might want something else. Conflict isn't easy for you, but at least you have the tools now to stand up for yourself. Take time to think about what you are going to say and then stick to your script. You may be pleasantly surprised when your wish comes true."
scorpio,2010-01-06,"Today can be an amazing day for your career, but you must be clear about your goals or others will make incorrect assumptions. Don't worry about following rules of social etiquette; just speak your truth. Your boss and co-workers will appreciate what you have to offer if you are willing to take the risk and share your point of view without editing it for political correctness. You may stir things up now, but that is exactly what is needed."
sagittarius,2010-01-06,"If you are uncomfortable with your current work assignment, consider the source of your uneasiness. You might not like the way you are being managed, or, perhaps, you are bored with what you are doing. Your restlessness is exacerbated now by your inventive ideas, especially if there's nowhere to express them. Instead of going out on a limb and sharing your thoughts, write them down and save them for another day when they can have the positive impact they warrant."
capricorn,2010-01-06,"You take your work seriously and like to know that you are correct before you share your opinions. You want to be known as someone who can be relied upon, but now your thoughts are a bit erratic and you may not trust yourself. Actually, you are able to think outside the normal constraints of logic and your ideas may be quite original. Then again, they may be a bit flaky. Keep them to yourself for a few days to see how they stand up to the test of time."
aquarius,2010-01-06,Someone isn't playing fairly now and there's not much you can do about it yet. A co-worker may have hidden motives for what he or she is doing. Don't try to force the issue even if you think something is being kept from you. Just let the current events play out. Everything you need to know will become obvious in time.
pisces,2010-01-06,"You may be the wild card in the group today, but aren't yet aware of your role. If you are working as part of a team, others might take a collective stance that is more conservative than your position. Although you might not intend to stir up any trouble, something you say could inadvertently let the truth slip out. Once it's been said you cannot take it back. Don't worry; ultimately everyone will feel better after everything is out in the open."
aries,2010-01-07,It's difficult to gauge how much you need to hold yourself back today when pushy Mars forms an irritable aspect with the Sun in calculating Capricorn. You mean well but your best intentions aren't good enough if your abrasive behavior still offends someone you are trying to impress. Keep in mind that it's better to err on the passive side now; you can always reaffirm your position tomorrow when the coast is clear.
taurus,2010-01-07,"The politics at work may be complicated today. Even if you can see what's going on, navigating your way through the emotional landmines can be tricky business. Instead of stubbornly sticking to your agenda, a smarter strategy may be to simply respond to situations as they occur and return to moving ahead with your goals tomorrow."
gemini,2010-01-07,"Although you are eager to put others at ease today, your motives may not be all that altruistic. There's nothing wrong with wanting to be accepted by someone you like, for you are able to give more when you feel appreciated. Nevertheless, the greatest gifts of friendship and love are offered without measuring or keeping score of what you receive in return."
cancer,2010-01-07,"Even if you do everything just right today, someone is still going to feel as if you are overly controlling. But you are merely acting defensively to prevent others from manipulating you. There is likely truth to both sides. Practice detaching yourself from the outcome; if you can get comfortable with the current situation, power struggles will dissipate and maybe even vanish."
leo,2010-01-07,"You may put a lot of forethought into what you are doing today, but your planning may be for naught. Perhaps you read the situation incorrectly and made assumptions on incorrect data. Or maybe the circumstances change, turning your schedule upside down. Whether or not you were ever really in control isn't the point; things will improve when you loosen your grip on the day."
virgo,2010-01-07,There's no need to overreact if anyone makes unreasonable demands of you today. Your smartest strategy is to push back in a firm yet gentle manner. Establishing boundaries now requires extra clear communication on your part because a misunderstanding can easily creep into the picture if you respond impulsively without thinking first.
libra,2010-01-07,"You may get the idea that your friends are not being supportive today, but your worries could be unfounded. You have a lot on your mind as domestic responsibilities weigh heavily on your shoulders. But don't expect others to rush to your rescue just because you are under pressure. For now you might need to handle your personal obligations on your own."
scorpio,2010-01-07,"Your energy is out of balance today and you may become a bit frazzled if you cannot reestablish a steady pace at work. Something has gone slightly awry and it feels as if you need a chiropractic-like adjustment to your attitude to snap your thinking back into place. Take a break, a walk or an extra long lunch; anything that shifts your focus can help you regain your natural rhythm."
sagittarius,2010-01-07,"Financial planning isn't necessarily the most exciting activity, but now you may find yourself wishing you did more of it prior to today. You prefer dreaming about the big picture and making long-term plans, but you could be in the midst of a cash flow problem and need to pay close attention to the immediate situation. Once you navigate through the current obstacles, make sure to set aside time to look further ahead."
capricorn,2010-01-07,It's difficult to know whether you should try harder today or temporarily retreat. You could feel frustrated now because you wish you took the other course of action no matter how you proceed. Rest assured there is no right or wrong way to go from here. Your path is temporarily obscured and it's best to bide your time until you receive a clear signal that tells you what to do next.
aquarius,2010-01-07,"Your dreams continue to be very active now, whether you remember them when you wake up or you just drift into them throughout the day. However, you need to exercise caution because your fantasies seem so real today that they can lead you on a wild goose chase. Don't assume you have the proper perspective to tell the difference between fact and fancy; maintain a wait-and-see attitude until clarity returns."
pisces,2010-01-07,"You might have a very intuitive take on your life, as if you are living within a dream. But something happens that wakes you up today and reminds you that you need to be more practical. You may not like having to make such a drastic adjustment, but using your common sense now will surely save you from disappointment later on."
aries,2010-01-08,"Your key planet Mars is in the spotlight today, provoking you to act impulsively. Often your spontaneity works well for you, but now it may be more of a problem than a solution. Think twice before you do something that seems like a good idea at first. Hesitating long enough to consider other options can save you from an awkward situation."
taurus,2010-01-08,"A particular relationship may be on your mind now, yet you don't seem to be able to find the satisfaction you seek. Don't blame your frustration on anyone else; it could be self-created, even if it doesn't feel that way. Consider how your actions can contribute to others forming an incorrect conclusion about your intentions. If they truly understood where you were coming from, they might be more willing to help you achieve what you want."
gemini,2010-01-08,Your confusion can get you into trouble today as retrograde Mercury diffuses your logic when it aligns with nebulous Neptune. Your most sensible strategy now is to keep quiet; you will sound more sincere if you don't try to convince others you know what you're talking about when you don't. Don't be in such a hurry to force an answer when there isn't one available yet.
cancer,2010-01-08,It doesn't seem fair that you're the one who is stressing about what others are doing now while they don't seem to be as concerned. You might have a difficult time deciding whether or not to say anything because you don't think anyone will take you seriously. Rest assured that your perceptions are correct. But keep in mind that exposing your emotions today could stir up more resistance than satisfaction.
leo,2010-01-08,"You are tempted to keep your frustration to yourself today because sharing your true feelings could put you at a real disadvantage. Logically, there's no reason to draw additional attention to your vulnerability now. Instead of making such a big deal about a disappointment, focus your attention on the possibilities that are ahead. Your positive attitude can turn a difficult situation in your favor."
virgo,2010-01-08,"Although you are usually able to explain yourself quite accurately, today you might be unable to find the right words. Instead of struggling to justify your actions, let them speak for themselves. It may not feel comfortable, especially if you think that you're being misunderstood, but you'll have a better chance of getting it right if you wait to say what's on your mind."
libra,2010-01-08,"You may be at odds today with someone you normally like very much. Uncomfortable family dynamics can stir old memories, but it's important to realize that what's happening now is different. Unexpressed emotions can increase the gulf between you and others, but sharing your fears will further complicate matters. It makes the most sense now to wait without escalating any conflict. Continue your discussions tomorrow after the intensity begins to settle."
scorpio,2010-01-08,"Your traditional planetary ruler Mars is activating unresolved feelings today, especially with the Moon back in your sign. Other people do things that are particularly irritating now and it's not easy for you to remain quiet. Unfortunately, spontaneously expressing your annoyance won't likely bring you any lasting satisfaction. Be smart and make a plan for the days ahead, rather than acting impulsively without a long-term goal."
sagittarius,2010-01-08,"It's important for you to feel like you have the tools necessary to accomplish your goals. Your frustration level will be high today if you lack the resources to do your job. However, you might not be in control of what's happening now and too much ambition could add to your anxiety. Don't give up, but exercise common sense by being extra flexible with respect to your expectations."
capricorn,2010-01-08,"You might believe that you know what you want today, but your current desires may be confused by inconsistent reasoning. Something or someone very attractive could be stimulating unfulfilled fantasies that get in your way of seeing what's actually happening. Don't set yourself up for discouragement by talking yourself into an ill-advised action. Wait and see how you feel about it tomorrow before doing anything silly."
aquarius,2010-01-08,"You could have a stroke of brilliance today that inspires you to swing into action without a lot of warning and your behavior can catch others off guard. They may resist your current efforts, leading you to reconsider your original idea. But don't draw the wrong conclusion. Your logic may be quite sound; the problem could be in your delivery. Give your co-workers time to readjust their thinking before suddenly springing your plan on them."
pisces,2010-01-08,"Your imagination can place a strain on your life today because others could inadvertently misinterpret what you say. You might choose to share a meaningful dream, knowing that it is a favorite fantasy. Meanwhile, someone else mistakenly believes that your vision is factual, causing them to doubt your integrity or judgment. You can avoid misunderstandings by taking the time to clearly state the source of your thoughts before you begin."
aries,2010-01-09,"It may seem as if someone is coercing you to get involved in an emotional drama that you are attempting to avoid. But your feelings are already engaged and it's difficult to turn them off once they have been aroused. You might not be able to avoid a stormy interaction, yet you'll probably feel more peaceful once everyone's agenda is out in the open."
taurus,2010-01-09,"You like to keep things simple, yet others may be forcibly pushing you now to consider alternatives that will ultimately complicate your life. Paradoxically, your resistance won't likely elicit the desired effect and could even stir up more unresolved emotions. This is no time to stubbornly adhere to your principles. Being extra flexible won't be easy, but it could help everyone get through an awkward emotional impasse."
gemini,2010-01-09,"You have a set agenda today and aren't interested in getting involved in anything that doesn't help you make progress toward your goal. Someone may misinterpret your single-mindedness as a personal rejection, but you just don't have time for that kind of personal politics now. Stay focused on your mission. When you've accomplished enough for one day, let others know that you're ready for some fun and relaxation."
cancer,2010-01-09,"You may not be easy to get along with today, but you could be preoccupied with a decision that you must make soon. It's likely that your friends and family will want to help you, but you might see this as a way for them to exert control over your life. You don't have to push away someone who can be a trustworthy ally now; instead let everyone know your concerns and be clear about your boundaries."
leo,2010-01-09,"You have strong feelings about a family member or very close friend, but unfortunately you may be unable to share your concerns now. You are tired of always being the one that others rely on, yet the timing isn't right for you to let anyone down today. If you decide to keep your emotions out of the picture, don't do it halfway. Process your negativity, for any hidden resentment will be obvious and can get in the way of what you have to offer."
virgo,2010-01-09,"You may believe that you can accomplish more today than you actually get done, but don't waste energy being hard on yourself. You deserve some downtime, so be certain to build a bit of creative playtime into your schedule no matter what. Ultimately, you'll be more productive if you make room in your day to do something you truly enjoy."
libra,2010-01-09,"You may need to take an unpopular stand today because being true to your own values is more important than just being nice. It could be challenging to hold your position if your friends and family are trying to convince you that you are wrong. Ultimately it's not about what anyone else wants; maintaining your integrity isn't easy, but for now it's what counts."
scorpio,2010-01-09,"Your friends might attempt to sidestep a difficult issue today, for they realize that you are in a no-nonsense mood and have no time for unnecessary drama. But the Moon's current visit to your perceptive sign means that you'll know if anyone is holding anything back. There is plenty of room for misinterpreting someone's motives now, so go out of your way to let others know what you expect."
sagittarius,2010-01-09,"You may believe that if you don't have anything positive to say today then you shouldn't say anything at all. Unfortunately, your silence communicates a lot more than you realize because others will know that you are withholding your feelings. Avoid provoking an unnecessary emotional drama by pretending that everything is okay. Instead, do what you usually do so well; just tell the truth."
capricorn,2010-01-09,You can set an important example today by stepping up to a leadership role. But this isn't about telling anyone else what to do; it's about jumping into a situation without having your own personal agenda. The best thing you can do now is to simply show up with a positive attitude. Maintaining a high level of integrity is much more effective than pretending you know all the answers.
aquarius,2010-01-09,Others demand a lot of you today and you might think they are being unreasonable. But the truth is that you aren't responsible to live up to anyone's expectations except your own. Set your goals early in the day and then do the best you can. But keep your doubts to yourself or you'll just be unnecessarily feeding into negativity that isn't even yours.
pisces,2010-01-09,"It's surprising how quickly you can swing from having unattainable goals to very pragmatic ones. Yesterday's dreams have faded, leaving you with a practical sense of what you can manage. Don't waste energy now trying to conform to someone else's strategy for living. Trust your vision; it won't steer you wrong today."
aries,2010-01-10,"It may feel as if you are being pulled this way and that way, making it difficult for you to get your chores done. But after being buffeted around for a while by fluctuating circumstances, you decide that things cannot continue as they are going. Luckily, you have enough sense to change your attitude, which subsequently puts control back in your hands. Decide what you want to accomplish now and don't let obstacles deter you from reaching your goals."
taurus,2010-01-10,"Avoid getting dragged into an unnecessary conflict today because it won't likely lead to anything good. However, don't be afraid of holding on to your position now because you've had enough time to form your opinions. But you would be wise to play it low key for a while, for the best way to avoid an argument is to remain quiet. You can speak your piece later in the day without as much risk of encountering opposition."
gemini,2010-01-10,"You might feel as if you are being ignored today, but there's no need to try harder to get the attention you desire. It's best to just let things unfold naturally, for you will be taken more seriously later in the day. Fortunately, you don't have to do anything but be flexible in your approach. If you maintain a cheerful attitude, your interactions with others should continue to improve."
cancer,2010-01-10,"You might attempt to sidestep a challenging issue today, especially if you and a loved one have different opinions on the subject. Even if you successfully hide your feelings for a while, you won't likely be able to avoid the truth all day. But don't say anything while your emotions are all fired up. Wait until your intensity settles and you are able to convey your position without making things worse."
leo,2010-01-10,"Although you may get off to a slow start today, the action picks up soon enough and you could thoroughly enjoy yourself while being productive. If you have been putting off a creative project around the house, now would be the time to jump in. But don't worry about finishing what you begin; it's more important to take the first step and set a sustainable pace for the rest of the job."
virgo,2010-01-10,"It's difficult for you to stay on track today because you keep imagining all the exciting possibilities ahead. Unfortunately, you can scare yourself by the enormity of your vision, prompting you to take no action at all for fear of failure. The big picture can be daunting if you don't know how to break it down into manageable pieces. But everything will be easier if you just remember to keep scaling back your plans."
libra,2010-01-10,"You won't likely be able to avoid your domestic responsibilities today, but that doesn't necessarily prevent you from having fun anyway. Fortunately, you have the ability now to turn the most mundane chore into an interesting diversion. Let your creativity shine, no matter what else you must do in order to fulfill your current obligations."
scorpio,2010-01-10,"Your financial condition might be improving, but that doesn't mean you should spend the money before it's in the bank. You still have a substantial amount of work to do before you will see any tangible rewards, so it's best not to count your chickens before they hatch. Although you are now tempted to visualize good news before it occurs, there aren't any easy shortcuts to your final destination."
sagittarius,2010-01-10,"The Moon's return to your sign today is bound to lift your spirits. It's as if you receive a cosmic energy boost that makes you feel great. Your confidence runs high, giving you the ability to handle even the most difficult situation. But don't fall into the trap of complacency; you'll still need to be diligent in order to overcome the difficult odds that seem to be stacked against you."
capricorn,2010-01-10,"You may be a walking paradox today because you are so optimistic and pessimistic at the same time. These opposing attitudes should cancel each other out, but you don't need to lose your overall positive attitude, even if you appear to be much less confident. Ultimately, it's your serious side that drives your can-do-it bias, for you are willing to put in the hard work necessary to accomplish your goals."
aquarius,2010-01-10,"The uplifting Sagittarius Moon is in your 11th House of Groups today, tying your spiritual approach to life to your association with like-minded individuals. You might be more attracted now to some form of organized worship, or, perhaps, you are motivated to increase your involvement with a community cause. However this energy plays out for you, enjoy being part of something that is larger than yourself."
pisces,2010-01-10,"The Moon's visit to your 10th House of Public Responsibility makes it doubly important for you to remember how much you care about your friends and family. But today your way of nurturing those you love isn't about smothering them with sweetness and compassion. Instead, you are driven to take bold action that empowers others with a new sense of confidence, enabling them to be more independent."
aries,2010-01-11,"You have a pretty good handle on your goals now, but could be a bit too lackadaisical about turning your strategy into action. You may be a champion of figuring things out as you go along, but now you will benefit by being a little less spontaneous and a lot more methodical. Don't be afraid to attend to the details; you can always modify your plan later on, if necessary."
taurus,2010-01-11,"Your ideas are very sensible now and could make you a lot of money, but you'll need to overcome the temptation to take the easy way out. Your key planet Venus cozies up to the Sun today, reminding you of how much you enjoy indulging your senses. Eating, drinking and being merry might sound like viable alternatives to hard work, but they can lure you away from what really needs to be done. Decide what you want, make a solid commitment to reach your goal and get busy."
gemini,2010-01-11,"Although you might like the idea of a flirtatious interaction with an adventurous acquaintance, you quickly discover today that you want more. Instead of simply enjoying lighthearted banter, you are being driven to go deeper. Emotional intensity is something you often try to avoid, yet the potential is so alluring now that you don't want to miss your chance to experience something very special."
cancer,2010-01-11,"You may feel quite loved today if someone goes out of the way to do something nice for you. But you also might experience a bit of anxiety as you wonder what you are expected to do in return. However, unspoken requests really do not need your response. If you are worried that this could set the stage for a conflict later on, bring it out into the open. Talking about your fears will help to clear the air and ease your mind."
leo,2010-01-11,"You may have all kinds of big ideas about how you can express yourself today. You want to be magnificently creative in your actions, but it could be inappropriate if your responsibilities need to come first. Transform your frustration into productivity because you'll have the greatest positive impact on your own self-esteem now by attending to unfinished business."
virgo,2010-01-11,"It's challenging today to know when to stop, especially if you fall into an enjoyable groove while getting things done. Others might even think you're a workaholic, while the truth is that you're just having fun. Nevertheless, you can overdo it now and ruin a good thing. Slow down or you could be exhausted by tomorrow."
libra,2010-01-11,"You want to do things that keep you close to home base today as your key planet Venus joins the Sun in your 4th House of Security. However, if you take a safe approach now, you may grow restless because you also see the advantages to riskier behavior. Don't be fooled by a passing mood; caution, not recklessness, is highly advised at this time."
scorpio,2010-01-11,"You are in a calmer place now and better equipped to face the upcoming challenges. It's important for your actions to be as loving as your words, and a positive attitude will ultimately make your life easier. But this doesn't mean that you can ignore your values for the sake of expediency. Instead, demonstrate your ability to maintain integrity while still being an optimist."
sagittarius,2010-01-11,"Your spirits are high today, yet you might be afraid of reaching too far for fear of upsetting the status quo. Fortunately, your current actions are cosmically favored as long as you aren't too greedy. Whether you are seeking reward or romance, focus on your long-term goals and not on immediate gratification. Moderation, not excess, is your key to success."
capricorn,2010-01-11,"You may feel as if your goals are within reach now, but you can't help but wonder if you are just fooling yourself. Normally, you are able to see the facts quite clearly, however difficult they may be. It's not that you are avoiding reality today; it's just that you realize how important your positive attitude can be in achieving success. Stay focused on finishing what you start, even if it takes longer than expected."
aquarius,2010-01-11,"You could be quite convincing today as you dazzle others with your knowledge. But you might be so confident that you fool yourself along with everyone else. Your tendency to walk on the brighter side of the street is fine now as long as you don't take it too far by ignoring the facts that remain in the shadows. If your position is sound, the rest of the truth won't detract anyone from joining you."
pisces,2010-01-11,"It's easy to lose track of your own goals today because you are so willing to be a part of something that is greater than yourself. Whether you are swept up by the team spirit at work or by a social cause close to your heart, your ability to blend into the group now is a mixed blessing. Working for a higher purpose can be very gratifying as long as you also maintain a solid sense of your own professional trajectory."
aries,2010-01-12,"This might seem like a perfect day to catch up on unfinished business, but completing any single task could take much longer than you think. Instead of pushing forward, you might be wiser now to map out your plans for the weeks ahead. But it's crucial to be realistic. If you scale back your expectations today, you should be able to make some solid progress."
taurus,2010-01-12,"Perhaps you feel as if you missed your chance to make your dreams come true, but you have another opportunity within your reach now. You may be inspired to take a calculated risk today and you just might get what you want. Nevertheless, don't let your hopes grow larger than life or you could end up being disappointed all over again."
gemini,2010-01-12,"Just as you begin to think that not much is happening today, an unexpected treat flies into your life, tempting you to deviate from your prepared script. You are intrigued and may be ready to take the road less traveled, but moving slowly is smarter than rushing into a decision you cannot undo. Act with caution; you may be surprised at how the current events unfold."
cancer,2010-01-12,"You are less interested in the details today than you are in wanting to understand the big picture. But peer pressure will likely prevent you from floating up into the clouds of your imagination. It seems as if there's always someone nearby to remind you about the next job that must be done, making it difficult to ignore your obligations. Focus on finishing your work and save your dreaming for another time."
leo,2010-01-12,"You may fantasize about traveling to faraway places with a friend or lover today as the adventurous Sagittarius Moon activates journeying Jupiter. But the real emphasis now is on your 6th House of Daily Routine, reminding you to do your chores first before running off to follow your dreams. There's no need to feel as if you've missed your boat; another one will take you someplace special when the time is right."
virgo,2010-01-12,"You might be a bit uncomfortable today when you realize that no one is holding you back. Paradoxically, it was quite reassuring when you had good reasons to stay right where you are. But it can be disconcerting now that you are freer to explore something new, for you don't yet know your true limits. It might be wise to take a risk as long as you have a well-considered plan."
libra,2010-01-12,"Today is a bit of a paradox because as long as you remain serious about what's most important, you'll have the ability to also enjoy the lighter moments. But if you attempt to avoid your basic obligations then you won't feel free enough to partake in any fun. Being responsible now is the key to unlocking the gate to the playground."
scorpio,2010-01-12,"Focus on what is right in front of you today instead of worrying about what's coming up next. It's challenging for you to ignore the larger view, yet trying to map out the next month or so only leads to frustration. Take a leap of faith and trust that you'll have a better chance of reaching your goals if you narrow your thinking now and concentrate your efforts on the present moment."
sagittarius,2010-01-12,"Time is running out, or so it seems today. You may be inspired to try something risky, especially if you're worried that your actions are too little and too late. Although your fear is unfounded, taking a step in the right direction is advisable while the Moon is still in your sign. It's better to begin now and then build on your current efforts over the days ahead."
capricorn,2010-01-12,"You want to be positive about your future, but today you can clearly see the warning signs for what's around the corner. This is not a good time to lose yourself in fantasies, although the temptation is surely present. Get a jump start on the inevitable hard work ahead; the more you accomplish now, the easier it will be in a few days."
aquarius,2010-01-12,"It's difficult for you to acknowledge your limitations today because you could easily believe that anything is possible. But this is tricky territory, because your attitude could transform an impossible task into one that can be done. Still, it's not a smart idea to exhaust yourself trying to prove your competence. Don't be afraid to ask for what you want, but give yourself plenty of time to reach your goals."
pisces,2010-01-12,"You can be quite headstrong today about your career objectives, yet you might be missing something crucial in your strategy to get ahead. It's easy now to make an incorrect assumption or to misinterpret someone's message. Be open to change; sticking to your current plan may not be the smartest idea. Fortunately, you should have a better notion of what to do by tomorrow."
aries,2010-01-13,"You know that you have work responsibilities that really should take precedence over socializing today, but a unique invitation makes it tough to say no. Since your mind is probably already made up, be smart and don't go overboard. You can go out and have a good time, but apply yourself diligently early in the day so you don't feel guilty about avoiding important commitments."
taurus,2010-01-13,"You may need to deal with an unpleasant obstacle early in the day, but, fortunately, you have the determination to overcome nearly anything that stands in your way. You have an uncanny ability now to know when to wait and when to be a bit more forceful. Trust your intuition and don't let logic override your feelings today."
gemini,2010-01-13,"It's just like you to have a plan and then change your mind at the very last moment. Others may not understand your motives for shifting your priorities, but you have your reasons. Just make sure that you aren't taking the easy way out. If your new strategy is truly an improvement, then go for it and don't worry about justifying your actions to everyone else."
cancer,2010-01-13,"You might frighten yourself today because you are suddenly willing to gamble more than you would at other times. But taking a calculated risk may be the smartest thing you can do now, even if others attempt to talk you out of your plan. Consider what is worse -- the fear of failure or the regret of having not tried. Overcome your self-imposed resistance and follow your heart."
leo,2010-01-13,"You have resources that you haven't tapped into yet because you weren't fully committed to a single goal. But it's time to dig deep into your arsenal and play for keeps, especially if you really know what you want today. If you aren't certain yet, wait a few more days. A big shift is right around the corner and no harm is done if you stubbornly hold your ground for now."
virgo,2010-01-13,"You can't decide whether or not to go ahead with your plans because the pros and cons seem pretty evenly balanced. But even if you finally choose against pushing forward today, you might surprise yourself and suddenly take the next step anyhow. Be careful; if you make a false start, you may just have to begin anew next week."
libra,2010-01-13,"Today you may have an original idea about how to improve upon a task you perform on a regular basis. Unfortunately, your fear of upsetting the status quo may be enough to convince you to forget about your new method of doing things. However, if you don't try it, you'll never know whether or not it works. Be innovative; you can always go back to your old ways if you want."
scorpio,2010-01-13,"Being creative may be quite exciting now, especially if you establish a work flow that you can sustain. Although your head may be filled with good ideas today, you aren't very interested in making a one-time splash. Save the showy presentation for another day; instead, be satisfied with impressing others by demonstrating your determination to complete what you begin."
sagittarius,2010-01-13,"You can get away with unorthodox behavior today because others will see your more contemplative side, even if you think your actions are a bit edgy. Fortunately, your willingness to take a chance by doing something different now demonstrates your desire to succeed without sacrificing your integrity. Playing the role of a nonconformist enables you to be responsible while also remaining true to your values."
capricorn,2010-01-13,"You are a force to be reckoned with today, yet you need to slow yourself down or you could squander a precious opportunity. Being an effective leader can be challenging if you are overly eager to reach a goal because you are tempted to bolt ahead of those who should be following you. Make sure to move at a pace that allows others to be a part of the process."
aquarius,2010-01-13,"It won't do you much good to try to hide your intentions from others today, even if you think it's a prudent idea. The problem is that unpredictable Uranus, your key planet, is activated by the Sun and Venus, setting the stage for an unexpected turn of events. Tensions created by unspoken feelings can quickly come to the surface and then dissipate just as fast."
pisces,2010-01-13,"Of course your feelings make total sense to you, but the trouble begins today when you try to explain them to anyone else. Misunderstandings occur when you get so excited about your vision that you jump from thought to thought without completing one idea before you're on to the next. A more intelligent strategy now might be to work quietly toward your goals and wait a few more days before sharing your plan with others."
aries,2010-01-14,"This could be an important day for you professionally, but it shouldn't really come as a surprise. Your contribution to a project or a cause will be acknowledged, as long as you have been doing your work. But don't expect too much at once; even though you are moving steadily toward your goals, it will take some time yet for you to reach critical mass and experience the breakthrough you seek."
taurus,2010-01-14,"You may appear to be moving slowly today, yet you are on a mission and should reach your goal as long as you follow your plan. Don't let others talk you out of what you believe. Your logic is sound and your strategy makes as much sense as anyone else's. There still might be a surprise or two along the way, but don't let anything distract you from your current destination."
gemini,2010-01-14,"It's a smart idea for you to go over the details of a proposed project one more time today, especially if you have been attempting to finalize a business deal. You would also be wise to go out of your way and check in with your spouse or partner about an emotional issue that's still unresolved. One way or another, things are coming to a turning point over the next few days and it's important that you are ready for whatever happens."
cancer,2010-01-14,"Your logic may not be trustworthy now, so use your intuition to navigate your way through a difficult relationship dynamic. Don't waste your energy analyzing what went wrong or what you should do next. Let your emotions speak to you and then carefully share them. It's okay if you do not have any answers now. At least, show up with enough integrity to express your feelings and let the situation evolve from there."
leo,2010-01-14,"Your physical well-being and mental health are now inseparably intertwined and you must work at both simultaneously if you want to feel better. Making improvements to your diet or exercise program is certainly commendable, but you'll also need to reduce your stress on the job if you want to be happy. Don't try to do too much at once. Taking one small careful step after another is more effective than one big messy leap."
virgo,2010-01-14,"You may be frustrated by the lack of fun in your life now. Even if you have attempted to make time for some pleasure, it's been hard to make much progress these last couple of weeks. Don't lose faith; things are going to loosen up very soon. In the meantime, try to get your ducks in a row so you are ready to fly when given clearance for takeoff."
libra,2010-01-14,"A family matter may be taking longer to resolve than you expected, but your extra effort today could be the catalyst needed to push the situation along. However, part of the problem may be that you are stuck holding a perspective that is no longer working for you. Reconsider your position; changing your mind can have a positive impact on those around you and enable you to get things moving again."
scorpio,2010-01-14,"You really don't want to make changes in your immediate environment, but the very things you have resisted for the past few weeks will now be easier to handle. You are standing at the edge of an energetic shift that will affect your daily routine, but it may take a few more days to become apparent. Luckily, you won't have to wait much longer."
sagittarius,2010-01-14,"You could be limiting yourself financially without even realizing it, for your income may be directly related to how you value yourself -- or how you don't. You may think that others see you as someone with high self-esteem, but there could be insecurities that still get in your way. Don't try to fix anything overnight; instead, begin by simply recognizing all that you bring to your work. Believing in yourself enables others to have more faith in you."
capricorn,2010-01-14,"You might attempt to hide your anxiety today because you want to set a good example for others. Meanwhile, you may be quietly panicking because you don't know how you are going to meet your current deadlines. Instead of wasting precious energy on needless worry, just focus your attention on what must be done and give it your very best. Hang in there, it may take a day or two to see the results of your current efforts."
aquarius,2010-01-14,"It truly feels like the end of the road, and in some sense it is. But you are not quite finished with an old project or issue and what you do now is of utmost importance because it sets the tone for weeks to come. However, you cannot see around the bend to know which way to turn, so don't bother to finalize any long-term plans yet. Just concentrate on what you need to do today and let the future come to you at its own pace."
pisces,2010-01-14,"You may need to take a stand against the pressure you feel from your friends or co-workers. Others expect you to fulfill your responsibilities now, yet you might not see eye-to-eye with them about what you're supposed to do. Be clear about your intentions and ask for clarification, if needed. Before you spin your wheels any further today, make certain that you are driving in the right direction."
aries,2010-01-15,Acting with authority doesn't mean that you should boss people around. Being in command comes from the power you derive when you are in sync with the truth. Today it means being the author of your own life. Just be careful about what you say because your words carry more weight than usual and can have a bigger impact on others than you realize.
taurus,2010-01-15,"Just when you think you know where you are going, something happens that makes you reconsider your earlier plans. Change may be required now, but don't throw the baby out with the bathwater. Luckily, your key planet Venus is conjunct today's Solar Eclipse, enabling you to improve on your current strategy. Success is likely, but you must allow time for your actions to create the desired results."
gemini,2010-01-15,"Be aware that trickster Mercury is at work during the Solar Eclipse, which can fill your head with unwarranted self-doubt today. You may wonder if your efforts over the past few weeks moved you any closer to your goals. Now that your key planet is no longer retrograde, you should begin to feel more productive and quickly see the results of your recent diligence."
cancer,2010-01-15,"You are particularly sensitive to the Solar Eclipse because it polarizes your 7th House of Partnerships. Stress will likely be encountered in a relationship with a friend or lover, but it can actually bring you closer together as a challenging issue is addressed. Even if communication seems difficult today, sticking with the process will lead to a feeling of accomplishment."
leo,2010-01-15,"Your daily routine may be temporarily turned upside down today as the Sun is eclipsed in your 6th House of Work. Although a change of pace can be upsetting at first, it could also reveal hidden details that alter your perspective. Don't look back; there's no use being hard on yourself for something you didn't know. Fortunately, it's not too late to modify your course of action now."
virgo,2010-01-15,"Communicator Mercury focuses your attention on your 5th House of Self-Expression. You might feel as if you have been waiting for the right moment to share something very dear to your heart with someone special. Now, after careful deliberation you may be ready to show your cards, especially if the risk seems minimal. You won't have a shot at success by keeping secrets now, so you might as well give honest disclosure the chance it deserves."
libra,2010-01-15,"It may not appear as if your personal life is going in the right direction now, but you'll probably end up getting what you want with sweet Venus conjunct the Solar Eclipse in your 4th House of Foundations. Just keep in mind that there could be a long haul in front of you before you reach satisfaction because today you are building a base for future operations. Remember, anything that's really significant is worth the wait."
scorpio,2010-01-15,"Today's New Moon Eclipse rattles your 3rd House of Communication. You may become quite anxious if you have to handle an unexpected problem that arises, but remember there's no need to escalate the situation into a major drama. Luckily, clever Mercury comes riding to your rescue now; everything should resolve smoothly if you let logic, not your emotions, be your guide."
sagittarius,2010-01-15,"If it seems like your path to success has been blocked by one obstacle after another, prepare for a change of pace as the resistance begins to dissipate. Although it may appear as if circumstances are improving due to luck, it's actually more a result of the hard work you have been doing over the past few weeks when Mercury was retrograde. It's time for you to enjoy the fruits of your labors. Finally, you are sitting on the launch pad and ready for blast off."
capricorn,2010-01-15,"You may feel as if you are losing control of your life now and the more you try to put everything back in order, the crazier it becomes. It's surely not just another day for you because the Capricorn New Moon Eclipse tests the stability of what you are doing while Mercury ends its three-week retrograde period in your sign. It's hard to know whether you should laugh or cry. Perhaps, both are in order as you prepare to take your life into a new and exciting direction."
aquarius,2010-01-15,"A Solar Eclipse in your karmic 12th House could stir up issues from your past. But you might not remember things as they actually were because your imagination can warp the truth. Further complicating matters, everything seems more significant now, as if a magnifying lens has been placed over reality. Take the truth with a grain of salt today, for you could have a very different perspective by tomorrow."
pisces,2010-01-15,"Your world now might feel like a science fiction movie because you seem to be able to see far into the distant future. Today's Solar Eclipse highlights your 11th House of Hopes and Dreams, enabling you to use your imagination to create the next phase of your life. You may be tempted to let your fantasies run wild, but you will be more successful if you keep reminding yourself to be practical while formulating your vision of tomorrow."
aries,2010-01-16,"You may be pleasantly surprised by how easy it is for you to get along with everyone now, but you have to be careful that your confidence doesn't turn into arrogance. Your words could carry more power than intended and others might secretly think you are bullying them. Luckily, your friends and associates will give you the benefit of the doubt, but you still must pay attention or you'll anger someone if you push too hard. Being gentler in your approach is your best strategy."
taurus,2010-01-16,"You have an unflappable sense of what needs to be done today and you don't waste any time getting started. But others may see your efforts as more show than substance now, which can make you angry. Even if you are irritated because you are being misunderstood, don't bother trying to convince anyone of your merit. Ultimately, your actions will speak for themselves."
gemini,2010-01-16,"It's nice to be feeling more positive about your plans for the future, but you still might run into a bit of opposition later in the day. But facing the problem head-on may not be the most useful strategy today, for that will only feed more stress into the situation. Don't let anyone else's negativity be cause for self-doubt. Avoid confrontation for now and continue on your way."
cancer,2010-01-16,"You may attempt to be carefree today, but you cannot be as adaptable as others might wish. It's challenging to act nonchalant when you can see through someone's facade so easily. Nevertheless, it's still not a smart idea to reveal the emperor's new clothing for what it is. Even if you are annoyed by the whole charade, it won't serve you to turn this into a big deal. It may be best to just let the whole thing pass quietly."
leo,2010-01-16,"You might be angry with someone you like now, but expressing your emotions in a direct manner could be difficult or even impossible today. Unfortunately, you are tempted to take your feelings out on a scapegoat who doesn't deserve your wrath, which could sour an amicable situation. Find a way to vent your negativity without stirring up resistance. Doing vigorous chores at home or sweating it out at the gym can, at least, reduce the stress."
virgo,2010-01-16,"It's important that you don't get too carried away with what you are doing today or you could exhaust yourself too soon. If you start a project and it becomes more work than you expected, make sure you know when to call it quits. You don't have to prove yourself now, even if you think that others may judge you as less than capable. Give it your best effort and then just walk away."
libra,2010-01-16,"You may go about your day with a chip on your shoulder, especially if you are confident about what you're doing now. But your attitude could stir up a bit of animosity from a family member or one of your friends. Keep in mind that there can be multiple points of view and yours is just one of them. If you attempt to prove that your approach is superior, you might experience more discord than is necessary."
scorpio,2010-01-16,"You are annoyed at someone who doesn't respect your boundaries today and it may be necessary to take a stand. For example, a roommate or neighbor might be overly noisy and inconsiderate of your needs. Even if you decide to take an adaptable approach and patiently anticipate a quieter time, your irritation could build to antagonism. Don't wait until it's too late; it's best to express your feelings now before you lose your temper."
sagittarius,2010-01-16,"You are not looking forward to doing everything the same way you usually do and could become quite determined to initiate change in your Saturday routine. Unfortunately, your lack of flexibility now could create an entirely new set of problems. Innovation is fine, but don't turn your life upside down just because you are bored and restless today."
capricorn,2010-01-16,"You have a new way of looking at what's important to you now, and your sudden change of priorities might cause some trouble. Although you take yourself quite seriously, someone else might think that you are just going out of your way to be weird today. Actually, you could come across as more contentious than you feel. It's in your best interest to moderate any extreme behavior; getting along with others now may require you to pay more attention to how you express yourself, rather than what you say."
aquarius,2010-01-16,"It's normally easier for you to be logical than emotional, but the Moon's visit to your sign can bring intense feelings to the surface now. You may not be fully in control as you bounce back and forth between your head and your heart. Once you have expressed your needs, you might overcompensate by acting in a cool, intellectual manner. Your hot-cold mood swings could confuse others, so do your best to find a rational middle-of-the-road approach."
pisces,2010-01-16,"You may think that you are the epitome of common sense today, yet it's possible that you have made an assumption based upon your desires rather than the facts. It's easy for you to inadvertently provoke a conflict as you defend your point of view. However, it's much smarter to listen to what you are being told now. When you get the details in order, everything else will fall into place."
aries,2010-01-17,"Your hopes for success were likely revived last year as bountiful Jupiter visited your 11th House of Long-Term Goals. Now, however, your objectives may gradually change as you seek to find deeper meaning in your life. Although you still have your aspirations, it's wise to take a bit of time for yourself and allow your past accomplishments to reverberate into the future."
taurus,2010-01-17,"You may have experienced career opportunities with Jupiter in your 10th House of Status last year. Now, as it enters your community-minded 11th House, you may become interested in expanding your involvement in a social cause. Because this is such a long-lasting transit, no immediate action is required; however, it's still a good idea to start thinking about the possibilities of social networking."
gemini,2010-01-17,"Last year you had a chance to plan, and maybe even embark on, a great adventure. Or perhaps you enrolled in an educational program to widen your professional horizons. But now as expansive Jupiter enters your 10th House of Career, it's time for you to concentrate on making the most out of potential opportunities at work. You may need to become more grounded in order to get ahead, but your intuition can still play an important role in helping you decide what to do next."
cancer,2010-01-17,"Confident Jupiter's entry into your 9th House of Big Ideas today can jump start your dreaming and scheming. You aren't willing now to wait for opportunity to knock on your door; you're eager to go out and find it, even if you need to take a risk to make something happen. But don't be in too much of a hurry. Be patient and let the gears of your imagination spin for a while before doing anything you might regret."
leo,2010-01-17,"Expansive Jupiter moves into your 8th House of Shared Resources today, urging you to be open to receiving financial assistance or spiritual guidance from others. Although this long-lasting transit could take months to have its full impact, you may receive an inheritance or an offer to invest in your future. It is one thing to know what you want, but you must be willing to accept it when it actually arrives."
virgo,2010-01-17,"Your partnership potential is looking good over the next several months as joyful Jupiter moves through your 7th House of Relationships. Although you may be disappointed if your expectations are unrealistic, it's more likely that someone special will enter your life and impact you in a positive manner. Whether you discover a mentor or a romance, exciting opportunities abound."
libra,2010-01-17,"Jovial Jupiter's move into your 6th House of Habits can create problems along with opportunities. Your exuberant approach to the day-to-day routine of life allows you to show others your most positive side. But it can also cause you to overlook the importance of handling the details of your schedule. Ultimately, your best strategy to accomplish your goals will be to focus on managing your time efficiently."
scorpio,2010-01-17,"If you became overly comfortable with your living situation last year, you would be wise to consider how you can reach out beyond the safety and security of home base. Exploring new avenues of creativity can bring more pleasure into your life as Jupiter visits your 5th House of Self-Expression. Instead of dreaming about the things you want to do, go out and do them."
sagittarius,2010-01-17,"Your key planet Jupiter enters your 4th House of Roots today, bringing growth to your life through your home and family. Instead of ambitiously seeking rewards from professional endeavors, the months ahead allow you to benefit from more personal interactions. Establishing a strong foundation will give you enough confidence to reach for your goals."
capricorn,2010-01-17,"While propitious Jupiter was in your 2nd House of Possessions last year, you may have had an opportunity to increase your personal financial holdings. But the real value of what you gained might have had more to do with your self-esteem. Now that Jupiter is entering your 3rd House of Communication, you must reach out beyond yourself and interact more with others. You have much to offer and much to learn, yet it's up to you to take the initiative."
aquarius,2010-01-17,"Bountiful Jupiter was in your sign last year, encouraging you to begin a new phase of your life. Now, it shifts into your 2nd House of Material Wealth, offering you opportunities to build upon what you have already started. Your chances for financial success will improve month by month through the spring, yet you'll need to use your common sense if you want to achieve your goals."
pisces,2010-01-17,"You are standing at the threshold of a new adventure as auspicious Jupiter enters your sign today. Although great changes may not occur overnight, your horizons will begin to expand and new opportunities for growth could appear at your door. Keep in mind that your attitude will make the difference between success and failure. You must be willing to risk a bit of security in order to begin your incredible journey."
aries,2010-01-18,"It's not easy to keep your feet planted on the ground today, for you might choose to follow an idealistic daydream filled with rainbows over the basic facts. Avoiding the truth may be tempting now, but you won't be able to escape reality by slipping into a parallel universe. Being one hundred percent authentic, however, will free you up so you can make creative use of your imagination without fooling yourself or anyone else."
taurus,2010-01-18,"You may feel torn between taking care of serious matters as they arise today and putting them off for a later time. Normally, your no-nonsense approach favors dealing with unfinished business right away, but now your ruling planet Venus in your responsible 10th House allows you to be more easygoing about when you do your work, as long as you get it done."
gemini,2010-01-18,"Although your life may seem overly complicated, you are less concerned about keeping it all together today. Maybe this is because likable Venus is now in fellow air sign Aquarius, enabling you to see the positive side of nearly any situation. Your upbeat attitude can contribute to your success if you don't take it too far by ignoring what is obvious. Focus on the truth instead of the easy way out."
cancer,2010-01-18,"Your intuition is functioning at a very high level of efficiency now that the Moon is back in a receptive water sign, especially with Jupiter also in fishy Pisces. But you might attempt to suppress your imagination if you think it's wiser to stick to the facts. The idea of having reliable data on which to build your plan isn't quite as good as it sounds. Information will only take you so far; your creativity can transport you to where you really want to go."
leo,2010-01-18,"Your need to delve into the unknown and discover what's going on beneath the surface now can be at odds with a more logical desire to step back from a complicated situation. Intellectually, you know that emotional detachment is healthy, but you cannot banish the fantasies of deeper intimacy from your mind. Keep in mind that you'll be happier if you can enjoy the rainbows without needing to find a pot of gold at the end of each one."
virgo,2010-01-18,"You are moving into a phase when work becomes more enjoyable now that sweet Venus is in your 6th House of Employment. You may have an opportunity to make new friends or even become romantically attracted to someone you meet through your job. But others could be more emotionally expressive than you prefer, provoking you to retreat. You'll be happier in the long run if you take your time and develop an enduring relationship rather than one that quickly comes and goes."
libra,2010-01-18,"Your key planet Venus, the goddess of love, enters your 5th House of Romance today and this can energize a current relationship or catalyze a new one. And although this is likely to be a joyful time, you could diminish your chances for happiness if you become overly emotional. Enjoy the fun and games without getting too serious about your feelings."
scorpio,2010-01-18,"You are developing an entirely new set of partnership needs, but you may not know the best way to get what you want. Although you might have had your heart set on an intense relationship, now compassion is overtaking passion as your top priority. Don't worry; this is just a passing phase that enables you to diminish excess emotional distractions so you can reconnect with your inner self."
sagittarius,2010-01-18,"Although this is a back-to-work day for many, you aren't quite ready to jump into the action. You are attracted to the camaraderie at work now, but it could be tough to get excited about much beyond the social distractions. Don't be too hard on yourself if you don't accomplish a lot today. You should have a chance to make up for your current lack of productivity later in the week."
capricorn,2010-01-18,"You might struggle with an inevitable shift of power because you are deeply invested in the status quo. Even if you see the advantage of shaking things up, it makes you nervous when there are too many unknowns. Keep in mind that you won't be able to stop the wheels of progress. Give yourself a few more days and then make up your mind to be a positive part of the change. Once you do, you can assume an important leadership role in the transformation."
aquarius,2010-01-18,"You might feel as if you have been granted a reprieve. You have more time now to reach your goals and you may be quite optimistic about your chances for success. Although you don't have to panic and get everything done right away, there's also no need to play it cool. Just listen to your instincts and let your charm do its magic. Following the course of least resistance today should work in your favor."
pisces,2010-01-18,"The Moon's return to your empathetic sign today offsets your desire to put up arbitrary walls that protect your insecurities. Isolating yourself from other people's feelings might make you lonely, while opening to love can ultimately heal old emotional wounds. Even if you must confront your own fears first, don't withdraw for the wrong reasons. Instead, find a way to decrease the distance between your heart and someone you trust."
aries,2010-01-19,"It may be difficult for you to get motivated today because you would rather lose yourself in a fantasy than take care of business. Your idle dreaming can be very useful, even if you simply give yourself enough time to recharge your batteries. But beyond being revitalized, you can untangle complex threads of interwoven feelings by allowing your mind to unwind. However, make an effort to write down your realizations before you forget them."
taurus,2010-01-19,"Leaning on your friends can be tempting, but you might discover that their responses to your call for help might be less than what you ultimately need now. Still, they will be supportive of your plan if you don't expect too much from them. You might not be able to avoid disappointment today, but you can increase your chances for success by being as self-sufficient as possible."
gemini,2010-01-19,"You might be a bit scattered if you try to be all things to all people today. It may be difficult for you to say no, but it's better to be honest upfront than to lead someone on indefinitely. Keep in mind that you could easily underestimate the time needed to finish a task, making it unwise now to trust your own judgment. Instead of making promises you cannot keep, let everyone know that you will simply do the best you can and leave it at that."
cancer,2010-01-19,"You can dream your way into the future, for tomorrow's reality begins as today's vision. But it's not good enough to just have a hunch and then let it go. Take control of your fantasies and fill them in with as much detail as you can now, for the more specific you are in your flights of fancy, the easier it will be to turn your thoughts into reality."
leo,2010-01-19,You may feel as if your actions are on a collision course with your dreams today when you finally see where you are going. But opening your eyes to the truth is just the beginning of an ongoing process for you. It's exciting to be unencumbered by the overwhelming weight of responsibility; now you must exercise your freedom and actually put yourself back on the most sensible path to your true goals.
virgo,2010-01-19,"Your innate love of perfection often places you ahead of the pack when it comes to high standards. You want to get it right. But today your unwillingness to accept anything less than the best can actually get in the way of your happiness, especially if you don't have the luxury of sufficient time. For the sake of expediency, don't be such a stickler over the details now. Although it may go against your grain, it's better to get the job done than to miss your current deadline."
libra,2010-01-19,"You optimistically believe that the future holds promise and you are willing to wait just a bit longer to receive the goodies that you want right now. Even if something goes wrong today, it's not difficult for you to see the potential of the moment. Your anticipation of better days ahead helps you stay positive; your cheerful attitude, in turn, increases your overall chances for success."
scorpio,2010-01-19,"Even if your work is stacked up now -- making it tough to know which way to turn next -- your smartest strategy may be to take a bit of time all to yourself. Slipping away from the pressures of your responsibilities for a while won't have a negative impact on your productivity. Paradoxically, doing something that you totally enjoy could actually enable you to complete your assignments faster than if you keep working into the night."
sagittarius,2010-01-19,"You might have conflicting emotions about what you want to do today. On one hand, you understand that it's crucial to follow through and deliver what others are expecting from you. On the other hand, you are tired of always being the one who has to ride to the rescue at the last minute and bail out everyone involved. This time you are tempted to just let it all fall apart. Obviously, abandonment isn't a smart idea. Once again, do your best and then call it a day."
capricorn,2010-01-19,It's uncharacteristically challenging for you to make an appointment and then show up for it today. This is not because of any irresponsibility on your part. It's just that you may avoid committing to a specific time because you think that it's more important than usual to remain flexible. But your compulsive need for extra fluidity now may be counterproductive. Ultimately you might discover that having a schedule will give your day the structure it needs.
aquarius,2010-01-19,"You may be sitting on the edge of your chair today because the anticipation in your life is increasing at a rapid rate. You've been waiting long enough; now you are ready to break out and make your move. Unfortunately, your path is not totally clear, which can make you nervous. You can minimize your anxiety by realizing that the pressure you are feeling comes from within. Take a few deep breaths and give yourself the extra time you need to figure out your best course of action."
pisces,2010-01-19,"If you don't want everyone to know what you're up to now, you might need to be very cautious about what you say. However, it's not just about your words because if you don't pay close attention to your actions, others still may be able to read your intentions as if you're an open book. Fortunately, you can contain your energy now by carefully monitoring your thoughts and consciously directing them into safe spaces. Be patient; you'll know when it's the right time to share."
aries,2010-01-20,"""Fools rush in"" and so do you, especially when the Moon returns to your impetuous sign. Unfortunately, your rash behavior could arouse an intense and unforgiving reaction from a co-worker or a friend. Instead of starting something you could quickly regret, waiting until tomorrow may be a smarter strategy. If it still seems like a good idea, then confidently go ahead with your plan."
taurus,2010-01-20,"You could get annoyed with yourself if you want to start a new project at work today, but find sufficient reasons to talk yourself out of doing anything. Even if waiting is the most sensible approach, your frustration level still might rise. Keep in mind that it's better to listen to the voice of logic than to push ahead only to run into insurmountable resistance."
gemini,2010-01-20,"You are finally spending more time looking ahead than reconsidering your recent past. However, you may still have to overcome a formidable obstacle before you can actually put your plans into action. Don't even think about avoiding the source of the current resistance, for it will only resurface with greater intensity. Take your time and swallow the bitter medicine, if necessary. Once you learn your lesson, you'll be able to take the next step towards your future."
cancer,2010-01-20,"Domestic responsibilities might conflict with the demands of work today. You may feel as if you are caught in the middle of strong opposing forces and that you'll let someone down, whichever choice you make. There is, however, a viable alternative. Hold your ground without choosing between your home and your job. Acknowledge their mutual importance while doing your best balancing act for now."
leo,2010-01-20,"You may be feeling more confident today, especially if you have something exciting coming up. But your plans may be complicated by others who don't seem to understand your needs now. Try not to place too much reliance for support on anyone else. However, don't turn down assistance if it's offered, even if you think you can be self-sufficient. Learning to receive help graciously may not be easy, yet it's surely worth the trouble."
virgo,2010-01-20,"Personal and business relationships can be quite complex these days and you might rather avoid entanglement as much as you can. Showing your vulnerability doesn't sound like a smart move to you now, but you may be more dependent on others than you are willing to admit. Acknowledge any resistance you are feeling; your upfront honesty could defuse a potentially difficult situation."
libra,2010-01-20,"It's no fun when anyone pushes his or her way into your day and tries to convince you to change your mind. You may feel as if your space has been invaded, yet you really don't want to waste energy today defending your territory. Nevertheless, you still may be dragged into a conflict that you wanted to avoid. Luckily, once you stand up for yourself, the antagonism should quickly dissipate."
scorpio,2010-01-20,"You know that you need to step up to the plate at work and courageously do the best you can. But you cannot suppress the awful feeling that you are being judged by others who don't appreciate what you are trying to do. There is no doubt about it; you must overcome resistance now -- yours or someone else's. In either case, sidestepping the issues will feel like defeat. On the other hand, you'll be quite proud of yourself once you respond successfully to the current situation."
sagittarius,2010-01-20,"Although the day may begin slowly, your creativity suddenly comes alive with a burst of energy. You are not inclined toward self-restraint; pushing yourself to the max can be quite exhilarating. Nevertheless, there's a price to pay for putting out too much of yourself all at once. Set a steady pace or you will be exhausted before you finish what you started."
capricorn,2010-01-20,"You are struggling now with finding the right balance between being patient and asserting yourself. You certainly don't want to miss your chance by waiting too long. On the other hand, no one will support your aggressive behavior if you come on too strong. Instead of trying to decide your strategy on your own today, be smart and ask someone older and wiser for a bit of sage advice."
aquarius,2010-01-20,"You might actually believe that you'll be able to slip through the day without making many waves. But once you get on a roll, you may turn a few people's lives upside down. You could set a pace for yourself that would wear anyone else out. But you are riding an adrenaline high and may not care. Be cautious, for you, too, might not be able to keep up with your crazy calendar, even if you think you can."
pisces,2010-01-20,"Although you might feel persistent resistance from a powerful friend or ally, it's crucial that you continue to push toward your goals. However, reaching your destination today is not as important as heading in the right direction. Don't be disappointed if something takes longer than you expected. As long as your intentions are in line with your values, the results should ultimately bring real satisfaction."
aries,2010-01-21,"You may be quite enthused about accomplishing your goals today and, luckily, your optimism is likely well founded. It appears as if it will be easy to get your work done, but the harder you push, the longer everything seems to take. Instead of forcing your agenda on others, ease off and let events unfold naturally. Paradoxically, you could reach your destination faster once you slow down."
taurus,2010-01-21,"The first flush of excitement passes quickly today, leaving you with a more realistic plan of attack. Instead of attempting to overwhelm someone who is resisting your efforts, let your own stubbornness work in your favor now. Impatience can backfire on you by provoking strong defensive reactions from others. Focus on your long-term strategy; time is on your side."
gemini,2010-01-21,"You are often of two minds and today is no exception. One of the Twins is barraging you with reasons to take immediate action. This inner voice raises fears that if you don't do something drastic right away, you'll lose your chance. Meanwhile, the other Twin cautions you in a soothing voice, telling you to wait for a better time. Ultimately, it's wiser to hold off as long as possible and then give it your best shot."
cancer,2010-01-21,"Acting impulsively is often difficult for you, unless you're feeling very secure. Although a burst of excitement today may be invigorating, it also worries you because you don't know what you might do next. Luckily, you are able to come down from your adrenaline rush, which should help you to sustain your energy. Remember, nurturing connections with those you love can be just as important as maintaining productivity."
leo,2010-01-21,"Although today's presentation of your point of view can be quite a show, there is real substance behind your performance. Your playful feline approach can disarm others, giving them no logical reason to put up their defenses. Meanwhile, your subtle persistence is relentless. Talking up a storm is fine; just remember to take your time when following your heart's desires."
virgo,2010-01-21,"It's easy for you to fall into a place of self-criticism because your current impulsive behavior doesn't appear to be moving you any closer to your goals. In fact, you could inadvertently push someone special further away by saying too much or coming on too strong. Don't be impatient. Taking lots of little steps works better now than one giant leap."
libra,2010-01-21,"You may feel as if you are in a playful tug-of-war with a friend, yet the game could turn more serious before you know it. But there's really no need for animosity, even if the underlying tension is thick. Fortunately, you are more interested in making love than war. Even if there's no romance involved, focus on creating common ground and the pleasurable feelings will soon return."
scorpio,2010-01-21,Your actions demonstrate one thing while your unexpressed desires offer a different story. It appears that you are fully engaged in your current work and you can be quite productive now. But you are yearning for something different and may not be ready to share your vision with anyone else yet. There's no hurry; keep your dreams to yourself until they are solid enough to talk about.
sagittarius,2010-01-21,"Today may be filled with fun activities and ample opportunities for you to show your good-natured side to everyone. You probably don't need to do a whole lot of planning right now; just living in the present moment seems to work fine. But later in the day you might realize that your pleasures were transitory. Don't resist taking a more serious path just because it's not as exciting. If you maintain a positive attitude, the rewards should follow."
capricorn,2010-01-21,"You are easily excitable today and need to pay attention to how you handle your emotions or they can get in the way of your efficiency. Too much excitement creates anxiety, while moderating your feelings helps you to be more confident and productive. Take time to consider what your real goals are, separate from current professional demands. Remember, it's easier to put forth extra effort when you are working for something you love."
aquarius,2010-01-21,"It's all about you today and, fortunately, you can feel quite satisfied as long as you aren't overly impatient. But it may seem as if you should be able to get whatever you want right now. However, as you work toward your goals, you may realize that it's going to take longer than you thought. Don't be discouraged. You have a lot going for you now and it's crucial that you maintain a good attitude or you could jeopardize the positive outcome."
pisces,2010-01-21,"You are fired up at work today and could be quite productive once you put your mind to accomplishing something very specific. Although you sometimes avoid getting too involved in the details, you are able to maintain a high level of concentration now. Even if you know there are significant challenges ahead, stay focused on applying yourself in the present moment, without being overly distracted by what's around the next corner."
aries,2010-01-22,"There could be many different things going on within your mind and in your environment today. The fiery Aries Moon encourages you to take on the day with zest. You are eager to do everything, but events are unfolding at their own rate now and demand that you slow down. There's no bolting ahead on your own schedule, so respond to any delays as gracefully as you can and enjoy the present moment for what it offers."
taurus,2010-01-22,"It's not that you are overjoyed by having to hold your horses today while waiting for something you want, but it's a tradeoff that you're willing to make now. You are close to success and you can feel it in your gut, but you're not quite there yet. The results will be worth it if you are willing to sit tight a while longer."
gemini,2010-01-22,"You may feel as if the weekend is still far away because you could be so bored at work now that you can't keep still. Finishing your work early won't help; you'll have to wait for the clock to catch up to you anyhow. Instead of making yourself frustrated by thinking about what you would rather be doing, bring your attention back to the present and find fulfillment in the moment."
cancer,2010-01-22,"Others are depending on you now and although you want to do your best, you also might resent them for having unreasonable expectations. Naturally, you enjoy nurturing those you love, but you don't like it when your needs go unnoticed. Stop looking for someone else to blame; it's time to take charge of your life and take care of yourself."
leo,2010-01-22,"You have something special to smile about today. Even if you don't have everything you want in your life, it's great to know that your patience will pay off. Blindly pinning your hopes on a better future isn't a smart strategy, while taking direct action is a wise thing to do. Remember, you don't need to turn your life upside down; just making concrete plans is enough for now."
virgo,2010-01-22,"Being busy, along with the satisfaction of a job well done, puts you in a good mood today. You aren't even that concerned if others don't realize how much you contribute. For now, it's about meeting your own standards of high quality. Luckily, your low-key approach will eventually work to your advantage and your extra effort will be acknowledged and appreciated."
libra,2010-01-22,"You are so skilled at being gracious that sometimes your greatest challenge is acknowledging what you need. Today, however, you know exactly what you want and would be wise to ask for it. But keep in mind that being vulnerable has its downside and you might have to wait for satisfaction. Nevertheless, if you express yourself nicely, your chances for success are favorable."
scorpio,2010-01-22,"It's now time to seek new ways to attack old problems. Rather than doing your tasks in the same old way, an original approach allows you to gain a fresh perspective on your daily routine. But don't try to shake up everything all at once. Working quietly, and maybe even behind the scenes, will enable you to make steady progress toward feeling more secure about your job."
sagittarius,2010-01-22,"Although you might prefer to take the day off to have a good time, you can derive a deep satisfaction from working with others today. There is a special camaraderie that comes from being part of a team, yet you may need to subdue your independent streak that encourages you to do your own thing. Instead of withdrawing, express your individuality by bringing an original point of view to the group process."
capricorn,2010-01-22,"Lovely Venus is aligning with your key planet Saturn today, bringing something or someone wonderful into your life. You may have an opportunity to invest in a business that could make you some extra cash. Or perhaps a romantic interest is kindled or revitalized. Whether it's money or love, remember that you'll need to be patient. Success and happiness won't happen overnight."
aquarius,2010-01-22,"This can be quite a busy day, especially if you believe that you must complete your work before the weekend. Unfortunately, you may not finish everything you start. Don't take it personally; it's not necessarily a reflection on your efforts. Acknowledge that some things are simply beyond your control and be content with doing the best you can in the current circumstances."
pisces,2010-01-22,"You may be tired of the daily grind and now want to retreat into your own private space. Even if you must be around others today, you're likely to feel more withdrawn than usual. But this doesn't have to be a problem because you can continue to do your job while also attending to your more private thoughts. Don't make a big deal of it; just do your work while keeping your personal matters to yourself."
aries,2010-01-23,"Instead of trying to make changes to your schedule or rushing off to start something entirely new, it makes more sense today to stick with the tried and true. You could become a little restless if everything seems too familiar, but it's better to deal with your anxiety by changing your attitude rather than messing with your environment. Once you decide to settle into the day, things should get easier all around."
taurus,2010-01-23,"The Moon's return to your sign can be like a breath of fresh air. But you could be so concerned with getting your way today that you close down and forget to breathe. Even if you are having misgivings about the course of events, they may be out of your control. Instead of increasing your frustration by attempting to change that which is unchangeable, remind yourself to exhale and inhale deeply to prevent your energy from becoming stagnant."
gemini,2010-01-23,"You may not be your regular talkative self today because you want to keep some energy in reserve. This is a smart strategy for you now because there are situations that require your serious attention and it can be problematic if you wear yourself out too early in the game. Instead of putting your effort into making things happen socially, use this time to relax so you can feel rejuvenated for what's ahead."
cancer,2010-01-23,"This could be an ideal day to spend some quiet time socializing with friends, but don't worry needlessly about filling in all the details in advance. You may have some anxiety because you want to know exactly what you will be doing later, but ultimately it will be more enjoyable if you leave things unstructured now. You may be pleasantly surprised at how everything unfolds. The less you plan, the more relaxed you'll be throughout the day."
leo,2010-01-23,"You could work yourself into a corner today because you know how you want your day to unfold. In fact, you are counting on things going exactly according to your plan. But the cosmos may have a slightly different idea about what will happen and it's just not worth fighting for your way. You may be able to force reality into your scheme, but you could exhaust yourself doing so. Instead, be smart and relax your control. You'll be able to regain it later on."
virgo,2010-01-23,"This could be an easygoing day if you don't make yourself busy with unnecessary work. Instead of simply shifting into automatic and starting on your regular list of chores, consider which tasks are non-essential and leave those for another day. Even if you are a typical hardworking Virgo, think about taking some time off today just for yourself."
libra,2010-01-23,"You have an original way of approaching life today, but that doesn't mean you'll be able to put your ideas into motion. It's not that you are being blocked; it's just that you aren't confident enough to push your big plan uphill against the prevailing currents. Actually, you are wise to enjoy yourself now and be creative rather than productive. Save the hard work for another day when the going isn't so rough."
scorpio,2010-01-23,"It's no fun if someone agrees with you in word, but then resists everything you do. It's as if there is a split between the mental and physical universe and this can be quite frustrating. Unfortunately, you won't be able to solve this dilemma today, but you can still be quite content if you simply make a decision to let it be for now. Instead of forcing integration between mind and matter, simply be a witness to what's happening."
sagittarius,2010-01-23,"You may not be able to accomplish your goals today, but part of the problem stems from taking on too much. You can visualize the big picture and therefore think that you must extend yourself beyond your immediate environment. But there's no easy way to get there from here. You will be happier now if you focus only on the most practical things you can do, even if that means reaching your destination another day."
capricorn,2010-01-23,"Those who think that you don't know how to enjoy yourself should follow you around today so you can prove them wrong. Although you may have to struggle to get your way now, you are still able to focus on having fun. If someone has a different idea of what you should be doing now, don't bother defending your actions. Just get on with your plans and make things happen the way you want them to."
aquarius,2010-01-23,"The same things that might have created a meltdown in your life previously don't seem to affect you very much today. The unresolved issues are still there; it's just that you have a firm inner resolve now that won't be pulled off track. Keep your eyes focused on the distance. You will reach your goal if you don't let yourself become distracted, even if it takes more time than you wish."
pisces,2010-01-23,You are ready to settle in to your weekend routine and you look forward to a bit of peace and quiet. But it may take extra effort on your part to overcome a few obstacles that stand in your way of satisfaction. You won't find happiness by forcing your position on others. It's better to step back from a potential conflict until you are ready to talk about your feelings in a calmer manner.
aries,2010-01-24,"Although you are well known for being able to be in the here-and-now, the present moment is always transforming into the next, which can make you very impatient. Today, however, you appear to have all the time in the world and are content with the status quo. But don't get too lazy because the work you do now can have enduring positive consequences."
taurus,2010-01-24,Your feet are planted squarely on the ground today and there's not much that can throw you off course. There is a certain safety in knowing exactly where you stand and where you are going next. Don't waste your energy trying to make sense out of something you don't understand. Focus on what you can perceive now and leave the conjecturing and dreaming for another day.
gemini,2010-01-24,"You actually find pleasure in being serious today because you want others to know that you can be a deep thinker. Sometimes you are content with being known as the one who is the first to speak up with a witty or funny comment. However, now it's not about being the cleverest one in the room. Slowing down your responses will help to demonstrate that you are contemplating your answers before you speak."
cancer,2010-01-24,"Although you might attempt to act independently today, you cannot escape from your current emotional entanglements so easily. You feel a profound sense of duty when it comes to your family and friends, making it nearly unthinkable to do something that creates a gulf between you and any of them. Nevertheless, try to expand your repertoire and consider pushing the boundaries just a little bit. You can still be there for others while you are also stretching and growing."
leo,2010-01-24,"You are feeling more secure about your relationships today, even if there isn't much to talk about. It's as if your jaunt on the emotional rollercoaster has slowly come to an end and now you must integrate the wild ups and downs you experienced. The thrills may be temporarily over, but rest assured that there are still more rides to take before your journey is done."
virgo,2010-01-24,"You might feel a bit uneasy now if your day doesn't unfold on schedule. Although you still could complete all the projects you initially set out to do, something big gnaws away at the back of your mind. It can be frustrating because you know that whatever is bothering you will take more than just a day to handle. Don't beat yourself up; you are human and must accept the imperfections and limitations of life along with everyone else."
libra,2010-01-24,"It's tempting for you to act annoyed when dealing with others who think they know it all, but expressing your frustration won't likely improve your day. You could inadvertently provoke a friend or family member to become even more obstinate. If someone close to you digs in his or her heels, don't try to move them. It's not your job to change anyone's mind today. It's smarter now just to work on your own issues and let your actions say it all."
scorpio,2010-01-24,"You would prefer to set an even pace to your routine that will enable you to accomplish the things you must do in the days and weeks ahead, but it's not that simple. Intellectually, you know that you cannot make anyone else move any faster than they are going, even if it would make your life simpler. Instead of worrying about something that's beyond your control, do what you can in the immediate moment to continue your own progress. Your persistence will be rewarded."
sagittarius,2010-01-24,"You could have a real sense of satisfaction today if you concentrate on finishing whatever project you start. This means that you'll need to set realistic goals, make a plan for the day and then follow through with your good intentions. Anything done without using your common sense now will likely backfire and complicate your life."
capricorn,2010-01-24,"This is a propitious day because the Sun harmoniously trines your ruling planet Saturn in your 10th House of Status. However, don't expect too much because karmic Saturn can delay the positive outcome for several weeks, as it moves through its retrograde cycle. Nevertheless, it's crucial that you do the very best you can in whatever you undertake now, for others will notice your diligence and the rewards will follow."
aquarius,2010-01-24,"While others may be acting irresponsibly in your eyes, you are taking care of serious matters as the Sun in your sign forms an easy trine with stoic Saturn. There is no room for sentimentality because everything you do now counts extra. Even if you must apply yourself more than you want today, it will be worth it in the long run. Don't miss this chance to do something that truly matters."
pisces,2010-01-24,"It's hard to know whether it's smarter today to be as practical as possible or if you can get away with taking a bit of downtime. Ultimately, your best strategy is to combine hard work with a bit of escape. But make sure you get the sequence right by meeting your responsibilities first, before you indulge your senses or your fantasies."
aries,2010-01-25,"Everything is jumping today and you are not sure whether you like it or not. The high-frequency energy is not necessarily good for productivity because you are a bit scattered as you attempt to juggle too many activities at once. At first it seems like fun, but then your amusement could turn to dismay when you cannot keep up with what you started. Do yourself a favor now and don't try to fit so much into your day."
taurus,2010-01-25,"You want to do something that is out of the ordinary today, but it's wise to think twice before you stir up more problems than you need. Finding an outlet for your restless energy could help to relieve your temptation to agitate an already imbalanced situation. If you are wondering whether or not your plan is a good one, it's best to wait until tomorrow when your thinking will be more rational."
gemini,2010-01-25,"The Moon's return to your sign today reminds you that you have more options than you previously realized. Although this is an exciting prospect, it also poses problems of its own, for you might not be able to decide which course of action makes the most sense. Don't waste energy spinning your wheels trying to force an answer now, for it probably won't be the right one unless it comes to you easily. Wait for your intuition to guide you in the right direction."
cancer,2010-01-25,"Your mind is buzzing with original ideas, but you are wise to keep them to yourself today because you may not be able to explain yourself very well. Instead of trying to convince anyone now that your plan really could work, just quietly concentrate on making it happen. Once you have some positive results to show for your efforts, others will be more likely to roll up their sleeves and jump in to support you."
leo,2010-01-25,"Your attempts to make headway on a variety of projects may be stymied today for several different reasons. Although you have good intentions and a lot of energy, you could end up feeling frustrated unless you can focus on one thing at a time. If you have a hard time focusing, give yourself a break and take it easy for a bit before trying again."
virgo,2010-01-25,"Current circumstances test your ability to multitask and you could come through with flying colors if you look at it as a game. But if you take yourself too seriously today, you're likely to sabotage your efforts because of a fear of failure. However, if you aren't overly attached to the outcome, it might seem as if time slows down, enabling you to complete everything right on schedule."
libra,2010-01-25,"You may be in a playful mood today even if you have a lot of work to do. Thankfully, your lighthearted attitude allows you to overcome obstacles with finesse. Spend some time making plans for an upcoming trip or vacation. It doesn't matter if it's only a night on the town; just having something fun on your calendar will help you to focus on what you have to do right now."
scorpio,2010-01-25,"You are a bundle of paradoxes today as you strive for depth and intensity while maintaining a casual approach with others. Although you can appear to be enjoying yourself, those who know you will be able to sense the uneasiness that lurks just beneath your surface. Nevertheless, it's still wise for you to think about the consequences of what you intend to say before you speak. Remember, your unedited words could open Pandora's Box, which may be better off left closed for now."
sagittarius,2010-01-25,"Everyone appears restless today, which only contributes to your current lack of concentration. Although you may start the day knowing exactly what you are going to do, one thing after another distracts you and leads you on a series of detours. But don't blame this entirely on others; if you weren't so fidgety it would be much easier to stay on track. Instead of worrying about what isn't getting done, just do what you can and, if necessary, complete your work tomorrow."
capricorn,2010-01-25,"After a rather serious weekend, you are feeling a bit irresponsible, even if you have pressing obligations. It's not that you won't attempt to do what you should, but you may become bored by the required level of concentration. Your thoughts are moving at light speed and they just don't seem to fit into the narrow confines of your day. Don't beat yourself up if you cannot hold your focus; things will quickly return to normal in the next few days."
aquarius,2010-01-25,"You may not make a whole lot of sense to your friends and co-workers today, but then again, you might not care. You could be on an individuality kick now and want to do everything differently than everyone else. It's fine to demonstrate your independence, but you can take it too far. Moderating your brilliance with a touch of practicality will enhance your life instead of just turning it upside down."
pisces,2010-01-25,"You are quite clear about what you want now, but as soon as you open your mouth to share your thoughts with your friends, the mists encompass your thinking and turn your plan into an idle fantasy. Part of the problem is that you don't know when to stop talking. Remember, the fewer words you speak today, the more precise they will sound to others."
aries,2010-01-26,"You may think that you have a way with words today that will get you whatever you want. But even if you are quick-witted and charming, you still can come across as being too aggressive for the situation. Tone it down or you could possibly offend someone without even realizing what you have done. Practice patience and consider other people's feelings before thinking of yourself."
taurus,2010-01-26,"Even if you have been maintaining a steady pace, it's more challenging today for you to keep on task. It's not because you are distracted; rather your thinking may be running on overdrive trying to figure out the fastest way to get things done. However, not being able to keep up with your work can make you feel less confident. Don't worry about why your job takes you so long when others seem to finish faster at whatever they do. Your strength is not your speed; it's the power of your determination."
gemini,2010-01-26,"Your key planet Mercury is good for a surprise or two today, so it might be difficult for you to plan too far in advance. Luckily, you are able to tap dance around the edges of uncertainty as well as anyone and now this can work to your advantage. While others are trying to figure out what went wrong, you are engaging the moment with intelligence and brilliantly making it up as you go along."
cancer,2010-01-26,"Your plans for the future might require a sudden overhaul today, even if you thought they were looking pretty good. Luckily, once all the facts are placed on the table, you can easily see the emerging patterns, enabling you to put everything in a sensible order. Nevertheless, being brilliant isn't enough now; you must also be willing to share your ideas to make your dreams come true."
leo,2010-01-26,"You are tired of the status quo and may be inclined to do something besides talking about how much you need a change. Words come too easily to you, even if they are provoked by your frustration. Fortunately, you have friends who will listen to what you say. Unfortunately, they might not truly understand the source of your current malaise. Trust that your actions will speak more convincingly than your words ever could."
virgo,2010-01-26,"Talk is cheap and others may grow weary of your promises today once they see you fall short of your target. You certainly mean well when you commit to your end of the deal, but you are now more willing than you are able to perform up to your own extreme expectations. Don't put too much energy into any one relationship, and if a pending agreement doesn't sound right, walk away from it for a few days before picking it up again."
libra,2010-01-26,"You are feeling a new wave of tension rolling in today, but hopefully the carrot that is dangling in front of you is large enough to hold your attention. Resolve petty differences between you and your sweetheart now before they grow into an unapproachable mess. Stop making excuses in the name of love; you have work to do and you better get started."
scorpio,2010-01-26,"You are fully capable of surprising others and even yourself today, as you arrive at a totally new answer to a previously unanswered question. Following through with your own advice isn't always the easiest thing to do, but it's a lot wiser than any of the alternatives in the long run. The time to hesitate is over."
sagittarius,2010-01-26,"You are feeling a bit out of sorts today as the flippant Gemini Moon moves through your 7th House of Partnerships. It's not that you intend to offend anyone -- of course, you don't. Nevertheless, your need for the truth will likely outweigh other desires, so don't bother wasting any energy on anything that diminishes your spirit. Just remember to be compassionate to others while you are on your journey of self-discovery."
capricorn,2010-01-26,"You could experience information overload at work today as everyone appears to want you as their confidant. Although you are willing to perform this role for a special person or two, you really aren't interested in giving everyone your shoulder to cry on. Learn how to say no gracefully so you can establish boundaries between your professional and personal life."
aquarius,2010-01-26,"You might feel a bit like a mad scientist today because your innovative thinking sounds ungrounded when you try to explain it to anyone else. You are not interested in simply being of entertainment value now; instead, you are resolved to uncover the key solution that allows everyone to break through the old restraints."
pisces,2010-01-26,"Your friends have something crucial to tell you and you better listen carefully now, or you could miss an important fork in the road. If you aren't paying close attention, you'll continue down the same path you have been traveling, whether or not it's the best option. Even when doors begin to open, it is still your choice about which ones to walk through. Heed the advice you are given today and choose wisely."
aries,2010-01-27,"Friendly Venus is tugging on your heartstrings from individualistic Aquarius today and you might not know which way to turn. You aren't happy about being vulnerable, and you would rather be independent of the responsibilities that come along with a relationship. But you are aware of the potential for transformation, even if it means expressing yourself in ways that may not be fully comfortable. Remember, you cannot use logic to rationalize your actions now. Just follow your heart."
taurus,2010-01-27,"Feisty Mars in your 4th House of Security opposes your key planet Venus in your 10th House of Career today, possibly provoking you to unconsciously strike out at someone who loves you. Your unexpressed anger doesn't have to become the main focus of the day, but it gains importance until you untangle your obligations. Once you clarify your personal and professional responsibilities you'll be able to respond more sensibly."
gemini,2010-01-27,"Your life feels as if it's slowing down, but you may wish for a return to the simplistic noise from the more complex quietness. You might as well get used to the silence now because you cannot go back to the past. Be extra careful to avoid an extreme emotional outburst today, or you could inadvertently provoke others to overreact as well."
cancer,2010-01-27,"The Moon's return to your sign today is the start of something new, even if you aren't ready to leap yet. Fortunately, you can buy yourself a little time now as long as you are watching your pocketbook. But without the funds, you'll only make yourself more frustrated because you won't be able to afford what you want to do. Don't push too hard; if you are running into resistance, just go home and try again tomorrow."
leo,2010-01-27,"You are tempted by something or someone today, inspiring you to act more spontaneously. However, being in the moment isn't the only thing that is important now; relationships also require you to project into the future. Ultimately, it may be wiser to keep your needs quiet and tell others about them some other day."
virgo,2010-01-27,You may be happy if the pressure in your life is decreasing and that your experiences have taught you as much as they did. You have the opportunity now to integrate your feelings into your social interactions. Trusting others enough to freely share your heart is the greatest gift possible. Don't miss this chance to let someone special past your defensive walls.
libra,2010-01-27,"You may face a stressful dilemma when the hypersensitive Cancer Moon aspects several planets today. At first you might have attempted to make light of what you endured. Now, however, your defenses are too strong for anyone to break through. You'll feel better if you work more on letting others into your heart and less on trying to look good."
scorpio,2010-01-27,"Relief is on the way now, or so it seems. But there will be no angels riding to your rescue tonight, so you better take care of yourself the best you can. Luckily, you are quite capable of following your intuition and it won't likely steer you wrong today. Don't worry about what you cannot control. Take things as they come and respond from your heart and not your head."
sagittarius,2010-01-27,"If you want a sound reason for everything that happens to you now, you will need to face your disappointment sooner than you think. The quick and easy explanations aren't forthcoming today, turning up the intensity of your frustrations. But the real source of your discontent is not about what you didn't get. It's about being coerced into exploring the boundaries of intimacy when you would prefer not to acknowledge your own confusing emotions."
capricorn,2010-01-27,"The Moon's current visitation to your 7th House of Relationships warms up the fires of romance, especially if you are attracted to someone with potential. But you may become annoyed if your partner withdraws just when you are ready to engage the alluring energies. Instead of fearfully pushing and demanding more today, chill out and relax. Your sense of urgency isn't as pressing as it seems now."
aquarius,2010-01-27,"You may not be able to get through the day without having to deal with a relationship meltdown. Jumping right in to help people handle an emotional scene might be unavoidable since you won't be able to stop the inevitable. Instead of wasting too much energy on other people's dramas, quietly get to work and be as productive as possible."
pisces,2010-01-27,"You are ready for a day of fun-filled activities, but you won't likely be allowed to go off and amuse yourself until you have met your obligations. You might even feel peer pressure from your friends to keep working. Don't give up on the idea of pleasure today; you still might be able to take a break as long as you come back to finish your responsibilities with replenished vitality."
aries,2010-01-28,"You may go out of your way to demonstrate that you are free from emotional attachments today, but there is a problem with this approach. Little events throughout the day remind you how deeply you love your family. You realize that it's your choice and you can easily avoid upsetting your security by reining in your unrestrained behavior. Be careful; you could be so annoyed by the power that someone has over you that you could push that person further away."
taurus,2010-01-28,"A clash with someone at work can be avoided today, but it will take some restraint on your part. You might feel as if others are baiting you, but it's your own worries that can create the biggest problems now. Instead of blaming anyone else for your lack of confidence, consider what you can do to boost your self-esteem. Remember, change won't happen overnight."
gemini,2010-01-28,"You might have a very challenging time explaining your feelings today as communicator Mercury is opposed by the hypersensitive Moon. Although you know what you want to say, the words just don't come out the way you hear them in your head. Make sure you don't jump around from topic to topic now because you could easily leave others in the dust. But if you tell your story succinctly, it could just as well leave a positive impression."
cancer,2010-01-28,"You are overly sensitive today and may retreat in order to honor your own need for boundaries. Being around other people can be overwhelming now and it's just not worth the effort to push yourself at this time. But if you cannot get out of a social obligation, don't focus on your annoyance or it could turn into resentment. Instead, cheerfully do what you must, postponing your quiet time until you can be alone. You might be surprised at how you end up feeling by the end of the day."
leo,2010-01-28,"You know that it's time to make changes to your daily routine, but you probably can't imagine how great this shift will be. One thing is apparent, though; even if it takes months, you are willing to do whatever must be done in order to see yourself through this transition. Even if you want everything to happen right away, there are circumstances beyond your control that must reach their conclusion before you can take your next step."
virgo,2010-01-28,"You may feel as if you are stuck in a situation and want to break free, whatever the cost. You have spent enough time considering your options; now you are ready for action. Forcing change today is not recommended because the security-conscious Cancer Moon is in your 11th House of Long-Term Goals. Although you can see that the potential benefits outweigh the risks, you are not likely to follow through with your plan yet. Be wise and maintain the status quo for a little while longer."
libra,2010-01-28,You may feel a bit anxious today without knowing why you cannot settle down. Your nervous energy might not be tied to a single real world event; it may be related to a larger and more complex set of circumstances. Don't look for the quick fix because that will only put off the inevitable for a few days. Take your time and find a healthy way to relax.
scorpio,2010-01-28,"You may be digging in your heels and holding out for what you need, but the final outcome of your current strategy is not dependent on you being stubborn now. In fact, your inflexibility can complicate things and push you even farther away from your destination. Don't be so sure that you know what you want. The more you remain open to compromise now, the better you'll feel about the situation."
sagittarius,2010-01-28,"It's disheartening to know that you are ready to embark on a great journey now, but you haven't even bought a ticket. There are too many demands on your time now for you to be seriously thinking about just leaving on the spur of the moment. Be patient and don't let go of your dreams; work out all the details before you make your move."
capricorn,2010-01-28,"You may be pressured to make a serious career decision now, but you would be wise to delay making it for a few more days, if possible. Your current uncertainty could pull your thinking into a more cautious pattern, encouraging you to make a choice that you could quickly regret. You do not have all the facts yet, so give yourself extra time until you are sure that you know what's really going on."
aquarius,2010-01-28,"The Sun in eclectic Aquarius is zapped by shocking Uranus today, encouraging you to take impulsive action despite your current underlying resistance to change. If your workmates try to talk you out of your decision, you only become more determined to do it your way. But this is no time for foolish obstinacy because you can easily reduce the stress by meeting someone halfway, even if you'd rather not."
pisces,2010-01-28,"You are still attempting to process a lot of information that recently came into your life, but it's not easy to integrate so much all at once. Nevertheless, you may feel as if you have a deadline that is quickly approaching. Unfortunately, this can be a study in frustration. Ask a trusted friend for help, so at least you have someone else to listen to your story. Any additional feedback you receive at this time will move you closer to your destination."
aries,2010-01-29,"Your key planet Mars is opposite the Sun now, but Mars is currently retrograde, making it even harder for you to swing into action. Just as you're ready to begin a new project, a wave of anger can sweep over you and take your day by surprise. You don't need to wait any longer; now is the time to sprint toward your destination. Focusing your attention on reaching your goals will likely dissipate any unnecessary negativity."
taurus,2010-01-29,"Making a premature move might not seem like your style, but you are so impatient today that you'll do something without thinking about the consequences of your actions. You could get so worked up about what you want to do at work that you are willing to jeopardize the stability of your job for a chance at success. Go for it, but don't create a scene that you will later regret."
gemini,2010-01-29,"You might want to make a big show about finding your center today because you want everyone to see how dynamic you can be in a tough situation. But you could be so excited that you inadvertently work someone else into a frenzy. Step back from the craziness and take a few deep breaths. When you are ready, give it your best shot one more time."
cancer,2010-01-29,"You are driven to take on a financial project today, but the closer you get to starting it, the less inclined you are to do it. You may not have enough stamina to finish much of anything now, so don't waste energy that could be crucial to your well-being later. Just remember that there is a lot going on, so prioritize your tasks before you begin and not after."
leo,2010-01-29,"You may not be very happy as warrior Mars in your sign faces off with the Sun. You could feel as if you are like a kettle that's nearly boiling, yet you are too close to the situation to be able to develop the perspective that you want. Unfortunately, it's too long to wait for Mars to turn direct in March, so grab the energy while you can and apply it constructively to your life."
virgo,2010-01-29,"You might not want to see many people that you know today, and your tendency could be to withdraw. But this isn't the healthiest response because your presence is required now. Consider performing your social duties while still leaving time for yourself. You'll be able to do it all if you don't get lost in your fantasies along the way."
libra,2010-01-29,"Everything seems to be getting more complicated again, especially if your friends are making demands on you that raise your anger. You don't want to be pushed around and are likely to step into the game fighting mad. It's best for others to leave you alone now, unless they are willing to put up with playing according to your rules."
scorpio,2010-01-29,"Your traditional key planet Mars is a major player now that the Sun is tensely opposing it. This energy can turn a simple conversation into an outright conflict. But you still might be more adept today at making peace, not war. Unfortunately, it will take a conscious effort on your part and won't just happen on its own."
sagittarius,2010-01-29,"Today's Sun-Mars opposition highlights your communication houses, filling your day with noisy conversations and a plethora of email. You could even lose your temper now if the information overload becomes too much to manage. But unnecessary ego battles have no real place in your life. Playing the blame game won't accomplish anything; stop talking and focus your attention on changing your attitude."
capricorn,2010-01-29,"You might try to demonstrate your passion to a loved one, but you could miss the boat unless you simply stay true to your feelings. There's no need to put any kind of flourishes on your words or actions. Just telling the truth in a straightforward manner will minimize your chances of offending anyone else."
aquarius,2010-01-29,"It's all about partnerships today as the Sun in your 1st House of Self pulls you one way while feisty Mars in your 7th House of Companions pulls you the other way. You may feel as if a friend or lover is pushing you around now and you don't think it's fair. Defending your personal space is one thing, but don't take it too far by launching an offensive attack. You are not in as much danger as you think."
pisces,2010-01-29,"You are more focused than usual, which encourages others to come to you now in order to get specific things finished. But you may be tired of being the one who holds the fort down and keeps track of the progress at work. It's no use trying to avoid your responsibilities today; the sooner you get started, the quicker they will be done."
aries,2010-01-30,"You may believe that you can power your way through just about anything now. Putting on a show can certainly help your cause and could be fun, but you still might take it too far. Make certain that you aren't stepping on anyone's toes; if you are, be sure to apologize without drawing any additional attention to the situation and then move on to what's next."
taurus,2010-01-30,"Your feelings may be maxed out now with the Full Moon activating your 4th House of Home and Family. There's also action in your 10th House of Career, forcing you to juggle the private aspects of your life with the more public parts. But don't let laziness stand between you and success; just start early today and steadily work your way through your obligations."
gemini,2010-01-30,"The Full Moon joins fiery Mars in your 3rd House of Immediate Environment, indicating that your life is very busy now. Consider what you want to do and then make plans to reach your goals. Just remember, there still may be a big difference between your expectations and what you can actually accomplish."
cancer,2010-01-30,"You are quite sensitive to the movements of the Moon, and today's Full Moon reminds you to hold on to what is working. But things that have not reached fruition could be losing their appeal and it may be wiser to let them go. Don't be afraid to take decisive action and, if possible, build on what you've already started. It's better to push your work forward if it's still relevant."
leo,2010-01-30,"You may be a bit much for others to handle because today's Full Moon illuminates your 1st House of Self. Her conjunction to Mars suggests that you will be more forceful than you realize and could even scare others away before you understand what is happening. Luckily, you can save yourself from a logistical nightmare if you don't try so hard right now."
virgo,2010-01-30,"The outgoing Leo Full Moon falls in your 12th House of Secrets, presenting you with a dilemma. You'll need to figure out a way to express yourself that allows you to maintain silence on some aspects of your life. Selectively disclosing information now can be tricky because once you start talking you could find it difficult to stop. Decide your limits beforehand so you will know when to retreat."
libra,2010-01-30,"The gregarious Leo Full Moon can turn you into a bull in a china shop because the force of Mars joins her today to push you to let everyone in your social or work group know where you stand. Fortunately, your key planet Venus is also in the picture, enabling you to appear gracious to others, even if you are on a mission. Don't worry too much about trying to be nice now; if your heart is filled with good intentions, they will carry you through."
scorpio,2010-01-30,Your feisty energy continues today as the Full Moon in your 10th House of Career opposes the Sun in your 4th House of Security. Don't wait for others to create your reality. You are tired of sitting on the sidelines; now it's time for you to put on your game face and go out there and make something happen.
sagittarius,2010-01-30,"Although the Full Moon is in expressive Leo, she energizes your 9th House of Adventure -- a natural sweet spot. You are eager to set your current plans aside and do something totally out of the box. It doesn't have to be a family vacation on a South Sea island. Even an afternoon at the movies can provide the escape that you are craving."
capricorn,2010-01-30,This is not an easy Full Moon for you because you really don't want to appear too carefree. You fear that you could lose some of the authority that you worked so hard to gain over these past days. But having a good time could be more important now than nurturing your fears. Take a leap of faith and realize that laughter really is the best medicine.
aquarius,2010-01-30,"The big, fat Leo Full Moon is in your 7th House of Partnerships, encouraging you to demonstrate your feelings for someone else. This is potentially a real turning point in a relationship, but you need to be very conscious of the increased impact your current actions will have today. If you go overboard in your generosity, it may backfire on you when people think you are expecting something in return."
pisces,2010-01-30,"Your 6th House of Daily Routine is lit up today from the playful Leo New Moon, creating a clash between what you're supposed to be doing and what you want to do. You can have the best of both worlds by working off some of your excess energy through physical exercise. Although the movement will likely feel good, it will feel even better if you can also accomplish something useful while exerting yourself."
aries,2010-01-31,"There's a lot weighing on your mind now, yet lightning-like Uranus strikes impulsive Mars today, indicating that you may leap before you look. It's not that you don't know better; you've been here before. But you now have the chance to change an old pattern by doing the responsible thing instead of following the course of least resistance."
taurus,2010-01-31,"Although you might attempt to be conscientious in all that you do today, a shortcut could be so tempting that you cannot resist it. Unfortunately, taking the easy way out will likely lead to more work rather than less. Be responsible; once you create a plan that is based on common sense instead of appearances, don't take any detours until you have reached your goals."
gemini,2010-01-31,"It's challenging for you to get to the bottom of an important issue today, but understanding your motivation can save you from unnecessary headaches down the road. Instead of distracting yourself with one thing after another, set aside a bit of quiet time to think about your life and what you would like to change in the months ahead. But rather than just visualizing your future, don't forget to also look back so you can better understand how you got yourself into the current situation."
cancer,2010-01-31,"Creating a schedule is a smart idea today because you'll feel more comfortable knowing in advance what you will be doing. But even if you use your common sense when planning your day, you still should remain flexible to allow for unexpected changes. A lot can happen now that's outside your sphere of control and it's better to roll with the waves than to exhaust yourself fighting against them."
leo,2010-01-31,"It's difficult for you to reconcile your current feelings with your commitments for the year ahead. There's a part of you that's ready to cash in your chips and start anew, but that's not necessarily an option. Instead, consider what you can do to revitalize your life without abruptly turning it inside out. This may be a time for bold thinking, but don't be in too much of a hurry to put your ideas into motion."
virgo,2010-01-31,"The Moon's return to your sign today heightens the intensity of your emotions. It's difficult for you to understand your feelings now because they are not what you expected. Instead of trying to rationalize your reactions, try to observe them without judgment. Give yourself permission to change your mind as often as needed, until your new perspective begins to solidify. Your values are in the midst of a long-term metamorphosis and there's no use in rushing the process."
libra,2010-01-31,"Your fantasies can be quite active today, but you cannot afford a day of escaping into your imagination. You have important decisions to make that could alter the direction of your life. Although you might not be able to put a new plan into motion right away, you could come up with an original strategy that changes the rules of the game. Sudden shifts in your thinking are likely now; just don't do anything radical until you've had time to develop your ideas."
scorpio,2010-01-31,"You may feel reality catching up with you now that karmic Saturn is squaring your key planet Pluto. You know that change is possible, even necessary, but it could seem too overwhelming today to do anything about it at all. If it feels like you have bitten off more than you can chew, declare a temporary moratorium to give yourself some downtime. You'll have a better chance to meet your deadlines if you take a break to replenish your energy."
sagittarius,2010-01-31,"It's challenging for you to see the potential in the current set of circumstances, but a sudden breakthrough in your thinking makes anything possible. You may even have moments of extreme optimism today that temporarily lift you out of your serious mood. But don't worry if you cannot solve your problems with one brilliant idea. Keep in mind that you are in a long-lasting period of change and that it will take time to create a new plan."
capricorn,2010-01-31,"You feel safe when you know that the foundations of your life are stable. Unfortunately, those things that you normally can count on are now undergoing a very slow transformation, making it more difficult to plan your next career move. You might be at your wit's end because you don't feel in control of your life and intense concentration doesn't seem to help. Fortunately, a breakthrough is possible if you aren't afraid of stepping outside of the box."
aquarius,2010-01-31,"You may be frustrated today by your desire to make long-term plans since you know that they are logically out of the question now. Part of the problem is that you want stability, yet the current circumstances stir up old issues. You are reminded that everything changes, including those things you thought were forever. As challenging as it is to separate your past from your future, critical thinking can help you see the present moment in a clear light."
pisces,2010-01-31,"If someone appears to be overly critical today, it may be a result of your unfounded optimism. But it's not that you really believe everything is fine. You are aware of the difficulties ahead and you want to handle them the best you can. Still, others may think you are lost in a fantasy world and could judge you harshly. Consider it a reality check and make sure you aren't avoiding the truth."
aries,2010-02-01,"Although you may be tempted to think about your life in general terms today, you'll be much more effective if you can bring everything down to a very practical level. Instead of attempting to understand long-term consequences of anything you do, keep your thinking limited to the here and now. Don't worry about the whole alphabet; just get from A to B as quickly as you can. The rest will follow later."
taurus,2010-02-01,"You are happy to return to work today, especially if your job allows you to express yourself in a creative manner. But even if it does not, accepting your responsibilities graciously enables you to make the most of your current situation. Staying focused at work increases your chances of taking time off later to kick back and relax."
gemini,2010-02-01,"The discerning Virgo Moon focuses your mind on the details, whether or not they are truly important. Meanwhile, mental Mercury's alignment with grandiose Jupiter opens your mind to include the widest horizons. Whichever perspective you choose the other is nearby, making it tough for you to concentrate. Instead of trying to use logic now, fall back on your intuition. Following a hunch might just be your best chance for success."
cancer,2010-02-01,"You may be rethinking your relationship strategy now as you try to balance domestic responsibilities with other obligations. But it's challenging to follow any one train of thought through to its conclusion. Instead, you seem to bounce around from one idea to the next without rhyme or reason. Forcing yourself along a narrow track now could bring frustration. It may be smarter to leave the heavy thinking for later in the week."
leo,2010-02-01,"Your strategy at work today will determine how much you actually accomplish. If you focus on the immediate tasks at hand, it may seem like you get a lot done. But if you put your attention on planning and other issues that take you farther into the future, you might end up frustrated with how much there is still to complete. Nevertheless, it's still wiser now to take the more global approach, even if it leaves you with more to do tomorrow."
virgo,2010-02-01,"It's going to take extra effort today to stay focused because opportunistic Jupiter is busy opening your mind to new possibilities. You may be so enthused about the unproven potential of someone's bold idea that you cannot stuff your thoughts back into the box from which they escaped. However, it's not a smart idea to just give up. If you continue bringing yourself back to the present moment, your efficiency will increase throughout the day."
libra,2010-02-01,You need to finish up an old project now so you can be ready for the new opportunities just around the next corner. But it won't be easy to tie up loose ends when it's so much fun to imagine untying them. You could be your own worst enemy if you really think you can outsmart the timing of the cosmos. Stop procrastinating; your lack of attention to your chores can only delay the inevitable for so long.
scorpio,2010-02-01,"You are quite picky about your social commitments now because you really don't have any time to waste. And if you did, you'd rather choose your own activities, rather than following along with a group. Still, closing yourself off from your friends and family isn't a smart idea either. It's up to you to manage your schedule more efficiently so you can spend some quality time with your loved ones."
sagittarius,2010-02-01,"Bringing your optimistic outlook to work can help others get a sense of the big picture today. But you can become so caught up with how you see the future that you lose sight of what's happening in the here and now. However tempting it is to throw yourself into the next great adventure of your life, it's crucial for you to demonstrate your pragmatic side as well."
capricorn,2010-02-01,"It may take a few days for things to settle down a bit at work. You can see that the dynamics have already peaked and that everything is finally moving in the right direction. But you may be a bit overconfident now as you imagine what will happen next. Don't trust your visions, especially if they appear too good to be true. They may be, but remember the future is ours to change."
aquarius,2010-02-01,"You may have an apparently sound plan that should make you more money, yet it might not turn out as sweet as you expect. Your tendency now is to inflate everything, but some ideas will lose their value when you take them too far. Knowing where to draw the line may be the most significant contributor to your current success."
pisces,2010-02-01,"Your friends will steer you in the right direction today as messenger Mercury stabilizes communication from the 11th House of Teamwork. It's surely not a time to go off and try things by yourself, especially since working as part of a group can be so rewarding now. But don't minimize your own ideas either, for they, too, can have the right mix between pragmatism and spiritual adventure."
aries,2010-02-02,"Relationships may seem like a minefield today as you attempt to establish clear boundaries in new or existing friendships. You might feel as if you are losing ground or, perhaps, addressing issues that you believed were already resolved. It doesn't matter if you think you've been here before; you still must reconsider your goals and how best to achieve them."
taurus,2010-02-02,"Your ruling planet Venus is usually your key to pleasure, but today you may feel isolated as her sweetness is blocked. This is likely to play out at work, maybe even delaying a promotion or other recognition for a job well done. Relax; don't fall into the trap of thinking that something is wrong just because it is taking longer than you originally expected."
gemini,2010-02-02,"Your typically easygoing demeanor might seem elusive today as you grapple with more serious issues. It's tough to be witty when you are so preoccupied with a lack of love or money, but this contemplative mood can lead to a positive outcome if you are willing to stick with the process. Don't seek a fast fix; instead, acknowledge the difficulties and concentrate on long-term solutions."
cancer,2010-02-02,"You may be running out of patience today, especially if people who are supposedly your allies are giving you a hard time. Although you surely would prefer more support from your friends and associates, it's not too much to expect them to be kind. Unfortunately, it may be difficult now to lessen the gulf that's separating you from others. Even if it's a challenge to wait, give it time; the distance will diminish on its own."
leo,2010-02-02,"If someone owes you money, you could get the runaround today as payment of the debt is delayed. In a relationship, it may seem as if your friend or partner is withholding affection. Either way, you may not be thrilled about being denied what you want or even having to wait. Unfortunately, you could make matters worse if you press the issue. Your smartest strategy now is to make your position known and then let it go. You may be surprised at how quickly it all changes."
virgo,2010-02-02,"You might not enjoy the restrictions being placed on you at work, but you can accomplish a lot once you accept them. You may not feel enthusiastic for a particular job or maybe you're a bit insecure about a current relationship. Fortunately, this is just a temporary phase, so take the medicine, learn what you can from the situation and then move on."
libra,2010-02-02,"Today could be a rather stressful day because your key planet Venus must stand up to tough guys Saturn and Pluto, indicating that you won't likely get what you want today. Although the Moon is back in your sign, you might be unable to relax and let your feelings come to the surface. Self-doubt can be your enemy, but asking hard questions now can prompt further exploration."
scorpio,2010-02-02,"Although the idea of love may sound wonderful to you now, in actuality it might not work out so well. On the other hand, you don't necessarily want anyone to know that you're hiding behind your castle wall, because you are enjoying the peace and quiet and prefer no interruptions. Still, you have an important lesson to learn from a spiritual tradition, even if you don't yet know what it is."
sagittarius,2010-02-02,"No matter how upbeat you try to be today, it doesn't seem as if you can get a handle on what's directly ahead. It's doubly challenging if your friends seem to stand between you and your goals. Although their real motivation may be to help you get your life in order, you cannot succeed until you acknowledge the hard truth that's currently being shown to you."
capricorn,2010-02-02,"Although you are probably no stranger to the stern voice of Saturn, it is different today because you don't have a clear sense of what to do. You want answers and you want them now, but they are not forthcoming. Fortunately, your ambition and patience blend well, turning you into a formidable opponent, especially if you are willing to wait a while longer."
aquarius,2010-02-02,"The sensitive Moon's entry into your 7th House of Companions can indicate a nice addition to your life, but Saturn's pressure now might prevent you from taking advantage of your relationship savvy. Just because you understand what's going on doesn't mean that you'll automatically know what to do about it. If you cannot find what you are currently seeking, don't panic and accept something less than what you need. Don't compromise; the wait will be worth it."
pisces,2010-02-02,You are attracted to the beautiful magic that comes through your fantasies. But you won't get away now with simply substituting an illusion for the truth. It's fine to hold on to your dreams while working in the real world. Just acknowledge that your limitations are a healthy part of the process.
aries,2010-02-03,"You have something to say and cannot put it off any longer. There's a good chance that a current conversation will pick up on a previously discussed topic from late December, prior to Mercury's retrograde turn. Now, however, no stone should be left unturned because you probably won't have an opportunity to talk about this again for a while."
taurus,2010-02-03,"You may believe that it's in your best interest to be as specific as you can while talking about what you want, but you don't wish to impose on your co-workers. Once you begin sharing your thoughts, you might feel as if your words reveal more than you intend. But don't worry if things move too fast for you because the outcome will likely be positive."
gemini,2010-02-03,"A situation that's felt stuck could open up today and the resistance begins to fall away. Your optimism is guarded, but at least now you are able to see the potential in the same circumstances that only yesterday were blocked. Nevertheless, you'll need to be patient because it still could take a few more days before the details are filled in sufficiently to proceed with confidence."
cancer,2010-02-03,"You are able to be quite even-tempered today, even if the emotional waters raise some pretty good sized waves. It's not that you don't care about what's happening; it's just that you can see both sides of an issue now and you are willing to work with the outcome either way. Ultimately, your desire to nurture someone you love is more important than whether or not you get your way."
leo,2010-02-03,"It's a bit easier today for you to go along with someone else's idea, even if you don't think it's perfect. You are more accepting and able to make allowances for other people's shortcomings now. But this doesn't mean that it's smart to indiscriminately say yes to everyone. Getting involved in the projects of people you like is a wonderful way to support your friends, as long as you don't set aside your own goals."
virgo,2010-02-03,"You probably think that you are taking a straightforward approach to your tasks at work. You believe that others know exactly what you mean, but your communication can be a bit more garbled today than you realize. Sorting through your complex list can positively impact your day, but you must take enough time to consider the full variety of choices now at your disposal."
libra,2010-02-03,"You might appear so easygoing today that someone may actually believe you cannot make a choice for yourself. But the Moon in gracious Libra is simply making it more sensible for you to go along with others for the sake of establishing a good rapport. Once you feel comfortable with the current situation, it will be just as easy to speak up when it really matters."
scorpio,2010-02-03,"You may be a bit sad today, especially if it seems like a window of opportunity is closing and you haven't yet made a choice. There's a part of you that doesn't want to impose your will on others, keeping you from expressing what you want. Thankfully, you are still feeling the generosity of Jupiter, and reaching for the stars will help you get past your fear of failure."
sagittarius,2010-02-03,"You are able to make a quick recovery today and could be quite optimistic when compared with the uncertainty you were grappling with only yesterday. Now, however, you are able to find that sweet spot amongst your friends where you don't have to do anything except show up. It may be puzzling to you, but you are deeply appreciated for the words of wisdom that you can offer to any gathering."
capricorn,2010-02-03,"Taking steady steps forward is easier when you are standing on familiar ground. However, the landscape is turning unfamiliar and you cannot reliably proceed unless you are willing to take a risk. Fortunately, you are under the protection of a kindly Libra Moon, currently in your 10th House of Career. Although you may have to get adventurous to reach your destination, you are ready for a quieter existence now."
aquarius,2010-02-03,You may feel as if you are being lifted aloft as your ideas catch the mental thermals and soar high above the mundane practicalities of Earth. You are hesitant to take off because you are now afraid that you won't be able to get safely back to the ground. But it's a waste of energy worrying about how to be practical today. Let go of your fears and explore the potential that lies ahead.
pisces,2010-02-03,"Your guardian angels are looking out for you today as the Moon in your powerful 8th House harmonizes with several planets in your 12th House of Universal Consciousness. Luckily, you don't need to believe in angels to benefit from their presence. Even if you consider yourself a doubting Thomas, it's smart to suspend your judgment and simply acknowledge the magic that's in the air."
aries,2010-02-04,"You are thinking about the meaning of life today and trying to get a handle on how your choices have brought you to where you are now. This is actually a good day for this kind of contemplation, for you can see a variety of paths ahead, yet you may not be tied to any one of them. But applying a new plan will be tougher than making it, so don't try to accomplish too much too quickly. Give yourself enough time to let your current ideas develop before turning them into action."
taurus,2010-02-04,"Although you may have a list of specific tasks you want to complete today, your attention quickly shifts from work to more personal matters. Relationship issues become more significant, although you might try to steer clear of a drama that's developing around you. Instead of being irritated by emotions that don't fit into your agenda now, recognize that interactions with others make your life richer and more meaningful."
gemini,2010-02-04,"Although you aren't necessarily interested in deepening a connection with a friend now, you have no reason to avoid closer contact either. You may be neutral at first, but a complex array of attractions can draw you into unfamiliar ground if you allow it to happen. As long as you know what you want from a potential interaction, this is a smart time to move through old relationship fears and explore the uncharted possibilities."
cancer,2010-02-04,"You can take a difficult situation and make the best of it now by setting aside long-term plans and simply focusing on the present. Your clarity of perception and intensity of emotion are refreshing, but as soon as you place expectations on the current situation, everything changes and the interpersonal dynamics become tricky. Observe how you unconsciously slip into thinking about the future and remember to keep bringing your thoughts back to the here and now."
leo,2010-02-04,"You may be resigned to do whatever you must, but it's tough when a family member or close friend has a very different way of looking at life. It's not that you just disagree about the course of action to be followed; it's that you approach the issue from fundamentally different assumptions. Don't try to convince others that your position is better. It's less frustrating to acknowledge the reality of multiple points of view and get on with your day."
virgo,2010-02-04,"You may be feeling a bit anxious today, even if everything seems to be going along well. Your worry stems from the uncertainty you have when you are drawn into emotional issues that pull you away from your more comfortable logical view of life. But this isn't a smart time to remain cool and detached. Jump in and get your hands dirty from messy and unmanageable passions without worrying about cleaning up until later."
libra,2010-02-04,"It's time for you to be more practical today. If you have been avoiding financial issues, this could be a good time to take care of business. Don't be afraid to set fun aside for a while in order to tie up loose ends. Knowing where you stand with respect to money will give you a kind of peace of mind that's longer lasting than transient pleasures."
scorpio,2010-02-04,"The Moon's return to your sign occurs today in the midst of several lovely transits, easing you gently back into the emotional realms. Perhaps you recently entered a phase of logical analysis. Now, however, you can set the serious thinking aside for a bit and sink into a more nurturing watery world that's quite familiar to you. But don't try to hold on to any one feeling for too long. Be flexible and allow your moods to change naturally."
sagittarius,2010-02-04,"You may be content now to slip into a more contemplative space. There's no need to run around in circles trying to get things done. If you are meeting resistance, listen to the message being given to you instead of frustrating yourself by fighting the currents. You are on an imaginative adventure today, but others may not be able to come along. Create boundaries if needed and enjoy your solo journey."
capricorn,2010-02-04,"The emphasis in your life is shifting, adding importance to your interactions with associates at work and friends at play. This is a phase when you can reestablish your relationships in a way that makes more sense, but this isn't about any one individual. Instead, take time to contemplate your place within the larger network. Find a role that balances your own personal needs with those of your social and professional groups."
aquarius,2010-02-04,"Circumstances at work could be running rather smoothly today, but the surface appearance is different than what's actually happening. You may be irritated that your plans are not playing out in reality as expected and you're not sure how to get yourself back on track. The more you think about this dilemma, the more unsolvable it seems. The deeper issues won't be resolved so easily, so let them go for now. You will be better equipped to think on a long-term strategic level in a few days."
pisces,2010-02-04,"You may not be thinking very concretely today and others might grow dismayed at your apparent lack of interest in practical matters. But you aren't worried because your imagination is flourishing now and it feels good to be in touch with your own feelings at a deeper level. Still, it's difficult to keep up your regular routine while also indulging in your fantasies. Even if it's a bit awkward at times, don't close down your dreams, for they are the wellspring of your creativity."
aries,2010-02-05,"You may feel a bit jumbled today and have a difficult time sorting out what you truly want. You know what is best for you, but it may not sound as enticing as something else you wish to do now. Be careful making any long-term decisions, because you could easily be tempted to chase after a mirage. Bringing your thoughts down to earth can save you from disappointment."
taurus,2010-02-05,"You are usually the practical one that others go to for a reality check, but now you might have a hard time distinguishing between fact and fancy. Although you could start off knowing exactly what's going on, it's easy to slip further and further away from the truth and back into your fantasies today. Unfortunately, you won't be able to sustain your dreams unless they are well-grounded."
gemini,2010-02-05,"It really doesn't matter how lighthearted you usually are; today is one of those days that can drag you through the murky swamp of your emotions. This might sound worse than it truly is, for you can learn quite a bit about human nature and yourself if you are willing. Being open to positive potential is a great feeling, but acknowledging your limitations enables you to start pushing through them."
cancer,2010-02-05,"You have big ideas now that entice you to think about the world in an optimistic manner. Unfortunately, avoiding the harsh realities of meeting responsibilities and deadlines doesn't mean that you can actually get away with it for long. Instead of sneaking around the edges, stop moving long enough to evaluate where you are and to figure out how to take the next step."
leo,2010-02-05,"You are tired of doing things just because you are the responsible type. You are eager to show your friends that you can be wildly creative, too. Trying something you have never done before can be exhilarating, but leave enough time to reconsider how you're going to fulfill the promises that you made earlier."
virgo,2010-02-05,"Your friends are not the greatest positive influence on your life now, because they may encourage you to expand your horizons and open your heart to deep mystical truths. This would be a great idea, except you have very basic responsibilities that you must handle today. Don't let anyone pull you off course; just keep returning to the obligations that are right there on your plate."
libra,2010-02-05,"You might imagine a better way to do your job now, but when you try to put an idea into action, the logistics suddenly grow overly complex. You are driven to do the right thing, but are also motivated to be creative as you pursue your ambitions. Don't be fooled by your own enthusiasm; it's better to take on less and reach your goal than to inflate your expectations, only to be disappointed."
scorpio,2010-02-05,"Your emotions are strongly pulling you one way now while your intellect suggests there's a smarter route to success. Unfortunately, you cannot just choose one over the other, for there is more going on than simply picking A or B. The more spiritual approach suggests that you can be quite creative by listening to your feelings while saving your rationalizations for another day."
sagittarius,2010-02-05,Your key planet Jupiter opens your mind so wide today that you could lose track of reality. The good news is that your visions can be profound now if you don't slip and fall into the darkness of the unknown. Ask your friends and associates for help; you'll be surprised at how quickly they come together to support your dreams.
capricorn,2010-02-05,"Your key planet Saturn is guiding you toward accomplishing your goals at work now. You have strong ambitions and want to be recognized for what you do. But instead of being noticed for your leadership skills today, you may be acknowledged simply because of your positive attitude. Keep up the good work; whatever the process, tangible rewards are just around the next corner."
aquarius,2010-02-05,"Your traditional ruling planet Saturn is a bit out of whack today as it forms a quincunx with indulgent Jupiter, making it tough to turn your goals into a workable plan. When you start toward your current destination, you could discover that you're actually heading in the wrong direction. Don't give up; hold your course, even if you have your doubts. Your dreams will crystallize and you'll be closer to them than you ever thought possible."
pisces,2010-02-05,"Although you may feel wishy-washy at times, your dreams of travel, education and other adventures are not currently negotiable. You are quite certain of your goals and will confidently share them in great detail to anyone who might be able to help your cause. Unfortunately, the more you say, the less believable your story becomes, and so it's a smart idea to save your explanations for another day."
aries,2010-02-06,"Although your friends may not fully understand what you want now, they will ultimately support you in your current quest. You assume that they will resist your unorthodox ideas, but in actuality they just might not want to get actively involved. If it feels like you are on the right track, consider going ahead on your own."
taurus,2010-02-06,"It's hard to know what's on the minds of those around you now that the secretive Scorpio Moon squares confusing Neptune. But answers might come to you in a split second like an electric lightning flash of awareness. If you do have a perceptual breakthrough today, don't trust your memory. Write down your thoughts and make certain to reread them later."
gemini,2010-02-06,"You are totally buzzed today, but still may have a tough time letting go of your attachment to unfinished work left over from Friday. Remind yourself that there is no viable reason to hold on to an idea whose time has passed or an agenda that is no longer useful. If someone enters your life to show you something new this weekend, be ready to make the most of it."
cancer,2010-02-06,"The emotional anchor that has been tethering you to your home and family may feel less stable today because your feelings are up in the air and you want to fly on the thermals. Luckily, you don't have as much holding you back now, but this means that you'll need to pay closer attention to establishing your own limits. You can always push them a bit further if you ascertain that there's still something more to learn."
leo,2010-02-06,"Instead of relating to your friends in the same way you have done in the past, consider which of them may be capable of something more. You are ready to deepen an existing relationship or go off and start a new one. Although recent responsibilities still continue to follow you, remember it's possible to separate yourself from some of the more time-consuming ones if you make an effort."
virgo,2010-02-06,"As much as you try to take yourself very seriously now, you are in the process of loosening your thoughts from anything that ties them down. This transition won't happen all at once, but rather with fits and starts, until you build up the necessary momentum to break away from the comforts of a strong safety net."
libra,2010-02-06,"It's rather confusing now, because you are ready to play in the realm of love, but signals could get mixed early on and prevent you from following through. Acting too soon can turn a situation with great potential into a complex web of feelings. Nevertheless, it is smarter to wait until later in the day when the cosmic forces gather in your favor."
scorpio,2010-02-06,"It's always more challenging to sail against the prevailing winds and today you'll get your chance to demonstrate your masterful navigational skills. But don't waste energy just fighting the emotional tides. Instead, choose a route that enables you to get out of the tumultuous currents completely. Once you have relaxed and caught your breath, continue on your way with determination."
sagittarius,2010-02-06,"It's difficult for you to apply what you've learned during the past few days, but you have no shortage of fine ideas. Unfortunately, your mind is moving much faster than everything else and you could become frustrated as you wait for events to catch up to you. Fortunately, your patience will be rewarded and progress will continue later this evening after the Moon enters enthusiastic Sagittarius."
capricorn,2010-02-06,"Your anxieties continue to surface now as the pace of change picks up speed. You don't mind having a lot to do today, but you aren't as happy when each activity you begin opens another can of worms. It reaches a point when there's just too much going on all at once. But don't withdraw; keep doing what you can and wait for your confidence to return tomorrow."
aquarius,2010-02-06,"You have a lot on your plate now as you attempt to prevent everything from going crazy today. Your key planet Uranus aligns with the sensitive Moon and communicator Mercury, possibly making you feel as if you know too much. Don't worry; you don't. But you do know just enough to be able to make a real difference if you act swiftly with a kind heart."
pisces,2010-02-06,"Your key planet Jupiter forms a rejuvenating sextile with potent Pluto today, increasing your energy reserves for what's ahead. But it's a challenge for you to wait until the most propitious moment; you want to swing into motion right away. There's no harm in responding immediately; it's just that your actions will have longer-lasting consequences if you can restrain yourself until later this evening."
aries,2010-02-07,"You could fall in love with your own reflection today and not even realize what's happened. Naturally, no one will be able to live up to your impossible expectations unless you take the time to separate your dreams from the actual events. The truth isn't as pretty as your imagination, but it won't create as many problems in the long run."
taurus,2010-02-07,"You are able to convince yourself that you have done all that you can to help others now as your key planet Venus joins deceptive Neptune in your 10th House of Public Status. Unfortunately, you may be acting out of self-interest rather than altruism. Still, it's a waste of energy to question your motives. Why you are doing something today is less important than whether or not you are treating others kindly."
gemini,2010-02-07,"Relationships are complicated today because it's not easy for you to see things as they truly are. Instead, you perceive others through rose-colored glasses now, tinting reality with your unfulfilled desires. Don't be afraid to dream; just temper your expectations with critical thinking so you don't confuse what you want with what you have."
cancer,2010-02-07,"Your standards for romance are set very high today, but you need to be careful or you could fool yourself into believing that everything is in order. It's difficult to find a healthy balance between seeing the truth and bending it. Although you might try to avoid an unpleasant situation now, you'll be happier in the long run if you take the time to address any unresolved issues as they arise."
leo,2010-02-07,"Although it might feel as if you hit an emotional wall today, it's not a smart idea to retreat. However, you won't likely be able to force your way through the obstacle course, either. Create your ideal vision of the way you want things to be and then share your thoughts with someone you trust. It's wonderful to be heard, but it can be discouraging when you realize that no one other than you is responsible for making your dreams come true."
virgo,2010-02-07,"You may have big ideas about what you want to do at home today, but could become confused as you desperately try to accomplish your goals. Your dilemma becomes more apparent as you think about your ideal situation and then attempt to manifest it right away. But your impatience is unnecessary; you have more time than you realize."
libra,2010-02-07,"Your key planet Venus is angelically touched by nebulous Neptune today, dangling exquisitely beautiful carrots in front of you, just out of your reach. However, you might feel frustrated if your satisfaction is postponed again and again. Instead of pinning your hopes on some future fulfillment, keep bringing your thoughts back to what's happening in the present moment."
scorpio,2010-02-07,"You are looking ahead today, rather than being distracted by what's in the rear view mirror. Luckily, you understand that you cannot intelligently guide yourself forward until you focus your attention on what's in front of you. But don't reach too far or a brick wall will be more like a restraining wall, holding you in the present moment. Using your creative imagination sets a lovely tone for the future as long as you don't lose your patience."
sagittarius,2010-02-07,"The truth need not get in your way today as you imagine all the possibilities. Ultimately, you have a shot at what you want as long as you can conjure up a clear image of your desires. But daydreaming is not sufficient to make it happen; perseverance will be required, too. Don't give up on yourself or you'll never know what might have been possible."
capricorn,2010-02-07,It's challenging for you to honor the limitations that are stressed by the Sun's uncomfortable sesquisquare to your key planet Saturn today. The difficulty stems from your inability to recognize the dividing line between fact and fiction now. But you can also play this to your advantage if you can suspend doubt long enough to make up an alternative story with the exact ending that you want.
aquarius,2010-02-07,"You may take pride in your ability to remain emotionally detached, even when you love someone very much. Fortunately, you understand why maintaining your autonomy is important. Unfortunately, you still might take the bait even if you know better. Once you bite, you can become entangled in a struggle to free yourself. Save yourself the headache by avoiding the hook in the first place."
pisces,2010-02-07,"Sweet Venus aligns with your key planet Neptune today, turning simple bits of reality into cascading streams of fantasies. It all happens so quickly that it's easy to become enamored with your beautiful daydreams. Don't deny yourself the pleasures; just enjoy temporarily losing track of what's real. You can always find your way back to the basics tomorrow."
aries,2010-02-08,"You might not be willing to justify your feelings today just because someone asks for an explanation. The truth is that your emotions are not subject to logic and analyzing them only detracts from your experience. Instead of attempting to make sense of your desires now, just share them when it's appropriate without trying to get others to voice their approval. Remember, you don't need anyone else's permission to be yourself."
taurus,2010-02-08,"A conflict with someone at work can be a bit complicated today because everything is not as upfront as it seems. Although your apparent openness can be disarming to others, they could make incorrect assumptions about your motivation. Take time and explain yourself; if a workmate or boss misunderstands what is driving you now, your actions won't make much sense."
gemini,2010-02-08,"You may be thrown a curve ball today as a current disagreement stirs up an old issue within a relationship. This time, however, it's different than before because you are more aware of how your perspective is tied to what happened previously. You might want to simply change what you discover, except it's impossible to hide it away once you realize the truth."
cancer,2010-02-08,"Your ability to feel things fully now can be quite a lot to handle if you get into a contentious situation with someone close to you. Your resistance to change can actually arise out of a Sun-Pluto sesquisquare, yet the Moon's easy aspects to volatile Neptune and Venus helps you to demonstrate an unexpected grace in whatever you choose to do."
leo,2010-02-08,"The Sun's harsh connection with controlling Pluto can push you to say something that you may not really mean. You could be frustrated by other people's inability to follow through on what they promise, provoking an angry outburst. Luckily, saying what's on your mind can suddenly release tension, leading to a clearing of the air. Nevertheless, don't hesitate to apologize for an inconsiderate choice of words."
virgo,2010-02-08,"Your friends and co-workers may think that you are being rather eccentric today if you don't conform to the basic social rules. Meanwhile, you are just trying to be true to yourself, even if you accidentally step over the edge. Unfortunately, you might not have the right words at your disposal to say what's on your mind, so let your actions speak for you until your thoughts become clearer."
libra,2010-02-08,"Something very strange can happen today, grabbing your attention and convincing you that the veil between this world and others is thinner than you thought. But there's really nothing for you to do right now except observe what's coming through from the other side. If you do see a pattern, then it's a smart idea to come up with a plan that enables you to work with the energy rather than against it."
scorpio,2010-02-08,"Your key planet Pluto is being stressed today, setting the tone for deep psychological changes. You are being tested and may need to dig beneath the surface in order to discover the spiritual truths now coming your way. Take a chance and make a choice that moves you closer to the unknown. Avoiding the uncertain aspects of a situation will likely feel better right now, but it won't keep you on the track to success."
sagittarius,2010-02-08,"You are hopeful that your day will change for the better, but you may be fearful to put too many expectations on what is happening. Desiring more from your interactions with others isn't harmful as long as your strategy isn't overly rigid. Maintaining flexibility today can be crucial to your current happiness."
capricorn,2010-02-08,"You might feel as if there's a lot at stake now and are tempted to do whatever is necessary to turn the tables in your favor. Unfortunately, attempting to micromanage a current work situation can backfire on you because you cannot keep up with all the complex interactions. Paradoxically, loosening the reins can ultimately increase your efficiency and make you more productive."
aquarius,2010-02-08,"The Moon's square to your key planet Uranus can turn your social interactions upside down today. This can make things at work more complicated because there are too many loose ends for you to keep tabs on. Your smartest strategy now is to focus on the long-term goals, without filling in too many details. Be ready to change your plan as circumstances require."
pisces,2010-02-08,"You have your sights set on a distant horizon now, yet you may need to redefine your goals as you learn more about the politics of what's currently happening. Someone may be trying to amass power and you are willing to do what you can to prevent it. Unfortunately, you aren't strong enough to face the resistance directly, so working through channels can be the most effective way to reach your destination."
aries,2010-02-09,"It's time for you to stop wasting your time expressing your best intentions. Even if you mean well, you are not free to do as you please. Think about your responsibilities and plan your day accordingly. You can still enjoy yourself today, but you'll feel better about having fun if you don't have to worry about what you should have done earlier."
taurus,2010-02-09,"Others won't be able to change your mind today, no matter how much they try. Unfortunately, neither logic nor an emotional appeal will work. But, ultimately, the choice is yours and it may be wiser for you to remain open to new input from someone who is an authority. Remember, you may have a great plan, but there are still those who know more than you."
gemini,2010-02-09,"Although you may be tempted to do your own thing today, you'll still probably try to meet other people's expectations. Your innate desire to remain uncommitted gives way to a more immediate need to be practical. Don't waste precious energy fighting about the wrong things. Do what makes the most sense in the immediate moment."
cancer,2010-02-09,"The Moon's entry into your 7th House of Partners places a spotlight on your relationships. Instead of responding to a situation based upon your own needs, you must also take what others want into consideration. Unfortunately, it's not easy to accept someone else's point of view now. Nevertheless, compromise is still a smarter alternative to acting on your own."
leo,2010-02-09,"You know what has to be accomplished at work today, even if it seems overwhelming. Your original plans may be quite different than what actually needs to happen, but avoiding your responsibilities is not a smart idea. Keep in mind that you'll still have to meet your commitments sooner or later. You'll enjoy yourself more if you get them out of the way earlier in the day."
virgo,2010-02-09,"Your current approach to work is not based solely on being efficient or getting the job done. Instead, you are also likely to consider what brings you joy. Although you are often content to narrow your focus and complete the tasks at hand, you may actually be more effective now if you are having fun. Paradoxically, taking yourself too seriously today can actually be counterproductive."
libra,2010-02-09,"Domestic chores can be quite demanding today, especially if other people's expectations are out of line with what you are willing to do. Unfortunately, you may not be able to get out of meeting your obligations and it's not worth turning your resistance into a major conflict. Instead of denying your desire to have a good time, just delay the fun and games until you have demonstrated your willingness to be responsible."
scorpio,2010-02-09,"Your busy schedule might not leave you a lot of room today for idle daydreaming. Although you may prefer having unstructured time by yourself for contemplation, you're more likely to be pulled into a series of intense interactions that define your day. It may feel like hard work, but there's a lot to be gained now by processing your emotions through constructive dialogue."
sagittarius,2010-02-09,"You may need to stand up to others at work today because your plan could be contrary to the general consensus. Your friends or associates might be satisfied with finding the easiest way out, but you can be quite stubborn now in your desire to hold truth over convenience. Although your idealism is admirable, it can be taken too far. Don't be so self-righteous that you miss the acceptable common ground you are already standing upon."
capricorn,2010-02-09,The Moon's return to your hardworking sign can turn a simple task into a major project before you even know what happened. You can get so carried away with your own ambitions now that you lose track of the most sensible path and end up making a poor decision. Don't create goals that are lofty yet unreachable. Focus on your intentions instead of the final destination while maintaining a practical approach to your job.
aquarius,2010-02-09,"Sometimes your fantasies are like scenes out of a science fiction movie and have little basis in reality. Now, however, your dreams can hold the key to your immediate future because your imagination grows directly out of your everyday experience. Don't try to rein in your thoughts; be as flexible as possible and patiently let them wander as they will. Your relaxed approach just might enable you to find an undiscovered treasure."
pisces,2010-02-09,"You may be so sure of what comes next that you find yourself defending your plans against someone at work today. It may feel as if others are being overly aggressive, but it's more likely that you don't want to face any uncertainty at all. Don't avoid the facts just because it makes sticking to your strategy a no-brainer. It's crucial to acknowledge your error in judgment as soon as possible if you have missed something important."
aries,2010-02-10,"Your attempts to accomplish an ambitious set of goals today may be thwarted by your lack of sound judgment. It's not that you are missing any of the facts; it's just that you could easily underestimate the amount of work that's necessary to finish a job. Instead of trusting your first estimate, you would be wise to think about all the details involved in a project before making promises you cannot possibly keep."
taurus,2010-02-10,"You might believe you're very clever today because your mind is buzzing with the crackle of excitement and the eagerness of anticipation. Unfortunately, your enthusiasm can land you in trouble because it's easy to get your wires crossed as you jump to an incorrect conclusion. Remember, just because you are able to think faster now doesn't necessarily mean that your thoughts are correct."
gemini,2010-02-10,"It's easy for you to make something sound better than it is because exaggeration comes naturally to you now. Fortunately, your key planet Mercury enables you to back up your point of view with what appears to be impeccable logic, but others should be warned that you can bend the truth without actually saying anything that is overtly incorrect. You can help the situation by sticking to the actual facts instead of embellishing what you know."
cancer,2010-02-10,"You may be jumping out of your skin today as trickster Mercury zaps his way into your world. You could have your heart set on doing something so special that it revitalizes an old relationship or opens the door to a new one. In either case, don't let your fixed expectations get in the way of a happy surprise ending."
leo,2010-02-10,"It appears that you have everything under control and your positive approach to the day enables you to accomplish a lot at work. But negativity lurks just beneath the surface and can throw your plan into turmoil. Don't complicate an interesting conversation by talking about your emotions. For now, stick with the facts to keep it simple."
virgo,2010-02-10,Your key planet Mercury becomes a bit too quirky for your taste as it enters radical Aquarius. You may be tempted to say something you don't really mean or somehow make your work life more complicated than it needs to be now. Stop worrying about how you appear to others. Focus your efforts on doing the best job possible instead.
libra,2010-02-10,"Although you are often quite accepting of others, you may be very self-critical today. Unfortunately, you have enough information at your disposal now to make a good case for your own shortcomings. Fortunately, a tiny bit of conscious intervention can be enough to put your thinking back on track. Being creative is easier if you don't promise to deliver more than you can."
scorpio,2010-02-10,"You could become a temporary workaholic today because you want others to see how conscientious you can be in a crisis situation. But it's easy to take your good intentions too far by assuming such a heavy burden of responsibilities that you cannot do a competent job at any single task. Remember, this isn't an all-or-nothing situation; you can effectively moderate between the extremes by finding a healthy balance between work and play."
sagittarius,2010-02-10,"You may be ready to throw in the towel today because it seems as if you need to work extra hard just to stay current. But don't give up; your determination still might pay off. Waiting for your contributions to be acknowledged isn't much fun, but delayed gratification is surely better than none at all."
capricorn,2010-02-10,You may be torn between following your bliss and having to come through on a promise that you already made and can no longer take back. You could even become upset with someone you like today because it seems as if he or she says one thing and does another. Forget about engaging in a dialogue to point out the problems; just respond to the change of plans with a dose of compassion and a dash of humor.
aquarius,2010-02-10,"Mercury's entry into your sign might have you thinking about yourself from a new perspective now. But in reality you aren't the only person to consider. If you are distracted by your own cleverness, diffuse a potentially challenging situation by talking with others about what they want in the days ahead. Remember, it's not just about your needs, even if it's tempting to only focus on yourself now. Establishing healthy relationships depends on allowing for multiple points of view."
pisces,2010-02-10,"You may be so enthusiastic today that you try several different approaches before giving your final approval to any one of them. However, once you decide, you are tempted to put all your eggs into one basket and see what happens. A singular focus is not the smartest method at this time. Instead, keep your options open and continue to try different ideas until something clicks."
aries,2010-02-11,"You may desire kinder and gentler people in your life now, yet you aren't ready to give up your attachment to some unknown experience that is lurking just around the corner. You could be quite comfortable with the paradox of being attracted to an impossible dream, but that doesn't mean your acceptance of this self-created dilemma is amenable to those around you. Don't try to explain your motives today, for others probably won't understand. Just do what you can to balance the extremes so you make the best choices possible."
taurus,2010-02-11,"Your key planet Venus moves into friendlier territory today, raising your hopes for more pleasurable times ahead. It may even seem like a new romance is within reach or an old one is rejuvenated in time for Valentine's Day. It's likely that your social life will continue to improve as long as you don't put too much effort into accomplishing the impossible at work. Knowing when to walk away from an unfinished task can surely improve the quality of your personal life now."
gemini,2010-02-11,"This is a great time for you to make plans because your mind is extra sharp. You are not afraid to assert yourself and may be more willing than usual to take a calculated risk. But negative emotions could get in the way if you try to avoid your feelings because they'll just reappear as a projection. Express your feelings as succinctly as you can, without blaming anyone else for your emotional response."
cancer,2010-02-11,"The possibility of exploring new territory or enrolling in an educational program is quite exciting to you now, but nothing will likely reach fruition unless you take the initiative. Others may believe that you are overreaching, but their judgments of your alleged impracticality aren't the final words on the matter. Luckily, you can successfully continue with your current plans as long as you don't exhaust yourself trying too hard."
leo,2010-02-11,"You may feel as if an opportunity for a friendship or romance is beginning to fade. Luckily, you haven't lost your chance to make it work. Actually, it might not be prudent to assert yourself now just because you are impatient. Instead, actively keep your dreams alive within the realms of your imagination instead of attempting to move mountains."
virgo,2010-02-11,"It's challenging to separate your rational ideas from your feelings today as the sensitive Moon joins your key planet, Mercury. Your words carry an emotional charge that arises from your subconscious mind and you might not even realize their impact. But paying close attention to what you say can help. If you find yourself remembering previous similar experiences and retelling stories from your past, simply bring your focus back to what's happening in the present moment."
libra,2010-02-11,"Your key planet Venus enters your 6th House of Daily Obligations today, putting you into a much better mood about fulfilling your current work responsibilities. Instead of complaining about your plight, selectively share your vision of what it will be like when the job is finally finished. But it's not just talking about what you're going to do that will do the trick; roll up your sleeves now and get busy."
scorpio,2010-02-11,"Telling someone special what you want today isn't all that simple, for there is more going on than meets the eye. The entry of seductive Venus into your romantic 5th House suggests that you are in for more pleasurable times. Meanwhile, you'll need to exercise caution because you are working with increased magnetism, enabling you to be quite convincing. Don't get greedy and ask for more than you need."
sagittarius,2010-02-11,"You are feeling better about skipping over the details now and heading right for the big ideas without any additional planning. You can quickly grasp the overarching concepts, but have less and less interest for the countless little things that must be put in order before a project can be successful. Don't force yourself to deal with the minutiae today. Give yourself a few more days before returning to the drawing board."
capricorn,2010-02-11,"You may need to handle a variety of little emergencies that surface today, but you should be able to have a positive impact on your immediate environment while smoothing out the bumps. Still, something weird can happen that reveals an unseen side of a situation. Things are more complicated than they appear. Don't be afraid to use your imagination, instead of facts, to map out your smartest strategy."
aquarius,2010-02-11,"Your innate intelligence comes in handy today as the Moon aligns with clever Mercury. But it might take you a while to arrive at the solution to a complex problem if you are sidetracked by lovely daydreams and unfulfilled fantasies. Instead of setting aside what you started and beginning all over again, you'll get faster results by improving upon what you've already done."
pisces,2010-02-11,"Your relationships are likely to be more satisfying now as lovely Venus returns to your sign, bringing pleasure, beauty and creativity. But it's still difficult to enjoy the benefits of the planet of love because your mind is working overtime analyzing the interpersonal dynamics. Others might not even notice that you are preoccupied today. Unfortunately, the more you attempt to force things back into place, the more difficult it gets. Stop struggling to make sense of everything; the complexity will dissipate on its own."
aries,2010-02-12,You could get into an unnecessary battle over a minor issue today as your key planet Mars stays busy rubbing unyielding Pluto the wrong way. Everything might appear to be going along fine until all of a sudden major parts start to fall apart. Don't panic; just keep returning to the basics and try to simplify your life.
taurus,2010-02-12,"You might feel as if you are going through the motions today, and it's challenging to connect your heart to what's happening. Although your required efforts at work can be at cross-purposes to your ideal path, there's no reason for you to retreat. Keep your eyes on the distant goal; steady work will be rewarded by noticeable progress."
gemini,2010-02-12,"Your key planet Mercury is stabilized by an easy trine to realistic Saturn today, giving you an air of superiority. Although it sounds like you know the truth about nearly everything now, your overconfidence could grow annoying to others unless you make an effort to keep it in check. Consciously understating your position will help, but it will take continuing vigilance on your part to get along with others."
cancer,2010-02-12,"The emotionally detached Aquarian Moon can increase your awkwardness today by revealing differences between how you feel and what action you finally take. You are eager to talk about your needs, but don't want to cause any trouble for others. Nevertheless, it's still important to state your truth out loud now, even if it means upsetting the status quo."
leo,2010-02-12,"Your personality shines when you are happy, but it may take extra effort today as relentless Pluto casts its intense shadow onto your life. You might believe that you can just overpower the psychological darkness with your light, but it will probably require more than just good intentions. Search for the truth and when you catch a glimpse of it, don't be afraid to embrace it any way you possibly can."
virgo,2010-02-12,"Logical Mercury is your ruling planet and its connection today with taskmaster Saturn indicates how hard you must work now in order to be noticed by those who matter. However, you could get trapped by your own eagerness to perform. Keep in mind that too many flourishes can get in the way of your true message. Don't try to make it sound pretty; just speak from your heart."
libra,2010-02-12,"Communicator Mercury forms an eloquent trine with authoritative Saturn today, temporarily turning you into a force to be reckoned with. Every word you speak carries more power than you realize, so think before you start running off at the mouth. Saturn's going to be in your sign for a couple of years, so you might as well begin learning about establishing healthy limits now."
scorpio,2010-02-12,"Your frustration level could be high today as you run through the final preparations for an important event. You have made your list and checked it twice, yet something is still missing. Instead of wasting time looking for hidden treasure, focus your attention on what you already know. Minor improvements are better than splashy innovations right now."
sagittarius,2010-02-12,"You might have your heart set on lofty goals now, but the practical reality is that you must take care of today's business before starting anything new. You won't be happy if your friends are leaning on you to join them for an activity that's outside your primary interests. Nevertheless, overcoming your irritation is necessary so you can be free enough to do what you want."
capricorn,2010-02-12,"Your key planet Saturn receives an intellectual boost today, blessing you with an air of authority. You can express yourself casually, yet still be followed by people who want to know your point of view and how you arrived at it. Instead of setting up more arbitrary rules and avoiding those who think you have a worthwhile perspective, graciously accept your role as a teacher for now."
aquarius,2010-02-12,"Mercury in futuristic Aquarius pushes you even further while its current trine to Saturn warns you to wait. But you don't like either idea much and could reject the straightforward choices in favor of one that's not in the playbook. No matter how irritated you are with someone placing limits on you, rest assured that you alone have the power to break out of the preexisting pattern. Freedom is within your reach."
pisces,2010-02-12,"Your imagination is an even richer source of inspiration than usual, but you may not be interested in delving into your fantasies today unless they can also be useful in the real world. However, powerful friends could give you a hard time, especially if they think your ideas aren't grounded. Don't waste words trying to convince others that your strategy is sound. Just go ahead with your plan; they'll jump in once they see your progress."
aries,2010-02-13,"Today's independent Aquarius New Moon enlivens your 11th House of Social Networking, yet your volume may be turned up louder than you realize. You can talk up a storm, but your words could leave damage in their path unless you are sensitive to other people's feelings. Don't wait until someone in charge tells you to cool your jets. Remember, self-restraint is a sign of maturity. Express yourself in a way that doesn't overpower everyone else."
taurus,2010-02-13,"Today's New Moon falls in your 10th House of Status, reminding you that your freedom is extra important to you now. However, it still doesn't override your basic drive to establish security. Luckily, you can successfully play both ends of the independence-safety spectrum by balancing calculated risks with the simplicity of doing something familiar."
gemini,2010-02-13,"You could easily fall into an analytical trap set by today's Aquarius New Moon in your 9th House of Philosophy, but you could avoid the argument completely with a bit of conscious forethought. Even if you attempt to set the record straight, your ideas don't quite correspond with the points you are trying to make. Instead of getting caught up in proving that you are right, focus on the process of the discussion."
cancer,2010-02-13,"The intensity of the Aquarius New Moon isn't obvious to you at first, but you may be dealing with someone who needs more freedom than you want. In fact, messenger Mercury's harmonious trine with stabilizing Saturn could make you less interested in fun and frivolities now. Don't worry about being too serious; it's more important to maintain your integrity than to live up to someone else's expectations."
leo,2010-02-13,"Today's New Moon gives the current pile-up of planets in your 7th House of Companions a new sense of power. But although making a change may become more complicated now, it's a major one and will take time to unfold. Allow your feelings to work their way to the surface. But remember that this isn't the same old story of unrequited love. The choice is yours, so make time to reconnect with an estranged relative or a long-lost buddy to write a new chapter to your story."
virgo,2010-02-13,"You feel as if you need to be everywhere today, for no matter where you turn, the same messages are coming through. Nevertheless, there is enough variety in your current experiences to dazzle you and keep you thoroughly distracted from what you really should be doing. Luckily, you are able to put yourself back on track by consciously exerting just enough self-control."
libra,2010-02-13,"The New Moon begins a creativity cycle for you today as it highlights your 5th House of Self-Expression. But you'll need to fight for your right to be artistic. You may even face some tough resistance, but luckily it can be overcome if you put your mind to it. The most important thing is to understand that this is a turning point and you would be wise to push for what you want."
scorpio,2010-02-13,"Today's Aquarius New Moon is in your 4th House of Foundations. Although you may be interested in joining a social organization, you'll also want to stay at home and give extra attention to your family now. It's crucial to temporarily let go of your outside attachments so you can give your loved ones all they deserve. Establishing priorities is crucial; you'll be able to pick up the slack at work soon enough."
sagittarius,2010-02-13,"Your day may be filled with errands, shopping, telephone calls and more. The New Moon in your 3rd House of Immediate Environment suggests you would be wise to finish as many old projects as possible, so you are ready to make your move when the next big thing comes along. But start now; you cannot afford to wait any longer."
capricorn,2010-02-13,"Don't let anyone push you around when it comes to your financial affairs. Today's New Moon activates your 2nd House of Money, so this is a smart time to put new processes into place that establish your credibility. If you don't have a real budget, meet with a professional and create one. If you already have a budget, it's time to start walking your talk. Taking responsibility now will minimize problems in the future."
aquarius,2010-02-13,"Today's New Moon falls in your sign, bringing you strength of purpose. Although you are now able to clarify what you want in your life, mood swings could confuse your otherwise straightforward intellectual approach. However, your friends and family may prove to be a problem as they try to get you to change your mind. Instead of arguing your case, let your actions speak for themselves."
pisces,2010-02-13,"Much of your life is now taking place in realms that are not measurable by scientific methods. The New Moon falls in your 12th House of Divine Inspiration, blessing you with visions of a more perfect life. Don't try to rationalize these bursts of creativity; instead, do what you can to integrate your inspirations into your most routine and mundane chores."
aries,2010-02-14,"You are in a phase of steady progress as your key planet Mars aligns with hardworking Saturn for the next few days. Things that might normally bother you won't be so problematic now, but you will need to take care of minor annoyances as they arise or they'll create more trouble later. Balancing your fantasies with a healthy dose of reality will actually allow your dreams to become even more meaningful."
taurus,2010-02-14,"Your key planet Venus usually brings pleasure, but she can be quite annoying today. Still, it's not a smart idea for you to avoid the issues of love that she brings to the table. Surprisingly, you can derive great enjoyment by pushing against your discomfort instead of slipping into denial. But don't overcompensate by chasing unrealistic dreams. Keeping it real is your best strategy for now."
gemini,2010-02-14,"Going after your heart's desire can be complicated today, for your partner's needs may be opposed to yours. You can be pretty quick to set your dreams aside in order to win the affection of someone special. But denying your feelings is not a smart idea; you'll just end up frustrated if you do. Take it slow and let your partner know what's troubling you. Your only chance to work through your differences now is to be totally honest."
cancer,2010-02-14,"You may feel as if you have been touched by a wave of optimism, even if the joy is just out of your reach. You could work yourself into an unpleasant state of anxiety and frustration if you focus on what you don't have in your life. Instead, be content taking little steps toward a goal that may or may not be attainable. Don't worry about getting there; your challenge is to find satisfaction in the process and not the final achievement."
leo,2010-02-14,"Today's magical Sun-Neptune conjunction illuminates your 7th House of Partners with a rosy-gold glow, making it difficult for you to see your partner in a clear light. But you aren't very satisfied now with appearances and are driven to go deeper in a relationship. Establishing a real connection with someone special can raise uncomfortable issues, but you'll be richer in spirit if you face them."
virgo,2010-02-14,"The current emphasis on your 7th House of Relationships could turn this Valentine's Day into a memorable one, but it might play out very differently than you originally expected. Letting go of your personal agenda may not be the easiest thing for you to do, but it can be the most sensible way to patch up a misunderstanding and move on."
libra,2010-02-14,"Loving Venus is your key planet and she is in high demand today, raising your hopes for a sweet Valentine's Day. But you'll be irritated at someone if he or she doesn't come through with the goods. You want a partner who is willing or even eager to be romantic. Be prepared to take a magical day even further than planned, but don't place blame on anyone else if you don't get exactly what you want."
scorpio,2010-02-14,"Setting yourself up with unrealistic expectations could lead to disappointment, yet the emphasis is on your romantic 5th House of Fun and Games, indicating the potential for a good time. Nevertheless, illusory Neptune's involvement can muck everything up if you get your signals for fact and fiction crossed. Remember to keep reminding yourself of the differences between what you know and what you want."
sagittarius,2010-02-14,"Although you may often be restless in love, you could be willing to spend some quiet time around the house with your sweetheart today as the planets congregate in your 4th House of Home and Family. But this may not be sufficient to fulfill your fantasies, leaving you with a feeling of dissatisfaction. You might have to contend with a bit of malaise no matter what you choose to do, so just accept the dilemma and make the most of your day."
capricorn,2010-02-14,"You could have a hard time letting go of your ambitions now, but holding on to them can be rather discouraging. Luckily, you don't need to change your goals, but setting them aside for the day may be the smartest thing you can do. Giving yourself some downtime allows you to connect with someone you love on a deeper level. You will be able to return to work rejuvenated and ready for another round."
aquarius,2010-02-14,"Your dreams are confused with reality now, and nothing you do seems to help you know what's truly happening. Unfortunately, the more you struggle trying to figure things out, the worse it gets. But suspending disbelief, like you do when watching a movie, allows you to turn the frustration into magic. Just enjoy your experience today without judgment. You can always put things into proper perspective tomorrow."
pisces,2010-02-14,"Venus the love planet is totally engaged in your sign today, but it may be difficult to know what's too little or too much. You could be seeking the fine tuner all day, only to be annoyed that you cannot get rid of the distracting static that prevents you from distinguishing your dreams from what's actually happening. Trust what surfaces now without labeling it as fact or fantasy."
aries,2010-02-15,"You may feel in control now because you know the consequences of what you are doing and have had the opportunity to consider your options before choosing your present course of action. The rewards may be quite satisfying, although it could take a while for your labors to bear fruit. Setting a long-term pace today is more important than your actual production, so keep your eyes on the future."
taurus,2010-02-15,"You are not interested in anything superficial today because your key planet Venus is dancing with Pluto, the lord of darkness. Unconscious desires can motivate your interactions with others as unresolved issues rise to the surface. Fortunately, you currently have the emotional fortitude to stick with a serious discussion that can rejuvenate an old relationship with new meaning or fire up a new one with passion."
gemini,2010-02-15,"What you say today may be less important than what you do because your actions not only speak louder than your words, they also have longer lasting consequences. You have a significant opportunity now, but it may not be obvious at first. Think carefully about what you are about to do because a well-considered decision can assure the results you want down the line."
cancer,2010-02-15,"You have a difficult choice to make today as your plans come up for reconsideration. It might be easier if you were the only person involved, but someone else's needs must also be included. Opening your mind to think about your goals from a wider perspective can be very enlightening as you see possibilities that you previously overlooked. Don't be too quick to say no to anything now or you could miss a wonderful opportunity to strengthen a relationship."
leo,2010-02-15,"Although you may feel as if you've traveled this territory before, retrograde Mars is stabilized by his supportive aspect to realistic Saturn today. This gives you an opportunity to concentrate your intentions and focus on what's most important. Other harmonious aspects conspire to clear the path toward your destination, but getting there is ultimately your responsibility."
virgo,2010-02-15,"Someone may be acting overly sweet today and you might not know what to do about it. Perhaps you're not clear about what you want in general. Or, maybe, the other person's intentions are questionable. Either way, your best strategy is to carefully explore all avenues before deciding your course of action. Luckily, your reasoning is sound now, even if the options are confusing at first. Once you've done your research, make your choice and stick to it."
libra,2010-02-15,"Even if you have lots of hard work to do, the rewards appear to follow now that pleasurable Venus is harmoniously connected with intense Pluto. You won't be satisfied with just having a nice experience today; you want something that goes beyond the ordinary. Luckily, you are currently blessed with the patience to wait for the right moment and the drive to follow through on your plan. Remember, once you know that the timing is right, don't hesitate to make your move."
scorpio,2010-02-15,"Your two key planets, red-hot Mars and formidable Pluto, are each involved in a supportive sextile, turning the challenges of the day into a rewarding journey. You may be feeling the creative juices flowing and would be smart to find ways to concentrate on your self-expression. But this isn't just about personal issues; it's time to set new goals and then go after them now that karmic Saturn is sextile Mars in your 10th House of Career. Do what you can to stabilize things at work."
sagittarius,2010-02-15,"Your life might feel like an adventure today, but with so many planets in your 4th House of Security you may be doing more armchair traveling than real trekking. Luckily, you could make a lot of progress now by saving money for a future trip. Sometimes the planning stage of a getaway can be as much fun as the real thing, so take your time and enjoy the process."
capricorn,2010-02-15,"Although today might be a back-to-work day, you may have lingering memories from the weekend that are reverberating in your thoughts. Luckily, you should be able to juggle your personal and business worlds quite effectively, while keeping the two of them apart. But don't miss the powerful opportunity to make something important happen at work. You have the right balance between intention and follow-through now, enabling you to accomplish whatever you initially set out to do."
aquarius,2010-02-15,"If you are feeling good about recent activities, you could be emotionally disposed to spend money today on something you don't really need. Naturally, buying something nice for yourself can be a lovely thing to do, but you might be drawn toward an item that is more extravagant than you can really afford. Ask yourself whether or not your potential purchase is really such a good idea before you face possible regrets in a few days."
pisces,2010-02-15,"This is another powerful day for you, especially if you can let your imagination lead the way. But fueling your life with your dreams is not an excuse to be completely unrealistic. It's almost as if you must maintain a double life now; you have your head up in the clouds, but also need to keep your feet firmly planted on the ground."
aries,2010-02-16,"You may be quite comfortable in your current mode of operation, even if you must put up with minor annoyances, such as paying bills, going to work and handling other responsibilities. Nevertheless, an unexpected surprise today could lead to a spiritual opening if you don't assume that you already have all the answers."
taurus,2010-02-16,"Too much of a good thing can still feel pretty damn good today as opulent Jupiter joins your key planet Venus. You might feel rather lazy even as your senses are awakening. Everything would be copacetic if your noisy thoughts didn't get in the way now. Still, it's wise to enjoy yourself while the stars are on your side."
gemini,2010-02-16,"You are able to pull one brilliant idea after another out of thin air today, and it's no effort on your part because it's fun and easy. But turning a thought into something that's useful is more challenging. Still, you shouldn't struggle now. Let go of your desire for a specific final outcome or you might keep running into dead ends. Stay open to the possibilities to better your chances for success."
cancer,2010-02-16,"It's easy for you to gloss over an important fact today if it gets in the way of your perspective. You may be less concerned with the truth than you are with pleasure now, so you're not likely to go too far out of the way for the sake of integrity. A bit of self-indulgence is fine, but don't overdo it or you'll be spending too much time recovering from your lack of good judgment."
leo,2010-02-16,"Today's lovely Venus-Jupiter conjunction is in your 8th House of Intimacy, tempting you to push through residual fears that are stirred when you are in love. Thankfully, the potential reward is great enough that the risk doesn't seem so bad now. But you still have some work to do, for old unresolved issues may resurface once you are closer to the prize."
virgo,2010-02-16,"A big-hearted angel could enter your life now, bringing love, a business opportunity or a chance to travel. Receiving a generous gift is another possible manifestation of the wonderful Venus-Jupiter conjunction falling in your 7th House of Partners. Either way you're likely to be pleasantly surprised, assuming that you are able to accept what is being offered to you at this time."
libra,2010-02-16,"It's understandably difficult to motivate yourself if you are already content. Today's Venus-Jupiter conjunction in your 6th House of Work suggests that your easygoing demeanor enables you to leave unpleasant chores for another day. But you won't likely be able to avoid all your responsibilities as erratic Uranus now releases a surprise of his own, revealing a few twists and turns. Be smart; taking care of your obligations early in the day will minimize any complications."
scorpio,2010-02-16,"Although you may feel a growing urge to express yourself artistically, you may be blocked until a sudden burst of creative energy gets things flowing again. However, this is not a license to procrastinate, even if you feel a bit lazy. Don't worry about where the process might go; just jump in and let it unfold spontaneously."
sagittarius,2010-02-16,"It's difficult for anyone to bring you down today because delicious Venus is joining your key planet Jupiter in your 4th House of Security. But your unabashed overconfidence can also put someone in distress unless you moderate your optimism. Nobody likes a know-it-all, even if you turn on the charm. You might be able to impress others more easily now, but it won't likely be worth the price you must pay."
capricorn,2010-02-16,"Your creativity today depends upon your ability to skillfully use a tool in an original manner. Paradoxically, you might not make much progress if you try too hard. It's really not about accomplishing anything specific now; it's about feeling good about your work. If you can find a way to enjoy yourself, you might be surprised at how easy it is to communicate your pleasure to others."
aquarius,2010-02-16,"It's not easy for you to settle back and relax today because you can get swept up in the anticipation of what happens next. Even if something wonderful catches you by surprise, it still will be challenging to stop and enjoy it. Fortunately, you can make a conscious decision to bask in the present moment instead of running off to try something else, but you may have to repeatedly remind yourself to stay put."
pisces,2010-02-16,"Today's lovely Venus-Jupiter conjunction occurs in your sign, making it tough for you to miss the positive effects of this cosmic blessing. You are able to step gracefully into the natural flow of events, encouraging others with your undying optimism. But remember, if you take the ""everything is beautiful"" approach too far, a sudden twist of fate could be a wake-up call that prevents you from slipping further into denial."
aries,2010-02-17,"You are so quick to respond to those around you that it might appear as if you have something to hide, but your reactions are more the result of eagerness than secrecy. Your feelings are deep and complex now, yet your desire to be in the moment can cause you to miss the buried intensity. Don't be afraid to enter conversations that lead you toward uncertain ground. It's in these places of not-knowing that your truths will be expressed."
taurus,2010-02-17,"You want to meet your obligations today, but may be fearful about making a promise that you cannot keep. You are particularly aware of your own shortcomings and don't want to set yourself up for failure. However, being overly concerned about your ability to follow through now is counterproductive. It's of no value to judge the current situation by what you did or didn't do in the past. Keep things as simple as possible; do what you can and then let it go."
gemini,2010-02-17,"It's challenging today to keep your dreams from slipping into a place that feels uncomfortable. It's not that your best fantasies turn into nightmares; it's just that something comes to light that allows you to see an imperfection in your current strategy. Don't waste time worrying about what could happen. Instead, incorporate the new information into your plan and act on what has been revealed."
cancer,2010-02-17,"You are a champ at sinking into the deep recesses of your subconscious mind, but today's inner journey might not be so easy. Current relationship tensions may require you to face a serious issue. You could get yourself into trouble if you believe that you can take control and manipulate everything to go your way. However, you are in for a real treat if you surrender to your feelings. Your emotional flexibility opens the door to a profound and beautiful transformation."
leo,2010-02-17,"Although you can bump into a few old fears along the way to satisfaction today, the prognosis is generally good. Whether you're worrying about abandonment, professional failure or letting someone down, being forthright about your concerns is healthy as long as you don't dwell on them. Happiness arrives on a winding road now if you are willing to take a few detours as you go along."
virgo,2010-02-17,"The true meaning of serving others may be on your mind now. Perhaps you dream about cashing in on your current life to go help earthquake victims. Or maybe you compare yourself to someone like Mother Teresa, only to realize how far you fall short of your ideal. Fortunately, this process can be very healthy if you don't take it too far. In the meantime, find something you can to do improve someone's life in a small way and then do it today."
libra,2010-02-17,It's easy to imagine the great works of art you could produce if only you were as talented as one of the masters. Imagine what you would do if you didn't have to think about earning a living or handling everyday responsibilities. But don't give yourself a reason not to express yourself. Make time today for a creative endeavor as a way to get in touch with your playful side.
scorpio,2010-02-17,"It's a dead end to create scenarios fueled by what your life might have been like if only this or that happened differently. But today it's tempting to dream of going back and changing a critical event. Nevertheless, there is a distinct gulf between these fantasies and the way in which your life is playing out. Using your imagination, reach across the barrier of time and bring something you can use from your past into the present moment. Remember, change can only happen in the here and now."
sagittarius,2010-02-17,"You may be so eager to get things done today that you are distracted from something quite significant. You could miss an important but subtle message if you don't take time to listen to what your subconscious is trying to tell you about your relationship to someone close to you. Don't be cavalier and lightly pass off the symbolism of a fantasy or dream. Everything contains meaning, yet it's up to you now to discover what it is."
capricorn,2010-02-17,"It's time for you to reconsider a formative experience in your life that motivated you to be serious-minded, make ambitious plans and attempt to succeed. Trying to reach your goals is admirable, but it's helpful to remember why you set them in the first place. Dealing with money issues and other obligations is an ongoing chore, so don't miss this opportunity to expand your horizons and increase your options before you make any significant decisions."
aquarius,2010-02-17,"It may seem as if you haven't been like your old self in years with dreamy Neptune in your sign for the last decade. Now it's time to look back and think about all the changes you've been through, especially the ones that elude logical understanding. You are in a gradual transition phase, and your realizations today could be instrumental in making the choices that will redefine your life in years to come. Be patient; this kind of transformation takes time."
pisces,2010-02-17,"You are ready to plow ahead, but first must have one more long drink from the cup of nostalgia. Delving into your past could be a helpful endeavor, but it also can become self-indulgent if you use it to escape from reality. Although you long for a spiritual connection with the cosmos, there are opportunities for love and money in the present moment that you would be wise to pursue."
aries,2010-02-18,You may believe that you are on a roll today as you boldly share your plan with a confidant. But you might not have thought it out as efficiently as you imagined and could be surprised to discover that your foundation isn't as strong as you'd like. Don't worry; all is not lost. You can still facilitate a magical transformation if you are willing to let go of your previous assumptions.
taurus,2010-02-18,"You may already be bored with what you have accomplished at work and now begin to seek your next round of rewards in a less practical manner. Instead of trying to increase your professional status, you might be happier just to be accepted in your social circle. Connecting with friends currently has more to offer you than doing what is most sensible. You can always return to your work tomorrow."
gemini,2010-02-18,"You are trying to remain flexible with respect to important long-term decisions that must be made, but your tendency now is to make a choice and attempt to stick with it. Unfortunately, this kind of determination won't help you much. It might, however, tempt you to set lofty goals, rather than creating more measurable checkpoints. Reach for what is easily attainable first and then you can expand your horizons with confidence."
cancer,2010-02-18,"Something weird may be happening at work or in a relationship, but you cannot quite put your finger on it. The more you try to gather specific data, the less clear your vision becomes. Fortunately, you have a good sense of the big picture these days, which enables you to make a healthy choice, even without knowing all the facts. Don't wait until you have finished your research; let your intuition guide you into the unknown."
leo,2010-02-18,"As the Sun joins three other planets in compassionate Pisces, you are driven to understand someone's emotional responses in a deeper manner than ever before. Paradoxically, you might not want anyone to know the very same things about you. Remember, developing intimacy is a two-way street. Loving others is not enough; you must also open your heart so they can love you in return."
virgo,2010-02-18,"The Sun's month-long visit to your 7th House of Partners shifts the focus of your life onto those you interact with on a daily basis. Instead of basing your decisions on your needs, you must also consider what others want, too. Fortunately, this can ultimately work out to your benefit, for it's easier to relax and enjoy yourself when your friends and loved ones are happy, too."
libra,2010-02-18,"Your attempts to hold a centrist position now could backfire, especially if you are avoiding taking a stand because you don't want to hurt someone's feelings. The problem is that most everyone else doesn't care which side you take, because your choice affects you more than others. Snap out of it; any decision you make today will be better than none at all."
scorpio,2010-02-18,"You are intrigued by trying a new approach to something you've been doing on an ongoing basis as the enterprising Aries Moon visits your 6th House of Daily Routine. But you aren't driven by your clever ideas or intellectual brilliance now; instead, you are receiving symbolic communications from your subconscious mind. Turn off your analytical thinking and open an intuitive communication channel that links you directly with your feelings."
sagittarius,2010-02-18,"You'll need to tread carefully now that the Sun is in diffusive Pisces because it exacerbates your natural tendency to skip over the details. Your dreams swell like the seas, yet it's challenging to harness the power of your imagination. Still, you are able to share your ideas with others as long as you don't try to narrow your vision into a logical presentation. Instead of appealing to the head, you'll be better off aiming for the heart."
capricorn,2010-02-18,"Although you are usually cautious about getting involved in emotional entanglements, you might be ready to soften your approach now. But you must be prepared to do more than just talk about your willingness to take a risk. Whether or not you are able to bring a current attraction to fruition, keep reminding yourself, ""Nothing ventured, nothing gained."""
aquarius,2010-02-18,"Your birthday sign is officially over and you may feel a tinge of disappointment when you realize that the excitement of what you began must now settle down. Although the buzz of rushing out of the starting gate feels good to you, it's time to transform your new idea into a strategy that has stability and will last into the uncertain future."
pisces,2010-02-18,"The Sun's return to your fishy sign today dissolves your boundaries while raising the level of your intuition. No longer are you isolated and alone, even if you are doing something by yourself. Instead, you are now becoming a member of a larger school that thinks, swims and reacts as a single unit. Your current practice is allowing yourself to be a part of the greater whole, without necessarily giving up what makes you a unique individual."
aries,2010-02-19,"You could become annoyed with yourself today if you cannot comfortably fit your emotions into the current set of circumstances. Surely, it would be easier for all involved if you just played the role that reality hands you now. But the more you try to deny your feelings, the more difficult everything becomes. Do everyone a favor and be honest from the start while being careful not to blame others for your dilemma."
taurus,2010-02-19,"Your life is more pleasant when your friends encourage you to express your feelings and then acknowledge what you have said. But they don't always listen to you carefully enough to discern the real meaning of your words. Although it seems that you are being heard today, others will only scratch the surface. Be patient; you can inadvertently push someone away if you say too much, too fast."
gemini,2010-02-19,"Instead of relying on your quick wit and your ability to think on your feet today, you are better off closing the window on words and opening your senses to direct impressions. You don't need to rationalize your choices now, nor do you need to justify an intuitive hit that leads you in a particular direction. If you have a hunch, follow it and fill in the logic afterward."
cancer,2010-02-19,"Your work associates and personal friends can be the source of great stability now, so be open to what they say. Although you don't have to blindly follow their lead, they might bring you a pragmatic approach that helps you to solve a tricky problem. But don't expect all your uncertainty to magically vanish; there's still a fair amount of mystery that will take time to untangle."
leo,2010-02-19,"You might have doubts about your current course of action, but rest assured that there's no clear right or wrong path now. No matter how you proceed, it's going to be a circuitous route and the detours will teach you more of what you need to learn than just zipping along a superhighway. Don't be too quick to judge yourself in a negative light because you'll have a very different perspective in a month or so when you look back at this time."
virgo,2010-02-19,You may feel a sense of relief today because you are able to see a friend or partner in a more realistic light. It's comforting when you can make concrete decisions based on what you know rather than having to fly by the seat of your pants. But you should still act with caution now because you may be missing a crucial bit of information that can catch you off guard if you become too complacent. It never hurts to pay extra attention.
libra,2010-02-19,"You may be confused about something that's happening at work today. Or maybe an old health concern has recently returned. Fortunately, you are in a position to turn an uncertainty in your favor as long as you don't expect to change everything overnight. Remember, it's not about controlling anything; it's about rolling with the incoming waves as gracefully as you can. Being flexible now is more important than a dramatic show of your will power."
scorpio,2010-02-19,"The Moon's visit to your 7th House of Partners today, combined with the Sun's entry into your 5th House of Love yesterday can be a powerful combination that opens your heart or, at least, increases your awareness of your desires. But karmic forces may be at work behind the scenes, either making or breaking a potential romance. Don't try to force the issue; let the current events unfold as naturally as possible."
sagittarius,2010-02-19,"Your key planet, Jupiter, shows you how to make the most of a situation, but Saturn can act like a strict parent today, telling you no without even listening to your story. If you try to do an end run around an authority figure now, your plan could quickly backfire on you. Your smartest strategy is to acknowledge those who are in control and work with them rather than against them. You'll accomplish more if you save your battles for another day."
capricorn,2010-02-19,"Taskmaster Saturn is your key planet and its role is instrumental today in anything you choose to accomplish. But you'll need to move slowly and steadily because overconfident Jupiter is making everything look easier now than it actually is. Luckily, you can reach your goals as long as you aren't tempted to take any shortcuts. Remember, you'll be fine if you stick to the tried and true methods instead of being so clever that you end up outsmarting yourself."
aquarius,2010-02-19,"You'll have fewer troubles today if you just remember that you cannot possibly know everything. As sensible as this sounds, a glimpse of awareness may be dangerous now because it can trick you into believing that you understand more than you really do. You will be able to get through the day unscathed and even make progress if you only act on the facts and not on your assumptions."
pisces,2010-02-19,"Magic follows you around today, but this can become annoying if you are expecting simple cause-and-effect relationships between what you do and what you want to happen. Your common sense isn't much use now because it leads you down a garden path of expectations that are sure to be turned asunder. However, once you accept that you've fallen down the rabbit hole, anything is possible as long as you don't attempt to exert too much control."
aries,2010-02-20,"Your key planet Mars has been retrograde for two months now, slowing down your progress. Today, its anxious quincunx with the Sun can remind you of everything you thought would be accomplished by now. But don't fall into the trap of stressing over things that cannot be altered. There's no need to be self-critical; just continue to do what makes the most sense with the understanding that you'll feel a surge forward when Mars turns direct in a couple of weeks."
taurus,2010-02-20,"It's more natural for you to appear at ease in a social setting today than it is for you to actually feel comfortable. You would be fine if you were able to attend to your own needs, but you may have to set them aside in order to be fully present for others. Whether it's family or friends -- or a conflict between them -- you'll do better if you keep your worries to yourself for now and focus your attention on external circumstances instead of yourself."
gemini,2010-02-20,"You may be stuck in a tricky set of circumstances, especially if you are unable to share your feelings that don't fit into the immediate situation. Although you are often a champion at holding the tension of two opposing perspectives, today's dilemma is more complex because there doesn't seem to be a balance point. Unfortunately, logic continues to fall short of delivering a positive solution. If possible, let the ambiguity remain unresolved until your direction becomes more apparent."
cancer,2010-02-20,"You want to let your dreams come true and would love to plan your life accordingly, but there are unrelenting responsibilities and issues about money that you must face. Rather than ignoring your current obligations today, you may need to postpone the things you would do if you were truly following the vision of your life purpose. Don't judge yourself too harshly. Instead, make the most of what you have in your life right now."
leo,2010-02-20,"You may feel as if your efforts are being blocked in little ways that are more annoying than debilitating. It's easy to believe that you could overcome a real obstacle by concentrating your attention and simply doing what is required. But today you might face one thing after another that eventually wears you down, even if each separate situation is quite manageable. Don't lose hope; your relentless optimism is your secret weapon."
virgo,2010-02-20,"It's difficult to understand what motivates others today and your lack of comprehension can create stress between you and a friend or partner. However, the truth is that you might just want more clarity than someone else can offer. And although you claim to know what makes you tick, it's possible that another person's uncertainty puts you in touch with your own. Seek your solution from within; don't expect anyone else to resolve your doubt."
libra,2010-02-20,"You thought you knew exactly what you wanted to do today, but it's much less clear now that the day is actually upon you. You may be willing to change your schedule, but going along with the flow could make you feel agitated when you think about what you would rather be doing. It's easy to work yourself into a state of anxiety if you believe you made a wrong decision. Don't second guess yourself; you can always return to your own agenda tomorrow."
scorpio,2010-02-20,"You may be losing faith in other people's abilities to deliver on their promises, but it's wise to hold a mirror up to yourself before judging anyone else too harshly. The truth is that the difference between your intentions and your actions may be painfully obvious to you now, so you see it more clearly in everyone else. Although you can easily feel compassion for someone else, it's time to cut yourself some slack and feel it for yourself, too."
sagittarius,2010-02-20,"You are of two minds today. There's one part that wants to stay home and let the world go by. You've been very busy and really could use a day of downtime. But the other part of you is itching to get out and do something fun. Even if you are tired, you don't want to miss an opportunity for an adventure. Although these two tracks seem quite different, try to create a day that allows you to honor both agendas."
capricorn,2010-02-20,"There may be a lot going on in your life now. You would prefer a simpler day with less activity, but you don't really have a choice today. Others are relying on you and you don't want to let them down. If you try to make anyone feel guilty about your sacrifices, it will only make your day worse. Instead of focusing your attention on what you wish you were doing, just show up with the best attitude possible. In the long run, everything will work out well for all involved."
aquarius,2010-02-20,"You may be acutely aware of your emotions now and how they distract you from what you want to communicate to someone close to you. You may even be afraid of starting the conversation because you know you won't be able to remain logical. Although it's sometimes difficult for you to express your feelings because they make you uncomfortably vulnerable, it's time to push up against your fears. Don't miss this opportunity to explore the fuzzy boundaries between your head and your heart."
pisces,2010-02-20,"You can usually rely on your ability to swim through unfamiliar waters. Even when you don't know where you are going, you are a champion of figuring it out along the way. Today, however, you might not be able to clearly see your destination through the fog of your own fantasies. Don't try to control the flow of events now; instead let the currents carry you and then make adjustments to your direction once clarity begins to return."
aries,2010-02-21,"You might not know which direction to turn because you are first pulled one way and then another today. For a moment everything is as clear as a bell and then just a few minutes later you aren't sure about much of anything. This could lead you into a state of anxiety if you feel pressured to make a choice right away. However, consciously delaying your decision can be enough to help you sail through the day."
taurus,2010-02-21,"Just as you feel like your life is finally settling down, something happens that breaks the day wide open, making you realize that it's not going to unfold according to your plan. Your instinct is to try to regain control over your schedule, but that's not a very smart idea now because it will only increase your frustration. You would be wise to loosen your grip and let the instability play through. Wait until you are feeling more grounded before taking the reins again."
gemini,2010-02-21,"Although you are eager for something exciting to happen today, you might react with concern when it finally does. Normally, you don't mind when you're not sure what's going to happen next. But now you could begin to miss the stability as soon as it starts to vanish. Nevertheless, avoid grasping for what you don't have because wanting something out of reach will only prevent you from finding satisfaction in the present moment."
cancer,2010-02-21,"You may appear calm as a clam, yet others may not realize that your hard outer shell is preventing them from seeing your unsettled emotions. Inwardly, you may be in a minor crisis as you consider whether something is important enough to fight for today. You must choose to continue toward a previous goal or to let go of something that's no longer working for you. Even if you are unsure, making a decision frees you up so that you are able to move on."
leo,2010-02-21,"It feels as if you have to decide your answer to the same question over and over again. This deja vu can be quite bothersome, especially when you realize that you really have been here before. But things are not quite the same as they once were. It could be helpful to make a list of what is the same, what is similar and what is different. Once you have isolated why this situation seems so familiar, you'll be better equipped to make a sound decision based upon what's really going on in this moment."
virgo,2010-02-21,"Normally, your power of concentration is good as long as you aren't overwhelmed by too many details. But you may find it increasingly difficult today to follow through on what you start because you cannot easily distinguish the useful information from the background noise. Don't let your desire for simplicity make you obsess over filtering out unimportant data. Just work with what you know to be true and stay focused on your goal."
libra,2010-02-21,"You may feel a sense of relief when you realize that you have more options than you originally thought. Paradoxically, the increased freedom of choice actually stabilizes your situation today because you don't feel as much of a need to rebel. Taking responsibility for creating your future is a mature way to avoid unnecessary conflict with authority."
scorpio,2010-02-21,"It's challenging for you to let go of your need for intensity, yet you can certainly see the value of taking a more easygoing approach today. You are open to the idea of going along with someone else's plan now, even if it's not as good as yours. But taking a halfhearted stance won't work. If you hold on to your previous desires, your willingness could turn into anger or resentment. Luckily, this can be prevented if you honestly talk about what you want right from the beginning."
sagittarius,2010-02-21,"Someone could breeze into your life and quickly have you chasing an idea as if it were a kite being blown around on a whimsical wind. But you are certain that you can get within reach -- and maybe you can. Nevertheless, you could waste a lot more energy than you expect running after something that may not be as good after it's caught. Think twice today before you start pursuing something you might later regret."
capricorn,2010-02-21,"You have a lot of fresh thoughts and, fortunately, many of them could make good sense. But your mind is running so fast now that you are on to the next inspiration before you've done anything about the previous one. Unfortunately, an important innovation might be forever lost if you don't take the time to write it down as it's unfolding. You cannot rely on your memory; carry around a notebook today and jot down your ideas when they happen."
aquarius,2010-02-21,"You are refreshed by waves of enthusiasm, but whatever new possibilities appear, the opportunities are quickly dampened today. You may become discouraged because you ride an idea to the top and then, just like a roller coaster, down it goes to the bottom again. Instead of trying to hold a thought above all others, breathe it in and out and observe it as it rises and falls. Your day should flow easily unless you attach your desires to one thing or another."
pisces,2010-02-21,"Your current conflict stems from your ability to derive meaning directly from symbols -- like fully understanding a dream as you are being told about it. But you may have a difficult time completely trusting your psychic powers now when your analytical mind arrives at a very different solution to the same dilemma. Remember, your strength comes from simultaneously holding conflicting points of view, without trying to force one correct answer."
aries,2010-02-22,"Taking on too much might be your normal approach to life, but things could get out of hand today if you don't tighten the reins early in the day. Unfortunately, you are tempted to put a lot on your schedule because you're afraid that you'll get bored if you don't. There's no need to worry; you'll have plenty to keep you busy, even if you cut back on your commitments. Remember, practicing self-restraint is the responsible thing to do."
taurus,2010-02-22,"You may be attracted to the idea of doing something spontaneous today, but previous commitments prevent you from following a whim. You could be annoyed at someone at work who plays the role of the heavyweight, even if he or she isn't really your boss. Fortunately, you'll enjoy yourself more than you expect once you accept that your obligations should come first."
gemini,2010-02-22,"It might feel as if you are being set up today as you are persuaded to participate in a project at work, only to later discover that you weren't told everything in advance. You don't mind learning as you go, but you don't like feeling as if certain facts were purposefully kept from you. Don't worry about backing out; no one will fault you for doing the best you can with what you now know."
cancer,2010-02-22,"You may feel insecure about what you are told today because it doesn't quite match up to what you already knew. You should be able to put all the pieces together and make sense out of it, but the current situation is very complicated and eludes logic. You might be tempted to set reasoning aside and just follow your instincts, but it's smarter now to keep going over the facts until they fit into place."
leo,2010-02-22,"It doesn't make you feel comfortable if someone avoids tackling an issue head-on. You prefer to stick with the facts just as they are today, until you are clear about what's happening. But others might be more inclined now to take a wait-and-see approach. Talking about it can smooth over bad feelings, but don't push for final resolution yet. Being patient will allow the outcome to grow more favorable in the days ahead."
virgo,2010-02-22,"Sometimes you find it nearly impossible to do several things at once because your mind naturally prefers a higher level of concentration. Today, however, you are more adept at multitasking, deftly moving between projects at work. Still, you may reach a point at which you feel like a juggler with one too many balls in the air. It's not worth the anxiety; just set something aside for a while as you tie up all the loose ends on everything else."
libra,2010-02-22,"You may appear less flexible than you actually are today, but anyone who judges you too quickly will surely miss the real deal. You are prepared to discuss your ideas and negotiate with others to bring them to fruition. What someone else might mistake for rigidity is just your determination to make a difference. You have your own agenda now; so don't waste your energy on playing a supporting role when you are the star attraction."
scorpio,2010-02-22,Your word is as good as gold and you are willing to forgo personal pleasure in order to fulfill your obligations today. It's not that you wouldn't prefer more fun in your life; it's just that your priorities are clear and you know that you can enjoy yourself more when you aren't concerned about the negative judgments that others might have if you let them down. Your pride in a job well done will bring its own brand of satisfaction.
sagittarius,2010-02-22,"You are hopeful for a positive outcome from the difficult personal growth work you have been doing, even if others have not yet noticed a difference. You might get a bit discouraged today because you are tired of waiting for results, especially if those around you seem to be having an easier time than you are now. But don't let your impatience spoil the good news that may be just around the next corner."
capricorn,2010-02-22,"You are in your element and can rise to the challenge, while others at work might buckle under the increased pressure now. Even if you don't want to work so hard today, you are able to muster up the necessary energy and do what is required to get the job done. If you are pulled off task by one thing or another, just refocus and get back on track as soon as you can. Your steadiness and determination combine to create the success you seek."
aquarius,2010-02-22,"Recently you've been making concrete plans that involve other people, but a difference of opinion today can slow progress. Instead of attempting to decide who is right and who is wrong, assume that everyone's perspective has something positive to offer. Someone else's point of view might be totally opposite from yours, but you will be more successful if the best elements are taken from each idea. Cooperation may not be easy, but it will produce the results you want."
pisces,2010-02-22,"You have enough facts at your disposal now. Sure, there's always more to learn, but additional information won't make your choice any easier, nor will it guarantee a better outcome. In fact, you may already have the answer you need. Instead of going over all the details one more time, give yourself a bit of space to clear your mind. This will allow the right decision to come to you naturally from the depths of your creative imagination."
aries,2010-02-23,"You are now able to explore your own mysterious fears that you have kept even from yourself. It's as if you can swim upstream and into the hidden backwaters of your subconscious, to places normally inaccessible to the light of consciousness. Be careful, for getting there might be easier than having to deal with what you find. Still, it's better to learn the truth than to be in denial."
taurus,2010-02-23,"You can be a guiding light to your friends today because you seem to be able to maintain both your current position and your focus on your future destination, in spite of the many distractions. Your steady approach to work is an inspiration to others, even if they cannot duplicate your methods. But don't become complacent, for the currents are continuing to shift and you might not realize how quickly you can lose your direction."
gemini,2010-02-23,"You'll need to apply yourself extra diligently today or you'll miss your opportunity to capitalize on your recent progress at work. There is an unusual combination of energies now blending in your favor, allowing you to remain light on your feet while also standing still long enough to finish what you start. But if you linger too long, the situation will grow stale and you'll be pushed to move on to something new."
cancer,2010-02-23,"You must work with someone who can be quite cold-hearted or even domineering today. Luckily, you can appear sympathetic now without actually lowering your guard. There's nothing wrong with temporarily befriending a person just for the sake of accomplishing your job. Your co-workers will respect your ability to get along with others. Keeping your goals in mind enables you to separate your personal feelings from your actions."
leo,2010-02-23,You want to do things differently and you might start off with an act of minor rebellion today just to keep everyone else on their toes. But you will quickly run into problems unless you can demonstrate your sincerity. Others won't care about how clever you are now as much as they need to know for certain that you are being real.
virgo,2010-02-23,"It's hard for you to settle down when you are pulled all over the place today. Luckily, your ability to analyze what's going on continues to keep you ahead of the game. You are highly stressed now, but you are collecting data from your varied experiences as fast as you can. You will reach a turning point sometime later in the day when you begin to withdraw your energy. Don't rush the process; your patient contemplation will lead to a new plan."
libra,2010-02-23,"Although you do appear focused on your work, there's more going on behind your gracious demeanor than your colleagues realize. They all believe that you are in the office to make their day run smoother. And even if this is your job, you also can see the larger picture and have a lot to offer beyond just being a social director. Find your true voice and don't be afraid to let others know what you can truly offer."
scorpio,2010-02-23,"A day that begins on a scattered note ends with the focus and concentration that you need. But even if you are able to accomplish a lot by eliminating some of the excess distractions, you still might not be able to find enough peace to fully realize your dreams. Try to avoid making a final judgment about the value of your work now. Just keep showing up and doing the best you can. Fortunately, you should have a more positive perspective within a few days."
sagittarius,2010-02-23,"Confusion gives way to outright conflict today, but a heated discussion can actually lead to an agreement. Unfortunately, you won't likely reach your goal and therefore may feel stuck in debate. Attempting to force a final solution now will only push the differences farther apart. Let the gulf remain while continuing to search for common elements. At some point, cooperation will overtake the need to win."
capricorn,2010-02-23,"You may be so fierce in your convictions that it's difficult to get along with everyone today. You could feel as if others are either with you or against you, with very little middle ground in between. Unfortunately, your intensity can push people away by forcing them to make harsher decisions than they might on their own. Tempering your extreme emotionality now with a bit of simple loving kindness will likely make the day better for all involved."
aquarius,2010-02-23,"You are usually able to manage your feelings by keeping them under wraps. But slowly, suppressed anger is likely to boil up to the surface today and even spill out into the open. Instead of wasting your energy by pretending that you are surprised, it's smarter to acknowledge what you have known for a while. And although your emotions may be inconvenient, it's important now for others to know your heart."
pisces,2010-02-23,"It's easier for you to trust your instincts, even when they lead you into a confrontational situation. Although others may not agree with you today, your perspective has deepened and the facts now resonate with a larger view of your life than ever before. But be careful; if you push your views onto someone else, the resultant conflict can undo the positive steps recently taken."
aries,2010-02-24,"You could have your hopes set high today, yet suddenly slip into one of those moods when discouragement overpowers your enthusiasm. But don't worry; it won't last. In the meantime, make the most out of your little melodrama by paying more attention to your emotions without necessarily being overly attached to what happens."
taurus,2010-02-24,"Although you could still be in a stressful situation, it feels more manageable today as your key planet Venus takes the spotlight. Unfortunately, you might not be ready to appear on center stage now as you try to stay out of sight. Your impromptu strategy won't likely work because you don't really have anywhere to hide. Fortunately, your simple presence may be enough for others, so you don't have to reveal more than you want to at this time."
gemini,2010-02-24,"You might try to see how close you can get to the heat of emotion today without being burned. You know that you are missing out on something, so you bravely push against your fear of the unknown. You are usually more comfortable when being rational, but now find yourself tempted by illogical feelings. However, if you attempt too much too fast, you'll be like the groundhog that, scared of its shadow, runs back to the imagined safety of his hole."
cancer,2010-02-24,"You are willing to put up with a bit of surface noise now because it won't distract you from what you are feeling. Even if everything isn't going according to your plan today, you know that you are giving it your best shot -- and that's all you can do. But don't be too quick to judge the outcome. If you stay focused on your goal, the path should eventually open up and allow you to continue on your way."
leo,2010-02-24,"Your motives are not very transparent, especially if you successfully keep your emotions hidden from others today. You may be particularly thin-skinned now and feel more secure when your co-workers and friends don't even know enough information to ask revealing questions. Paradoxically, someone's sweet support could annoy you as much as any resistance you encounter. Luckily, the obstacles will begin to fade when you become confident enough to share your feelings with those you trust."
virgo,2010-02-24,"You are a source of inspiration and strength for your friends today. If you are working on a team, others in the group will look to you for guidance. But you don't have to take a leadership role or tell anyone what to do. Just let everyone know what you're feeling as you respond to the changes around you. You are like the canary in the coal mine now; your instincts will show the way to the light at the end of the tunnel."
libra,2010-02-24,"Maintaining balance isn't so easy because your mood swings are quite apparent to others today. But there's no reason to deny what you are feeling, especially since everyone can already see your reactions. However, don't stop with the simple answer that only touches the surface issues. Your key planet Venus is aligned with mysterious Pluto, enabling you to reveal previously buried secrets that can be important to someone else."
scorpio,2010-02-24,"Your perspective is very intense now as your two key planets, Mars and Pluto, are both aspecting magnetic Venus. You can make something unpleasant seem perfectly acceptable today, and you don't even have to bend the truth to do it. Don't be afraid to go out of your way to explain what you see because you have a knack for being able to reframe concepts and open up other people's minds to a different way of viewing things."
sagittarius,2010-02-24,"You might seem a bit spaced out today, but this is because you are able to extend your vision farther into the future now. Although you may appear ungrounded at first, it will be quickly obvious to others that you are holding your imagination in check, your observations are acute and your thinking is sound. Don't be afraid to dream out loud as long as you maintain a bit of common sense."
capricorn,2010-02-24,"You might not be too clear about your current goals, for they are a moving target now and in the midst of transformation. But you cannot hold on to old plans as your overall perspective continues to evolve. Don't be overly concerned if you temporarily lose track of your destination. Letting go of your previous agenda will make more room for a new and improved one."
aquarius,2010-02-24,"You may be getting close to the edge of your comfort zone today, for you have had enough drama recently to last you for a while. It's not that you are totally against any sort of emotional outbreak; it's just that enough is enough and now you want to get back to the work at hand. Unfortunately, there may be no easy way out, so be patient while you go through the process. You could learn some valuable lessons if you just give it more time."
pisces,2010-02-24,"You have been through an emotional wringer, yet today you may be feeling like the pressure is easing and that you can breathe deeply again. You have no need to worry if your desires are not being fulfilled in this moment, for at least your wishes are being heard and progress toward satisfaction is imminent. Instead of waiting for a more perfect day, be open to the pleasures that find you in the here and now."
aries,2010-02-25,"Although your behavior can surprise your friends, sometimes you need to take time by yourself so you can recharge. Today, however, you are ready to come out of hiding and engage in another round of activity. But something is different about you now. Perhaps you aren't quite as eager to turn everything upside down just for a little excitement. Don't be afraid to show a gentler version of yourself if that's what you are feeling."
taurus,2010-02-25,"You may not be so eager to get involved in a group activity today because you have plenty of things to do and prefer to get on with your own work. Unfortunately, it's not as easy as you thought it would be to isolate yourself from your associates. Don't waste too much energy resisting if something happens to bring you closer to others. Keep in mind that you can connect with everyone else while still staying primarily focused on your obligations."
gemini,2010-02-25,"You are responsible for delivering on what you promised today and others may be depending on your work. Fortunately, you are more tenacious than usual and won't let go of a task until you are satisfied that you've done your best. Don't be afraid to take a risk and try an original approach. Trust your instincts; if it makes sense to you, it will probably work out fine."
cancer,2010-02-25,"There's no need to be overly flashy as you do your job today; your final product will speak louder than any attention you can bring to yourself. But quietly meeting your obligations during the day could very well be cause for a little celebration later in the evening. Even if you work without demanding any recognition, it's certainly okay to stand up and be seen when you are enjoying yourself afterward."
leo,2010-02-25,"Do whatever you can to tie up as many loose ends as possible today as the Moon completes her visit to your 12th House of Endings. It's crucial to be ready for whatever happens next as the Moon enters your sign later in the day. And although you may be looking ahead to next month with anticipation, your eagerness won't be enough to guarantee success. Your preparation time is nearly over, so make the most of what is left."
virgo,2010-02-25,"If someone comes to you with big plans, there's really not much you need to do today except to be a good listener. They will receive plenty of feedback and criticism from everyone else; what they really need from you now is simply your undivided attention. Allowing others to talk about their ideas without having to justify each fact gives them a chance to take their thoughts to the next level."
libra,2010-02-25,"The smartest thing you can do today is to pay extra attention to what you are doing in each and every moment. But this is no simple task because your imagination is all fired up and you would rather dream of grand ideas while leaving the details for someone else. However, the choice is yours. Instead of making your life more complicated, attend to the most important aspects of your plan to prevent it from unraveling before you even get it off the ground."
scorpio,2010-02-25,"Your creative streak could continue today, but not if you start to worry about what others will think of your work. You are at the mercy of your own attitude; if you think you can't do something, then you can't. Period. On the other hand, the power of positive thinking can swiftly carry you over the threshold of doubt. Trust in the process and in your own strength."
sagittarius,2010-02-25,"You've been looking out toward the horizon long enough; now you are impatient and want to begin the next phase of your journey. Unfortunately, if you let your impulsive behavior get the best of you, it could cost you the ground you have gained over the past few months. Don't let your fear of failure trick you into pushing ahead today. You might not realize how much progress you have made until next month when everything starts to happen all at once."
capricorn,2010-02-25,"One of your co-workers or friends seems a bit too sentimental for you now. It's not that you can't access a softer and gentler side of yourself; it's just that you might be afraid that your emotional vulnerability can impede your productivity. Although you may be temporarily distracted from your goals, your ambition is likely to be stimulated and even more accomplishments will follow in the days ahead."
aquarius,2010-02-25,"Today you want to do something that makes you feel good about who you are and what you can do for others. You aren't interested in routine production now and might try to escape your regular responsibilities if they don't offer you the stimulation that you crave. However, your frustration could push you closer and closer to the edge. Avoid open conflict while making a plan to honor your altruistic intentions."
pisces,2010-02-25,"You may try extra hard now to balance your heightened need for fantasy through music, books, movies or daydreams with the practical reality of your normal routine. But it's not easy to bring such a wide variety of activities into one perspective that matches everyone else's ideas of what should be done. Paradoxically, the more you attempt to fit in, the more of an outsider you might become. Today, it's okay to dance to the beat of your own drum."
aries,2010-02-26,"You're ready to blast ahead today and you might not give it a second thought if you move fast enough. Giving pause for even just a moment might be all you need to put you into a tailspin of doubt. Nevertheless, this may be the best thing that can happen to you. Fortunately, your uncertainty won't last long, but it can open your eyes to an alternative course of action that proves to be much smarter than your first choice."
taurus,2010-02-26,"You may try to show your friends how much you care about them today, but a grandiose act might reveal more about your insecurity than your generosity. Don't worry about how others will respond to you; if you attempt to out-think them, your analysis could backfire. Instead, keep it simple and just come from your heart."
gemini,2010-02-26,Your cleverness is more likely to get you into trouble today than solve an existing problem. You are able to think so fast now that your mind can slip in and out of alternate realities without anyone else noticing. But fuzzy thinking sidetracks your logic if you don't take time to separate your fantasies from the real goods. There's nothing wrong with dreaming as long as you know when to wake up and deal with the truth.
cancer,2010-02-26,"You may be riding the edge of an adrenaline rush that pushes you outside of your comfort zone. When you realize how far you've stretched, a secondary wave of excitement can transport you even farther from your usual place of safety. But once you blast past your initial fear, you may be surprised at how easy it is to say what's on your mind and take things to the next level. Keep in mind that you are still laying the groundwork for what's to come next month."
leo,2010-02-26,"There's really no point in holding anything back now because everyone already knows how you are feeling. Although you won't reveal any shocking news today, the intensity of your stored up anger could catch others off guard. But their temporary discomfort with what you say is not your problem. Now that the Moon is back in your sign, it's your job to reflect what's happening as you perceive it. Just remember that there can be many ways to see the same situation, so don't assume that you have all the answers."
virgo,2010-02-26,"You have a lot to say today, but you might decide that it's smarter to wait a few days before revealing your thoughts. Taking extra time to consider all the options is a good idea, but it's also wise to observe what happens next before you make your position known. You may be feeling confident right now, but shifting currents will require you to be flexible and to reevaluate your plans as needed."
libra,2010-02-26,"Your friends might be planning something this weekend that sounds like a lot of fun to you. You would love to join them, but a previous commitment could complicate your schedule. Nevertheless, what seems like an irresolvable conflict at first might be the catalyst for a much-needed change. Don't say no before you try to figure out how to have time for both work and play."
scorpio,2010-02-26,It doesn't matter what you are feeling today; the show must go on. Perhaps you have been withholding your thoughts and are now finally ready to express them. But this may not be the right moment. You have a role to play at work and in some ways it is just like a performance. Act like a true professional and give it your absolute best. You can share what's on your mind some other time when it's more appropriate.
sagittarius,2010-02-26,"You are irrepressible today and are likely to speak your truth loudly and clearly. Even if you are the most sensitive person around, you still won't be able to withhold your opinions. Although you don't mean to hurt anyone's feelings, your direct communication style can seem abrupt to others. You don't have to change what you say, but a little forethought enables you to be kind as you express yourself."
capricorn,2010-02-26,"You are intrigued by the power of emotional expression today and could go out of your way to stir complex emotions that escalate a situation into a conflict. But this strategy won't likely bring you any closer to your goals, and it might actually damage a close relationship. Don't play with other people's feelings just to satisfy your own curiosity. Instead, discussing your concerns honestly can set the stage for real progress while also increasing the level of intimacy."
aquarius,2010-02-26,"An old business or personal relationship may be rekindled or someone new can come into your life as the Moon visits your 7th House of Partnerships. In either case, you may feel as if hidden forces are at work, turning a normal event into something very special. Don't try to make logical sense out of anything that happens now. Just stay open to the possibilities and wait to see where they actually lead."
pisces,2010-02-26,"Things keeps looking bigger and better, but it feels as if the reward is always just around the next corner. However, this time it really is. Although it's easy for you to believe that you're fooling yourself, your extra efforts are very likely being noticed by someone who matters. Continue to do the best possible job at work, but don't push for any extra attention. Remember, what goes around comes around, so don't give up now."
aries,2010-02-27,"You need to be careful today because anything you can imagine has the possibility of coming true. At first this seems like really good news -- and, ultimately, it is -- unless you waste this opportunity on self-indulgent pleasures. Instead of scheming how you can gain an advantage now, shift your thinking and make others the beneficiaries of your dreams."
taurus,2010-02-27,"Think about your message before you open your mouth today because others are listening very carefully to what you say. You may not be aware of your impact, but your ideas will be more inspiring now than you realize. Don't worry so much about being practical; your current strength is not about leading by example. You can shine the brightest if you give yourself permission to dream out loud."
gemini,2010-02-27,"You have the creative mind of a poet or a musician today and trying to keep it on a straight and narrow path will only lead to frustration. Instead of reining in your thoughts, follow them as they meander through your imagination. But don't judge yourself harshly if, at the end of the day, you don't have anything tangible to show for your lovely fantasies."
cancer,2010-02-27,"You might be surprised at how creative you can be now if you just give yourself permission to daydream. On one hand, you are open to receiving more images from the shadows of your own subconscious. On the other hand, it may become confusing as the boundaries between your fantasies and the real world grow thinner. Don't worry; the wisdom of your imagination won't steer you wrong today if you let it take you on a magic carpet ride."
leo,2010-02-27,"It may feel as if you are the only one who isn't deluded now that your 7th House of Partners is being camouflaged by illusory Neptune. But if it seems like someone has misled you, consider your contribution to feeding the fantasy. The current situation might be part of a recurring pattern, so use this experience as a learning opportunity rather than viewing it as something unpleasant."
virgo,2010-02-27,"Your self-image might be a bit distorted today, especially if you are experiencing physical symptoms that are hard to diagnose. You are so sensitive now that subtle disturbances in your environment can manifest as inflammation or pain. Instead of covering up the discomfort, find the source and eliminate it. Maintaining a positive attitude is currently your best strategy to feeling better."
libra,2010-02-27,"You could easily set yourself up for disappointment by idealizing love. You may be so blinded by your hopes today that you put someone up on a pedestal and lose touch with the truth of the situation. On the other hand, your gift is your ability to see beauty where others don't and perfection where others see flaws. Simply acknowledging the potential now without going overboard may be enough to give it a chance of actually happening."
scorpio,2010-02-27,"You might be looking at a family situation through rose-colored glasses now, making it difficult for you to see what's really going on. Don't be too sure that you can separate the present set of circumstances from a similar one that you previously experienced. Even if they appear the same on the surface, recognizing the differences enables you to manage your current dilemma more realistically."
sagittarius,2010-02-27,"You could create problems for yourself by being careless about your commitments today. You might write an appointment down incorrectly or wait so long to confirm a date that others assume you have something else to do. Even a simple misunderstanding could turn your day inside out. Fortunately, you can circumvent trouble by taking extra time to manage your schedule before it runs away from you."
capricorn,2010-02-27,"An unexpected glitch in your personal budget could cause you a headache today and your avoidance of the situation will only make it worse. Luckily, there is room for a creative solution and thinking outside of the box can provide a quick fix to your dilemma. Just don't bury your head in the sand; facing the issue directly is wise whether it's an accounting mistake, a miscalculated expense or an error in judgment."
aquarius,2010-02-27,"You aren't to be trusted with an important decision today, especially if it requires you to be very practical. On the other hand, you are the go-to person for creative ideas or if advice is needed about relationships, interior design or fashion. Remember, your orientation tends to be more artistic now than logical, so don't pretend to be thinking more critically than you actually are."
pisces,2010-02-27,"Your dreams slip right out of your sleep and into the light of day today as mental Mercury is diffused by your key planet Neptune. Thoughts are not contained by reality now; instead they carry complex messages that are heavily laden with unconscious symbolism. Everything seems to have more meaning than usual, which makes it difficult to navigate through your mundane world. You can choose to look at this as an extra burden or as a precious gift that could vanish before you fully realize what happened."
aries,2010-02-28,"It's not easy for you to contain yourself today, even if you know that your enthusiasm might alienate someone else. Your intent is to be considerate, but your inner child may be too excited for your outer adult to control. Just keep in mind that if you really want to make the most of what's being offered, you'll need to pay attention to the details and follow through with hard work. Saying less and doing more is a smart strategy for now."
taurus,2010-02-28,"Your social life seems better than usual now that your 11th House of Friends is opened wide by the Sun-Jupiter conjunction. But you probably won't say yes to more than you can handle because the earthy Virgo Full Moon helps to keep you grounded. Luckily, your common sense doesn't have to get in the way of your fun. Remember, you don't have to overstep your limits in order to thoroughly enjoy yourself."
gemini,2010-02-28,"You are looking good in the eyes of your friends and family now, and you might even believe that you can do no wrong. But your foolish behavior will not be rewarded, so don't push your luck. It's better to acknowledge why others like you than to assume that you have carte blanche to do whatever you want. You can avoid negative consequences if you spend a little time thinking about the impact of your actions before you do something you may later regret."
cancer,2010-02-28,"You may be running around more than you expect today, thanks to the Full Moon in your 3rd House of Short Trips. You could have an idea about what you want to do or where you want to go, only to discover that it's going to be a bit more complicated than just picking up and heading out. Don't worry if it feels like you are spinning your wheels without making much progress, for things may fall into place suddenly, opening the way ahead."
leo,2010-02-28,"Try not to let your preconceived notions get in the way of your happiness now, especially if you have convinced yourself that it's unwise to spend money on something that makes you feel good. Even if your finances are tight, treating yourself well can be an investment that will pay off. But this isn't a license to waste what you've earned; it's only an acknowledgment that you are worth more than you might give yourself credit for today."
virgo,2010-02-28,"Today's Full Moon in your sign can mean a lucky break for you, but you must be willing to take a risk for it to pay off. This magical Full Moon opposes fortunate Jupiter in your 7th House of Others, indicating that a friend or partner could be the one who opens the window of opportunity. Although someone else can aim you in the right direction, it's still up to you to take the first step."
libra,2010-02-28,"You could be lazy or self-indulgent and skip your exercise routine today or go right for the dessert without eating your vegetables. But even though you might be able to get away with a bit of extra pampering, it's really not a good idea to stretch your limits too far. Today's Full Moon illuminates your 12th House of Karma, indicating that you won't be able to outsmart the cosmos at this time. It's wise to think about the consequences before you try to bend reality in your favor."
scorpio,2010-02-28,"Today's careful Virgo Full Moon activates your 11th House of Social Networking, reflecting your caution about wasting energy interacting with people you don't know. It's more important now to develop a one-on-one relationship with someone you already know than to play the ""maybe"" game with strangers. But this doesn't mean you are being unsocial; it only means that you reserve the right to be as discriminating as you wish."
sagittarius,2010-02-28,"You may be ready to set new priorities, as the Sun-Jupiter conjunction in your 4th House of Roots has you looking to your personal life now, rather than your professional life, for the meaning that you seek. Your vision of the importance of home and family can outshine your career ambitions today. Don't worry about any long-term fallout from your newly developing perspective. Keep things simple and just enjoy your day without being tied to any specific goals."
capricorn,2010-02-28,"Although you are often the champion of planning ahead, it's challenging for you now to think about traveling too far into the future. This may be a bit disconcerting, but it can also be a welcome relief to your regular way of scheduling things in advance. Consider a spontaneous day-trip to shake things up and make the most out of the time you have to escape from your responsibilities."
aquarius,2010-02-28,"You may experience a financial windfall today or simply make more money than you thought you would. The propitious Sun-Jupiter conjunction in your 2nd House of Income also means that this could be a good day to ask for a raise. Or, if you play the lottery, it might make sense to buy an extra ticket. But although this is considered a lucky transit, you won't likely get a free lunch if you expect one. Remember, the greatest fortune now will be the result of your hard work."
pisces,2010-02-28,"Today's joyful Sun-Jupiter conjunction occurs in your sign, widening your horizons and clearing a path to success. Luckily, the efficient Virgo Full Moon in your 7th House of Partners can bring people into your life now who help you stay on task. Show your intelligence by listening to the advice given by those who are more experienced than you. It's one thing to know where you want to go; it's  another thing entirely to have the wisdom to actually get there."
aries,2010-03-01,"You are returning to your senses and are now trying to regain a healthy perspective on recent events. You might have to do some damage control if you went overboard. But it's not just a matter of saying the right things; you also need to follow through with proper actions. Give yourself enough time to finish your work. Don't think that you can fix everything all at once. Be honest about your intentions, but don't promise more than you can deliver."
taurus,2010-03-01,"You may not be as clear about your long-term goals today, especially if discussions with friends lead you to start thinking about things from a different angle. A new strategy begins to take shape in your mind, but it becomes less plausible the more you think about it. It's great as an idea, but its execution could be impractical. Don't hold on to a plan that will only bring you frustration. Let it go so you can come up with a better one."
gemini,2010-03-01,"Put your ambitions to good use with the help of clever Mercury's entry into your 10th House of Career. You can make progress toward your professional goals, but it may take a leap of faith. Normally, you want to talk about your plans because they take more concrete form as you discuss them with others. Now, however, you may be better off without all the talking. Words will prematurely diffuse your ideas before they reach fruition. Trust your dreams without feeling like you must share them aloud."
cancer,2010-03-01,"You have work to do now, but your biggest hurdle may be the limitations that you place upon yourself. Your current struggle may not be apparent to anyone else, because you can keep your insecurities well hidden if you don't want to talk about your worries. Just make sure that your unwillingness to share your concerns doesn't turn into a deeper level of denial. Acknowledging your apprehension is the first step to overcoming it."
leo,2010-03-01,"The veil between this world and other worlds has stretched as thin as it can get. And although your magical mystery tour may not be over just yet, you have the distinct feeling that one phase is ending and another is about to begin. Even if you are eager to get on with what's next, don't hurry the process. It may not seem like it, but everything is happening on time."
virgo,2010-03-01,"It's difficult to know whom to trust now because you may be receiving conflicting information from a variety of sources. Additionally, your feelings may be so strong that your biases actually alter what you hear. Remember to acknowledge your own desires; once you are conscious of them, it will be easier to distinguish the truth from illusion."
libra,2010-03-01,"You could have an anxious moment when you realize how much work you still have left to finish. You are running into a real deadline today and you must buckle down and meet your obligations or you will have to face the music. Although there are potentially unpleasant consequences, they won't likely be as bad as you imagine. Do the best you can and stay focused on your goals, even if you don't reach them on time."
scorpio,2010-03-01,"It's time for you to move beyond any logical concerns you have about your creative abilities and just let your natural talent take over. This may require a higher level of trust than you've previously attained, but with five planets in your 5th House of Self-Expression, the only thing that can hold you back is your fear of success. You have the vision and the ingenuity, so get out of your own way and let it flow."
sagittarius,2010-03-01,"You may be having a tough time setting boundaries now because you can see unrealized potential everywhere you look. Although your ability to think is one of your greatest strengths, it's more difficult than usual to separate what's practical from what's not. Instead of relying on your common sense today, it may be smarter to just jump in. If your plan doesn't gain traction right away, leave it and try something else."
capricorn,2010-03-01,"Letting go of control is a challenge for you, but you are now beginning to see definite advantages to this tactic. It's not that you are giving up on your goals; it's just that you are admitting that you might not know the best way to achieve success. Mental Mercury's current visit to your 3rd House of Immediate Environment requires that you focus your thoughts on the present moment, so remove the unneeded pressure and don't try to look too far ahead."
aquarius,2010-03-01,"It's important now to think about your material possessions and what it takes to keep you up-to-date on your fiscal commitments. Revolving credit accounts and installment loans might be simpler to manage if there weren't other people in your life to complicate the logistics, but staying ahead isn't easy even if you are on your own. There aren't fast and easy answers to your financial questions today, but asking them is the right thing to do."
pisces,2010-03-01,"Your popularity can increase for the next couple of weeks, thanks to Mercury's visit to your imaginative sign. Although your storytelling will likely draw an audience, you might not have the patience to get the details straight. You would rather make your point now with an emotional appeal and leave the facts and figures for another time. You may be able to slide by without doing significant research, but don't fake the data. You'll receive more support if you are honest and just admit what you don't know."
aries,2010-03-02,"You may have solved a relationship issue in your mind, but that doesn't have the same impact as handling it in the real world. You might actually believe that changing your attitude is sufficient to take care of the current stress, but there may be more work required for you to learn an important lesson now. Acknowledging that you don't have all the answers is a good place to start."
taurus,2010-03-02,"Concentrating on the tasks right in front of you today might temporarily take the pressure off the larger issues you are wrestling with, but diverting your attention isn't the answer. Fortunately, you can get a lot accomplished now and there's certainly nothing wrong with that. But once you check off enough tasks on your to-do list, you may want to come back and think about your long-term goals, even if you don't reach any permanent conclusions."
gemini,2010-03-02,"Although your day might get off to a tough start, you should be able to handle whatever arises as long as you realize that it's going to take a while for things to settle back down. Luckily, the current circumstances won't likely spin too far out of control and your consistent attention will prove to be your secret weapon. Still, your desire to take some time for yourself may need to be put on hold while you show others how responsible you can be now."
cancer,2010-03-02,"An unacknowledged family obligation may garner more of your attention today than you prefer, but you could resist the urge to follow through and do anything about it. You might believe that if you don't say anything about your concerns, then they really don't exist. Unfortunately, this little mind game could turn into an obsession until you finally accept the need to talk about what's happening with those who are also involved in your drama."
leo,2010-03-02,"It's not easy to shake the high level of emotional intensity you have been feeling, but you are tempted to reestablish equilibrium as the graceful Libra Moon visits your 3rd House of Immediate Environment. Developing a plan is one thing, but putting it into motion is more difficult because of complicated logistics. Don't get discouraged; you can make it work, even if it takes more time than you wish."
virgo,2010-03-02,"Today you might try every trick in the book to stabilize a relationship that seems to be pulled one way and then another. But the more effort you put into making someone else feel okay, the greater the tension between you. Paradoxically, the most effective strategy now is to just acknowledge the uneasy energy and let it settle on its own. Fortunately, you can expect resolution within a day or two and then you both will be able to move on."
libra,2010-03-02,"It seems as if you won't be able to bring finality to a current situation at work, regardless of what you decide. Others may be waiting for you to weigh in today, but you can clearly see the inadequacy of the available plans. Although you want to add alternatives to the options already present, it would only complicate matters even further. Even if you know there's a better way, no one will fault you now for going with the consensus and picking the most popular solution offered instead of rocking the boat."
scorpio,2010-03-02,"Your current dilemma is a complex one that raises issues of confidentiality, integrity and performance. You may be asked to overlook a situation that could ultimately reflect back on your reputation. However, you don't want to turn a minor problem into a major issue, especially if it will end up requiring extra work. Your smartest strategy may be to acknowledge your concern and then let it go. At least those who matter will know exactly where you stand."
sagittarius,2010-03-02,"You may go out of your way today to let someone know that you take the relationship very seriously and that you are open to talking about what's happening between the two of you. But your words may be a part of your defensive posturing now, especially if you aren't clear about what you want to share. Be aware of the difference between the conversation you are having with someone else and the one you are having with yourself. You'll feel better when these two perspectives become one."
capricorn,2010-03-02,"From your perspective karma is a bit muddled now as your fantasies cross over into the real world. However, your key planet Saturn is in the spotlight today, reassuring you that you'll get what you deserve. Even if it's difficult to see the existing cause-and-effect relationships that you normally take for granted, don't let your uncertainty slow you down. Stay the course; you'll be closer to your destination once the mists begin to clear."
aquarius,2010-03-02,You may be struggling now to separate your idealistic dreams from practical solutions to the very real issues that are disturbing you. The truth is that you can have an immediate and positive impact on your life if you concentrate on just the simple facts today. Avoid the temptation to weave the threads of reality into an original fabric. Save this magic for another day once you've dealt with the current situation.
pisces,2010-03-02,"It's disconcerting when you realize that you cannot tell the difference now between your fantasies and what's actually happening. Part of the current problem is that your imagination is so active that your head is filled with great ideas and fantastic possibilities. And, they are all so vivid that they seem real. Trying to manifest your visions today will likely lead to frustration. Instead, write them down, reconsider them later, and then choose which ones to develop further."
aries,2010-03-03,Your natural affinity to an adrenaline rush doesn't mean that you are immune to the pitfalls of dangerous activities. You could become so excited about what you are doing today that you forget to pay attention to the simple things that would keep you safe. Remember that trouble only arises now if you are careless. A calculated risk can be fun as long as you take the necessary precautions.
taurus,2010-03-03,"Following your intuition today can lead you into a socially unstable situation. Normally, you would be more cautious about participating in a group activity unless you had sufficient information in advance. Now, however, you like the idea of living on the edge and are willing to jump in on a whim. Enjoy the thrills of the emotional roller coaster as long as the ride lasts. You could create a sweet memory that sticks with you for a long time."
gemini,2010-03-03,"You are tired of waiting and want results right away. Unfortunately, your sense of urgency could prompt you to make a hasty decision that doesn't turn out as planned. Observe your feelings today and explore your desires in the safety of your own thoughts. However, keep in mind that you aren't obliged to act on every whim. Use your common sense and think twice before choosing an unconventional solution when a tried and true one would work just fine."
cancer,2010-03-03,"Perhaps you have tried taking the wait-and-see approach to making plans, but now something happens that makes you jump one way or the other. Although you want to be fair-minded and consider other people's feelings, you probably shouldn't pass up an opportunity to learn something you've always wanted to know. Say yes and work out the details with everyone else later."
leo,2010-03-03,"You are being drawn deeper into a drama that stimulates old fears but now you eagerly anticipate facing them and overcoming them once and for all. You might have tried to skirt around the edges of what feels like a black hole, yet it's time to let go and dive into the center. Although your spiritual strength may be tested as you embark on a great journey, the rewards will last you a lifetime."
virgo,2010-03-03,"Just when you thought you've seen it all, a friend or partner does something that is totally weird and unexpected. However, there's a part of you that wishes you were daring enough to ignore the rules and be outrageous yourself. Even if nothing out of the ordinary happens now, consider taking a risk to make your dreams come true. You don't have to wait for others to act out your secret desires."
libra,2010-03-03,"The unbroken pattern of your daily routine can be quite reassuring and usually makes you feel secure. Today, however, you could be itching to break out of a rut and try something completely different. But you have ambivalence when the Moon is in Libra the Scales and might not be able to put your fantasy into motion. Don't get discouraged, for your chance may not happen until later in the day. Wait until it feels right and then make your move."
scorpio,2010-03-03,"You may be climbing walls, feeling like your creativity is bursting out all over the place today. You have a string of original ideas and want to discuss them with people you trust. Nevertheless, you still must perform your work within the expected parameters or your efforts, however brilliant, will be for naught. Enjoy tripping out to the edges of your imagination, but for now don't share your tales of traveling with anyone else."
sagittarius,2010-03-03,"You may have something in your background that others don't necessarily know about and it's on your mind today for one reason or another. Consider risking vulnerability and sharing your story with someone you like. Once you confront your resistance and start talking, your fears could transform into exhilaration. Opening the door to intimacy can be scary, but it is worth taking the chance."
capricorn,2010-03-03,"An unexpected interaction with a close friend or family member can shake you up today because you don't expect the conversation to go where it does. Fortunately, this is not about receiving bad news; rather, it's about having your assumptions questioned or even destroyed. But instead of wasting energy on fearful judgments, think about the freedom your new perspective brings to you. Embrace innovative thinking and, for now, leave the old rules behind."
aquarius,2010-03-03,"You are enticed to do something out of the ordinary, as Sweetheart Venus hooks up with your key planet futuristic Uranus today. The prospects can be very exciting, but you should exercise a bit of caution so you don't do anything you'll soon regret, like impulsively spending a lot of money on an item you don't really need or proposing marriage to someone you just met. Still, within limits, open your heart and mind to new possibilities and you can have a memorable and pleasurable experience."
pisces,2010-03-03,"You might believe that you are holding a ""Get Out of Jail Free"" card, and you're willing to use it to break out of someone's control. But this card only works within your imagination; it has no authority over anyone else. Nevertheless, the message is clear: if you are free in your mind, then no one can lock you up. You will be happier now if you consider what rules you are willing to accept and then follow them willingly."
aries,2010-03-04,"You may say that you want to have deeper and more meaningful experiences, but it might be easier to share your goals with someone than actually work toward achieving them. Still, you may be restless now unless you can get past the light and easy talk and settle into a real discussion about those things that elude understanding. Reaching into the shadows could be rewarded with an emotional treasure if you are willing to take the risk."
taurus,2010-03-04,"Your friends seem to be extra supportive of you now but upon careful scrutiny their words might not be connected to their actions. At first, you may think that your observations are incorrect, but it becomes apparent that others believe you don't understand what's happening. The truth is that you tend to simplify complicated issues. It helps if you consider what, if anything, you are avoiding for the sake of convenience."
gemini,2010-03-04,"You believe that you know the best way to complete your work today, but others -- including your boss -- may think that your approach will waste time and slow you down. Instead of doing as you are told, you're likely to hold fast to your radical strategy just to make your point. But don't be foolish and take things too far; if you can see that your methods aren't working, then let go of them and return to the proven way as quickly as you can."
cancer,2010-03-04,"You might enjoy the high level of emotional drama today because the expression of feelings touches something that resonates very deeply for you. Whether you are reminded of a past life or a past decade, it's crucial that you relate your memories to what is unfolding in the present moment and not what happened previously. Everything will be somewhat easier once you realize the power of now."
leo,2010-03-04,"Each time you reach the end of your rope, you're surprised to see that there's still more available. But now, if you don't want to slide down any further, you need to hold on tighter than ever before. Your unwavering determination is your greatest strength, but you alone are capable of applying yourself without restraint to get what you need at this time."
virgo,2010-03-04,"Others may still be acting evasively but now you are able to nail the truth so accurately that you can convince them to make the necessary commitment or move on. Your goal isn't to shame anyone into stepping up to the plate and doing what's expected, but that's exactly the effect your words produce. You don't need a complex strategy or lots of details to your plan; all you need to do is simply be honest."
libra,2010-03-04,"You know that you are bringing something important to your job today, and it's not just that you show up. Your ability to sympathize with others blends well with your desire to make your workplace a happier and healthier environment. Almost everything you suggest now is looked upon eagerly by everyone involved, but that's just because you are also willing to listen to what's being said."
scorpio,2010-03-04,"The Moon's return to your sign enables you to wear your heart on your sleeve, even though you might still want to remain invisible. But you cannot have it both ways. Anonymity sounds like a good idea, but it doesn't give you the chance to express yourself even when you know that it's safe. Take a risk and put your feelings on the line. Others will be more supportive of you once they realize that you are vulnerable and have hopes and fears just like them."
sagittarius,2010-03-04,"Your spiritual beliefs can pull you through a complicated situation today as you find your way by relying on a particular teaching. You might remember something from your childhood or a concept that you learned more recently. In either case, you don't have to tell anyone where your guidance comes from. Just aim your intentions high and don't settle for less."
capricorn,2010-03-04,"Although you want to hang out socially and discuss your long-term goals with your colleagues now, you might be required to take care of an endless stream of responsibilities instead. But you may not be interested in putting in enough time to manage your schedule today. Nevertheless, it's not such a smart idea to let the whole thing collapse. If you can hold on for a few more days, it should start getting easier to balance work with play."
aquarius,2010-03-04,"You are not ready to let someone else wrestle control from you because you are confident that your plan is the one that will work best. It may appear as if your ego is involved but you are not seeking any recognition for getting it right. Things will turn out as well as they can, as long as you really want what's good for everyone involved."
pisces,2010-03-04,"It might appear as if you are somewhat weakened by your compassion, but actually it's the current source of your strength. Your ability to feel the pain of others can make you more effective as a healer, and is likely right up at the top of the list of what motivates you now. And even if you think your timing is a bit off today, trust your hunches, for they will lead you in the right direction."
aries,2010-03-05,"You are eager to get started with something new. But jumping into a challenging situation before you test the water isn't recommended because you cannot tell much about the specific conditions from a distance. There are many possible trouble spots ahead, yet the greatest single danger is being ill prepared. Fortunately, you can minimize the risks by knowing as much as possible in advance."
taurus,2010-03-05,"Sometimes it gets old having to handle other people's dramas, but for now it's easier to do what you can than to stubbornly resist someone's cries for help. Nevertheless, be careful about taking on too much, for it's likely that your friend in need might expect something very different from you than you're willing to give. If you experience a clash of wills, be smart and retreat before your assistance just makes matters worse."
gemini,2010-03-05,"If you've been considering a change to your diet, this would be a sensible day to make it happen. The Moon's current visit to your 6th House of Self-Improvement also bodes well for starting a new exercise regimen. Ultimately, anything that helps you feel better now will also increase your chances for overall success in your career goals. Recognizing the connection between the personal and the professional enables you to do something small that has a greater impact over time."
cancer,2010-03-05,"Today you may be less interested in teamwork than you are in winning. You know the rules of the game and you are tempted to bend them in your favor in order to garner an advantage. However, coming out on top won't be as great as it sounds, for there can be a steep price to pay. It's much better if you figure out how cooperative efforts can turn everyone into a winner."
leo,2010-03-05,You know what your responsibilities are and nothing is going to deter you from fulfilling your current obligations. But your loyalty is so complete that you could overreact to the pressures of a situation today. Keep in mind that it's not as black or white as you think. There are an infinite number of shades of gray in between the most extreme choices.
virgo,2010-03-05,"You may actually believe that you are being flexible now, but you have probably already made up your mind. Your apparent willingness to negotiate could be more for show than for anything else. Instead of holding on to a fixed agenda today, try listening to what other people want, too. The outcome is surely better if no one feels outsmarted or left out."
libra,2010-03-05,"Today you may have money on your mind as the Moon moves through your 2nd House of Material Possessions. Financial planning will be more helpful now if you have definitive goals. Handling things by reacting to an emergency isn't your cup of tea. Instead, prevent the need for crisis management by planning ahead and then executing your strategy calmly and efficiently."
scorpio,2010-03-05,"You may have to fight to be heard today, which can be rather annoying to you. You know that your ideas are good and you are confident in your ability to express yourself. You would prefer it if others went out of their way to ask for your perspective on a sticky situation. Nevertheless, it's important that your voice is acknowledged, so don't back down until you have shared your opinion."
sagittarius,2010-03-05,"Battle lines may be drawn today and your unwillingness to take sides in the conflict could come back to haunt you next week. It sounds like a smart idea to remain neutral as an outsider, but you won't be as effective unless you are working on a team. Don't worry whether you'll pick the right side or not; just being involved is good enough for now."
capricorn,2010-03-05,"Business negotiations could become rather complicated today, encouraging you to throw your hands in the air and walk away from the whole thing. But you have come farther along than you currently realize and it would be a shame for you to give up when you are so close. It's not wise to make a stand, for an outright conflict now could create a setback. Keep the dialogue going and remain open to all possibilities, even if it's not what you prefer."
aquarius,2010-03-05,It's tempting to turn a little difference of opinion now into a major obstacle to your success. You might feel as if someone is purposefully picking a fight and this makes you angry enough to respond in kind. But ego conflict has no place in the current scheme of things. Keep your insecurities to yourself and don't transform an insignificant molehill into an unsurpassable mountain.
pisces,2010-03-05,"Taking a stand over a core belief might be wise now, but waving your flag as part of an unnecessary performance makes no sense at all. In fact, over-eager displays of passion can be counterproductive if they antagonize the very same people who would otherwise want to help you. Pick your battles carefully and use logic, not emotion, as your primary weapon of engagement."
aries,2010-03-06,"You may be feeling giddy with anticipation as things begin to fall into place now. However, your previous planning may not be as useful as you thought. The overall strategy might still be the same, but enough details have changed that you need to reconsider your options and make new decisions as you go along. Do your best to manage your excitement or you'll inadvertently take on more than you can handle."
taurus,2010-03-06,"Just as everything was beginning to settle down, your life becomes hectic again. But it's not necessarily unpleasant; it's just overflowing with a variety of activities that don't give you a chance to get your much-needed relaxation. Nevertheless, there still are choices you can make throughout the day that have a calming effect if you stop long enough to consider your options."
gemini,2010-03-06,"Someone may have high hopes for you now, but what you want for yourself is more important than what anybody else thinks you should be doing. Keep in mind that those who believe they know what's best for you are working off their own assumptions. Listening to sage advice is a smart strategy, but you don't have to follow it unless you actually think it's useful."
cancer,2010-03-06,"Today you may be overly confident about what you can accomplish on the home front and your unrealistic expectations could set you up for failure. Instead of just listing the projects you would like to complete, take the time to make a detailed plan for each one. This level of preparation doesn't guarantee success, but it certainly does increase your chances."
leo,2010-03-06,"You may declare the ""Waiting Game"" officially over today, but the Moon's current visit to your 5th House of Spontaneity doesn't tell the entire story. You might take a risk as you attempt to avoid the realization that you'll be sitting on pins and needles for a while longer. However, you can still get a glimpse of the good news ahead by letting go of control and enjoying the present moment while you can."
virgo,2010-03-06,"It's difficult for you to stay focused today. If it's not friends that are distracting you, then it may be family commitments that hold your attention. Luckily, the immediate situation can teach you the power of having faith in a larger process. Even if you aren't able to power your way through your chores now, a more laid-back approach can ultimately get the job done, too."
libra,2010-03-06,"You may run around trying to do one too many things today, which actually could prevent you from doing any of them effectively. Finding a sustainable balance between work and play is more difficult when you cannot catch up. Making one too many promises might even prompt you to think about walking away from your commitments without even trying to fulfill them. Don't be foolish; it's smarter to pare back your responsibilities before the day gets under way."
scorpio,2010-03-06,"Building on what you recently started is a good idea in concept, but it will be challenging to do until you find your groove. Even if you have been struggling, you can now see the pieces of the puzzle starting to fit together. But don't push too hard yet. It's wiser to build momentum gradually at first and then turn on the steam in a few days."
sagittarius,2010-03-06,The Moon's return to your sign can quickly work up your enthusiasm to a fevered pitch. But that level of excitement isn't really valuable to you now because it makes it hard to follow through on your promises. The trick is to maintain your new-found confidence without taking on so much that you disappoint others and lose faith in yourself. The key to your current success is cutting back on your commitments today and doing fewer things at once.
capricorn,2010-03-06,"Today you have good reason for celebration, but might not want to tell anyone else just yet. Instead of flaunting your exciting news, you may choose to keep it hidden for a while longer because you don't want to deal with someone's envy of your good fortune. Unfortunately, this kind of thinking could backfire on you as your friends might feel cheated out of sharing in your success. Just let others know what's going on without embellishing your story or gloating too much."
aquarius,2010-03-06,You are excited about the prospects of hanging out with friends and dreaming out loud about your ideal scenario for the future. You cannot be bothered now with the details of financial planning. You just want to think about the big picture and not deal with money issues until absolutely necessary. But be smart and set aside some time to manage your affairs first.
pisces,2010-03-06,"You may be temporarily more concerned with your public appearance than how you are actually doing now that the philosophical Sagittarius Moon visits your public 10th House. It's okay if you don't really want to talk about anything of substance today. For the present moment, keep your conversations limited to big ideas and broad strokes of your creative brush. You can always fill in the details in a day or two."
aries,2010-03-07,"Love is in the air with romantic Venus now visiting your sign until March 31. And whether or not anything actually pans out in reality, today you are pretty upbeat about the potential. But don't overplay your cards. Your unbridled optimism could make someone else feel uncomfortable and even overwhelmed by your energy. Express yourself, but don't forget to give others enough room to breathe."
taurus,2010-03-07,"Your key planet Venus is hosting a cosmic party today and although you will likely enjoy yourself, the activity can become a bit too much for you. But you aren't willing to be the one who pulls the plug on all the fun. In fact, you will probably encourage everyone else to push the limits and take the pleasure even further. Meanwhile, keep in mind that you don't have to go along for the ride unless you really want to."
gemini,2010-03-07,"Your key planet Mercury encourages you to extend your thoughts out beyond the horizon today as it joins expansive Jupiter. Recent recognition at work enables you to see a career path for yourself that has previously been impractical. Just don't turn a workable plan into one that's too ambitious to ever execute. It's challenging to use your common sense now, but it's crucial if you really want to succeed."
cancer,2010-03-07,"You might scare yourself today because you are bold enough to try things that you would usually pass by. This causes others to notice your sense of confidence, encouraging them to have more faith in you. Remain receptive to any support you receive now because your positive attitude can open previously closed doors."
leo,2010-03-07,"The anticipation may be making you crazy now that go-getter Mars in your sign is harmonizing with attractive Venus. But as sweet as everything seems in this moment, you still have to wait until Wednesday for Mars to be done with its retrograde phase. Avoid frustration by remaining flexible and remember that your insistence won't make something happen faster than it can."
virgo,2010-03-07,"You may uncharacteristically overlook an important detail today because you are more concerned with the big picture. Luckily, your ability to comprehend the interrelated complexities of a tricky situation can be of great help to you now. Just don't waste your intellectual advantage by selfishly looking out only for your own needs. Extending your charity to others will bring good fortune."
libra,2010-03-07,"You have the ability to charm your way into someone's heart, now that your key planet Venus dances into your 7th House of Relationships and gracefully sidles up to energetic Mars. You are likely to get what you want now, so it's wise to think about your desires before you give voice to your intent. And even though satisfaction feels close, don't get discouraged if it takes more time than you expect."
scorpio,2010-03-07,"You are clear in your communications, especially when expressing your feelings today. It's great that your positive attitude is contagious, but there is still a potential trouble spot. Don't pretend that everything is perfect if it is not. You can be such a good salesperson now that you could inadvertently mislead someone into making a poor choice."
sagittarius,2010-03-07,"You have a solid sense of your place in the world today, which helps you gain more confidence about what you are doing. But this doesn't mean that you must hide your tender feelings, for sharing your vulnerability can open the door to a magical experience with someone special. Don't let the day slip away without telling a friend or lover how much she or he means to you."
capricorn,2010-03-07,"You are not in the mood to make plans now because you would rather take the day more spontaneously and decide what's next as you go along. It feels natural for you to enjoy yourself today, especially if you know that next week is going to present more challenges. Nevertheless, it's still not a wise idea to set aside all your responsibilities, even if you really do deserve some time off."
aquarius,2010-03-07,"You may be tempted to shop for something you really don't need today. Additionally, you could talk yourself into spending more than you should, especially if you're optimistic about your finances. But you don't have to buy anything now to feel good about yourself and your relationships with those you love. Take the emphasis off the material world and shift it to your personal experiences. A heartfelt conversation is worth more than money can buy."
pisces,2010-03-07,"You can readily see the gains you are making if you have been attending to your health through proper diet and regular exercise. And as much as the power of positive thought affects your well-being, it's not enough. Don't just make idle promises about improving your lifestyle. Turn your words into actions today, for what you set in motion now establishes a pattern for the weeks to come."
aries,2010-03-08,"Circumstances don't leave you much room for fun today as a co-worker reminds you of your responsibilities. It may seem as if you have no choice now but to do what's expected of you. This might even provoke you to question whether or not anyone else's approval is worth the extra effort. Naturally, this is your choice, but keep in mind that your current negativity won't last."
taurus,2010-03-08,"Your key planet Venus is in a tense tug-of-war with solid Saturn now, but luckily the love planet is capable of softening even the toughest of opponents. Although you may feel as if your good feelings are being restrained, your firm resolve can overcome most obstacles as long as you maintain a positive attitude. It's crucial to nip any discouragement in the bud today before it can take root and spread."
gemini,2010-03-08,"Your hopes may be dashed today if you set your sights too high. Even if you are being realistic, you still might have to overcome your own resistance to being methodical. Letting go of your attachment to spontaneity will help to keep you focused on following through with what you start. But chasing an elusive dream now will only waste your energy that could be better applied in a more practical manner."
cancer,2010-03-08,"You might not take kindly to someone making demands on your time today, especially if you don't feel appreciated. Perhaps you have professional commitments you need to fulfill, but a family member may insist that you change your schedule to spend more time at home. Don't overreact; keep in mind that the emotional distance you are feeling now is temporary."
leo,2010-03-08,"You would like to be able to relax, but you might not have enough time left over after taking care of all your obligations. Perhaps you didn't mean to agree to so many commitments, but now it's too late to make changes that would let others down. Instead of complaining about the fun you are missing, turn your current activities into memorable experiences by doing an extraordinary job."
virgo,2010-03-08,"You are aware of the potential love that's in your life, but may be frustrated in your efforts to make it real. It might even feel as if someone is pouring cold water on you while you are attempting to soak in some warm rays of sunshine. Fortunately, there is a silver lining to the dark cloud; knowing the truth makes you more powerful than believing in an unrealistic fantasy."
libra,2010-03-08,"Someone you like may be acting particularly nice to you now, yet you're not sure how best to react. At first you might enjoy the idea of a romantic liaison or just deepening an existing friendship. But you can also see the wisdom of an emotional retreat to avoid the complications that could arise. Respecting sensible boundaries is a smart idea; rushing the development of a relationship is not."
scorpio,2010-03-08,"Creating a relationship with someone is like setting out to sea. When it's new, your vessel seems very big and the open waters appear boundless. But after a while you may feel trapped on your boat by the ocean's restrictive containment of your space. Fortunately, you can move beyond your current frustrations by recognizing your role in what is happening. There may be real limitations being placed on you now, but you can be happy if you keep your destination in sight."
sagittarius,2010-03-08,"You may be annoyed that your confidence is waning and wish that you pushed yourself harder yesterday. However, your perspective will change as your pent-up energy is released later this week. In the meantime, don't deny your current self-doubt. Instead of worrying about a setback or a rejection, use this opportunity to reconsider how best to proceed before taking the next step."
capricorn,2010-03-08,"You might feel the brunt of someone's sharp criticism today or the controlling hand of an inconsiderate boss. Your first tendency is to pack a bag and head for the hills or perhaps just go home where you feel safer. But the current circumstances are not signaling you to give up. Rather, they are requiring that you hone your skills and overcome whatever obstacles, physical or emotional, that appear in your path. Don't take no for an answer now."
aquarius,2010-03-08,"You may have to pare back your plans now, especially if you aren't receiving the financial support that you were expecting. The current lack of funds may be tied to more complex emotional issues, especially if there are others involved in your project. You won't gain anything by giving ultimatums or using force; combining patience with gentle persuasion is a much smarter strategy."
pisces,2010-03-08,"You may realize how weary you are today, especially if you have been putting a lot of energy into maintaining a high level of optimism recently. Now, however, it's as if someone has let the air out of the helium balloon and it's requiring more work on your part to keep it afloat. Although you may be tempted to let it fall to the ground, another round of effort is a good idea, for it will keep you in the game long enough to ride a second wind that is on its way."
aries,2010-03-09,"It feels like one minute you have the patience of a saint and the next moment you're climbing the walls with anticipation. You honestly don't know whether to scream out of frustration or laugh joyously because you are so excited about your future. Your friends might be wondering about you these days, but their concern could quickly turn into admiration as you come alive over the next few weeks."
taurus,2010-03-09,You may be rather subdued now as you settle into a steady pace at work. You're less concerned with recognition for your extra efforts today than you are about getting the job done right. Others may look to you as an example of what it means to be a team player because you are willing to trade anonymity for the overall success of a project.
gemini,2010-03-09,"You could feel the discomfort of being observed today because you currently seem to attract attention no matter what you do. But as you become more accustomed to being on stage, your inner performer could come out to play. There's nothing wrong with having the spotlight on you for a while, but being too expressive can make others uneasy. A smarter strategy would be to downplay your role and share the recognition with your co-workers so that everyone feels appreciated."
cancer,2010-03-09,"It's important to respect the power of the system and follow the rules now, even if they don't make sense to you. Don't bite the hand that feeds you. There will be time later to question authority, but rebellious behavior today won't likely make you any friends or influence those who matter. Think about your words before you say anything, for a slip of the tongue can start a verbal landslide that you would be wise to avoid."
leo,2010-03-09,"You may have already decided that some things are best left unsaid. You know better, but it's just too tempting to say what's on your mind today, especially if your words are able to even the score. It's not that you are holding a grudge; it's just that you could have a bit of unexpressed anger that needs clearing as Mars prepares to turn direct in your sign tomorrow. Just remember to be kind in your delivery."
virgo,2010-03-09,"You are usually very astute in your thinking, but others could confuse you now, even if your logic is sound. At first you might question your own ability to interpret what's being said, but as you listen more carefully you begin to realize that you are not the problem. If someone starts talking in circles today, your best response is to avoid direct engagement, even if it means walking away."
libra,2010-03-09,"You may not understand how a warm relationship could cool off so quickly, but you still might be at odds today with a close friend or partner. Fortunately, a business disagreement or lover's spat won't likely last too long now if you can maintain respect for each other. It's a good idea to allow enough space to process any hard feelings instead of trying to force a quick resolution. Tempers might flare during an intense discussion, so it's best to return to the conversation tomorrow once emotions have settled down."
scorpio,2010-03-09,"You might have a serious debate over a creative issue with someone at work today. What makes this so difficult is there's no right or wrong answer, just a difference of opinion. Nevertheless, you may become discouraged if you feel as if you are not being heard. Don't take your fight too far. But if you are overruled, at least make sure that your ideas have been acknowledged before you let go and move on."
sagittarius,2010-03-09,"Although you may have recently cooled your jets in order to stabilize your current position, today you begin to see new opportunities for growth. Hopefully, you have learned your lesson and won't run too fast with an idea before you give it enough time to go through a sensible development process. But there's a real danger that you could quickly become obsessed with your scheme and talk of nothing else. Ultimately, it's a better strategy to downplay your plan until next week."
capricorn,2010-03-09,"You might decide that biding your time makes more sense now than running around like crazy trying to accomplish the impossible. You may feel like you are attempting to make a river flow up a hill and you could exhaust yourself in the process. Don't fight the currents now, even if they carry you in the wrong direction. The tides are about to change; be patient and let them do the work."
aquarius,2010-03-09,"You are feeling better about a relationship now, even if there are still a few significant differences to be ironed out. Fortunately, you have the sense to realize that it's okay to have diverging opinions on how to handle a specific issue. What's more important is that your core values are similar. After establishing some common ground, agree to disagree on the specifics and move on to what's next."
pisces,2010-03-09,"You may be in an agreeable state of mind, but the more you say today, the more conflict is fomented. Paradoxically, arguments seem to heat up as you attempt to avoid them. Part of the problem is that you are probably more undecided about an important issue than you realize and your uncertainty comes across in your communication. If you aren't sure, just say so; it will minimize your frustration and your headaches."
aries,2010-03-10,"You have pulled the bowstring back as far as you can. Now, as Mars turns direct today in your 5th House of Love and Creativity, it's time to steady your aim and release your arrow of intention. You will be called on to practice patience, but you can feel the changes before they even happen. Be clear about what you want and don't be afraid to share your thoughts with those you trust."
taurus,2010-03-10,"It's been challenging for you to get your way when dealing with family issues recently as Mars retrograded in your 4th House of Domestic Conditions. Now, however, your thwarted efforts are going to be rewarded if you have made effective use of the last two months. Your hopes may be high today, but it's still a good idea not to expect too much, too fast."
gemini,2010-03-10,"Today's fiery Mars action in your 3rd House of Communication indicates that the message you have been trying to get across for a while will finally begin to sink in. It's not that others don't care about what you say, it's just that they've been a bit distracted. Don't give up now; you are closer to your career goals than you think."
cancer,2010-03-10,"If you have been dealing with money issues since the holiday season, your tenacity may finally begin to pay off now that Mars is turning direct in your 2nd House of Finances. Unfortunately, a recent decision that wasn't very wise can cascade into a more complicated situation. But don't avoid facing a problem today; thoughtful actions that are done with purpose can bring healthy progress over the weeks ahead."
leo,2010-03-10,"You may feel as if you have been forced to hold your breath as circumstances tightened their grip since just before the holidays when Mars turned retrograde in your sign. Today, as the action planet changes direction in your 1st House of Self, fresh winds will begin to blow in a new weather pattern that enables you to reclaim the ground that you lost. Don't forget to breathe in future possibilities and breathe out past setbacks as you move forward."
virgo,2010-03-10,"Your thoughts about your life and purpose have deepened over the past couple of months, thanks to the recent Mars retrograde in your 12th House of Destiny. Now, as this phase ends, you aren't interested in spiritual pursuit unless it also has some practical application. This is not about putting an end to your dreams; it's about using your imagination to recreate your life."
libra,2010-03-10,"The social components of your life are emphasized as Mars turns direct today in your 11th House of Friends. You may have had to scale back your party schedule and minimize community participation as personal obligations required your attention. Your responsibilities are not going away, yet now you should be able to make more time to jump back into the group scene and seek out the company of like-minded individuals."
scorpio,2010-03-10,"When Mars in your 10th House of Career began its retrograde cycle back in December, you had no idea that it would take so long to bring your work objectives to fruition. Now that things are starting to move along, you might be able to see the wisdom in the long gestation process. Don't worry about what you could have done if you were able to get going faster; just narrow your attention to the tasks in front of you and give it all you got."
sagittarius,2010-03-10,"You have had your vision set on the distance but haven't been able to find a path that would lead you in the right direction. Now that action-hero Mars is turning direct in your 9th House of Adventure, the fires of inspiration are burning strongly enough to blaze a trail straight to your destination. It's time to define the fuzzy edges of your dreams so you can make them become real."
capricorn,2010-03-10,"You have been pulled into deeper emotional waters than you prefer, but the intensity of these past two months has taught you a lot about yourself and human nature. Mars ends its retrograde cycle in your 8th House of Intimacy, indicating that you are increasing the value that you place on feelings. But there's no need to let your unrestrained passions run amok -- simply acknowledging them changes everything."
aquarius,2010-03-10,"Dynamic Mars has heated up your 7th House of Partners since the beginning of the year, but its backtracking action hasn't made life easy. Obstacles on the road to relationship happiness have created delays and setbacks. But with Mars turning direct now, this is no time for unproductive nostalgia or discouragement. You have work to do if you want to make the most of the opportunities ahead."
pisces,2010-03-10,"You may feel as if you've exhausted your magic, but nothing is further from the truth. You are at a crucial turning point today as Mars turns direct in your 6th House of Work. Your dreams continue to be bigger than life, yet day-by-day they will seem to inch away from the night and out into the light of day. Keep the faith; you are closer to success than you realize."
aries,2010-03-11,"It's not easy for you to express your needs now, especially if you're not even willing to face them yourself. But what you don't feel can still hurt you and your emotional denial could make an easygoing relationship more complicated. Fortunately, it's possible to circumnavigate an unpleasant situation today by paying extra careful attention to your feelings."
taurus,2010-03-11,Your key planet Venus gives you cause to worry today as she runs into a hard square with uncompromising Pluto. Your stubborn resistance to change can heat up a simple disagreement and turn it into an outright conflict. But ultimately the outcome is up to you. A no-win situation can be avoided if you are willing to extend yourself by being more flexible than usual.
gemini,2010-03-11,"You may be feeling uncomfortable with the power of your own reactions today. You might not even understand why your emotions are so agitated. But pretending that they don't exist is not necessarily a smart way to handle the situation, for your denial can inadvertently give them additional strength. Acknowledge your anxiety by sharing what's on your mind with a friend, but don't try to control where the conversation goes. Talking about things should help settle your nerves."
cancer,2010-03-11,"Someone may try to make you change your mind about your feelings today yet it's crucial that you remain true to yourself. Being open to other people's opinions is a smart idea, but denying your needs because they might create conflict will only lead to further complications. You don't have to overstate your case; just be clear about what you want from the start."
leo,2010-03-11,"Relationships continue to raise complex issues for you as you consider how your feelings are affected by someone you love. But just because there's no easy solution to your questions doesn't mean that you should avoid them. Balancing your long-term needs with your short-term desires may require you to change your perspective, even if this can only occur little by little over an extended period of time."
virgo,2010-03-11,"Although you may not be clear about your intentions today, it's even more challenging when you don't understand your partner's position either. You listen to every word that's being said, but you cannot quite grasp the overall meaning. You'll do better in getting the message if you stop trying to analyze what you hear. This isn't about being rational now; it's about responding to your feelings without being able to explain them to anyone at all."
libra,2010-03-11,"Someone may seem quite abrupt to you today, but your feelings of rejection might not reflect the reality of the situation. Your friend or partner could be overwhelmed with intense emotions that defy easy description. What you perceive as abandonment can simply be your interpretation of another person's inability to express what's important. Don't rely on words now as the only form of communication. Actions say more than you realize."
scorpio,2010-03-11,"You're challenged to acknowledge hidden feelings that may be darker and more complex than what others expect, since Innocent Venus squares your key planet Pluto today. But it's not your job to make everyone feel comfortable by denying your own needs. Fortunately, you are able to express your emotions kindly without placing blame on anyone else. This allows someone to meet you halfway without having to take responsibility for solving your dilemma."
sagittarius,2010-03-11,"You still might not fully understand what's happening on the home front today, for the interrelationships between everyone's emotions are way more complicated than you want to know. You would prefer to receive the condensed version, but the only way to grasp the truth now is to plunge into the deep complexities of the entire story. Although this detour can be unnerving, you'll learn something important about yourself if you just take the time to listen."
capricorn,2010-03-11,"You know there isn't an easy way to reach your goals and are now ready to make the required sacrifices. You have an agenda today and may not be interested in setting it aside just to make everyone else feel more secure. But in your eagerness to encourage others to handle their problems, be careful that you aren't abandoning someone who could really use a friend. There's nothing wrong with giving those you love a shoulder to lean on in a time of need."
aquarius,2010-03-11,"You have something on your mind that needs to be communicated and today is a good day to start the conversation. You may be readily able to talk about a very deep-rooted emotional problem now, but your overly casual style might make it appear less important than it actually is. Do yourself a favor by slowing down and sinking into your feelings, rather than intellectualizing them. It may be awkward at first, but you'll probably feel better once the air has been cleared."
pisces,2010-03-11,"You may be at your wit's end today because every time you start to share your feelings, the words slip away before you can express what's in your heart. Paradoxically, you seem to know what you want to say as long as you are quiet. Even if you don't think that you're providing an adequate explanation, don't withdraw before giving it your best shot. Once you start the conversation, you can always fill in more details later."
aries,2010-03-12,"You are not eager to work by yourself today, even if that is your normal preference. The Moon's visit to your 11th House of Friends can tie your feelings to those of other members of your social network or the entire group, itself. If, however, circumstances do require you to spend time alone, you could develop resentment toward those who are participating with a team effort. But there's no need to hold a grudge; you'll feel better about things tomorrow."
taurus,2010-03-12,"You have an uncanny ability now to know what to do at work, even if your plan seems to go against the prevailing opinion. Don't worry about trying to convince others that your way makes the most sense now. They probably won't believe you anyhow. Just let them know that you have the authority to do what you are doing. You'll gain the necessary respect once everyone realizes that you can do the job."
gemini,2010-03-12,"Although you usually have something to say, you are willing to go along with the general consensus now, even if you disagree with it. You may decide to put up a fight at first, but will probably acquiesce to the majority. Fortunately, nothing is written in stone today, so allow external situations to find their own path toward full expression. You really don't have to push so hard."
cancer,2010-03-12,"You may be in an odd frame of mind today because you have the idea that you can be emotionally closer to others yet they might choose to be more distant from you. Naturally, this can be stressful and it's best to decide how comfortable you can be before it's too late. Ultimately, it's not just about what you can tolerate; it's also about being with those who are supportive of what you do."
leo,2010-03-12,"Your brain may be overflowing with new ideas today and your senses awakening to the smell of spring in the air. But it's difficult to know how far to take your original thoughts now, for they can have negative consequences on your current lifestyle unless you know when to stop talking. Remember that you don't need to share everything that crosses your mind."
virgo,2010-03-12,"Expressing your frustration can get in the way of your ambitions today, but luckily you can change your attitude. Don't go running off in search of a dream job that's supposed to fall into your lap. Remember, you can work several disparate threads into one complex piece of fabric now, as long as you don't try to control everything."
libra,2010-03-12,"Normally, you approach your work with a fair-minded attitude, combined with a dose of creative logic. Today, however, it may not pay to be overly practical, for it's the most unusual ideas that will produce the best solutions. Don't strive for balance as you try to decide your next move. Shaking everything up now will bring a wider variety of choices than cautiously staying on the straight and narrow path."
scorpio,2010-03-12,"You have an unusual approach to managing a minor problem at home now. Instead of practicing a ""hands-off"" policy, you are ready to jump in and take control of anything that's out of whack. But exerting too much authority today could backfire, especially if you don't have all the facts. Step back and play an investigative role by listening more carefully and being open to everyone's plans."
sagittarius,2010-03-12,This is a busy day with the Moon in your 3rd House of Immediate Environment. The level of interaction is high and yet you may not be certain about how one relationship pattern affects another. But rest assured that nothing can happen in a vacuum. Connect with others consciously and don't worry if you can't find all the answers just yet.
capricorn,2010-03-12,"It's entirely appropriate for you to examine your motives now, then adjust your goals to make your path more straightforward. But your intentions may not be as clear as you wish, so you'll need to start the process by making a vigilant effort to untangle your subconscious mind. Don't be afraid to ask for help; a counselor or a life coach can make all the difference in the world today as you prepare for what's next."
aquarius,2010-03-12,"You may be overly sensitive today, especially if you uncovered a well-hidden secret when Venus squared Pluto yesterday. Now, the Aquarius Moon can bring your emotions right out into the open. But don't force anything, for you may not be given enough time to delve into a significant issue. Just observe how you react and open your heart when appropriate. You'll do best in the long run if you can wait a while to share your feelings."
pisces,2010-03-12,"You are filled with dreams that stick with you throughout the day, but it's still not easy to share them with anyone. Part of your problem is that the lingering images don't make sense to your rational mind and as soon as you go to explain what's going on, the fantasy disappears in an instant. Cultivate your imagination now by giving yourself permission to wander in your thoughts, even if it doesn't appear to take you anywhere useful yet."
aries,2010-03-13,"Your friends might not meet your expectations today, but that could be because you are being unrealistic about what they should do. Instead of making assumptions about other people's behavior based upon what you would do in a similar situation, allow everyone the freedom to be unique. Once you get over your need to make a judgment, you could be pleasantly surprised by what is offered to you now."
taurus,2010-03-13,"Even if you thought you knew what you were doing, you aren't as clear about your goals now. It's as if the fog rolled in to obscure your view. But it's not just about what you can see ahead of you, for your thinking is also fuzzier today. Give yourself a day or two of downtime and use the weekend to let your fantasies take you on a detour. You should feel refreshed enough to swing into action next week."
gemini,2010-03-13,"It's challenging for you to make definite plans now because you can see so many different ways to reach your goal. But you know that you are in trouble when the various routes appear to be more interesting than your final destination. Luckily, your current lack of focus is not a problem and won't be a setback to your ambitions. It will, however, enrich your experience if you have enough sense not to worry."
cancer,2010-03-13,"You might read someone's energy wrong today, believing that you have more support than you actually do. Your tenuous position could be exacerbated if you make a commitment based upon your incorrect assumption. It's futile to pretend that you'll be able to finish everything on schedule; instead, admit that you underestimated the amount of time needed to finish the job. You won't be faulted if you come clean in advance."
leo,2010-03-13,"You may feel as if you are getting mixed messages from someone you love, but you are probably a bit confused all on your own. It's easy to be so idealistic today that you become discouraged when anything falls short of perfection. But, of course, it's not likely that others can live up to your high expectations. You'll be happier if you can be more flexible and refrain from sharing all your judgments now."
virgo,2010-03-13,"It's hard to know how to best schedule your time today, for the details about what you must accomplish keep changing. Fortunately, you may be uncharacteristically willing to let go of your need to be in control, for your regular analytical skills won't be of much use now. Asking for guidance from someone else isn't a smart idea, either. Let your imagination, not your map, guide you through the murky waters ahead."
libra,2010-03-13,"Tasks that require focused thinking can be challenging; don't bother trying to pay your bills today. Instead, do something artistic that will allow you to rely more on your visionary side than your rational abilities. If you have a room that needs redecorating, there's no longer any need to put off the project. But don't spend the day lost in planning, either. Instead, be creative and let your inner child out to play."
scorpio,2010-03-13,"You aren't so sure about your feelings today and that can make it trickier to make choices that might otherwise be very straightforward. The more you try to deconstruct your emotions by giving voice to them, the less connected you feel with yourself, your family or your personal history. There's no need to force an issue now, so be smart and consciously choose to make your decisions later next week."
sagittarius,2010-03-13,"You might believe that you have a better way to put all of the activities of the day in order, but your plan might not work for anyone else. You can see things differently than others do today, but your ideas may not be very practical. Don't spend too much time trying to convince your friends that you are right. Do your own thing, if necessary, and make your pitch next week when your thinking is clearer."
capricorn,2010-03-13,"Today you might be anxious about money, yet spending time working on your finances now doesn't make you feel any better. It's not about logic; your current fears are coming from your subconscious mind where common sense doesn't matter. Nevertheless, you can minimize the negative effects of your uncertainty by keeping your mind busy on other activities."
aquarius,2010-03-13,"Someone who normally looks to you for answers might not be so sure about your advice today. You aren't as willing to be the authority figure now because you just don't feel as certain as you usually do. Each time you think you know what's going on, something shifts and you realize that you misread the situation, thereby undermining your confidence. Don't worry; you are wise to acknowledge the current uncertainty and admit what you don't know."
pisces,2010-03-13,"You may reach a turning point today when self-doubt begins to transform into confidence. But it's smart to keep your eye on this process, for your growing certainty could morph into blind optimism. The wide spectrum of feelings might be confusing to others, even if you just accept it as the way things are for now. The power of positive thinking is real, but remember that it has limits, too."
aries,2010-03-14,"It's no simple matter to say exactly what you mean today, especially when your own thoughts are so fleeting. It's frustrating because so many original ideas are blowing through the caverns of your mind now. But you might be more successful at catching the wind, so it's a smarter strategy to sit back and enjoy the show. Don't worry; you'll be better able to share your vision over the next few days after everything quiets down."
taurus,2010-03-14,"It may be challenging for you to grasp the fullness of what's happening today as you keep trying to make sense out of something that isn't sensible. This could bring up issues of trust because it's not easy to be open to someone else's point of view when you aren't clear about your own. Nevertheless, you still should be able to distinguish between your uncertainty and the information that you need to know in order to make a decision now."
gemini,2010-03-14,"You would be wise to watch what you say because your key planet Mercury aligns with the Sun today, adding power to your words. But five planets in empathic Pisces will probably increase your sensitivity enough to hear things before others say them. Although your intuition should lead you in the right direction, it can still be confusing when you don't understand how you already know something. Remember, you don't need a logical explanation all the time."
cancer,2010-03-14,"You may be on a roll, for your intuition is right on the money, enabling you to react quickly in nearly any situation. Don't worry about explaining yourself today; just take advantage of your ability to know what's happening without the need for words. You can always strike up a conversation at a later time, but now your thoughts will only get in the way."
leo,2010-03-14,"Sometimes it's challenging for you to ignore a feeling, even though you know it doesn't apply to the current situation. Your senses are telling you one thing, yet your subconscious mind is saying something else. Usually, it a good idea to listen to your inner voice; now, however, relying on just the facts will lead you in the right direction."
virgo,2010-03-14,"Your thoughts intensify as your key planet Mercury joins the Sun today. Paradoxically, this may not make you feel at ease because the alignment is in fuzzy Pisces. Although you prefer precision in communication, you must be satisfied now with dreamy images. Accepting the soft focus on your lens can help you to be less critical and express your creativity instead."
libra,2010-03-14,"You could benefit from less scheduling today rather than more. Surprisingly, you'll accomplish a lot more by going with the flow than by making commitments in advance because you could promise so much that you end up being scattered and inefficient. Instead of trying to plan every moment of your day, just let the currents carry you where they will."
scorpio,2010-03-14,"You are riding a wave of intellectual creativity now that enables you to express your thoughts in a positive manner. Although the potential is great, it may be difficult for you to get started. It's not that you lack motivation; rather you are challenged to focus your grandiose visions. Don't follow your regular routines. Do things differently today and you'll be surprised at how easily you find your groove."
sagittarius,2010-03-14,"It's not easy for you to exercise restraint today if you are overly confident that whatever you do will work out fine. Although your personal life is likely looking good, don't assume that everything is coming up roses. Keep in mind that your view of reality is somewhat distorted now and you are seeing things through a rose-colored lens. It's great to be positive but don't let blind optimism steer you in the wrong direction."
capricorn,2010-03-14,"You may not feel very productive today as your dreams flow out of their nocturnal slumber and into the light of day. It's uncharacteristically challenging for you to get a handle on what's happening now and the harder you try the less certain you become. Fortunately, this can be a great day to get lost in your fantasies, hang out with friends or make time for a personal retreat. Withdrawing from your regular responsibilities could be just what is needed to get you back on track."
aquarius,2010-03-14,"You want to integrate your core beliefs into the fabric of your life, but someone may challenge your assumptions now. Instead of wasting your energy trying to defend your opinions or justify your values to anyone else, it would be smarter to spend some time thinking about what's most important to you. This isn't about finding facts to support your position; it's about deciding who you want to be."
pisces,2010-03-14,"This is a powerful time in your life and avoiding the serious issues won't help you solve the underlying problems. But balancing the gravity of these times with the potential levity of your emotions today can be tricky business. Although it may not be appropriate to concentrate only on having a good time, a bit of fun now can be revitalizing and help you face the challenges ahead."
aries,2010-03-15,"You are caught in a strange spot in the fabric of time today as the New Moon activates your 12th House of Destiny. It's apparent that big changes are about to unfold in your life, but first you must bring an old project to conclusion. Once you finish tying up loose ends, only then will you be allowed to move into the next phase of your life."
taurus,2010-03-15,Today's New Moon revives your desire to be around like-minded people as she zaps your 11th House of Friends. But you aren't willing to be a silent partner or do what others expect. Your strong opinions can teach everyone a thing or two if you don't take your point of view too seriously. Knowing when to let go of control may be the smartest thing you can learn now.
gemini,2010-03-15,"Unexpected changes at work can catch you off guard and throw you for a loop today. Perhaps you are given a new task to do and you don't know how you'll fit it into your day. Or, maybe changes in the management structure directly impact your work. In any case, consider what you can do to shake things up even more. This is no time to maintain the status quo."
cancer,2010-03-15,"If you have been dreaming of going on an exotic vacation to a place far away, don't let the current opportunity slip by without taking action. It doesn't matter that you can't afford the time off or the costs involved. What matters is that you try to do something extraordinary. Imagine your fantasy coming true; making preliminary plans now won't require a commitment of resources and you can always put the logistics together later on."
leo,2010-03-15,"You often seem so capable that it can be hard to get help when you need it. Your friends may be hesitant to offer their assistance now, even if you could use the support. Meanwhile, you might feel as if you waited too long and don't want to appear desperate. It's not too late if you act now. Show your vulnerability and ask for what you need."
virgo,2010-03-15,"Everyone seems to be full of surprises today as the New Moon turns your 7th House of Partners inside out. Just as you expect one thing to happen, something else comes out of left field. You could become very anxious if your approach to what's occurring is overly rigid. But the sudden changes might open doors to great potential if you are willing to remain flexible."
libra,2010-03-15,"Improving your health through diet and exercise is something that often sounds like a smart idea but requires a serious commitment on your part. Fortunately, your good intentions go a long way now and beginning a new regimen can have a lasting impact as the New Moon falls in your 6th House of Habits. Remember, a small change that endures is more significant than a big one that doesn't."
scorpio,2010-03-15,"An unexpected dance with romance might be just what you need now, whether or not you actually do anything about it. This could be a wonderful experience that takes place within your imagination, yet it might also have real implications in your life if you act on your feelings. Either way, give yourself permission to feel good about a current attraction wherever it leads."
sagittarius,2010-03-15,"You may be better off keeping your feelings to yourself today, even if you are tempted to open up and share what you've been going through. Unfortunately, some matters are best left at home; bringing your personal life into the office might not be appropriate. But don't let your current discretion become an excuse for shutting down emotionally and not feeling anything at all. Writing in a journal or talking to a trusted friend could be a healthier outlet."
capricorn,2010-03-15,"A sibling or close friend might do something today that confuses you, but you shouldn't let this become the focus of your day. You have more important things to do than wonder about someone's motives. Of course, you could be direct and ask questions to find out what's going on. There's no reason to be left in the dark, but if answers aren't forthcoming, just let it go for now and return to the puzzle another time."
aquarius,2010-03-15,"Brilliant new ideas about increasing your income could come from today's New Moon in your 2nd House of Money. But every train of thought won't lead to profitable strategies because you might not be as practical as you need to be now. Consider everything that comes across your desk, but avoid putting all your golden eggs in any one basket."
pisces,2010-03-15,"You may get a whole new lease on life, thanks to today's New Moon in your sign. Every way you turn reveals another path you haven't yet thought about taking. But there's no need to rush into anything at this time. You are an explorer, but your uncharted lands are not in the outer world; they are within you. Take your time and consider each option before making your choice."
aries,2010-03-16,"Yet another wave of energy surges through your life today as the Moon arrives in your excitable sign for a two-day visit. But it may not be so easy because you could become overwhelmed with your feelings. It's especially challenging if you don't have someone with whom you can share your emotional stress. Opening up to a friend may make you feel vulnerable, but it could strengthen your relationship in the long run."
taurus,2010-03-16,"Responsibilities at work have piled up enough to make you realize that you don't have time to spare. You may need to stand up to your boss and say no because you won't be able to do what's being asked. It's not that you are trying to avoid work; it's just that you already have plenty on your plate. Avoid unproductive distractions, even if you are restless today; concentrating on your job will help you get through this crunch."
gemini,2010-03-16,"You may feel as if you are full of ideas today yet still creatively blocked somehow. You're eager to show your friends what you can do, yet you might not believe that they really want to see it. Although you usually like to steer clear of emotional drama, denial of your fear could bring you face to face with an uncomfortable level of intensity now. Believe it or not, facing it head-on can help to heal your insecurities."
cancer,2010-03-16,"You have been swimming in the waters of your own emotions, but now you may be pulled up onto dry land. It's time to act on your feelings, rather than just experiencing them. However your behavior could be restrained by old fears of rejection that swiftly come to the surface as you begin to swing into motion. Take a few breaths to honor your past and then push through the resistance. Whatever happens, you'll be able to be proud of yourself for taking a chance and exposing your inner process."
leo,2010-03-16,"A wave of confidence surges through you as the Moon enters your cavalier 9th House. The fiery Aries Moon combines with Mars, now gaining momentum in your 1st House of Personality, to give you the ability to make plans for the future, even if you aren't yet clear how you will handle the current circumstances. There's no need to figure out everything in one day; release your anxiety little by little and let time work it's magic."
virgo,2010-03-16,"You may be a bit frustrated with yourself today because you don't know what to do with your restlessness. You are itching for a new experience -- something that revitalizes you and focuses your attention on the excitement of living in the present moment. But it's difficult to let go of your financial commitments. It's best to simply observe your dilemma now, rather than attempting to change too much too fast."
libra,2010-03-16,"The Moon's entry into your 7th House of Relationships reminds you of the weird paradox of being yourself when that self includes someone else in it. But it's not easy to find that delicate line between loving someone and being codependent, especially when you are so good at making others happy. Although you may create stress in the present moment by looking out for your own needs, it will make you an even better partner in the future."
scorpio,2010-03-16,"Today you might be dancing right at the edge, yet maintaining a cool demeanor is the smartest approach. Unfortunately, your patience has run thin and you are tempted to do something that you'll surely regret. Don't do it; there is too much at stake. Be extra attentive of your high energy and do what you can to blow some of it off through physical activity or concentrated work. You'll feel great if you channel your nervous anticipation into productivity."
sagittarius,2010-03-16,"You feel lucky today and you might be tempted to take a foolish risk. Positive thinking is supposed to be a useful tool, but in your case now it might be too much of a good thing. It's not that a gamble will lead to loss; it's just that taking the more reliable path will give you an even better chance at success. Don't get greedy and overshoot your mark. Just set a sensible goal and then do what you can to reach it."
capricorn,2010-03-16,"You can see quite far down the road to success now, but you might not trust your perceptions. You may be very self-critical, believing that you won't be able to sustain your current level of productivity as you push into new territory. Admittedly, if you are driving yourself too hard, you might burn yourself out before you reach your destination. Although it's counter-intuitive, slowing yourself down today can help you achieve success sooner."
aquarius,2010-03-16,"You may be all over the map, distracted by one thing after another now. However, each time you lose your focus, instant karma makes you aware of what you did and swiftly sets you back on track. There isn't much time to waste today if you want to fit in everything that you must accomplish. Luckily, you are able to surpass your own expectations if your intentions are clear."
pisces,2010-03-16,"You are standing in a tricky spot, for yesterday's New Moon marked the beginning of a new phase of your life. But today your eager anticipation runs into a roadblock, making you wonder if you are even on the right path. Don't get discouraged because the current obstacles are a test to see if you are really serious about what you are doing. This is no time to quit; your hard work is building a strong foundation for your future."
aries,2010-03-17,"Moderation may be the wisest strategy today, but it's not the path that you are likely to take. Instead, your imagination can lead you to an extreme point of view and you are already putting your impulsive idea into action before you give it a second thought. You know what you want and are willing to take a gamble to get it. Counting to ten before you jump into anything new could slow you down just enough to save the day."
taurus,2010-03-17,"You might surprise yourself today by forgetting your agenda and helping others to achieve their objectives instead. Normally, you derive strength from moving slowly and with great determination. Now, however, your eagerness to finish a job may encourage you to start it before you are fully prepared. Don't be misled by your excitement; impulsive behavior will only lead you astray."
gemini,2010-03-17,"Although you aren't quite finished dealing with a serious set of circumstances that prevent you from reaching your goals, you should get significant relief now as talkative Mercury harmonizes with fiery Mars. You can further your career objectives today by letting go of any fear you have around your professional aspirations. Don't worry about whether or not you'll succeed. There isn't time to hold anything back; just give it all you have and watch what happens."
cancer,2010-03-17,"You can easily say something today that you don't really mean, but you may blurt it out before you realize what you've said. Although you might shock yourself, others probably won't be as surprised as you are. In fact, your ideas could sound so exciting that someone else picks up the lead, prompting you to lose control. Don't hold on to your agenda; it will only get in the way of your success."
leo,2010-03-17,"This is one of those rare days when the best of things and the worst of things can be wrapped into one package. But it's not about your judgment of good or bad, for you will probably bounce back and forth between these two opposites as your feelings change quickly now. Rather, it's about being able to let go of control at the right moment. Luckily, your thinking is clear, so don't be afraid to trust your intuition."
virgo,2010-03-17,"You cannot rely on others today, even if they are usually quite dependable. A co-worker may be very smooth-talking, leading you to think you will get the support you want. But everyone seems to be overly independent now, including you. Don't worry if you are required to demonstrate how capable you are as a solo act, even if you usually prefer working with a partner. You might surprise yourself with how much you can accomplish on your own."
libra,2010-03-17,"You can become easily confused because your intentions are to be nice and sweet, yet your actions may convey less compassion and patience. At first, you might deny that your behavior is abrupt, but as you become more aware of your actions, you will be able to change. Don't expect too much too fast; your mind is working ahead of the rest of you and it could take a few days for you to catch up with your thoughts."
scorpio,2010-03-17,"You are on fire today as your creativity burns hot and fast. But spontaneous self-expression isn't all fun and games because you could feel exhausted after an intense period of productivity. Although you might not be able to maintain a steady pace throughout the day, give yourself some time to rest between the bursts of energy."
sagittarius,2010-03-17,"You still run the risk of pushing your luck too far today, so it's a smart idea to temper your extreme emotional reactions with a bit of cool logic. However, this may not be as simple as it sounds, for you don't want to lose an opportunity that is presented to you now. Don't doubt yourself if things are looking good. But rest assured that you have more time than you realize to respond to the current situation."
capricorn,2010-03-17,"You might be ready to throw caution to the wind today as your current excitement overwhelms your fears. But the heavy hand of karma won't let you get away with any shortcuts now and you'll have to face a hard lesson quickly if you don't follow the rules and adhere to the proper procedures. Fortunately, if you do things right, you'll probably reach your goal much quicker than you ever imagined."
aquarius,2010-03-17,"The Sun hooks up with your key planet Uranus today to electrify your 2nd House of Finances. Be careful about buying something you don't really need, for you might not realize how much you spent until the deal is already done. On the other hand, Uranus could also bring a sudden windfall. Either way, it's easy come, easy go, so think about what you are doing with your money before it's too late."
pisces,2010-03-17,"It's nearly impossible for anyone to know what you're up to now, because you aren't likely following a script. The shocking Sun-Uranus conjunction falls in your 1st House of Personality, provoking you to act impulsively to express your current sense of independence. Ultimately, your unorthodox behavior is your attempt to be true to yourself. Just remember that you can be kind to others in the process."
aries,2010-03-18,"You may be more realistic about what's ahead than you have been in a while. However, you are still eager to entertain an idea if it sounds exciting, though you won't be so quick to do something about it now. Don't worry; you haven't lost your edge of heightened anticipation for long, so enjoy the less frantic approach to life while it lasts."
taurus,2010-03-18,You may feel a bit lazy today because it's hard to get yourself motivated when you think that your work won't be appreciated. But this could be a self-fulfilling prophecy since your lack of effort will likely be frowned upon. The Moon's midday return to your sign is an opportunity for you to push through your internal resistance and do what's expected of you now.
gemini,2010-03-18,"Your key planet Mercury may be clever, but its tense opposition to restrictive Saturn is likely to prevent you from demonstrating your usual wit. Your thoughts may not come to you as quickly now, making it tough for you to talk your way out of a difficult situation. Instead of trying to get around the resistance, handle the uncomfortable issues that are being raised."
cancer,2010-03-18,"Although you may express yourself eloquently today, it's crucial to steer clear of an emotional outbreak. Becoming involved in someone's drama now can take precious time and energy, yet won't increase your chances for success. Instead, show your support by being the strong and silent type. Let a weary friend lean on your shoulder without losing yourself in the complicated dynamics of the situation."
leo,2010-03-18,"Immediate concerns about your job are replacing grand notions about long-term decisions that you have been trying to address. With several planets in your 9th House of Big Ideas, you may have allowed your thoughts about your future to grow out of hand. If your plans are unmanageable, it's time now to tone down the noise and set priorities based on the importance of the present moment."
virgo,2010-03-18,"Although you may be forced to retreat as an idea of yours runs into insurmountable resistance, you may be relieved that you finally know your limits. It might not feel good when you cannot do what you planned because of financial constraints, but at least now you have the structure that you were previously missing. Don't take the current situation as a sign of defeat; instead, set your feet firmly on the ground and then, once you have established a strong foundation, try again."
libra,2010-03-18,"You don't normally enjoy being the person who says no, but today it might feel good because you believe that ultimately you are helping someone who truly needs it. Don't hold back because you fear being perceived as negative. Your authoritative guidance may be a surprise to the other person, but your kindness will still come across if your intentions are good."
scorpio,2010-03-18,"If you are willing to let go of your unnecessary fear, the Moon's entry into your 7th House of Partnerships today can strengthen an existing relationship. You may be scared of losing control if you acquiesce to someone else's demands, but responding intelligently to reason will demonstrate your willingness to compromise. Remember, there is no right or wrong in the land of emotions, so stay open to points of view beyond your own."
sagittarius,2010-03-18,You may be disappointed today when it becomes apparent that you have to handle any resistance that surfaces prior to continuing on your path. It's especially difficult if you have been anticipating success and are now told that you have additional work to do before reaching your destination. But don't let the setback bother you. Keep a positive attitude and meet any problems head-on. You are closer to your goal than you think.
capricorn,2010-03-18,"Whether you must deal with a powerful authority today or act as if you are one, it's not easy to deal with those who see you as the source of a problem. You may not be able to use cool logic effectively in your bid to handle the opposition now because the more you talk, the wider the gap becomes between you and your adversary. Instead of using words, demonstrate your competence through sensible action. It's the best way to make your case."
aquarius,2010-03-18,"Instead of assuming that you have all the answers that you need now, try softening your approach by acknowledging the expertise that others bring to your world. Being open to new information may be more important than maintaining your authority, but you must be secure in what you know in order to admit what you don't. Keep in mind that you have a chance to demonstrate real wisdom today rather than just your intelligence."
pisces,2010-03-18,"Although you may be willing to take constructive criticism today, you get very touchy if you feel someone is questioning the validity of your core beliefs. Some things are simply not up for debate. But don't use your convictions as a way to avoid hearing the truth. Be willing to reconsider your opinions when you receive new data that is contrary to what you previously knew."
aries,2010-03-19,"It's time to take a deep breath and regroup. You have been on the go and although it may seem as if the pace of your life has slowed down a bit, it won't last. But rather than relaxing during the day, it may be smarter to make sure that everything is in order and to firm up your plans. Take care of basic needs such as paying bills, shopping for food and getting enough sleep."
taurus,2010-03-19,"You would be doing fine today if there wasn't so much to be done. You might even feel as if your friends aren't participating as much as you would like, but they seem to be relatively unresponsive to your needs. Although you would prefer to have fun now, it's best that you just do the work that's expected of you and wait for the weekend to take some extra time for yourself."
gemini,2010-03-19,"There's no need for you to say everything you know today because sometimes things are better kept secret for a while. Knowing when to talk and when to keep quiet may be one of your ongoing struggles in life, and now you have an opportunity to work on this issue. Your silence could be unnerving to someone else, but that's not your concern. Let others deal with their own insecurities as you practice discretion."
cancer,2010-03-19,"You could be feeling more social than usual as you look forward to the weekend. But rather than being spontaneous, you might want to check in with your friends and make your plans in advance. Although this strategy may offer you the security you seek, leave yourself enough room to change your mind and do something else at the last minute."
leo,2010-03-19,"You may be more interested now in making steady progress toward accomplishing your goals than being acknowledged for what you are doing. Fortunately, you might actually be able to see the results of your work more easily than you have in the recent past. Still, it will probably take more time for anyone else to recognize your current contribution. But don't be impatient and draw attention to yourself. It will mean more to you when it comes on its own volition."
virgo,2010-03-19,"Making concrete plans for the future is easier today because you are able to see more possibilities than usual. But even with your expanded vision, you're not likely to get lost in an impossible fantasy. Trust your own judgment now over that of others, for they might encourage you to take more of a risk than is sensible for you at this time."
libra,2010-03-19,You could be rather persistent today and might even get on other people's nerves. Your current insistence is surprising to your friends who are more familiar with your easygoing style. Don't settle for less than you want. It's your turn to push up against the barriers of someone's unwillingness to commit. Just make sure that you are conscious about what you are doing and be willing to take no for an answer.
scorpio,2010-03-19,"It's frustrating when someone wants you to do something that you would prefer to avoid. Although you are able to let others know what your limits are now, they might not acknowledge your needs because they are so determined to have their way. This can create an awkward impasse, but you'll be better off in the long run if you hold firm to your position and remain clear about your boundaries."
sagittarius,2010-03-19,"No matter how many great ideas you have today, you'll need to keep bringing yourself back to what needs to be done right now. It's more important for you to demonstrate your consistency and reliability than your optimism and ability to see the big picture. For now, don't allow yourself to get distracted by anything that doesn't contribute to your immediate commitments."
capricorn,2010-03-19,"A low-level anxiety keeps you in motion today as you attempt to express yourself creatively. Although it might be impossible to achieve peace and quiet, you should be able to find a steady groove that allows you to be productive while bringing you temporary satisfaction. Forget about your long-term goals for now; instead just take your time and stay focused on fulfilling your current obligations."
aquarius,2010-03-19,"Although you may have to go off to work today, your mind is still lingering on personal matters. You might even try to begin your weekend a bit early, but it's crucial to tie up loose ends before you make your escape. Remember, you'll be able to enjoy yourself at home, yet it may not be until later in the day. It's not easy being patient, but doing things in the proper order will be more satisfying in the long run."
pisces,2010-03-19,"Sometimes you Fish like to swim through your day, letting the currents take you where they will. Today, however, you'll be better off making your plans in advance and then trying to stick to them. But keep in mind that this could be a study in frustration if you are so rigid that you cannot alter your schedule when circumstances warrant. Being practical is ultimately more important than doing everything your way."
aries,2010-03-20,"You are ready to shine your light and expect others to support you or get out of your way now that the Sun is returning to your sign for its annual visit. But even if you are brilliant, your presence may upset someone who is threatened by your apparent self-confidence. Keep in mind that you can make your day flow easier by lightening up. Taking yourself less seriously will help everyone else do the same."
taurus,2010-03-20,"You may feel as if you are being pushed to take on more than you want to now, but you cannot say no. If you do resist, you might stir up more ill will than if you just grit your teeth and do what's expected of you. Fortunately, once you get started, it will be easier to keep up the pace. Nevertheless, don't be hard on yourself if it takes a while to get in gear today."
gemini,2010-03-20,"It's much easier for you to be open today than it was yesterday. It's as if a weight is being lifted from your shoulders and the self-doubt you had is vanishing. But you could inadvertently start a discussion that takes you to a difficult place, unleashing more emotional drama than intended. Stick with the process; communication will lead to resolution and the heaviness will dissipate as the Moon returns to your sign later in the day."
cancer,2010-03-20,"There are things you want to do now and you aren't willing to wait for the approval of anyone else. But your current impatience can reveal a deeper disagreement between you and a loved one. Nevertheless, it's healing in the long run to talk about issues that you have been trying to avoid. You don't have to shy away from a difficult discussion as long as you refrain from blaming anyone else for your feelings."
leo,2010-03-20,"Watch out world, for you are on a roll today. It feels as if things are falling into place, so you are ready to push as hard as you can to make up for lost time on a significant project. Just remember that your eagerness can provoke someone to resist your progress or secretly work to undermine your position. A little self-restraint on your part should minimize bad feelings all around."
virgo,2010-03-20,"You might prefer to keep your feelings to yourself today, but someone draws you deeper into their situation than you prefer. Your annoyance could come to the surface, provoking you to have an emotional outburst. Unfortunately, it can happen so fast that you don't realize what's occurring until it's over. Instead of making this into a bigger deal by dwelling on your anger, just let it go and move on."
libra,2010-03-20,"The emphasis may now be on someone else instead of you, as the Sun enters your 7th House of Partnerships. You usually don't mind playing a supporting role, but now you might feel as if you need to stand up for yourself. Do whatever it takes in order to make your needs known. Whether or not you reach satisfaction by being fully recognized, at least you can feel good about trying to reestablish balance in your life."
scorpio,2010-03-20,"You could get annoyed today because everyone seems to be hurrying you along. You would rather stop your forward progress for just a little while to give yourself a chance to assimilate how much has happened in these past few weeks. Unfortunately, you cannot justify taking so much time away from your chores. You have obligations to fulfill so you'll need to wait until another day before you can luxuriously sink into the present moment without feel guilty."
sagittarius,2010-03-20,"These are exciting times, but you could become so opinionated that you waste a lot of time and energy defending your position instead of doing what you want to do. You can avoid an unnecessary argument today by simply toning down your rhetoric. There's no place now for sweeping generalizations or unsubstantiated accusations. Adopting a more easygoing approach will help you be more productive in the long run."
capricorn,2010-03-20,"Your concern with what's happening on the home front intensifies today with the Sun's entry into your 4th House of Foundations. You may feel torn between heading out into the world and staying at home. But if you do choose to have a family day, don't do everything the same old way. You'll end up being restless and bored unless you make a concerted effort to stir things up by writing your own script instead of following the one that's always worked before."
aquarius,2010-03-20,"Consider throwing your plans out the window today, for you'll have more fun starting anew than trying to maintain your regular schedule. Spontaneity is more important now than productivity or efficiency. Don't worry about what others think of your erratic behavior. But be prepared to face some serious objections to your new strategy. Even if the discussion becomes intense, you'll be glad that you changed your approach to suit your current needs."
pisces,2010-03-20,"Taking a project to the next level isn't enough today; you must also make certain that you have the time and resources to see it through. If you don't, things could fall apart much sooner than you expect. But if you evaluate all the contingencies before making your final decision, you should be all right. Don't act impulsively before completing an emotionally detached analysis to help you decide whether or not to proceed along your previously determined path."
aries,2010-03-21,"There is a delicate balance between what you intend to accomplish today and what you are actually able to do. If you set your goals too high and try to pack too much into the day, you could become annoyed with yourself when you realize that you have fallen short of your own expectations. But if you have a more realistic approach, you'll be able to meet the challenges of the day."
taurus,2010-03-21,"Keeping yourself busy around the home today is one way to maintain your progress. However, it's difficult to overcome your own inertia if you take the lazy way out and decide to do as little as possible. Once you opt for engagement versus withdrawal, it becomes easier for you to accomplish each successive task on your list. Nevertheless, it's still a good idea to start off slowly and build momentum throughout the day."
gemini,2010-03-21,"Just as everything seems to fall into place, you become aware of the fact that something isn't quite right. Your first impulse may be to withdraw your energy from the outer world and wait until a better time to push forward. But upon deeper consideration, you have a chance to realize how effective you can be if you keep inching your way toward your goals in spite of the resistance you must face."
cancer,2010-03-21,"You may have an opportunity to build your self-esteem while you're expanding your horizons. It could be as simple as learning a better way to protect your feelings in a debate. This might not sound like a big deal, but if you think someone is pushing you too hard, you'll likely resist because of your insecurity. It's one thing to know how you feel; it's something else to have enough courage to act on your intuition."
leo,2010-03-21,"You cannot decide whether to laugh or cry today, yet ultimately, you might feel better by doing both. On one hand, your plans have been thwarted and it really doesn't make you happy at all. On the other hand, you are done crying over spilled milk, for you don't see any future in worrying about the past. But be careful not to make any decision too hastily now or you'll face the music later on."
virgo,2010-03-21,"You have had your share of responsibilities over the past couple of years, and today could be an instant replay of the hardest moments. But it will probably be much easier to reminisce than to have to go through all the tests again. The key to standing up to those who might give you a hard time is keeping an open mind and knowing that you are coming from a place of love."
libra,2010-03-21,"This weekend continues to be a bit of a struggle for you as someone attempts to steamroll right over your emotions. Fortunately, you're not acting much like the textbook Libra who is wishy-washy and acquiesces to others. Instead, you are in touch with your feelings, know what you want and are able to master the energy required to reach your current destination."
scorpio,2010-03-21,"The volume on your life is turned up as the enthusiastic Aries Sun aspects your two key planets today. A harmonious trine to Mars gives you an can-do attitude that borders on bothersome to others. Still, they are wise to trust you even with the most delicate job. But an opposition to taskmaster Saturn could call in self-doubt. Luckily, you can see your recent accomplishments without having to look too far. Acknowledging how capable you are enables you to quickly get back onto your path of productivity."
sagittarius,2010-03-21,"You are now able to keep up with those who were previously running circles around you. But you question whether or not this is an intelligent use of your energy. Keep in mind that self-restraint isn't about avoiding confrontation at this time. Instead, cultivate your concentration, even while others are distracting you from your feelings."
capricorn,2010-03-21,"You may attempt to hide your need to control others today because you think that it could get in your way instead of helping you reach your goals. But showing a little more compassion is always a good idea, even if it means keeping some of your own ideas to yourself for a while longer. Fortunately, you should be able to perform exquisitely once you swing into motion, so don't be afraid of setting your fears aside for a while."
aquarius,2010-03-21,"Allowing someone else to take the lead today could relieve more pressure than you expect. Your first impulse might be to resist anyone else being in charge, but you'll gain a sense of relief once you relinquish control. Having more time to play now makes you feel better about yourself and more willing to expend the extra effort that's now required of you."
pisces,2010-03-21,"You might feel like a beached fish, longing for the nurturing nutrients of the fluid seas. But the energy is flowing mostly through fire and air signs now, drying up your emotions. Don't waste your time complaining about the lack of watery feelings in your life, just let others know of your sincere intentions. You have plenty to do before the tides change again."
aries,2010-03-22,"Today can be an important day because there's more going on than what appears on the surface. You can accomplish a lot more than you expect now, even if you are feeling a bit scattered. Don't try too hard to focus your energy; letting your personal intentions meander could eventually create the most meaningful path for you."
taurus,2010-03-22,"You may feel as if you have walked onto a set for a new science fiction movie, making it difficult for you to separate the strangeness of fantasy from what is actually true. Your desire to explore new territory now could give you enough impetus to break out of an old rut, but you quickly realize that you are not in control of what's happening. Avoid any temptations to pull too tightly on the reins; you'll receive more benefits from the current situation if you don't try to be in charge."
gemini,2010-03-22,"You may be at a loss for words today, even if you normally have the gift of gab. You know what you want to say, but you have a tough time conveying your message. Instead of overcompensating by coercing others to listen to your ideas and then persuading them with vague generalities, let your thoughts gel for a day or two before saying much of anything at all."
cancer,2010-03-22,"It becomes easier throughout the day for you to share your feelings with those you love. But you also want to honor the Moon in your reclusive 12th House by keeping your thoughts to yourself. But your self-imposed isolation begins to wear on you the longer you keep to yourself. Ultimately, you will be happier once you reconnect with those you may have previously pushed away."
leo,2010-03-22,"It's challenging to stay true to your energy today because you are picking up on thought forms that aren't your own. It's unusual for you to be so wired to what's going on that you have no room for your own ideas, yet the cosmic noise could be overpowering now. Acting with intention is fine, but don't forget there are other issues that also play into the current mix of events, so remain open to unexpected changes."
virgo,2010-03-22,"You are being tempted by the illusion that knowing more gives you more choices as the Moon visits informative Gemini. Nevertheless, you know that it's better to have useful data than to be overwhelmed by too many facts. Just make sure that you don't miss a crucial part of the equation because you are overly concerned with your efficiency at this time."
libra,2010-03-22,"Someone you like lures you off the beaten path; your key planet Venus may lead you into some pretty strange territory today. The unknown has a certain charm now, especially if you don't have to explore it by yourself. But previous obligations could prevent you from taking a current whim too far. Being responsible is the mature thing to do, but try not to close the door completely on the possibility of play."
scorpio,2010-03-22,"Your key planets Mars and Pluto are tied up in a complicated dance of the heart with loving Venus today, leaving you with a vulnerable feeling of loss or emptiness. Fortunately, you have an extraordinary spiritual foundation on which to build a new relationship, but taking too much of a risk or moving too fast could ruin your chances. Observe your feelings without getting too caught up in them for now."
sagittarius,2010-03-22,"The proverbial warning about judging a book by its cover could have real significance for you today. You might miss an extraordinary opportunity now if you jump to conclusions or let your assumptions get in the way. It's difficult to recognize a cosmic message if it arrives wrapped in a plain package, but it will become obvious that it's something special once you begin to open it."
capricorn,2010-03-22,"You may appear overly intense to others today, yet you are not as attached to the drama as it appears. A friend or partner might rub you the wrong way and what starts as a little disagreement could turn into a major conflict. An argument may suddenly flare up and then settle down. Instead of just following the course of least resistance, be willing to stand up for what you need while also staying as flexible as you can."
aquarius,2010-03-22,"Usually you are the one who is far out of the box, but today someone in your life may be playing the role of a change agent and all you can do is show up and respond accordingly. You may feel as if you are being let off the hook, but you should be prepared to collaborate. Don't just say yes to everything that comes down the road. Sometimes setting boundaries can give you more freedom than going anywhere you please."
pisces,2010-03-22,You might actually believe your own logic today as you try to convince yourself that you don't really need the complexity of emotions. But you probably won't last long with this line of thinking because your feelings are rich with symbols and metaphors. Being methodical now is a good idea and can help you delve into the mysteries of your own mind. But you can also get bogged down if you become too systematic. Find the middle path between your head and your heart.
aries,2010-03-23,You may feel as if you lost an opportunity now that the Moon has sunk into your soulful 4th House. What seemed like a sure thing might no longer be seen in such an optimistic light. But your current lack of clarity has an important purpose because you may have been in too much of a hurry for your own good. Be content with your current situation instead of trying to change anyone's mind. Wait until your confidence returns before pushing forward again.
taurus,2010-03-23,"It's never fun running into obstacles, but it won't be that difficult today if you are patient and take the resistance you meet with a grain of salt. But if you stubbornly push ahead in spite of the changing circumstances, you'll probably make everyone else as unhappy as you make yourself. Don't treat your life as if it was a game of chess now or you'll be frustrated by being stalemated. Cooperation makes more sense than competition."
gemini,2010-03-23,It may appear as if others are cooling off to you today and your attempts to maintain close communication can actually make things worse. Your key planet Mercury could muddy the waters of understanding as it aligns with nebulous Neptune. Don't let your insecurities provoke you to ramble on about unimportant details just because you are afraid of the silence. Avoid unnecessary conflict by allowing others the space they need.
cancer,2010-03-23,"You may be hurt if someone behaves insensitively toward you today, but it's difficult for you to express how you feel. You want others to be aware enough that they notice what they've done and you could become angry if apologies aren't forthcoming. Keeping your emotions to yourself will only make matters worse. Sulking is not a wise course of action. Overcome your moodiness by saying what's on your mind and then be ready to let it go."
leo,2010-03-23,"Harboring resentment can fuel a lingering anger today as the Moon in your 12th House of Secrets is pressurized by unforgiving Saturn and Pluto. Fortunately, a change of attitude is possible if you allow compassion to replace judgment. Keep in mind that it only takes a few words of heartfelt forgiveness to release yourself from the situation that you have inadvertently created."
virgo,2010-03-23,"Your key planet Mercury is pushing you into places you might rather avoid today. You may not be able to turn off the barrage of words that are coming at you from others or from within your own head, but you can lighten your load by moving beyond logic. Analysis can be a trap now; you must shift from language into imaginative symbols to find the solution to your current dilemma."
libra,2010-03-23,"You aren't ready to give up your own happiness in order to save someone else, yet you may feel as if you cannot avoid the unspoken demands of a partner or co-worker. Just remember that you could exhaust yourself trying to make others feel good. Although it may seem selfish, attending to your own needs today is the first step to truly helping those you love."
scorpio,2010-03-23,"You don't want to get into an intense show of emotions with someone who is stirring up your fears now. It's not that you need to avoid the situation completely; it's just that you have so much to do that you cannot waste your time and energy on anything that pulls you off track today. It's not easy to talk your way around the unspoken feelings because words will only add to the confusion. Instead, hold to your vision and save the discussion for another day."
sagittarius,2010-03-23,"It's a bit disconcerting when others show up with such deep feelings that you don't know how to respond. You might try to ignore them, but that only encourages someone to push you harder. You don't have to sink into denial to navigate through these unfamiliar waters. Just say what's on your mind, including your current discomfort with the topic of conversation. Honesty is the best policy, even if it's not what your friend or partner wants to hear."
capricorn,2010-03-23,"Your continuing intensity can be difficult for others to handle today because they could perceive you as overly emotional. But your passion is more about being practical than anything else. What someone else thinks is an overreaction on your part is simply what you must do now to get your way. Still, toning down your sense of urgency will paradoxically help you get what you want with less resistance."
aquarius,2010-03-23,"It's easy for you to lose sight of your destination today, especially if you get caught up in a conflict at work that stirs up your insecurities. A co-worker could criticize your performance or simply not say anything at all. But don't be overly concerned because other people's behaviors might have more to do with the stress they are feeling than anything you have done."
pisces,2010-03-23,"Although you are highly sensitive, it may be a challenge to distinguish what you know from what you are picking up intuitively. Even if your hunches are correct today, it won't be easy to put anything into words. It may be smarter to acknowledge your inability to communicate effectively now than to struggle with the consequences of a misunderstanding. The intensity won't likely fade, even if you gain clarity later in the week."
aries,2010-03-24,"Your friends may be concerned about you today because you aren't as outgoing as they think you should be. But this isn't really your problem. It's more important for you to show your vulnerability now and let others move past your display of competence and into your heart. You might feel uncomfortable knowing that someone truly sees you, but ultimately this is part of your healing process."
taurus,2010-03-24,You may feel as if someone is rubbing you the wrong way today. You can choose to remain irritated or you can use the discomfort as a learning experience. You don't have to stay quiet and let another person continue to annoy you. Stand up for yourself and clearly state your limits. Your relationships will have the potential to develop and grow if you are honest and keep your anger to a minimum.
gemini,2010-03-24,"Your memories may return to haunt you today, making it difficult to finalize a decision. If pushed, unwarranted fears could be the thing that makes the difference, tilting you toward caution rather than action. But even if you say no to an opportunity, you'll still wish you said yes because you could quickly grow bored with your current routine. Once you realize that there's no single path, it will be easier to accept the one you have chosen."
cancer,2010-03-24,"Although your intentions may be straightforward, your behavior doesn't necessarily demonstrate your true feelings today. You could be moodier than you let on, for the hypersensitive Cancer Moon can give you a lot to worry about. But you realize that others tire quickly when you express your concerns, so you may consciously choose to keep any negativity to yourself. Remember, even suppressed feelings can impact your day, so find a way to share your uncertainty without blaming anyone else."
leo,2010-03-24,"You may be required to be on stage today or have interactions with others where you need to set an optimistic tone. But it's not necessarily appropriate for you to share your personal issues, even if you have a lot going on. Keep in mind that you should be able to appear upbeat anyhow and then handle your private matters later on when you have the time."
virgo,2010-03-24,"You might withdraw a little today because your friends and associates seem a bit too moody and you just don't want to deal with them. But pulling away from the group will only reinforce your isolation and provoke more emotional drama. Instead, consider the possibility that it's really your own feelings that are being stirred and not those of everyone else."
libra,2010-03-24,"There's no need to make a big deal out of what you are doing now, but your actions can positively impact others on the job even if they don't realize how much you've done. You may not have a desire now to be in charge, yet you are still able to exert subtle control in order to steer events your way. Nevertheless, it will go easier if you work for the benefit of all."
scorpio,2010-03-24,"Often you are able to demonstrate your power by making up your mind and then sticking to your decision. Now, however, you may be more open to change, especially if someone's new idea can add enjoyment to what you are already doing. Although you might not be willing to sacrifice efficiency for fun, you don't want to lose out on the opportunity to make a good plan even better."
sagittarius,2010-03-24,"You are more inclined today to want to get to the bottom of an emotional issue that has been brewing for a while. But once a conversation has begun, you are likely to grow restless and prefer to change the subject to a lighter topic of conversation. Nevertheless, you'll feel better in the long run if you stick with it until some sort of resolution is reached."
capricorn,2010-03-24,"You may not like it when others aren't open to your method of doing things today. You feel as if they are stuck in their old patterns or, perhaps, just afraid of trying something new. Either way, it's helpful for you to be patient with a friend or partner; being insistent could stir up more resistance instead of acceptance."
aquarius,2010-03-24,"You are usually able to pay sufficient attention to details in order to get a job done, yet you are naturally more interested in concepts than in one specific method. Today, however, you could get bogged down with seemingly unimportant minutiae and you don't see a way to avoid it. Fortunately, your detour into the world of narrow focus can bring its own kind of freedom, so concentrate on whatever it takes to be efficient now."
pisces,2010-03-24,"Your willingness to take an emotional risk might not be apparent today, but it's not about what reaches the surface. You are in the process of making big changes in your attitude and it could take a while before they become obvious. For now, be content with acknowledging the possibilities you see, even if you're not ready to share your optimism with anyone else. There's no need to rush into anything; you'll know when it's time to involve others."
aries,2010-03-25,"It's best to think before you act today because the Moon fires her way into Leo, increasing your chances of responding brashly. Your instincts are usually good, but an impulsive reaction now could lead you astray. Don't be surprised if someone points out your shortsightedness. Instead of being defensive and arguing right away, listen to what is being said. You have an opportunity to grow if you are open to learning a valuable lesson."
taurus,2010-03-25,"Your stubbornness is helpful if others are trying to lead you off course, but circumstances can get complicated if you cannot be flexible. Unfortunately, you can inadvertently dig yourself into a hole by overstating your position and then trying to defend it. It's easy to turn a minor disagreement into a major conflict, but it won't likely be worth the price you'll need to pay."
gemini,2010-03-25,"It's not usually your style to keep things secret, although you are often able to cleverly divert attention to something else. Today, however, you may be the one who's delving into hidden feelings and uncovering an issue that's been on your mind. But just because you bring up a touchy subject doesn't mean that the conversation will go easily. Don't be discouraged; even if the path is difficult, you'll be relieved afterward."
cancer,2010-03-25,"Although you may think that this is a good day to come out of your shell, it may not actually be as easy as you think. You could find yourself trying to cut through a thick emotional blanket that descends over you. It's even more difficult if you are so sensitive to someone else's feelings that you worry about what you might say. However, it's less important to monitor your words than to maintain your boundaries so you don't mix up other people's fears with your own."
leo,2010-03-25,You can wear your feelings pretty close to the surface today and might even be overly expressive if you have been withholding your anger. But others won't likely let you run on with your emotions unrestrained and their response can upset you even more. Keep in mind that your perceptions may be warped by hurtful memories and the present moment may not be quite as intense as it seems. Breathe deeply and be gentle with your judgments before you say something you will regret.
virgo,2010-03-25,"It may not be that simple to let logic reign supreme today, even though it's what you prefer. You have strong preferences about what's happening and you are easily provoked to express them now. You might feel as if someone is pushing you into a battle for survival, but fighting back in order to win will only turn everyone into a loser. It's smarter to strive for a solution based upon cooperation and not competition."
libra,2010-03-25,"You may feel as if you've been pulled in two directions for a while, but now it seems as if you are finally gaining the clarity you need. Your choice might differ from someone else's preference, but you may not be able to verbalize your intentions because you don't want to let anyone down. Unfortunately, too much self-restraint can lead to disappointment in yourself. Finding enough inner strength to say what's on your mind will do wonders for your self-esteem."
scorpio,2010-03-25,"A sense of urgency is added to everything that's going on today, thanks to the Sun's dynamic square to your key planet Pluto. You may not be able to live up to your own expectations now because so many important responsibilities are falling on your shoulders. Even if you are able to do a good job with most of them, something might have to wait until you have the time to get back to it. Just do the best you can, even if it feels like it's not good enough."
sagittarius,2010-03-25,"A sudden burst of confidence today can motivate you to take a risk, especially if you are willing to put your feelings on the line. But you'll need to use your common sense too, for you might appear pushier than you intend. If you run into strong resistance from others now, it might be smart to ease off and give them a little breathing room. Remember, you have more time to accomplish your goals than you realize."
capricorn,2010-03-25,"Being excited about something new can help to motivate you to work harder, but your current intensity may be a bit overwhelming today. Normally, you are quite accomplished at metering out your enthusiasm in a calculated manner in order to be highly effective. Now, however, your feelings can get in the way of your success unless you remember to temper them with a bit of common sense."
aquarius,2010-03-25,"No matter how good your intentions are, you may not be able to meet the current demands that are being placed on you. Although you could be convinced that you will come through with flying colors, others might have unrealistic expectations of you now. Someone in particular may be on your case today, even if you do not understand why. A defensive attitude won't likely help, but incorporating the feedback into your actions can turn you into a hero."
pisces,2010-03-25,"You could create unnecessary problems for yourself today if you decide that you know what's best. Even if you have a clear understanding of the current circumstances, you may place too much importance on one aspect instead of focusing on the whole picture. Changing your approach to a job isn't easy, but compromise will bring much better results now than stubbornly sticking to your plan."
aries,2010-03-26,"Your energy level can be so high that you could exhaust yourself before meeting your obligations. Although you sometimes think that pushing harder and working faster is the answer to every problem, this strategy won't likely work today. Remember, you may still be processing emotions from a recent melodrama and that can tire you out even more. Don't overdo it; moving slowly and consistently now is a more effective way to reach your destination."
taurus,2010-03-26,"Today a domestic issue can heat up as the Leo Moon activates your 4th House of Home and Family. It's not easy for you to express your feelings if they go against the flow, but holding them in won't make anyone feel better in the long run. You might be resistant to facing a difficult situation, but you'll be wise to do it now rather than later."
gemini,2010-03-26,"The Moon's visit to your 3rd House of Communication could pick up the pace of events in your life today, but this might just feel like more of the same. You don't mind things moving quickly, yet a series of odd events could be enough to make you say uncle. Unfortunately, you won't likely be able to change the intensity. Luckily, the energy should settle down over the weekend."
cancer,2010-03-26,"Money issues may be on your plate now that the Moon is visiting your 2nd House of Possessions. It may be as simple as attending to your accounts, but deeper problems could also come to the surface. Good intentions are not enough; neither is just going through the motions superficially. You must demonstrate that you are serious by following through with what you start."
leo,2010-03-26,"If you have been thinking about doing something special, today may be the day to share your plans with others. But you'll need to exercise a bit of caution because once you start talking it may not be that easy to stop. There's nothing wrong with telling your friends about your dreams, even if they are not yet based in reality. Just remember that saying too much can disperse the energy prematurely."
virgo,2010-03-26,"The Moon's current transit of your 12th House of Destiny might increase the tension in your life because the stakes seem so high. Unfortunately, you cannot back out of a game that you started, so it's crucial to be clear about your goals. However, don't be misled into believing that you must win. This is not about coming out on top; it's simply about playing the best you can."
libra,2010-03-26,"You may be spending so much time talking with your friends now that your work suffers. But this is not cause for worry because the Moon's short visit to your social 11th House will be over by tomorrow. In the meantime, don't judge yourself too harshly if your productivity isn't up to par today. You should be able to make up for lost time next week."
scorpio,2010-03-26,"You are encouraged to tell others at work exactly what you think, with the demonstrative Leo Moon in your 10th House of Status today. Although sharing your ideas is easy at first, others won't necessarily agree with your perspective. You may not be eager to back down, but looking at this as a competition will only make matters worse. Keep in mind that finding common ground will ultimately make everyone involved feel good about being on the same page."
sagittarius,2010-03-26,"You may be more inclined than usual to openly discuss your feelings in a personal manner, instead of the more philosophical approach you usually take. But your emotionality could catch others off guard, possibly even making them somewhat uneasy. It's okay to moderate your approach if you feel resistance, but don't use someone else's fear as a reason to withdraw. Gently lean into the discomfort until it feels better for everyone."
capricorn,2010-03-26,"Dealing with others at work can be complicated today because their motives may be very different from yours. Still it would be easier if you knew exactly what they wanted. But as forthright as your associates appear, you intuitively know that something is missing from the equation. The harder you push to get to the bottom of the situation, the more mysterious it becomes. Back off for now; the details will reveal themselves soon enough."
aquarius,2010-03-26,"A partnership may require your immediate attention today, but the background tension doesn't seem to dissipate even if the apparent conflicts are resolved. The actual words spoken indicate everything is okay, but you may still be left with a feeling of confusion. Don't make a big deal about your uncertainty. It's best to downplay any drama now and let events unfold as they will."
pisces,2010-03-26,"The Moon's visit to your 6th House of Work indicates your current need to be recognized for your contribution, however small it may be. But it's important to avoid any kind of grandstanding now, as it will probably backfire on you. Just do your job as effectively as you can and rest assured that others will notice even if they don't say anything about it today."
aries,2010-03-27,"It may be the weekend, but you have plenty on your plate and have high hopes to accomplish a lot today. But, due to circumstances beyond your control, events might not unfold according to your plan. Don't waste time trying to figure out what happened. Just roll with the unpredictable waves of change the best you can. Life should make more sense again tomorrow."
taurus,2010-03-27,"You might think that you are being sweet today, but something that you say is misunderstood and creates a problem where there previously wasn't one. You are clear enough to carefully explain your intent, but somehow your words can still miss the mark. Your smartest strategy now is to stop trying so hard. Paradoxically, as you soften your attitude, others will finally get your point."
gemini,2010-03-27,"You might be so clever that you end up fooling yourself, since your key planet Mercury is in its trickster mode today. If interactions with friends have been stressed over a recent disagreement, words should flow more easily now as long as you don't get hung up in unimportant details. But you could also gloss over a significant piece of data that spins a conversation into strange territory. It's not necessary to force the topic back onto familiar ground; just be aware of where you stand."
cancer,2010-03-27,"You may be expected to take the lead today, even if it's only within your family or group of friends. But someone may be resistant to following in the direction you are heading. This can be a tricky situation because the negativity that appears to come from others could actually be yours. Take some time to examine your concerns about your plans and be open to the possibility that you are facing your own suppressed fear in a projected form. If so, you're the only one who can change your mind."
leo,2010-03-27,"You may feel as if you've been running on autopilot lately. It's not that you aren't aware of what's happening; it's just that you are spontaneously making choices while you are still in motion. However, you might modify your style today because you want to be more conscious of why you are deciding one thing and not another. Logical analysis can be helpful as long as you don't turn it into an obsession that disconnects you from your intuition."
virgo,2010-03-27,"The Moon's entry to your sign today brings a new emphasis on all forms of communication. But your key planet Mercury is so quick now that your thinking could get way ahead of the rest of your world. This strange phenomenon may lead you to feeling a bit alienated from others, even if your interactions appear to flow smoothly. Acknowledge the gulf between your fantasies and reality; you'll probably feel more connected by tomorrow."
libra,2010-03-27,"You might enjoy being gently prodded into doing something that you have been avoiding because you lacked sufficient clarity. Your indecision could end this weekend as a close friend or new acquaintance acts as a catalyst by sharing a perspective you hadn't previously considered. Even if you still have a few reservations, go ahead and take the leap now. You can always revise your plan later on, if necessary."
scorpio,2010-03-27,"Your traditional planetary ruler, Mars, is receiving cosmic instructions today from nebulous Neptune, requiring you to stay receptive to the messages contained in symbols rather than words alone. You have the potential of being newly inspired about a project if you are open to guidance from your imagination, spirits or your version of God. But if this is not your cup of tea, you might float through the day in confusion. Keep in mind that it won't hurt you to learn from things you don't logically understand."
sagittarius,2010-03-27,"It's difficult today to hold on to your recent optimism, but this need not be a source of concern. It's healthy to consider more realistic scenarios and integrate them into your plans to increase your chances for success. But don't be self-indulgent and allow your current worries to grow into self-doubt. It's crucial to maintain your critical thinking, even while dreaming of all the future possibilities just around the corner."
capricorn,2010-03-27,"On one hand, you are relieved by how easy it is for you to be practical and take care of your domestic chores today. On the other hand, you might feel as if you are only going through the motions and that your mind is wandering somewhere else. Although this could be somewhat disconcerting, there's no harm in having one foot here on earth and the other one off in fantasy land for the weekend."
aquarius,2010-03-27,"This could feel like your kind of day, for you've been given a pass to visit whatever worlds of your imagination that you choose. Whether you lose yourself in a movie, a book or in music, sensory stimulation becomes a catalyst for generating fantasy. Unfortunately, you also have real obligations to handle today and you may not be able to avoid them. The smartest strategy is to fulfill your responsibilities first and then relax into the escapist behavior of your choice."
pisces,2010-03-27,"You might as well be playing the lead in your own sci-fi or fantasy movie today as your key planet Neptune downloads a choice of scripts from a parallel universe. The bottom line is that you don't really feel very grounded now and the idea of having a routine day filled with routine activities doesn't appeal to you. Be clear with others and tell them that you need some time alone in order to reconnect with your inner self. Afterward, you will be ready to reenter the real world."
aries,2010-03-28,"You may feel as if you cannot tell your friends what you really want now because of your fear of judgment. Venus, the planet of desire, is in your feisty sign, enticing you to take a risk and share your feelings anyhow. But you would be wise to consider the impact of your words on a loved one before saying something that could be misinterpreted. Don't be afraid to tell the truth; just decide how far you need to take it before you find yourself in over your head."
taurus,2010-03-28,"Your key planet Venus can lure you into the fire today. Although it may seem deliciously warm at first, it could get much hotter than you expect. If you think that you are overstepping your bounds, you might suddenly cool off. Unfortunately, someone may misunderstand your intentions and mistakenly believe that your emotional withdrawal is because of a lack of love. Be clear and make sure you tell it like it is."
gemini,2010-03-28,"You might feel clueless and the more you try to figure out what's happening, the less you seem to know today. Unfortunately, logical investigation isn't going to help now, for reality is being fed by emotional rather than logical currents, and you won't be able to think your way through these circumstances. You'll gain a sense of freedom, or even temporary exhilaration, when you just give in to the flow."
cancer,2010-03-28,"You may be a bit befuddled today as you slip in and out of contact with your subconscious mind. But even when you lose touch with other planes of existence, they are still making themselves known in the here and now. When you can stretch your awareness, you get momentary glimpses of how all the pieces fit together. Then you close back down and fall into confusion. You can relieve some of your anxiety by simply reminding yourself that more is going on than meets the eye."
leo,2010-03-28,"If your expectations are too high now, reality can act like a wet blanket as the truth dampens your spirit. But if you can adjust your attitude to accept what you are being offered, then satisfaction may be within reach. This isn't about striving for less; it's about the practice of being grateful for what you currently have."
virgo,2010-03-28,"Your optimism today can set you up for disappointment. Or, perhaps, you are already discouraged and an enthusiastic friend tries to lift your spirit. Either way, you still might not feel very supported. It's not that you need a lot at this time. Just knowing that others recognize your talents and acknowledge your contributions might be enough to put you back on track. But don't withdraw if you feel misunderstood. Be clear about your intentions and you will ultimately be seen for who you truly are."
libra,2010-03-28,"You are usually able to reach an understanding of how others are feeling, even if it ends up making a decision more difficult. Today, however, interactions with those around you might leave you with a sense of disillusionment. Relationships are a mystery now and you don't even know where to begin to put things back in balance. It is less frustrating if you don't even try. Developing a bit of emotional detachment might allow your perspective to return to normal in just a few days."
scorpio,2010-03-28,"All you want is the connection of familiarity from a friend; you don't need a lot today. But your support network might seem somewhat distant now, leaving you lost somewhere between loneliness and nostalgia. Luckily, it's not nearly as bad as it seems because the gulf between you and others won't last long since it's largely the result of your runaway imagination. Don't worry; the real world is on its way back, bringing more clarity with it."
sagittarius,2010-03-28,"Your playful spirit could run into a wall today, but the external resistance won't be able to hold you down for long. You might be required to readjust your goals, but that's just because they weren't very realistic in the first place. The obstacles will be much easier to handle, even if they were previously insurmountable, once you bring your hopes back into line."
capricorn,2010-03-28,You may need to play the role of the taskmaster today as stern Saturn comes to the forefront. This can be a challenging job because sweet Venus is doing her lovely thing and trying to soften you up. But neither flirtation nor temptation should distract you from your current goals. Don't give in; you have an important part to play by being the one who is the most responsible in the situation.
aquarius,2010-03-28,"It's more difficult to sustain your connection with your imagination now because you need to see tangible results. Although you are often quite capable of depersonalizing your feelings and connecting with a more universal understanding of things, today's Virgo Moon wants you to bring your ideas down to earth. Don't go too far in either direction; seek ways to balance your dreams with what's happening in your immediate environment."
pisces,2010-03-28,"It's challenging today for you to fit neatly into a box that's been created by someone else. But a close friend or partner has very specific expectations about how you should behave now, and you might not perform as desired. Although there may be conflicts between personal styles or values, this is only a problem if one of you is so insecure that you need the other person to agree with you one hundred percent. Assure those you love that your individuality doesn't mean you love them any less."
aries,2010-03-29,"You want to do the right thing in a relationship, with today's Full Moon in your 7th House of Companions, but it's difficult to balance your needs with those of a partner. It may seem to you as if other people are being too demanding and that there isn't much room for negotiation. You might be close to throwing your hands up in frustration and walking away from it all. Give it time; your dreams still may come true."
taurus,2010-03-29,"You are full of good ideas, but find it difficult to turn them into anything practical today. Unfortunately, you may be trying too hard and your narrow focus prevents you from seeing the clearest path to success. Luckily, your key planet Venus receives support from imaginative Neptune later in the day, enabling you to broaden your vision and make the most of the Full Moon illuminating your 6th House of Work."
gemini,2010-03-29,"The artistic Libra Full Moon illuminates your 5th House of Creativity, provoking you to overcome your self-doubt and other people's resistance at the same time. If you are serious about what you are doing, you'll be able to count on the support of your friends. But don't make assumptions, as they will likely lead to disappointment. Clarity in communication is the key to making the day work for you and everyone else involved."
cancer,2010-03-29,"You are particularly sensitive to today's Full Moon, which activates your 4th House of Home and Family. Unfortunately, domestic responsibilities can conflict with your job or be the source for a disagreement over who is in control. Although your loved ones have their expectations of you, it may make more sense to primarily concentrate on your career. You don't have to make this a long-term commitment, but it should help to ease the pressure for now."
leo,2010-03-29,"You won't have to go far for satisfaction today, as the pleasure-seeking Libra Full Moon falls in your 3rd House of Immediate Environment. But with an additional emphasis on your 9th House of Adventure, the proximity of pleasure won't likely stop you from dreaming of distant places and unreachable fantasies. Remember, it's not an either/or situation. Take the middle road and find a way to do both."
virgo,2010-03-29,"Your concern about money might increase today as the Full Moon highlights your 2nd House of Resources. But it's not a simple matter to fix the problem, especially if others are involved in the equation. You may be tempted to minimize the situation, but this is not a time for pie-in-the-sky thinking. Be realistic and deal with the issue as best you can -- directly and at the source."
libra,2010-03-29,"The polarity between yourself and others is emphasized since today's Full Moon is in your sign. You graciously want to act in ways that make those you love feel better about themselves. But the self-reliant Aries Sun in your 7th House of Partners cautions you against codependency. Nevertheless, it's not one approach or the other; it's both. Remember, it's especially beautiful when you can take care of your own needs while also contributing to someone else's well-being, too."
scorpio,2010-03-29,"You may be much more serious about a relationship today than anyone realizes, but that's because you're not revealing all your feelings. You have the ability to focus your intentions more easily now than at other times, and this may mean that there are things that will be left unsaid. Your motives are admirable, for you don't want to burden others with your needs. Nevertheless, be careful not to bury your emotions so deeply that you slip into denial."
sagittarius,2010-03-29,"Keeping your social life from overtaking everything else now can be a challenge because you gain so much when you are around your friends. But there's a limit as to what they can currently do for you and it's up to you to set clear boundaries. This can be complicated by your eagerness to see the good in everyone and everything. Although you'll benefit from your positive attitude, taking it too far won't be helpful to anyone."
capricorn,2010-03-29,"Assuming responsibility is usually not a problem for you, but the Full Moon in your 10th House of Career can entice you to overstep your authority. You might even find yourself in a power struggle that threatens the existing hierarchy. Even if you believe that you are acting with awareness and for the best possible outcome for everyone involved, it's still smart to take a deep breath and slow your pace down. You may be missing something important, so don't push too hard, too fast."
aquarius,2010-03-29,"Getting your facts straight is always important to you, but now that the Full Moon activates your information houses, you'll be even more motivated to know what you're talking about. Still, you'll need to be on guard against becoming a Pollyanna when making plans. You might be aware that you are stretching the truth because you're sharing your dreams, but others could take your words at face value. Make sure to distinguish fact from fantasy for everyone's sake."
pisces,2010-03-29,"You are encouraged to explore some pretty deep issues with someone you trust, as the Full Moon lights up your 8th House of Deep Sharing. Additionally, your key planet Neptune is receiving an exciting kiss from Venus, the love planet, stimulating your fantasies about romance. You can make real headway in an intimate relationship, but Neptune might also be deceptive. Make sure the other person is on the same page as you; otherwise the magic may be all inside your head."
aries,2010-03-30,Someone's indecisive behavior may increasingly bother you today until you lose your temper. But you might learn something important about yourself if you stop to think about your own role in your current frustration. Your impatience could be motivated by your insecurity and it may be more of a problem than the other person's ambiguity. Pull back and give others more space to let them make decisions at their own pace.
taurus,2010-03-30,"You might be concerned today that you will lose your opportunity if you don't say what's on your mind right away. But your sense of urgency is probably an overreaction. Time is running out, but not as quickly as you believe. It's more important now to be thorough in your thinking so your message can be delivered as effectively as possible."
gemini,2010-03-30,"Your key planet Mercury is bombarding you with a continuous stream of thoughts, filling you with anxiety because you cannot process them as fast as they arrive. But your concern may be worsened by self-doubt rather than what's actually happening. Instead of trying to react and work with each and every idea, it would be wiser to let go of the less important ones. Consider today as an exercise in setting priorities."
cancer,2010-03-30,"Your ambivalence about a family matter could easily be misinterpreted by others who think you don't care. But, of course, nothing could be further from the truth. It's just that you are sympathetic to both sides of the issue. To avoid a misunderstanding that could grow into a conflict, make sure to be accurate in your communications and let those you love know exactly what you feel, even if it doesn't lead you to making a decision right now."
leo,2010-03-30,"You could play the role of a diplomat today as you stand in the middle of a conflict, acting as the go-between. You may have your own point of view, yet you are wise enough to keep it to yourself. Don't get tricked into taking sides, for once you do you'll lose neutrality and your ability to effectively help others find common ground."
virgo,2010-03-30,"You aren't as concerned today about holding firmly to your beliefs, but this doesn't mean you'll be a pushover when someone comes along with another point of view. Rather, you are more open-minded now because you understand that different perspectives could be valid, too. Still, you might surprise others by how fast you can close down to defend a core value if you feel coerced. Maintaining healthy boundaries from the start is smarter than overcompensating later on."
libra,2010-03-30,"You might think that all is well with a co-worker or friend, only to discover that you missed an important piece of information. Others may lose patience with you because they believe you knew the truth all along. It doesn't matter if the error was yours or if something was purposefully withheld. What matters now is that you integrate what you learn as best you can and move on."
scorpio,2010-03-30,"You often have more going on than meets the eye, but today you can take this to a new level. Presenting a happy face to cover your concerns isn't your usual style, but it may be the most effective way to make it through the day. You'll have your chance to clear the air soon enough, but for now there's no need to rush the moment."
sagittarius,2010-03-30,"Looking to the future is easier for you if you have plans for something exciting to do. Now, however, there might not be one particular thing on the horizon that rattles your cage. Nevertheless, this is not real cause for concern. Instead, it's a reminder that you must create your own adventures in your mind before you can live them. Don't be afraid to dream of your great escape, for it's the first step in making it a reality."
capricorn,2010-03-30,"Playing it cool at work today may not convey your true attitude. You want others to see you as confident and capable, rather than as harried and under pressure. But instead, they could misunderstand your laid-back approach and might think that you don't care enough to engage directly. Remember, you can be involved without necessarily having to be overly emotional about it."
aquarius,2010-03-30,"A close friend or family member might say something today that strikes you as rather odd. Even if you want to let it go, you could keep coming back to this moment until you finally figure out what's bothering you about it. Remember, you don't need to wait until an issue becomes a problem before you handle it. It's certainly better to express the energy, instead of trying to force everyone into the same place."
pisces,2010-03-30,"It's challenging to understand other people's motives today, for they're presenting only one side in their regular communication with you. But beneath the surface lurks an abundance of mystery and complexity. You are not interested in psychological dramas and mysterious meanderings now. Instead of unwrapping layers of the onion to find the center, work with what you already know."
aries,2010-03-31,"Everything becomes a bit more complex today because you cannot escape your feelings just by doing something else. Your emotions are more persistent now and they can gnaw at your awareness until you acknowledge them and consider the issues that they raise. Although you may be irritated because you want to be independent of your attachments, slowing down and sinking into your current experience can teach you more than running off in search of the next one."
taurus,2010-03-31,"Your relationship houses are in the spotlight as Venus returns to your sign today. Simplicity and security becomes more important now as you look ahead to the next few weeks. Nevertheless, you still might be dissatisfied with what you have, unless it touches you on a soul level. Although your attraction to physical pleasure is strong, don't underestimate your current need for meaning."
gemini,2010-03-31,"You may be making plans for your escape, but that doesn't mean you'll actually go anywhere. It's just that relationship dynamics are growing more complicated by the day, and there's not much you can do about it. The real world can demand your physical presence, but not your attention. Turning up the volume on your fantasies allows you to relieve some of your discomfort without even telling anyone that you have temporarily checked out."
cancer,2010-03-31,"You are reminded today that you feel better when you are in touch with your emotions, even if something isn't quite right. You would rather be aware of what's going on than be left in the dark. But just because your sensitivity is more acute than usual doesn't mean that you are willing to expose your vulnerability now. Don't let anyone coerce you into revealing your inner secrets before you are ready."
leo,2010-03-31,"Others may be pressuring you to lighten up and enjoy yourself, but you have been resisting their well-meant intentions. Now, however, with four planets in fixed signs, it's even more challenging to change your previous strategy. You may feel stuck in a position that you recently defended, but you really didn't mean for it to last long. Fortunately, your ability to imagine new possibilities is strong today. Remember, what happens in the future begins as a dream."
virgo,2010-03-31,"You have mixed feelings about how deep to take a conversation today. Although you have a strong need to be real, you don't want things to get too intense now or a simple interaction could morph into something more, distracting you from your goals. Be as precise as possible when telling others what works for you, because your fuzzy message could lead them to misunderstand you. It may be awkward to set boundaries, but it will be better for everyone if you do."
libra,2010-03-31,"Your emotional needs seem to conflict with logic now, yet they are too convincing to ignore. Still, you might not want to tell anyone what you want because you're not sure what you would do if your dreams came true. It may be easier to live under the illusion that satisfaction is unattainable than to actually face the realization that it's within reach. Don't allow your self-doubt to get in the way."
scorpio,2010-03-31,"You know that you cannot express everything you feel today, because it's not appropriate to let everyone see past your boundaries. This can be the source of frustration, for you tend to subscribe to the all-or-nothing school of interactions, where anything less than the whole truth is a lie. There's an important lesson in this for you now, so try to understand the value in consciously limiting what you share in order to increase the impact of what you say."
sagittarius,2010-03-31,"You may not like it when you feel limited by your previous commitments, but you are true to your word and are willing to turn down an invitation today so you can complete your work. Nevertheless, you still might be annoyed at someone else's inflexibility that prevents you from being able to enjoy yourself. Don't let your frustration get in the way of your productivity. If you stay focused you could finish early enough to have time to play later on."
capricorn,2010-03-31,"Your key planet Saturn is tempted by delectable Venus as she glides into your 5th House of Romance today. But fun and games may have to wait a few days because stern Saturn is making more important demands on your time. It's all about setting priorities now. Just remember that you can go anywhere you want in the privacy of your fantasies, but you'll need to practice patience before you can try to make your dreams a reality."
aquarius,2010-03-31,"You may not be able to open your heart as wide as you wish today because of someone who exerts authority over you. Although no one can truly extinguish your gypsy spirit, you aren't happy about the limitations currently being placed around you. You don't like feeling caged and the wild animal in you longs for independence that now feels elusive. But don't give up hope; remember, no one gets to control your feelings. Freedom may be closer than you realize."
pisces,2010-03-31,"Messenger Mercury is harmonizing with your dreamy planet Neptune today, broadening the horizons of your fantasies. But you might quickly realize that you're not free to explore as far as you can see, especially when other people's feelings are so linked to yours. There is a high level of emotional interdependency now, so resign yourself to keeping some of your dreams private. There may be time to share them in a few days, but patience is your smartest strategy at this time."
aries,2010-04-01,"Although nothing seems easy today, you are able to draw energy from a deep well of confidence. You might not even know where you are getting your self-assuredness from, but you don't have the time to get lost in endless analysis. It doesn't matter whether or not you have a long-term plan; just aim high and do the best you can. It's more important to be doing something productive than thinking about what you could do in the future."
taurus,2010-04-01,"You might believe that your co-workers will give you a hard time, but when the going gets tough today, they come to your rescue. Still, you'll need to be open to receiving what others have to offer now, or you'll miss your chance to be helped through a rough spot. Don't let pride come between you and the support that's around you. This is not about showing your superiority; it's about being successful."
gemini,2010-04-01,"No matter how determined you are to accomplish your goals today, you're still likely to be overwhelmed by what you have to do. Instead of focusing on how you feel about your progress, take your cues from those around you. Luckily, they will see you putting your best foot forward now, making them more confident that you can get the job done."
cancer,2010-04-01,"Your attention is on getting ahead at work now, but you're a bit distracted by strong feelings that enter your awareness today whether they are convenient or not. But avoiding them is not a viable option, for they will only grow stronger if you choose the path of denial. Instead of fighting against the inevitable, surrender to it. When you do, your fear will transform into trust as more productive courses of action become apparent."
leo,2010-04-01,"You might not have an obvious reason to be so sure of yourself today, but it seems as if you are being guided by invisible helpers. Don't waste energy questioning whether or not this is real or even possible. It's fine if you simply trust your intuition now, even if you are challenged by the notion of metaphysical assistance. However you need to frame your current experience, don't be afraid to act on a hunch if it's for the good of everyone involved."
virgo,2010-04-01,"You may not be willing to trust what you already know today. You might prefer additional training or hearing other people's points of view, but having more data isn't the answer now. This is about letting your passion guide you, not about finding logical justifications for something you want to do. For now, it's about listening to your emotional heart over your logical head."
libra,2010-04-01,"Bringing your vision onto the job today can act as a profound catalyst for the entire workplace. But just reciting facts and figures won't have a whole lot of impact. Your workmates are fed up with people who say yes, but actually mean maybe. Don't just make empty promises now; you'll only alienate others if you do. Follow through on your promises with hard work and a positive attitude."
scorpio,2010-04-01,"Your high level of intensity can take someone's breath away, but you really don't want to make anything more difficult than it has to be today. Nevertheless, you still may impose your will on others because you are feeling everything so strongly now and it's challenging to see things from a different perspective. Keep in mind that you have the power to lift the overall mood by simply making a decision to see the good in everything."
sagittarius,2010-04-01,"You want everyone to see you in the best possible light today, for you realize that your current brilliance could pave the way for others to follow more easily. Luckily, you are able to keep far enough ahead of everyone else that it seems like you are a natural born leader now. Remember, you don't have to do anything differently than in the past. Just be willing to act on your feelings with integrity."
capricorn,2010-04-01,"You may still be attempting to do the right thing, but the wisest course of action is becoming more muddled with interference from other people's ideas. Most of all, your friends who want to help out in any way possible might withdraw when they realize there's just not much for them to do. Wait for the heavy energy to pass over the next couple of days before making your move."
aquarius,2010-04-01,"Today you can take charge quite easily, for you intuitively know what must happen next. Unfortunately, everyone else might not be so eager to give up power to you. Be careful; don't take on an authority figure just to demonstrate how serious you can be. It's better to avoid direct confrontation now, but make sure you're smiling if you are caught in the spotlight."
pisces,2010-04-01,"You are ready for something special to happen, but there won't likely be any miracles today. Nevertheless, some serious healing magic can unfold if you don't attempt to force anything. Stand back and give others a chance to breathe deeply. And remember, this is not a time to push your will on anyone else. Swim like a fish and take the course of least resistance."
aries,2010-04-02,"You may be a bit uncertain as to what to do next, for although you can see unrealized potential wherever you look, there isn't enough time in the day to pursue every opportunity. Therefore, setting priorities is a crucial component to your happiness. Luckily, the idea of slowing down sounds good to you now, making it easier to cut back on your involvement in activities that could prevent you from finishing what you start."
taurus,2010-04-02,"You may be feeling more self-assured, but you still aren't so eager to jump into something new today. It's not that you are fearful about the unknown; it's just that your confidence is strengthened now if you take your time and proceed slowly. You don't have to stress out because of anyone else's arbitrary schedule. Set a pace that works for you and then stick to it."
gemini,2010-04-02,"Others seem to have unrealistic expectations about what you should accomplish today, and you don't want to contradict them. But you also don't want to make yourself crazy by working extra hard when you know that you cannot meet an impossible deadline. Even if it's uncomfortable addressing the issue up front, everyone will feel better if you do. Don't turn it into a major drama; simply announce your good intentions and clearly say what you believe you will be able to finish prior to the weekend."
cancer,2010-04-02,"You usually know your limitations, but may get so caught up in your enthusiasm today that you commit to more than you can deliver. Unfortunately, your good intentions aren't enough to carry you through the day, especially if you are delayed by bothersome obstacles that must be overcome in order for you to move on. Don't worry about completing your tasks on time; it's better to strive for perfection now than to sacrifice quality by rushing your work."
leo,2010-04-02,"On the surface you're looking good, but you still aren't as confident as you would like to be. Others see your unwavering commitment today and believe that you are more solid than you actually feel. Nevertheless, don't go out of your way to talk about your uncertainty; there's no reason for you to show this kind of vulnerability now, as it will only lessen your chances for success."
virgo,2010-04-02,"You may have a good idea of where you want to go now, but can't find a clear way to get there. All of the roads in front of you appear to be more circuitous than you prefer, but there doesn't seem to be a better route. Fortunately, whatever path you pick will probably straighten out tomorrow, so head off in the most sensible direction without worrying if you've made the best choice. There is more than one way to reach your destination."
libra,2010-04-02,"Your reality could become infused with your illusions today, making it hard to tell which is which. But ultimately it may not matter because your dreams have the potential to become real. Placing too much trust on the analytical data can create artificial limits that prevent you from realizing your fullest potential. A bit of magical thinking now can take you farther than you think."
scorpio,2010-04-02,"Your emotions should settle down today, enabling you to concentrate on your back load of work. But this doesn't mean that production will be easy. You'll need to work extra hard for whatever you accomplish now. Setting your goals unrealistically high can inspire you to greater heights, as long as you don't get discouraged and give up too soon."
sagittarius,2010-04-02,"The Moon's return to your sign can be quite revitalizing today because she harmonizes with fiery Mars and the Sun. As long as you keep moving, you'll be fine. Don't think about what you are doing; just continue to do it. Logic is usually an essential tool for making a decision. Unfortunately, now it will only muddle your path with confusion. For the present moment, actions really do speak louder than words."
capricorn,2010-04-02,"You can quickly see the benefit of taking charge by initiating ambitious action. Your organizational skills could come to the rescue, enabling you to get a lot done. But you are of two minds today; you also understand the risk of doing too much too soon. Nothing positive will come from building a house on an unstable foundation, so take your time and make sure you do it right."
aquarius,2010-04-02,"It's particularly easy to get the encouragement you need from your friends or associates. But you must maintain a healthy perspective on what's possible today or you could quickly burn yourself out. Although positive feedback from those around you feels good and is a strong motivational factor, it can also fill you with so much confidence that you accept an opportunity before considering the potential problems. Hesitating is wise now; if it's a great idea, it will still be great tomorrow."
pisces,2010-04-02,"Your compassion can actually get in the way of your productivity today because the Moon in your public 10th House encourages you to nurture everybody. But, of course, this is an impossible task. Still, you might wear yourself out trying to help more people than you can. Keep in mind that creating healthy boundaries is a crucial step in your ability to positively impact those who need you the most."
aries,2010-04-03,"It is finally clear that you know what you want, but alluring Venus squares your key planet Mars today, making it difficult for you to achieve satisfaction. The problem is compounded if you set your goals so high that there's little chance of reaching them. Fortunately, you can remove the stigma of failure by staying so focused on the present moment that anticipation of future success becomes relatively unimportant."
taurus,2010-04-03,"You may be more aggressive than usual in your pursuit of happiness, since action-packed Mars squares tempting Venus in your sensual sign. But although you may reach beyond your normal limits today, satisfaction remains elusive. You could inadvertently add to your frustration now if you believe there's only one path that leads to pleasure. However, it's still possible to find joy in your life if you can be flexible enough to adapt to the changing circumstances."
gemini,2010-04-03,"It may not be the best day to start a new relationship because your common sense isn't working as well as your desire for physical pleasure. But if you can recognize the intensity of your needs, you don't necessarily have to fall victim to them. Conscious self-restraint can be part of a spiritual practice or just a simple survival technique. Either way, you might not get exactly what you want now. Patience isn't easy, but it will pay off."
cancer,2010-04-03,"You don't like being so transparent to others, but there doesn't seem to be an easy method of keeping yourself out of view. Even if you decide to just go about your chores in a quiet manner, you'll probably still draw more attention than you want. But even if you are easily annoyed with a friend or a lover, keep in mind that you don't have to share anything you prefer to keep to yourself for a while longer."
leo,2010-04-03,"Mars has been building momentum in your sign for several weeks and today's square with sweet Venus is a turning point. Your patience has worn thin if someone is standing between you and your happiness, yet aggressive behavior won't likely bring you the satisfaction you seek. Don't be overly demanding or you'll make matters worse. But don't give up; your most successful strategy requires that you remain determined and hold on to your goals."
virgo,2010-04-03,"Today you need to stay alert to possibilities you have not yet considered. Even if you already made a list of those things you want to do, it may be better to throw it away because sticking to your previous plan can limit you now. But you don't need to make a big deal out of your current spontaneity. Just remain open to what's going on without trying to steer things in a predetermined direction."
libra,2010-04-03,"A simple desire can turn into a major conflict, as feisty Mars angers your key planet Venus today. You might not be ready to go to war in order to get what you want, but a little disagreement can quickly grow out of hand. Paying careful attention to what's happening is essential if you want to prevent a major meltdown. Nothing will be gained by allowing your ego to run amok as you strive for satisfaction."
scorpio,2010-04-03,"Relying on your intuition can help you plant your feet back on the ground today, but chances are you won't be able to do it alone. Fortunately, someone reliable will be there to help you if you are open to the assistance. Unfortunately, your agenda may be different from everyone else's. Don't sacrifice your goals for the sake of peace now, for this kind of conciliatory behavior will only increase your dissatisfaction."
sagittarius,2010-04-03,"Others may see you as overly emotional today, but you are so concerned with reaching a goal that you may not even be aware of your own feelings. It might appear to you that your friends and family are working on your behalf, but you aren't seeing things clearly, either. Take a few deep breaths and step back from the current situation so you can regain a healthy perspective. When you finally understand what's truly happening, you'll know what to do next."
capricorn,2010-04-03,"Hiding your intentions may seem like a smart thing to do, but this strategy will only delay a conflict that continues to grow more intense. Although there could be a bit of an unpleasant scene if you tell the truth, it won't last long and everyone will feel better once the air is cleared and the tension is released."
aquarius,2010-04-03,"Your long-term goals are more important to you now and you would like to share your dreams of the future with your friends. Although you expect their encouragement, you might be surprised that they have different ideas about where your life should be going and they don't hesitate to tell you. Forget about trying to garner their support for now; it's better to use your energy developing your strategy and fine-tuning your trajectory."
pisces,2010-04-03,"You may be playing the role of mother hen today, yet you really don't want the extra responsibility. You would prefer to simplify your life now, yet demands are being made of your time that place the welfare of others in front of your own desires. Even if you know what you want now, it may be smarter to wait for a more opportune moment to push toward new ground."
aries,2010-04-04,"You may be drawn into an emotional drama now, even if you attempt to keep conversations on the lighter side of life. But it can reach a point where your philosophical approach becomes a way for you to deny your own feelings. It's one thing to walk on the sunny side of the street when possible; however, today there are treasures awaiting your discovery if you are willing to step into the shadows."
taurus,2010-04-04,"You really aren't interested in meaningless gossip or idle chatter today, for there are important issues that need clarification and you don't want to waste precious time. You might even be so eager in your quest for meaning now that you unintentionally open a can of worms. A discussion might not go as smoothly as you expect, but digging into a sensitive topic will set the stage for future growth."
gemini,2010-04-04,"You might prefer to keep certain feelings hidden from others today because it will be easier to enjoy the day if you do. Fortunately, your friends and family may initially support your efforts to have fun, but as the day wears on they could grow tired of your evasive maneuvers. Don't put others in the position of having to ask you what's really going on. Take the lead by sharing what's in your heart before you miss the opportunity to strengthen your relationships."
cancer,2010-04-04,"You may be rather fixed now about how you see your future, and are willing to make changes in a relationship in order to bring it into alignment with your goals. Needless to say, this requires the cooperation of someone else. Although others can sound sincere as they acknowledge your needs, their actions might not be as supportive as their words. Don't expect too much or you could easily slip into playing the blame game. Even in the best-case scenario, transformation will take time."
leo,2010-04-04,"There's little question about your high level of integrity, which certainly can garner the respect of those close to you. But others may notice that you aren't fully walking your talk today as they see differences between your honorable intent and the actual execution of your plans. This is not about trying to be perfect. It's simply about being aware of your own actions so you are able to hold yourself to the same high standards you expect from everyone else."
virgo,2010-04-04,"Contrary to what some people might believe, your ability to be practical doesn't make you any less passionate about your goals. Today is one of those days where your desires are so intense that you can become a bit obsessive about what you want. Paradoxically, your realistic approach can reveal ways to put your emotions to good use. Self-motivation gives you an extra boost now, but it's still up to you to act on your feelings."
libra,2010-04-04,"Your key planet Venus isn't very easygoing today, for she is under the spell of ruthless Pluto. There's no stopping you now if you know what you want. But your eyes may be so big that you don't know when to stop. You could easily overstep someone's boundaries without even knowing what you did. Although you could end up being satisfied, you'd be wise to take a few minutes first to consider if the desired outcome is worth the social cost."
scorpio,2010-04-04,"No one will be able to make you change your mind today because you are quite clear about what you want, whether or not it is what's best for you. Seductive Venus aligns with your key planet Pluto, driving your desires deeper than usual. You might be afraid of what could happen if you share your feelings, but holding back the heat of your emotions isn't a good idea either. Don't give up; finding a healthy outlet for your passion is a precious gift worth seeking."
sagittarius,2010-04-04,"You have been riding a big wave of confidence, but today you might realize that you overextended your reach. If you are paying attention, you should be able to quickly reestablish your emotional balance by pulling your energy back to your center. But a temporary retreat now isn't about giving up. Once you regain stability, don't be afraid to express what's in your heart with your newly found clarity."
capricorn,2010-04-04,"You may bite off more than you can chew today and as the day progresses you gradually realize that you won't be able to do it all. Naturally, it's smarter to eliminate extraneous activities before you tire yourself out because you'll want to have some energy in reserve. A minimal amount of self-discipline during the day will assure your ability to pursue pleasure and relax later in the evening."
aquarius,2010-04-04,"You may grow increasingly uncomfortable throughout the day as you realize that you won't be able to avoid entering unknown emotional territory. At first, it appears that you'll be able to keep interactions on an intellectual plane, where you feel a greater level of self-confidence. But the simplicity of ideas gives way to the complexity of feelings. Don't worry if you are unsure of yourself; revealing your vulnerability can open the door to a deeper friendship or more intimate love."
pisces,2010-04-04,"You are eager to swim in the nurturing waters of a special relationship today, but your unrealistic hopes can set you up for disappointment. However, this may be a necessary adjustment and once you set your illusions aside, you'll be ready for a more meaningful interaction. But be careful; your mood swings can be exhausting if you fight the changing tides that carry you back and forth. Save your energy for later, when you have more clarity about what you want."
aries,2010-04-05,"Your life has taken a serious turn, and a sensible approach to your current responsibilities will help you make the most of this phase. Don't try to avoid the intensity now because it narrows your focus. Fortunately, the more you are able to concentrate your attention, the more effective you can be in overcoming your own resistance to change."
taurus,2010-04-05,"You are a force to be reckoned with today, for you can accomplish nearly anything you put your mind to. But making a choice can be a bit overwhelming now because you realize the importance of your current decision. It will be easier if you remember that the most practical course of action is the most intelligent one. It's not time to take a foolish risk, so be cautious as you make plans for the future."
gemini,2010-04-05,"You may seem contentious to those around you today, but you really aren't looking to create more conflict. It's just that you might not take the time to think about the impact of what you say. You know that you are telling the truth, so you don't stop to consider that you could be stirring up a hornet's nest. Remember, everyone doesn't need to know everything that you do. A little compassionate discretion now will go a long way."
cancer,2010-04-05,"You may be impressed by a co-worker's level of commitment today, even if you have your own plan that's different from everyone else's. But as you enter into a debate with those who oppose your ideas, your frustration can outweigh any admiration you might have had. You would be smart to keep an open mind as you discuss the merits of the various strategies before you, but this doesn't mean you should consider negotiating away your core values."
leo,2010-04-05,"Don't be surprised if you draw someone's ire because you are not the easiest person to get along with today. You might even get into an open conflict with your boss, which can create additional problems. Although an argument can be quite stressful, others will respect you for standing up for your beliefs as long as you don't take it too far. Pay attention so you'll know when to acquiesce, if necessary."
virgo,2010-04-05,"Sometimes it's impossible for you to make sense of all the details. Today, however, you are the one who seems to be able to put enough of the small pieces of a puzzle together so you can see the big picture. Others may depend on your holistic thinking now, so don't hold back. Trust your intuition but don't lose sight of your common sense."
libra,2010-04-05,"You could make others uncomfortable today because you want to talk about a subject that everyone else tries to avoid. But you can see things now that are beneath the surface and you're not willing to pretend that you know less than you do. Remember, if you're going to be the one who raises issues, at least do it with kindness and without blaming anyone."
scorpio,2010-04-05,"Your close friends might try to avoid you for a while today, because they can tell that you have something on your mind that they don't want to hear. Your raw intensity is strengthened by the Moon's conjunction with potent Pluto. Just remember that your searing words can burn if you let them pass your lips uncensored."
sagittarius,2010-04-05,"You may be so passionate about your values today that you momentarily forget about the basic facts. But others won't let you get away with sloppy thinking now and they will confront you with the truth. Instead of becoming overly defensive and taking a stand that is based on moral righteousness, make every attempt to listen to what's being said. This isn't about you -- or anyone else -- being right or wrong; it's about maintaining your right to think for yourself."
capricorn,2010-04-05,"You are provoked to express your passionate perspective every chance you get as the Moon joins ruthless Pluto in your 1st House of Personality today. You could go out of your way to make sure that someone knows exactly where you stand on a controversial social issue. But a volcano derives its strength from the intense heat that it holds beneath the surface. Likewise, you have a chance to increase your power by choosing what to say on your own terms. Carefully controlling your message gives you the career endurance that you desire."
aquarius,2010-04-05,"A close friend or partner may stir up trouble today by accusing you of something you didn't do. You may feel personally attacked or even betrayed by someone you once trusted. But it's too late now to return to the way things were. Even if your feelings are hurt, think twice before fighting back because your unrestrained anger could escalate a minor problem into a more serious conflict."
pisces,2010-04-05,"You might not have the ability to accomplish your ambitious goals on your own, but you have access to all the tools you need once you recognize that the power now is within your network of friends and associates. There is no one single person that's the center of authority and, as soon as you attempt to consolidate control, you lose it. Keep in mind that cooperation is much more effective than any attempts at domination. Your success is assured when you realize that you are part of a greater whole."
aries,2010-04-06,"You can say what's on your mind today but you'll need to pick your topics of discussion carefully because your words might stir up controversy. You won't be satisfied following the party line now, yet you still appear to have ideas that are intelligent and sensible. Others will listen to you, even if they don't agree with what you are saying."
taurus,2010-04-06,"You have been running at a very heightened level of intensity, and interactive Mercury reminds you that you need some downtime today. Although the pace has begun to wear on your nerves, you are able to rejuvenate your energy now by keeping your feelings to yourself. There's no need to tell all your secrets; you'll gain power from being focused enough that you don't give away too much."
gemini,2010-04-06,"Although you may be accused of being too shallow sometimes, no such possibility exists today. You are the one who is pushing for more meaning now and you want others to follow your lead. But even if they can see what brings you closer to your truth, it could lure them farther away from theirs. Don't expect anyone to follow your thinking; just make certain that it's valid for you before you head out on your own."
cancer,2010-04-06,"You don't want to make a decision today, and yet you know what your choice would be if you were forced to let others know. It's your prerogative how much to reveal and when to reveal it. Don't let anyone coerce you into talking before you are fully ready, because you could end up developing resentment toward anyone who tries to control you."
leo,2010-04-06,"You aren't as easygoing as you appear today, but others won't realize that unless they overstep their bounds and try to get you to say something you don't actually believe. Fortunately, your endorsement isn't up for grabs to the highest bidder. In fact, you might not feel overly driven right now; you just want to continue doing your job without making any further promises about the future."
virgo,2010-04-06,"You are being lured into a place of enlightenment now by your key planet Mercury, where you can see previously hidden areas of your consciousness. As new ideas come into awareness, you want to do something about them, yet it still may be wiser for you to simply observe while waiting to act on your plans at a later time. Keep in mind that your decision to remain silent adds to your current air of mystery."
libra,2010-04-06,"Although you seem to be quite passionate about many topics of discussion today, you might not be as interested in sharing your feelings as you appear. It's not that you are detached from what you are saying; it's just that this is more of an intellectual exercise now than something of integral importance to you. But you still could get caught up in wanting to be right. Keep in mind that backing down from an indefensible position is, ultimately, a true sign of wisdom."
scorpio,2010-04-06,"There's a sharp edge to your words today as clever Mercury in your 7th House of Others forms a smooth connection with formidable Pluto. This is a mixed blessing, for your message could inadvertently cut someone before you even realize what you've done. It's one thing to take a swipe at an opponent intentionally; however, it doesn't feel good if you unintentionally hurt a friend."
sagittarius,2010-04-06,"This is a great day to undertake a project at work that requires a serious amount of mental fortitude, because you have the ability now to concentrate until the job is done. Although the potential to have fun is always looming near the horizon, don't let yourself be distracted until you have caught up with your chores. It's more important now to dig in your heels and take care of the business at hand."
capricorn,2010-04-06,"If you feel like you've been on an emotional rollercoaster, it may finally be time to end the ride. But you will need to be creative in your approach when you stand up to those who have made your life more complicated than you prefer. Don't try to blame anyone else for your extreme emotions now; if you do, you'll just go around again and again. Instead, accept responsibility for your part in the recent drama and be ready to move on."
aquarius,2010-04-06,"You may not be prepared for the intensity of your own feelings now. You believed that you had a good understanding of the current situation, only to discover that things are not as you perceived. Fortunately, you are able to think on your feet and are quite capable of regaining your balance. But don't dwell on the past; once things are stable again, let go of any residual negativity you might be holding onto for no reason."
pisces,2010-04-06,"There's a part of you that won't be satisfied until you've turned your support network inside out today. Instead of looking for stability from your friends, you're more interested in having them help you bring some meaning back into your life. But they might not be proactive enough for you now until you do something radical that catches them off balance. Once you get the ball rolling, others will likely follow."
aries,2010-04-07,"You may have enough cool logic to make a plan, but your heated emotions get in the way of what you want to do today. You might think you can just override your desires, yet they just reappear in the form of a projection if you try to suppress them. Pay extra attention if you start an argument with someone now, because this could indicate that you have unexpressed feelings that are working their way to the surface."
taurus,2010-04-07,"You have a job to do and the sooner you get going, the better you'll feel about your accomplishments. But it's not the best time to start a new project. Instead, think about the responsibilities that you have assumed over the past couple of years and how you can tie up loose ends in the next couple of months. Creating a sense of closure is more important now than beginning what comes next."
gemini,2010-04-07,"You would be happier if you didn't have to focus on meeting your obligations, but you have chores that you must take care of today. Although you wish you could do whatever you want, you don't have the luxury of following your heart's desire. It's time to get serious about self-discipline, because what you do now will set the tone for the rest of spring."
cancer,2010-04-07,"Although you tend to be cautious about personal disclosure, you are willing to work with others in order to reach your goals. Meanwhile, your co-workers may be impressed by your warmth today, even if you are feeling more emotionally reserved than they know. Don't go overboard in hiding your vulnerability, for your peers can be more supportive than you expect."
leo,2010-04-07,"A close friend or associate might seem very detached today, putting you in touch with old fears of abandonment. But it's crucial for you to separate your fantasies that are based upon painful memories from what's actually happening. Even if your emotions have been recently agitated, don't take it personally now if current relationship logistics require a bit of a cooling off period."
virgo,2010-04-07,"If you aren't willing to take on a certain level of responsibility today, something may happen that requires you to step up to the plate and do what you should have already done. You can thank taskmaster Saturn for backing into your sign and offering a healing course in self-discipline. Use your common sense and don't wait until it's too late; take action while you still have time to be successful."
libra,2010-04-07,"It may feel as if the pressure has been temporarily removed or lessened as stern Saturn backs out of your sign for a few months. But a serious issue that has been on your agenda isn't really going away. It's just that you have been granted an extension to a deadline, giving you additional time to organize your life for the changes ahead. Don't get lazy and waste this opportunity or you'll be sorry you did when the stress returns."
scorpio,2010-04-07,"You may be feeling the tension between your newfound freedom and previous commitments that have not yet been fulfilled. You could be caught in the middle of a tug-of-war with conflicting situations that are vying for your attention. But it's not an all-or-nothing game; you cannot choose one side over the other. Instead, balance the opposing forces the best you can, knowing that the tension will eventually settle back down."
sagittarius,2010-04-07,"If you have become concerned with getting a handle on your life by making plans for the future, it's now time to get practical and put one single idea into motion. Don't worry about reaching your destination since it could be a long distance from where you are currently standing. For now, just take one tiny piece of the puzzle and fit it into your present life. The larger pieces will fall into place one by one later on."
capricorn,2010-04-07,"You are receiving mixed messages today, for you want to build on what you started over the past few days. But yesterday's project may need to be temporarily set aside as unfinished business from last year cycles back through your life. You won't be able to move ahead with your current goals until you tighten up the loose ends that are becoming frayed. Creating sensible priorities now is more important than anything else."
aquarius,2010-04-07,"You cannot just ignore the wishes of your friends and co-workers, but the Moon's return to your eclectic sign is a reminder that you have to do things your own way. Managing your personal and professional relationships is crucial now, because you won't be able to reach your goals without having a support system in place. The healthiest strategy is to balance your non-conformist tendencies with your need to be a part of a larger group or community."
pisces,2010-04-07,"Interpersonal issues that you thought were already handled are revealed as serious Saturn temporarily returns to your 7th House of Others today. But your past is also your present now, and you have a chance to stabilize a relationship that's gone through changes over the last couple of years. Don't try to resolve all the stress overnight; it took time to build and it will take weeks to untangle."
aries,2010-04-08,"You are being challenged today to find the hidden beauty in everyday life. It's one thing to be moved by a great masterpiece in a museum or be touched by a timeless musical composition. It's quite another thing to see that same level of perfection on a busy street corner or while at work. Nevertheless, there is a higher order of harmony available to you if you are willing to let your imagination take you on a ride."
taurus,2010-04-08,"You have a more refined sense of taste today and an eye for excellence. But physical beauty is just the beginning as it points to the perfection of the spiritual world. You are spellbound by a vision that others cannot see and that might even be elusive to you. Nevertheless, you are not motivated by more mundane goals now, so give yourself permission to surrender to your daydreams."
gemini,2010-04-08,"It is said that one shouldn't judge a book by its cover, yet you often contemplate the inside of a person, a place or a thing from its apparent surface. However, today can teach you a lesson in humility if you think you know what's happening before you delve deeper. Don't worry about being practical now; explore your fantasies in order to reveal the true potential of the moment."
cancer,2010-04-08,"You are working hard to overcome your shyness now, for traveling through life is more difficult when you don't have someone with whom to bounce your ideas around. But getting what you want from others can be complicated if you don't go out of the way to express yourself. Hold tight to the highest ideals, even if the real world falls short of your expectations. Once you see the catalytic nature of what's in your mind, your hesitancy will vanish and the present moment will become a more interesting place."
leo,2010-04-08,"You are easily distracted by your desire for comfort now and will work harder so you can find pleasure in the realm of the senses. But you might still be left with a feeling of emptiness, even if you attain sensual satisfaction. The material world contains its own form of beauty today, but it will ultimately leave you cold, unless you're willing to extend yourself into the ethereal realms of spirituality."
virgo,2010-04-08,"You have a down-to-earth plan that can bring you closer to what you want now. But putting your scheme into practice is more complicated than it looks, especially with elusive Neptune transiting your 6th House of Work. Having a general strategy to reach your goals in some indefinite future may seem important, but it's much more crucial now to choose what makes the most sense in the present moment."
libra,2010-04-08,"Falling in love with an ideal can be magical until you have to deal with more mundane issues. But for now, your key planet Venus is locked in desire with spiritual Neptune, lifting your dreams out of this world and into the next. Be careful, for disappointment can catch you off guard when reality falls short of the aesthetic perfection that only exists in your imagination."
scorpio,2010-04-08,"You are willing to pay the price of disillusionment today because your fantasies are so convincing. It's as if you know what's going to happen, but still cannot stop yourself from falling in love, showing your vulnerability or making a commitment you know you won't be able to keep. Stop analyzing everything and trying to outsmart reality. Just raise your sails and let the winds of fate take you for a ride."
sagittarius,2010-04-08,"You may be truly inspired today but the closer you get to finalizing your plan of attack, the less clear you become about your goals. Needless to say, this can be problematic because you have to know where you are headed if you are going to get there. Instead of allowing yourself to be confused about your current direction in life, give yourself permission to float with the prevailing currents for a few days, until you decide on a concrete destination."
capricorn,2010-04-08,"You prefer to have your feet on stable ground, but now you might need to get used to standing on shifting sands instead. Maintaining balance could take up all your time, for it seems like everything is in a state of flux. Forget about building anything permanent now. Wait and see where the current energy takes you; once things start to settle back down you can think about creating a foundation to anchor your next phase of development."
aquarius,2010-04-08,"You may feel as if your friends and co-workers are turning your current beliefs into a joke now -- and you don't like it at all. You may be more technical in your outlook than others realize, but it's hard to rely on scientific judgments when you can see the amazing results. Don't waste your energy defending your position today; just stay in touch with the magic of the cosmos and your accompanying sense of wonder."
pisces,2010-04-08,"You aren't interested in trying to wrap words around your point of view now, for every time you speak up, you just seem to lead others further away from your truth. This can be rather confusing because you know exactly why you believe what you do. Nevertheless, it's not something you can easily communicate now, so leave the complex explanations for another day."
aries,2010-04-09,"You aren't sure what to make of today's events because you want to give everyone the benefit of the doubt. But it's tough to hold on to your fantasies when they are not supported by your friends and associates. Nevertheless, don't throw the baby out with the bathwater. Suspending judgment today may be more useful in the long run than giving up on your dreams."
taurus,2010-04-09,"It's not easy for you to establish boundaries today because your life seems to be more fluid than usual. You might set a rational limit for yourself, only to see it fade as you approach it. Don't waste too much energy trying to figure out what is the most sensible thing to do. Instead, let your intuition be your guide and save the heavy analysis for another day."
gemini,2010-04-09,"You may believe that your fantasies are growing out of control, but you're able to gain some perspective once you understand that this is just a temporary phase. Don't worry about falling into an abyss of illusion; the way out will be much easier than you think. Instead, luxuriate in the rich symbolism that is now arising from the hidden depths of your mind. You will be returned to your regularly scheduled program soon enough."
cancer,2010-04-09,"You may be temporarily incapable of describing your emotions to anyone else today, yet your disconnection with words allows you to simply experience your feelings without struggling to be understood. It's as if you've received special dispensation and are excused from justifying your current point of view. But don't completely withdraw from those you love; just being in their company will lift your spirits."
leo,2010-04-09,"There are people in your life now who are a total enigma to you. As much as you struggle to understand their behavior, you cannot put your finger on the elusive truth if you just stick to the facts. The information you are receiving is self-contradictory and won't lead you to a resolution. Instead of applying your web of analysis to the data, step outside the limits of language and let your intuition guide you on the next leg of your journey."
virgo,2010-04-09,"Although you have been given directions, you still may not be clear about what you are supposed to do today. Normally, you can be quite exacting about your work style, but now it's a challenge to come up with a plan that will put you on track to your goals. Asking for assistance from others can lead to frustration because no one can tell you what you need to know. It may feel uncomfortable, but your smartest strategy is to jump in and begin, even if you don't know what to do next."
libra,2010-04-09,"Today, your key planet Venus has you dancing to music that you cannot quite hear. There are strains of lovely melodies wafting through your imagination, but they are not quite clear enough for you to discern each note. Nevertheless, you are mentally stimulated to fill in the blanks and make up your own tunes. Don't worry if others can't understand your actions now; although you might be on your own for a while, you'll be able to reconnect soon enough."
scorpio,2010-04-09,"You are easily tempted by an unsolvable puzzle because you are driven to uncover the hidden answer. However, life seems like even more of a mystery today than it usually does, with no solution in sight. Instead of working harder to regain control over that which you don't understand, you may have to let go of your rational attempts to manage a current situation. Once you acknowledge that you're not in charge, your intuition can kick in and reveal your next step."
sagittarius,2010-04-09,"Since you are often capable of seeing the big picture, it's no surprise when your horizons widen to increase your view of the future. But paradoxically, the more you see, the murkier it all becomes. It's as if your lens on reality has become distorted, making it impossible for you to know what's really out there. You cannot rely on your senses now, so close your eyes and trust what appears within your imagination."
capricorn,2010-04-09,"Letting go of control isn't the easiest thing for you to do, but you actually could feel a wave of relief as you stop pretending that you are the master of the universe. Fortunately, your dreams can carry you along for now, even if they are not supported by reality. Don't worry about being practical today. Do what you must to fulfill your obligations to others, but give yourself a little vacation from the larger concerns you deal with every day."
aquarius,2010-04-09,"Just as you were becoming comfortable with letting others know how you feel, your mood shifts and what you previously said is growing less important. Although your friend or partner may be confused by your sudden change in attitude, you are also a bit uncertain as to what you are feeling and what it actually means. Don't try to figure it out; just roll with the waves and see where the currents carry you. When your clarity returns, you'll know what to do next."
pisces,2010-04-09,"If you can use your imagination creatively today, you'll be able to surprise others with your high level of productivity. But if you have to perform repetitive tasks for work that leave no room for originality, your frustration might get the best of you. Nevertheless, you should be able to handle your responsibilities by remembering that the weekend is near and that you will have time for more meaningful pursuits then."
aries,2010-04-10,"You might feel as if you are in over your head today and cannot figure out how to shift into reverse. Backing up seems impossible yet going forward is surely not a good idea. Fortunately, you may be able to turn things around, but it will take some creative thinking on your part. Bending the rules in your favor may not be enough; you might have to change direction and start over."
taurus,2010-04-10,"You don't like it when someone tries to get you to do something that's not in your best interest. You may feel as if you are being emotionally blackmailed today and you don't want to deal with the situation. You would rather kick back and enjoy yourself, rather than engaging in a family member's drama. Nevertheless, you can be quite effective in establishing limits around your involvement once you are pushed too far. Being clear in your resistance will make life easier later on in the day."
gemini,2010-04-10,"Your friends and family may grow frustrated with you today because you don't appear to be worrying about the same things that are bothering them. As far as you can tell, a current situation may pose temporary difficulties but will iron itself out without your intervention. You are willing to wait and see what happens, even if others are not. Visualizing your future in a positive light can be a powerful tool, but you'll have a better chance of success if you get more involved now."
cancer,2010-04-10,"You can feel the stress around you and you want to do something to make it go away. However, it may be apparent that others don't want you meddling in their affairs at this time. It's challenging for you to withdraw because you believe that your nurturing love can help. Don't take it personally and project your feelings of rejection on to anyone else; just let those around you have the emotional space they need at this time."
leo,2010-04-10,"You aren't willing to let anyone else take control of your daily schedule, even if you have let your calendar grow out of control. You may even resent the idea that someone wants to intervene on your behalf, for no one really knows your priorities. Instead of struggling with resistance now, try going with the prevailing currents for a while. You can always take back the reins when you are ready for the challenge."
virgo,2010-04-10,"Your key planet Mercury usually helps you to think clearly, but its connection with nebulous Neptune today can space you out. Even if you begin to get a healthy perspective, the Moon's visit to your 7th House of Companions indicates that someone could distract you. The problem is not your lack of focus; it's your tendency to judge yourself as less than adequate. Be careful about transforming self-directed anger into resentment of others, for the blame game is an unproductive detour."
libra,2010-04-10,"You may be ready to give up because you realize that your current tactics aren't working and you cannot control the actions of your friends by coercion. Unfortunately, they aren't falling into line and doing as you wish, but they may just be resisting your pressure. Instead of pushing harder to get your way, step back and give others room to breathe and make decisions on their own. Paradoxically, a retreat will actually improve your chances of getting what you want."
scorpio,2010-04-10,"Your two ruling planets, Mars and Pluto, are currently engaged in a winner-takes-all struggle, but it's actually a stalemate because there won't be a winner if anyone loses now. This will be a problem as long as you are in a competitive frame of mind. But you have the power to shift the paradigm from conflict to cooperation. By changing the rules of the game, everyone can come out ahead."
sagittarius,2010-04-10,"You may have big ideas about what you want to do later this year, but there seems to be so many potential obstacles now that you are tempted to give up before you even start planning your journey. If you are considering an educational opportunity, delay making your final decision until your current negativity passes. There's no reason to force the issue right away."
capricorn,2010-04-10,"It's challenging for you to get organized this weekend and your lack of progress on a project could make you quite grumpy. But don't take your frustration out on others or it will only compound your current problems. It's time for you to work smarter, not harder, or you'll exhaust yourself trying to finish what you started."
aquarius,2010-04-10,"Your friends and family may get on your nerves today as they become overly assertive. You may not realize it, but you are playing an important role in other people's dramas now. Unfortunately the more you resist, the more aggressive they become. However, you don't want to give in to unreasonable demands. Announcing your intention to remain non-committal until after the weekend could be enough to remove the immediate pressure and give you time to decide your next move."
pisces,2010-04-10,Your moodiness today can be more annoying to others than you realize. You might not understand why someone is acting standoffish toward you until you become aware that your current pickiness might be perceived as negativity. But your true motives will shine through if you can let go of your fear of failure. A temporary lack of focus won't jeopardize your big plans for the future.
aries,2010-04-11,"Your inner world is much more interesting now than the mundane events in your everyday life. Although you might be tempted to share your current desires with others, it may be wiser to keep them to yourself. Remember, some things are better left unexpressed; today, you might enjoy the fantasy more than the actual experience."
taurus,2010-04-11,"You know what you should do today, but you may be bored with the idea of meeting your obligations. It's even harder to stay on track if you are tempted by friends that are doing something exciting. You can play the possibilities through your mind with a variety of scenarios, but you still might not be able to make one work well enough to justify dropping your previous commitments. Don't stress about what you may miss; you'll get another opportunity for having fun soon enough."
gemini,2010-04-11,"You could lose your patience today and do something rash that surprises your friends and family. They might think that you are acting irresponsibly, but you see things quite differently. You've given a great deal of thought to your current options and may be willing to risk security for the chance to do something new and exciting. Ultimately, you believe that others will admire you now if you show originality in your approach to life."
cancer,2010-04-11,"You are able to forget your inhibitions for a while as you dream about going on an exciting journey to someplace far away. It really doesn't matter whether or not you actually go anywhere; the freedom that comes from thinking about your escape makes it all worthwhile. But as bold as you can be in your imagination, don't fight against the practical considerations that bring you back to your current responsibilities."
leo,2010-04-11,"You are in touch with your feelings, but may be frustrated because you cannot put them into words today. Your passion runs deep and your emotional reactions can be so extreme now that it can be wiser to keep them to yourself rather than burdening others with your drama. Although this is not a permanent solution to the situation, it will be easier to express yourself tomorrow."
virgo,2010-04-11,"You are probably more upbeat about your personal and business relationships today because you see how they support your goals. Still, you're aware that you aren't free to say what's on your mind, for you could upset the status quo if you do. Even if you are tempted to ask for what you want, it may be better to wait until midweek. Patience is your best strategy for now."
libra,2010-04-11,"Although you have high expectations, it's easy to bite off more than you can chew today because you'll probably underestimate the amount of time it takes to complete each individual task. Your list of chores may seem realistic to you, but others won't be surprised if you fall short of your promises. Don't be too hard on yourself; you can always finish your work over the next few days."
scorpio,2010-04-11,"You aren't happy with the current restraints on your self-expression. You have a lot to say today, but don't have the appropriate channel. Nevertheless, it's crucial to maintain a positive attitude, for discouragement won't help you get what you want. An alchemical transformation that turns a difficult situation into the magic of pure light is possible if you respect the limitations now being placed upon you."
sagittarius,2010-04-11,"The power of positive thinking could backfire on you today if you aren't willing to look at the possible pitfalls to your plan. You could get yourself into trouble because you might not take the time to consider any negative consequences of your current actions. There's no reason to expect the worst, but there's also danger in assuming only the best. Temper your optimism with a healthy dose of realism."
capricorn,2010-04-11,"If you let your friends talk you into breaking a rule today, you'll quickly wish you had been more cautious in your approach. Shortcuts might work for others, but you'll be more successful now by taking the tried and true path to your destination. Don't sell yourself short; you can cover more distance than anyone expects as long as you conserve your energy along the way."
aquarius,2010-04-11,"An overly optimistic attitude about your finances today can lead you to spend more money than you should. In particular, you would be wise to avoid an impulse purchase of something you really like, but could do without. Don't squander your money on anything that's non-essential now. A more practical approach to your cash flow may be less fun, but it will serve you better in the long run."
pisces,2010-04-11,"You could have stars in your eyes today, tempting you to reach beyond your normal limits. On one hand, this can lead to something wonderful as you take an opportunity you might otherwise pass by. But on the other hand, you could upset the security that you've worked to achieve by gambling your future on a risky venture. There's no simple answer to the choice you must make, so consider all options carefully before saying yes."
aries,2010-04-12,"You may be overly eager to get started on a new project today, but one thing after another reminds you not to be in such a rush. Nevertheless, you may not be willing to take no for an answer as you push harder against the resistance. Although being more forceful won't likely overcome the obstacles you now face, gentle patience can be the key to your success."
taurus,2010-04-12,"Accomplishing your goals seems more difficult than you thought it would be, but this is no time to give up. Although you may be frustrated by circumstances, your ideas are innovative and potentially valuable. Recognize the current setbacks as opportunities to strengthen your plans. It may take longer to reach your destination than you expect, but it will be well worth the extra effort."
gemini,2010-04-12,"You may wonder why you're spending extra time looking into the future when there's so much going on in the present moment. The truth is that planning for what's around the next bend in the road is nearly impossible now, for you cannot know where the current changes will take you. Temporarily letting go of your desire to be distracted by all the possibilities can help you get through a major transition."
cancer,2010-04-12,"Today you may be expected to nurture the very same people who normally take care of you. It could bother you if you're not being appreciated for what you do now, but you still need to deliver the goods. Even if you prefer the idea of withdrawing so others notice your absence, this kind of passive resistance will surely backfire on you. It's easier in the long run to just show up and tell the truth."
leo,2010-04-12,"You can see many good reasons for throwing caution to the wind and going ahead with your original plans. But it's confusing because there are also significant indications that you're on the wrong path. Although you could run into some stiff opposition to your ideas, it's much smarter to slow down your forward movement rather than stopping progress altogether. You have nothing to prove by getting anywhere in a hurry."
virgo,2010-04-12,Listen to your inner voice of common sense instead of taking your cues from friends or trusted professionals. Others may not see things the way you do and their well-intended advice will probably just lead you astray. Be willing to sacrifice your feelings of belonging to a greater cause because social action may be less important to you now. Concentrating on yourself for a while can be the catalyst needed to get you back on track.
libra,2010-04-12,"You are known for your skill of managing others in a difficult situation. Now, however, it's not easy to get the group settled down, especially if no one appears to be listening. You may be struggling with your current role as a negotiator because you don't have the patience to figure out everyone's different motives. Still, it's not that hard to be kind, even if you can't think about each person's possible reaction to what you might do."
scorpio,2010-04-12,"You are normally quite capable of thinking strategically, but today you may have reached the end of your rope and are very close to throwing out your previous plans. But impulsive actions won't benefit you or anyone else in the long run. They will only place you face to face with unnecessary resistance that will likely dissipate on its own if you don't push too hard at this time."
sagittarius,2010-04-12,"An odd mixture of positive intentions and negative encounters could make for a rather confusing day. You cannot decide if you should take the resistance at work as a sign that you need to change your direction. Or, perhaps someone's aloofness has you concerned about whether or not you did something wrong. Don't let fear sow the seeds of doubt and overcome your current potential."
capricorn,2010-04-12,"Although you know that a cautious approach to your goals usually works in your favor, today you are fighting back a high-level anxiety that is fueled by your anticipation. You are ready to let others know exactly how you feel, but you don't think that they are going to like what they hear from you. Trust your inner voice; intuition will lead you in the right direction. It may be smarter to wait before you speak, for you won't be able to take back what you say."
aquarius,2010-04-12,"You are independent in your thinking and are inclined to express yourself spontaneously today. Although your words can stir up an unexpected emotional reaction, it's still smarter to avoid getting pulled into a drama that's really not your business. Instead of allowing your feelings to guide your response now, tough analysis and sound logic should keep you on track."
pisces,2010-04-12,"You have a high level of self-esteem, but unfortunately you may not be able to rely on it when you need it later today. What makes it even more difficult is the fact that you cannot save a positive attitude like you would a computer file, to open up at a later time. But don't let the changing circumstances throw you for a loop. Wait it out; your optimism will return in a few days."
aries,2010-04-13,"You may be blindly pushing forward today because you mistakenly believe that your continued progress is more important than anything else. But someone's feelings can catch you off guard now if you don't take the time to consider the consequences of your current ambition. Although you might want to believe that your actions only concern you, there are many people affected by your choices."
taurus,2010-04-13,"You may be somewhat obsessive about finishing up old business today. However, your motives aren't as obvious to everyone else now, so it might be a good idea to take a bit of time to share what you've been hiding. The current cycle is coming to an end, and it's better for you if others know about the pressure you are feeling. Talking about your stress won't eliminate it, but it could make your life a lot more manageable."
gemini,2010-04-13,"You may be annoyed if you want to do something special with your friends yet they go ahead and make different plans without you. At first, you could feel hurt or rejected, but then you realize your newly found freedom is exactly what you need. You can always reconnect socially later in the week."
cancer,2010-04-13,"You may have a very clever plan now to get ahead at work. Unfortunately, you aren't overly motivated and might not try hard enough to make the progress you want. But the choice is yours; if you give up and take it easy today, you'll have no one to blame but yourself. However, if you decide to go for it, at least have the common sense to back off for a bit if you are receiving resistance from your co-workers."
leo,2010-04-13,"Just because things are making sense to you at work now, don't assume that you have everything in proper order. In fact, it's helpful if you recognize that you are probably missing an important piece of information. Keep in mind that your impulsive actions can throw others off guard if they believe that you have all the answers. Be smart and take the slow route instead of thinking that faster is better."
virgo,2010-04-13,"If you have been considering entering into a partnership with a friend or relative, read all the fine print in your agreement before signing anything today. Mercury the messenger planet is messing with you by holding up rose-colored glasses through which you see the world. There are important things happening now, so take your time to consider all the possibilities before settling on just one."
libra,2010-04-13,"You might act disinterested in what others are doing today, but that's not really the case. In fact, the opposite may be true. You feel so wrapped up in what your acquaintances think of you that you withdraw in an attempt to remove excess pressure before it evens builds. Fortunately, with a little awareness, you are capable of taking the middle path by honoring your needs as well as everyone else's."
scorpio,2010-04-13,"You may be quite concerned about your diet today, especially if you are being hampered by any physical symptoms or ailments. Remember it's better to eat smarter than to chow down so much that you cannot assimilate what you ingest. You still need your nourishment, but quantity is not a substitute for quality. Be aware that proper nutrition fuels you with the energy you need."
sagittarius,2010-04-13,"Your workmates might misread your intentions today because they don't understand your overall philosophy. Unfortunately, you may contribute to the murky situation if you don't take enough time to explain yourself before you head off in a new direction. Make sure to let others know that you're not really abandoning them; you just need a little time to pursue some current interests on your own."
capricorn,2010-04-13,"You may try to hold your temper, but something could happen at home today that pushes you over the edge. Although it's not healthy to bury your feelings by slipping into denial, an emotional outbreak now isn't of much use either. Seek a creative outlet for your passions instead of taking your frustration out on someone who doesn't deserve it."
aquarius,2010-04-13,"You may want to reinvent your day by turning your schedule upside down. You might even become giddy just thinking about the various ways you could shake things up today. Unfortunately, change isn't of much use now unless it serves a specific purpose. Save your radical attitude for another day when your catalytic behavior is exactly what's needed."
pisces,2010-04-13,"You have some tricky territory to cover because you aren't likely to say exactly what you mean today. It's not that you purposefully want to mislead anyone; it's just that you don't think about the language you are using and the effect it might have on others. Remember, the more words you use now, the less others will understand your message. Avoid complexity by letting your actions speak for you instead."
aries,2010-04-14,"Today marks a turning point in your year, as the New Moon falls in your sign. You have been preparing to make an important change in your life. Perhaps you've even had a few false starts in recent months. Now, however, there's no going back. Although it still may take another month to see significant progress, the intention you set now will be sufficient to get the ball rolling in the new direction."
taurus,2010-04-14,"You have more ideas now than you know what to do with as the New Moon plants creative seeds in your 12th House of Imagination. But turning an original thought into an executable plan will require a serious commitment on your part. Fortunately, the Moon's return to your sign later this evening can give you the willpower you need to make your dreams come true."
gemini,2010-04-14,"Your lack of concentration turns a simple project into a complicated array of seemingly unrelated tasks today. But the New Moon in your 11th House of Long-Term Plans can also give you a comprehensive view of the big picture, enabling you to keep coming back to what you must do next. Ultimately, it's up to you. Succumbing to distractions now will make your life more difficult, but repeatedly reminding yourself to stay on track will move you consistently closer to your goals."
cancer,2010-04-14,"You are empowered to plant seeds of intention to further your ambitions as today's enterprising Aries New Moon illuminates your 10th House of Career. You might feel as if anything is possible, but the actual reality can still be far away. Nevertheless, it's easy to dream big now, and you would be shortsighted to hold yourself back. Although you cannot yet see the details ahead, it's better to believe in yourself than to place unnecessary limitations on your thinking."
leo,2010-04-14,"This is an exciting day for you because the fiery Aries New Moon activates your 9th House of Adventure. Even if you have been carrying a heavy load, you're finally beginning to see the fruits of your labors now. You might even be caught up enough to take a bit of time off to do something fun. If you are thinking about a short vacation, make your plans right away. If you don't, the window of opportunity could close before you have the chance to climb through."
virgo,2010-04-14,"You may be a bit overeager to get others involved in a pet project of yours and the impetuous Aries New Moon doesn't give you much cause to slow down and think about what you're doing. Although you normally take sufficient time to attend to details, you might be surprised today when your half-cocked plan doesn't work out as expected. Avoid the temptation to rush ahead before you are ready and save yourself from an unnecessary headache."
libra,2010-04-14,"The courageous Aries New Moon in your 7th House of Partnerships gives you the green light today. Although you normally like to create harmonious relationships, you're less concerned now with the outcome than you are with just expressing your feelings. You may be ready to impulsively blast ahead, but you still would be wiser to exercise some caution and consideration along the way."
scorpio,2010-04-14,"You should temporarily forget about the big picture and simply focus on the details of the day, since the New Moon is in your 6th House of Work. Although this might seem counter-intuitive, it's the smartest approach to accomplishing your long-term goals now. Once you catch up with your immediate commitments, then you will be able to concentrate more clearly on what comes next."
sagittarius,2010-04-14,"Today's impulsive Aries New Moon won't do much to bring you down. You are enthusiastic now about the potential you see in your life and playing your cards cautiously doesn't make any sense to you. But even if you are ready to rush forward, you won't likely reach your goals as quickly as you expect. Be prepared for an endurance test so discouragement doesn't take the wind out of your sails."
capricorn,2010-04-14,"Your friends and family may urge you to take a risk, but you aren't quite prepared to move ahead as fast as they would like. The New Moon activates your 4th House of Security today, encouraging you to protect what you've already gained instead of trying to accumulate anything else. Nevertheless, you might be scared that your lack of ambition now could put you at a disadvantage. Remember, there are many types of success and they aren't all about getting ahead."
aquarius,2010-04-14,"Today's enthusiastic Aries New Moon could bring you more information than you know how to handle. It falls in your 3rd House of Communication and increases the flow of data, challenging you to utilize what you already know. It's one thing to have an abundance of facts at your disposal; it's quite another to know what to do with them. Don't let your brain get so far ahead of you that you lose touch with your common sense."
pisces,2010-04-14,"You could believe that your finances are sound enough for you to spend money that you don't really have, thanks to the active Aries New Moon in your 2nd House of Personal Resources. You may not realize that there's a problem until it's too late. Fortunately, you can avoid a difficult situation by simply acknowledging the truth before you go too far pretending that everything is okay."
aries,2010-04-15,"After a flurry of activity in your life, your days of enthusiastic creativity are drawing to a close. You may feel let down because the high level of excitement is passing, but this is just a sign that it's now time to develop a longer-term approach to your work. Build onto whatever you have already begun in order to give longevity to your recent endeavors."
taurus,2010-04-15,"You may have been frazzled these past few days because too much was happening. Thankfully, now that the Moon is back in your sign, you can take the time necessary to assimilate your recent experiences. Even if there's more to do, don't be in too much of a hurry. It's more useful today to relax and get ready for the next round of intensity before it arrives."
gemini,2010-04-15,"You can feel the energetic shift that is pulling you away from social interactions and into your own private world. You may not be so quick to say yes when invited to join your friends or workmates for an outing today. But don't worry; there's nothing wrong with wanting to spend some time by yourself. Your imagination is talking to you with rich symbolism, but you must be quiet to hear what it is saying."
cancer,2010-04-15,"You can become quite possessive about your friends today, especially if you're afraid that they won't be there if you need them. But your worries aren't likely based on reality now; instead an old memory may be haunting you by reminding you of a time when you felt left alone. Be careful, for your manipulative behavior could backfire and inadvertently bring about the very abandonment you fear."
leo,2010-04-15,"You would feel better today if you knew that someone was looking out for you, yet you might choose to take care of yourself rather than facing possible disappointment. Just because you're tired of being let down by others doesn't mean you need to overcompensate and perform like a superhero. Don't be afraid to admit that you cannot do everything; showing your vulnerability will ultimately bring you closer to those you love."
virgo,2010-04-15,"It's likely that you have been thinking about taking a vacation or doing something with educational value, but you haven't been able to pull it all together. Today, it's reassuring when your vision finally falls into place. But the work isn't done; you still have to fine-tune the details before executing your plan. Don't try to do everything all at once; give yourself plenty of time to make it happen."
libra,2010-04-15,"You might believe that your good intentions can navigate you through a tricky negotiation today, but you may be up against more than meets the eye. Your straightforward and simplistic approach could be disarming to some, yet it's also an easy target for others. Be careful about showing all your cards right away; it's smarter now to unveil your strategy slowly on an as-needed basis."
scorpio,2010-04-15,"The tension between you and a loved one can increase today, with the Moon's visit to your 7th House of Partners. It's not that a particular disagreement is problematic; it's more about how you approach things from a completely different point of view. It's challenging for you to acknowledge how simplifying a complicated issue has any real value. Nevertheless, your openness to other perspectives can make nearly any issue easier to handle."
sagittarius,2010-04-15,"Your associates may be surprised with your approach to work now, for you are usually the one who focuses on the big picture rather than being overly specific. However, today you prefer to hone into the tiniest details. Fortunately, you can be very productive by making a list, checking it twice and methodically accomplishing your tasks in order. Worry less about what your co-workers are thinking and more about getting the job done right."
capricorn,2010-04-15,"You have a methodical approach to having fun today and fortunately this includes both work and play. Although someone could rub you wrong by interfering with your plans, it's best not to get caught up in an unnecessary conflict. Instead, put your energy to work by expressing yourself creatively in everything you do. Your pragmatic way of turning chores into a good time is contagious, making others smile and want to join in to help you."
aquarius,2010-04-15,You have a certain notion of how you expect everything to be today and you might find it difficult to change your mind. Your emotions are pretty straightforward now and you aren't interested in playing any games to get what you want. But negotiation may not come easily at this time and this can complicate your life. Even a little flexibility on your part will help to simplify the path toward your happiness.
pisces,2010-04-15,"It's challenging for you to take things as they come today. You will be much better off if you can schedule your activities in advance so you don't have to deal with any surprises. Luckily, planning ahead works well for you now and whatever you set up will likely unfold according to your schedule. Make time at the beginning of the day to coordinate your calendar before it's too late."
aries,2010-04-16,"You want today to be just another day yet you can sense something special brewing, even if you don't know what it is. Don't try too hard to uncover the secret or you can spoil the surprise before it's ready to be seen. Instead, make choices that simplify your life rather than adding layers of complication. But don't get too blase or you'll miss the magic when it happens."
taurus,2010-04-16,"Your desires can lure you into unfamiliar waters as your key planet Venus connects with unorthodox Uranus. You like the idea of simple pleasures, yet nothing seems simple today. Satisfaction may be elusive as long as you try to bend reality to your liking. Fortunately, once you relinquish control, you'll realize that whatever happens can bring an opportunity for your enjoyment."
gemini,2010-04-16,"Something is different today and you aren't necessarily thrilled about it. Perhaps you can intuitively feel your key planet Mercury slowing down to turn retrograde later this weekend. Instead of worrying about any unfinished projects, take a few deep breaths and prioritize what you still have left to do. Running around with scattered energy won't help matters, so decide what you can do to be productive without taking on too much."
cancer,2010-04-16,"Something you have been working on for a while could get a bit weird today as an undeniable piece of information comes your way. You cannot ignore what you learn through your network of friends, even if it means that you must alter your strategy. Don't worry about what others may think; just do what you must in order to execute your plans."
leo,2010-04-16,"Although you may be resigned to showing up and doing what needs to be done, you are also thinking about turning everything upside down and making your escape. However, it's unlikely that you will act on your fantasies today because you know that a sudden break in your routine would not bring you lasting happiness. Instead of jeopardizing what you have, do something for yourself that's out of the ordinary yet doesn't throw your life into further turmoil."
virgo,2010-04-16,"It seems like everything is in order today and you should be able to stay on the straight and narrow path that is right in front of you. But someone may catch you off guard now by sharing a thought or feeling that doesn't fit into your previous expectations. Try not to judge anyone who is being sincere, for honesty is more valuable than staying in your comfort zone."
libra,2010-04-16,"Your key planet Venus can rattle your cage today as she tempts you with unusual fantasies. Fortunately, you aren't required to act on your impulses now, nor do you have to tell anyone what you are thinking. Instead, give yourself permission to explore the impossible and the improbable within the private spaces of your imagination."
scorpio,2010-04-16,"A close friend could pleasantly surprise you today by sharing feelings of admiration or love. Although too much personal disclosure might make you uncomfortable, it's not a good idea to close yourself off to positive emotions. If necessary, admit your uneasiness with the conversation and acknowledge your fears about being vulnerable, but don't try to control the outcome. This is an opportunity to open a new channel of communication, so give yourself the chance to enjoy it."
sagittarius,2010-04-16,"It's easy for you to be cavalier and minimize the importance of an interaction with someone at work today. But your curiosity has been piqued and there's really no reason to pretend that your feelings are neutral. It may be as simple as wanting to work together on a project, or, perhaps, becoming better friends. There's no immediate need to know where this relationship is going as long as you remain open, yet unattached, to the possibilities."
capricorn,2010-04-16,"Your friends might not understand how easy it is for you to have a good time. Somehow, they think you are the one who remains serious, no matter what. But you have a few surprises up your sleeve today and can get as crazy as anyone else. Nevertheless, true to your style, you'll enjoy yourself even more if you meet your previous obligations prior to starting your weekend fun."
aquarius,2010-04-16,"Your key planet Uranus plays a significant role in the day by preventing you from being overly rigid. Even if you are determined to have your way, something is likely to snap, forcing you to shift your expectations. Remember, the more tension that's buried, the greater the force of release. Instead of fighting against change, it's healthier now to embrace it."
pisces,2010-04-16,"You are capable of expressing rebellious feelings today that you might otherwise keep to yourself. It feels good when you get a secret off your chest, but your sudden disclosure could shock someone who doesn't expect such radical behavior from you. Keep in mind that your impact on others could be greater than you think, so take your time to share your thoughts rather than just blurting out the truth."
aries,2010-04-17,"You may be feeling a bit panicky today because you know that you are running out of time. Even if you have plans for the weekend, it makes sense to limit your activities to leave time for your chores. It won't be easy to make the necessary choices unless you step back from the social whirlwind; set your priorities and then follow through in a sensible manner."
taurus,2010-04-17,"You have a busy day ahead of you and it may be very challenging to fit everything into your hectic schedule. You'd like to get the most out of each experience, so you don't want to cut one activity short just to make time for another. On the other hand, you are tempted to squeeze something else in because it sounds like fun. Just remember that doing more today is surely not in your best interest."
gemini,2010-04-17,"It's nearly impossible to keep on schedule today, so you might as well not even try. You could have a perfectly enjoyable time if you clear your calendar as much as possible. But now that the Moon is back in your sign, don't think that having fewer plans means that you can relax. Instead, accept the fact that you'll need to respond to changing circumstances throughout the day. Keep in mind that your flexibility is currently your greatest asset."
cancer,2010-04-17,"You are emotionally bouncing all over the map today and may not be able to settle down your feelings. Luckily, others can't see past your smokescreen of complacency, since it's easier for you to manage your desires by temporarily keeping them to yourself. As soon as you share what's on your mind, everything becomes more complicated, so be careful about what you say in the first place."
leo,2010-04-17,"You have very high standards, making your unrealistic expectations difficult to reach. You can logically understand why your friends are acting as they do now, but all the rationalization in the world still doesn't diminish your disappointment. Don't give up on those you love, even if you have to cut them some slack for being who they are rather than who you want them to be."
virgo,2010-04-17,"You may have high hopes for today with a variety of interesting activities planned. But things don't unfold as expected, demonstrating early on that nothing is as certain as it seems. You could make yourself very frustrated if you attempt to force your agenda onto the changing landscape. Instead, it's a smarter idea to practice letting go of control now. Not only will you enjoy yourself, you'll also accomplish more than you think."
libra,2010-04-17,"Your rollercoaster ride continues today as your emotions rise and fall and rise again, giving you a queasy feeling in the pit of your stomach. You may grow tired of the excitement, yet there doesn't seem much you can do to stop it. Don't worry; things are about to slow down, even if they remain intense throughout the day. The key is to enjoy what you can along the way without being overly concerned about what happens next."
scorpio,2010-04-17,"Your emotions are raw today, yet you are able to move through difficult spaces quite quickly. But the speed at which you can process dark feelings now is not due to avoidance. It's the opposite; you can benefit from your willingness to jump into the fire, experience the intensity of the heat and then let go as the metamorphosis occurs."
sagittarius,2010-04-17,"Although you may be sidetracked for a while today as you become involved in someone's drama, you won't be able to stay serious for too long. Your sense of humor is your saving grace now, as long as you're not too quick to employ it to avoid an important issue. But a bit of wit and charm at the right time can be the perfect antidote for an intense situation that could use some levity to counteract the gravity."
capricorn,2010-04-17,"You might try to play a heavy-handed role today, but your attempts fall short of being able to pull it off successfully. Luckily, you won't be able to take yourself so seriously now because you can see exciting possibilities in the silver linings of every dark cloud. There is no need to be overly controlling once you realize that the sky will clear on its own."
aquarius,2010-04-17,"You may realize today that your feelings are changing too fast for you to make any long-term decisions. Although your overall values are constant, your moods are shifting as you continue to learn more about those close to you. Even if you are afraid of losing control in a relationship, remember that your fear is probably worse than any possible outcome. Focusing on the best-case scenario makes more sense because that actually helps it to manifest."
pisces,2010-04-17,"It's difficult for you to stay discouraged, even if you bump up against some difficult emotions today. An old issue may resurface, making you feel insecure about your family or social relationships. But once you realize that the present circumstances are quite different from the previous ones, it's much easier for you to see the sweet potential rather than doom and gloom. Set positive intentions, but don't expect miracles."
aries,2010-04-18,"Although you may be defiantly dancing at the edge of an abyss, there is no escaping the truth today. You cannot keep up the illusion of competence when you feel as if you are running out of steam. Your smartest strategy may include a bit of rest and relaxation, but this doesn't mean another distracting activity. Gather your strength now so you have it when you really need it."
taurus,2010-04-18,"Navigate carefully through tricky territory while Mercury is retrograde in your sign. The intensity of interpersonal interactions may be overwhelming, tempting you to retreat behind an impenetrable wall, but you won't like feeling so isolated. Oddly enough, you could overcompensate by taking on so many activities that you wear yourself out. Seeking a middle path between the extremes of all or nothing is your best chance for success."
gemini,2010-04-18,You are challenged to delve deeper into your fantasies as your ruling planet Mercury turns retrograde in your 12th House of Imagination today. But you cannot lose yourself in delusional thinking for the need to be practical remains strong. Your task now is to allow yourself enough freedom to wander through the rich symbolism of your mind without becoming detached from reality.
cancer,2010-04-18,"You may have to handle social obligations that have been left unfinished. Your intent is to take care of previous commitments and then move on. But it's not as straightforward as you expect because someone's agenda isn't yet on the table. There's no need to force anything now, for the missing information will come out into the open in perfect time."
leo,2010-04-18,"It's hard for you to reconcile your current course of action with what you now know, for the facts suggest you would be smarter doing something else. But you are determined to follow through on what you started, even if it makes your life more difficult for a while. Although your loyalty is admirable, it's still a good idea to reevaluate your plan rather than blindly sticking to it, no matter what."
virgo,2010-04-18,"Your ruling planet Mercury is in the spotlight today as it begins its retrograde cycle in your 9th House of Big Ideas. You may already know a lot, but you feel as if you need more specific information in order to make an informed decision about your future. Others may encourage you to decide right away, yet it's prudent to hold out until you have gathered enough useful data to choose wisely."
libra,2010-04-18,"You may be forced to dig into your hidden emotional reserves today. Fortunately, you'll be able to find the strength you need, surprising those who didn't think you had what it takes. But this isn't a one-shot deal; you have a few weeks of hard work ahead of you and you won't be able to slack off until the job is done."
scorpio,2010-04-18,"Your quick mental reactions can be misleading to others today because they might believe your current ability to think on your feet means you don't have a long-term plan. But you know where you are going, even if you're not sure exactly how you're going to get there. Don't worry about what to do; trust that each step will make sense in the right moment as long as you aim your thoughts at the finished goal."
sagittarius,2010-04-18,"Your daily routine could become undone today as an unexpected opportunity changes your schedule at home. Instead of attempting to make your previous plans work no matter what happens, you are smart enough to recreate your day without sticking to an agenda. Once you demonstrate your willingness to flow with the changing currents, a stressful path will morph into a trail of accomplishment."
capricorn,2010-04-18,"A fateful Mars-Saturn septile can lift the invisibility cloak today, allowing you to temporarily peer into the magical realm of possibility. You are not limited now to the three-dimensional world; events can bleed over from other dimensions this evening. Don't judge what's currently happening; instead, be open to the influx of fantasy because your belief is enough to make it real."
aquarius,2010-04-18,"You are being pushed right up against your comfort zone and may wonder whether or not it's smart to push back or just give in. But your problem may not be about doing the right thing; it's more about knowing when to call it quits. Keep in mind that it could take a week or two before you have enough perspective to make a final decision. In the meantime, just give yourself permission to change your mind if needed."
pisces,2010-04-18,"You may be confused as you try to sort out your dreams today, even though the Sun's sextile to imaginative Neptune can raise your spirits. You feel as if you have too much conflicting information to choose one single path over all the others. Trusting your intuition could lead you to leaving your options open longer than you originally thought possible. Don't panic and make an impulsive decision, for your current sense of urgency might be based more on fear than on reality."
aries,2010-04-19,"You may need to retreat while you figure out a new approach, for it's apparent that your old one isn't bringing you what you want. Perhaps an apology is in order, especially if you overstepped your bounds. But before you withdraw, consider how far you need to go in order to regain your composure. Remember, it's not an all-or-nothing situation. If you just quit, you'll probably end up resenting those who can help you the most."
taurus,2010-04-19,"You might prefer to remain quiet today while going about your business. You are more serious than usual and won't want to waste time on frivolous activities. It's as if you intuitively know that your time will be harder to manage in the days ahead, so you want to make as much progress now as you possibly can. Your strategy is sound, but don't become so rigid in your thinking that you cannot react to what's happening in the present moment."
gemini,2010-04-19,"It's easy for you to get so caught up in the current moment that you forget about what's most important to you. You should remember to take a few deep breaths in order to get back in touch with yourself today. You may feel as if the success of others might threaten your progress, but this is only a result of your fears. Listen to your own inner voice so you won't have to argue with anyone else to prove that you are right."
cancer,2010-04-19,"Your soft spots come right up to the surface with the Moon's return to your nurturing sign today. You want to show others how much you care about them, but your altruistic motives could also provoke manipulative behavior. There's nothing wrong with letting someone know about your vulnerabilities as long as you don't use your weaknesses to set up a situation where you can ultimately take control."
leo,2010-04-19,"Your planning stage is quickly drawing to a close. You must grab the opportunity that is in front of you or just let it go. Although you have more time to accomplish your goals than you realize, there isn't a lot of it to waste. Even if you intuitively know that it's going to be a very successful project, there is still quite a bit of work that falls directly on your shoulders."
virgo,2010-04-19,"You may have a carefully considered agenda that involves a group of people and the coordination can be quite a lot to handle. Luckily, you are able to weave a web through your current friends at work and play, enabling you to have a very broad perspective. Keeping your mind as open as possible will help you learn what you need to know at this time."
libra,2010-04-19,"Do your best to maintain the delicate balance between the traditional old way of doing things and the radical new breakthroughs that keep you on your toes. Adherence to cultural patterns is one way to show your respect and acknowledge what works. But it also gives unnecessary power to worn-out paradigms that need changing. Accordingly, pick your battles carefully and be aware of the consequences of the choices you make now."
scorpio,2010-04-19,"You are riding an emotional surge today. Although this can give you a sense of confidence and motivate you to share your most passionate beliefs, your feelings can also get in the way of your productivity. Pay attention to how much time you're putting into talking about your inner process. Don't be afraid to put a limit on what you're willing to share at this time."
sagittarius,2010-04-19,You might not be your naturally optimistic self today because you can see through the veneer that covers the truth. But being able to get to the bottom line is a real asset and paying extra attention to your perceptions can help you avoid trouble. It's better to know the potential pitfalls so you can avoid them than to live in ignorant bliss until you realize that it's too late.
capricorn,2010-04-19,"Your relationships may be rather stressful now as the Moon in your 7th House of Partnerships opposes ruthless Pluto in your sign. You are not interested in a casual interaction; instead you're seeking to engage others in a profound manner that sets the stage for transformation. Change can be hard work, but you have no reason to complain because you're not looking for the easy way out this time around."
aquarius,2010-04-19,"You might take your point of view too far today, which could be very upsetting to someone who disagrees with you. Hopefully you have the wisdom to avoid a fight to the finish, for assuming an all-or-nothing stance will probably turn everyone into a loser. Instead, it's healthier to acknowledge other people's right to have a different perspective, even if you believe yours is better."
pisces,2010-04-19,"You don't have to shout your feelings from the mountaintop; in fact, you may want to keep them quietly to yourself. Luckily, this doesn't have to prevent you from sharing them selectively with someone you trust. But your judgment may be slightly off today, so be careful about who you pick as your confidant. It's smarter to err on the side of saying too little rather than too much. You can always choose to disclose more later on, but you cannot take back what you already said."
aries,2010-04-20,"There's no need to pretend that you have everything under control today. In fact the more you try to hide your lack of confidence, the more transparent you will be. But you have a chance now to turn your shortcomings into strengths if you are willing to go out on a limb and admit your fears. Instead of appearing foolish by covering up what everyone already knows, get your concerns out into the open. Others will be willing to support you if they know you are being honest."
taurus,2010-04-20,"The Sun's return to your sign today marks the beginning of your birthday month. You would be wise to reconsider your priorities and allow time for both work and play. Your well of energy is deeper now, so putting in a little extra effort on the job should pay off. But don't forget about giving yourself enough time to relax. Maintaining your health is easier when physical activity is offset by sufficient rest."
gemini,2010-04-20,"You may be receiving support today from a hidden benefactor and it's really not important for you to get to the source. Just accept the positive energy that comes your way now without becoming lost in needless analysis. If you try to attract additional help, your scheme could backfire on you. Don't make a big deal about what you are doing; simply go about your work with determination and let go of your attachment to what happens."
cancer,2010-04-20,"It's not easy to cover up your feelings today, even if you attempt to hide behind your shell. But paradoxically, your worries can morph into your greatest strengths now; if you embrace them you'll be able to overcome the obstacles they portend. But if you make believe that everything is fine, your fears can grow and complicate your day even further."
leo,2010-04-20,"You are more resilient than you give yourself credit for today. Although you may be dealing with residual anger from recent frustrations, you should be able to bounce back quicker than you expect. But don't spread yourself too thin. Set simple goals so you have extra time to rest. Once you have finished your first round of chores, then you can always do more later on. Meeting your obligations one step at a time allows you to regenerate your energy."
virgo,2010-04-20,"You may be feeling an incoming wave of down-to-earth optimism, which is quite different from unrealistic dreaming. Today's methodical approach to long-term projects gives you a much better chance of being successful. There's no need to worry about reaching your goals now. If your destination is worth your effort, it's also worth the wait."
libra,2010-04-20,"You are motivated to take care of others today, but you might not be willing to stop with your family. You may choose to carry your loving and nurturing energy out into your community or workplace. Just be careful that your desire to enhance the lives of those around you could be taken too far. Don't stick your nose into business that's not your concern or you could be perceived as a manipulative person when you only meant to help."
scorpio,2010-04-20,"Although you may be attempting to do the impossible, you cannot please everyone now. The Sun's entry into your 7th House of Others reinforces your need to simplify your life. But you cannot just disappear because your friends and associates are relying on your involvement. Remember, you can play an integral role in someone's life without having to take full responsibility for all of it."
sagittarius,2010-04-20,"You may be on a positive roll, yet still an uncomfortable feeling is surfacing today. You could be worried that you don't yet know what to do with your resistance to work. You are pushing up against real deadlines, yet they won't matter as much as you assume. One way to maintain your productivity is to continue working as hard as you can without panicking over things you cannot change."
capricorn,2010-04-20,"Remaining sensitive to other people's needs today can be the key to your current happiness. It's not that you are co-dependent; it's just that your life is truly intertwined with those closest to you and you don't live in a vacuum. Although you might prefer to avoid an overly emotional meltdown, sticking with a discussion about your feelings can lead to revitalizing a troubled relationship."
aquarius,2010-04-20,"There's a lot going on in your life today that others cannot see. The Sun's month-long visit to your 4th House of Security motivates you to strengthen the foundations of your home and family, taking the emphasis off your career. But building a strong personal base is exactly what allows you to go out and develop your community presence later on."
pisces,2010-04-20,"Your involvement in health-related endeavors is gradually increasing, as Chiron the Wounded Healer enters your imaginative sign today. Even if you're not an official caregiver, your presence around those needing help is so strong now that you have a positive impact without even doing anything. But this is not a good time to remain silent. Although it's not wise to waste words talking about superfluous topics, saying the right thing can be just what the doctor ordered."
aries,2010-04-21,"It's as if someone changes the station on your television today when the Moon makes her midday shift into fiery Leo. You wake up from your earlier complacency and swing into action, as if you were waiting for the right moment to arrive before starting something new. But you may run into an obstacle before you reach your goal. Don't push too hard or your frustration will tempt you to retreat. On the other hand, don't give up prematurely if success takes longer than you expect."
taurus,2010-04-21,"You believe that you are on track today and there's no reason to alter your approach. But you can feel the resistance building, even if you aren't yet sure why anyone wants you to change what you're doing. Burying your head in the sand won't help you resolve the tension, even if it hasn't yet come to a head. Keep in mind that it will be easier to deal with the pressure for change sooner than later."
gemini,2010-04-21,"You may appear to be your regularly flexible self, but you aren't really all that eager to modify your current schedule today. You may give lip service to others while holding on to your old agenda if they ask you to alter your work flow for the common good. Take some time to think about why you are resisting change, for you might be happier once you loosen your controlling grip on the day's agenda."
cancer,2010-04-21,"Although you are quite easygoing for the first part of the day, it seems as if something is being taken away from you and you don't like how it feels. Nevertheless, resist the temptation to fight for what you believe is yours. If you engage in conflict, your chances of getting what you want could deteriorate. But if you are willing to let go of your expectations, you may be pleasantly surprised and end up with exactly what you desired in the first place."
leo,2010-04-21,The Moon's return to your sign can put you in closer touch with what you really want. You may have forgotten how you felt because you were distracted by fulfilling your obligations. But now you could have time to listen to your inner voice for guidance. Don't push away the messages you receive from the wisdom of your own subconscious mind.
virgo,2010-04-21,"You may struggle today because you want everyone to know exactly how you feel, yet you cherish your privacy too much to actually tell anyone about your inner conflict. If you open up to a friend early in the day, you'll be able to gradually retreat later on. But if you hide behind a smokescreen of cool detachment, then you could become more frustrated as the day wears on. You'll need to spill the beans sooner or later, so you might as well get it over with while you can."
libra,2010-04-21,"You are less inclined to apply yourself diligently today if it means that you cannot enjoy being with your friends. But if you can combine a social activity with more serious chores, then you should be able to get a lot more accomplished now than anyone expects. Remember, having fun doesn't diminish your opportunity for success. Combining work and play is sure to put a smile on your face."
scorpio,2010-04-21,"What others think of your performance is important to you now, but your concern can be so great that it actually gets in the way of optimum productivity. Naturally, you want to do a good job, but try to focus more on meeting your own high standards than waiting for approval from someone else. Even if you are overly worried today, things could look a lot better tomorrow."
sagittarius,2010-04-21,"Although you may be quite patient through the morning hours, you'll be champing at the bit before the day is through. Luckily, you shouldn't have to wait much longer, although Mercury's retrograde could make everything at work seem to take more time than usual. Begin a new project today or take an old one to the next step, but give yourself several days to accomplish your current goals."
capricorn,2010-04-21,"Just as you become accustomed to working with someone else and adjusting your calendar to theirs, something shifts and forces you back onto your own schedule. It's not that you should avoid partnering now; it's just that it can be more complicated than usual. Figure out what your limits are, communicate them to those closest to you and then, to avoid confusion, don't overstep your own boundaries. Your clarity will help everyone be more productive throughout the day."
aquarius,2010-04-21,"You may need to temper your feelings of independence now or you could damage an existing relationship by taking yourself too seriously. Don't be afraid of letting your partner know what you want, but remember that issuing an ultimatum is usually a bad idea. You can inadvertently trigger an unnecessary conflict by being too rigid in your interactions with others both on the job and at home."
pisces,2010-04-21,"Even if you aren't clear about the specifics of your job now, go ahead and do the best you can based upon what you've been previously told. Naturally, it's a smart idea to ask a simple question or two and find out more about any expectations. But in lieu of having the facts, just pretend that you know what's right. If it needs perfecting, others will tell you and you can make the necessary adjustments at that time."
aries,2010-04-22,"A difficult situation can turn into one that is based on love, as your key planet Mars is conspiring with sensual Venus today. Unfortunately, you can do all the right things, but may still feel as if you failed unless you can get someone else to join you in your efforts. However, the truth is that you don't require anyone else now, even if it might be more enjoyable to share the magic of the moment."
taurus,2010-04-22,"You are able to give an inspired performance since your key planet Venus is receiving an energetic boost from the Moon and Mars in showy Leo today. You may feel as if you are on stage, even if you are just sharing your dreams with a close friend or family member. But being real is still more important than being dramatic, so don't lay on the sentimentality too thick. Ultimately, the more straightforward you can be in your delivery, the better your story will be received."
gemini,2010-04-22,"You might not be able to decide what to do now that your heart tells you one thing but your head says something else. Normally you would use your logic to resolve a dilemma, but today your rational thoughts only present one dimension of a more complex situation. You may need to accept the current futility of arriving at a final answer; leaving things more open temporarily lightens your load."
cancer,2010-04-22,"Although you may be somewhat insecure in your relationship with your business or social network, wonderful things can happen today. Still, your attitude has a great impact on all your interactions, so try not to dwell on your fears. Assuming that the worst will happen can actually sour a sweet situation, so practice the power of positive thought to bring about the best results."
leo,2010-04-22,"Your greatest strength now is not something that can be described by a skill or a talent. It has to do with a more subtle gift that might be referred to as charisma. Fortunately, others will be able to see your sparkle in all that you do, even if you are concerned with more mundane issues. Although it might sound trite, it's more important for you to concentrate on love today than on being productive. As Einstein said, ""Not everything that counts can be counted."""
virgo,2010-04-22,"You may need to play the role of a heavyweight today by exerting authority, even if you don't want to be in charge. It's tempting to turn your resistance into anger, though it won't be appropriate for you to express your negativity. But there's no need to resent your current job; it's not permanent. Don't just do what is being asked of you to get by; give it one hundred and ten percent so you ultimately feel satisfied with your work."
libra,2010-04-22,"You are intrigued by the idea of slowing down and digging in emotionally; however, you're also afraid of feeling too much. It's often easier for you to keep your emotions on the lighter side where you aren't as vulnerable, but something is different today. Sure, you could make a graceful escape, yet you also are capable of pushing through your fears now as your key planet Venus receives a loving nudge from assertive Mars. There's no need to resist the possibility of pleasure."
scorpio,2010-04-22,"So much of your life now depends on other people that it's difficult for you to have the autonomy you prefer. But your relationships -- business and professional -- are less straightforward today because unspoken feelings can alter the apparent dynamics. An unsubstantiated fear can bend you out of shape, so don't assume there is a problem unless it's actually mentioned. Keeping a positive outlook helps you work well with others."
sagittarius,2010-04-22,"Although you are fairly optimistic today about your long-term plans, more immediate problems could create some anxiety. You know there is a solution to the stress you feel between personal and professional matters, but it doesn't seem possible now to choose one over the other. Fortunately the larger issues will fall into place if you stay focused on what's right in front of you. Act locally while thinking globally."
capricorn,2010-04-22,"You may need to step up to the plate and assume more responsibility today, even if there's no immediate reward or acknowledgment for your extra efforts. Nevertheless, you can see what your expertise brings to the current situation and you believe that your hard work should eventually pay off. Try not to waste energy calculating the potential return on your investment. You'll do better if you just jump in and give it your best."
aquarius,2010-04-22,"You may be seriously concerned about a financial decision that needs your attention, but you don't feel like you have enough information yet to make an educated choice. Meanwhile, others may pressure you with their agendas and try to convince you that they know what's best. Trust your intuition if you receive a clear answer in a moment of sudden inspiration. But if the solution doesn't come from within, then put off your final judgment for a few more days."
pisces,2010-04-22,"Something special happens today that kicks up your imagination and allows you to see a relationship from a new perspective. Although this moment of clarity may not ultimately change your life, it can be part of a process of growth that eventually moves you in a different direction. But don't be too quick to think you know where your current revelation will lead you. Observe what's happening and reserve your opinions until later when you can see the bigger picture."
aries,2010-04-23,"You look like you are ready to take a risk now in order to get something you have wanted for a while. But beneath your cavalier appearance, you're probably doing more calculations than anyone might realize. When you finally do climb out on a limb, you optimistically believe that you won't fall. To be safe, just make sure you've built your strategy on facts and not false assumptions based on unrealistic fantasies."
taurus,2010-04-23,"You aren't as sure that you know exactly what you want even though the Moon's entry into your playful 5th House today boosts your desire for pleasure. Paradoxically, while you have a practical approach to the concept of satisfaction, it becomes more elusive now as you attempt to reach it. But don't give up just because you don't have the clarity you want; your sheer determination will win out in the end."
gemini,2010-04-23,"You might feel a bit anxious now because there are too many conflicting thoughts running around inside your head. Normally, you are able to handle the lack of resolution, but today you could make an impulsive decision in order to bring finality to a situation. Unfortunately, you might still be missing a critical piece of information needed to make the best choice. Hold off as long as possible before giving your final answer."
cancer,2010-04-23,"You have an extra large supply of will power today and would be wise to put it to good use. Although your communication skills are heightened now, you still could get yourself into a bit of trouble by mixing up your favorite fantasy with the actual truth. Don't trust your perceptions because they may bend reality in your favor. Instead, check out your assumptions by asking a close friend for his or her perspective. You'll have a better sense of what's happening once you have another point of view."
leo,2010-04-23,"There is nothing wrong with your decision-making process now, especially if you trust logic over your impulsive feelings. If you are enamored with something or someone, remember that it's a good idea to hold yourself back while you think about the consequences of immediately pursuing your desires. If, after serious consideration, it still seems like a good idea, then go for it. Waiting a while won't hurt your chances for finding satisfaction if your plan makes sense."
virgo,2010-04-23,"The Moon's return to your sign today is a reminder that you do best when you filter out extraneous data before making any important decisions. But your current problem stems from the difficulty of knowing which information is valid and which originates within your imagination. Once you realize that your fantasies can now seem real, you are able to seek out the details that allow you to distinguish fact from fiction."
libra,2010-04-23,"It's another intense day because your desire for pleasure can lead you into a complicated situation. But you have no reason to avoid the complexity because the sweet possibilities are so enticing. Nevertheless, you could find yourself in deeper water than you expected. For now, err on the side of common sense rather than being disappointed by the lack of gold in the pot at the end of the rainbow."
scorpio,2010-04-23,"You are driven by the idea of accomplishing something very concrete today. However, it's challenging to keep your mind from wandering into the distracting realms of sensual pleasure. As lovely as your fantasies may be now, it's really up to you whether or not to encourage them with your attention. You'll enjoy the present moment more if it contributes to the enduring satisfaction of reaching your goals."
sagittarius,2010-04-23,"It's important to follow through with your promises at work today, for others are counting on your performance. Although you take your job quite seriously now, it's easy to misinterpret what's expected of you by getting the details mixed up. Listen to your instructions extra carefully, write them down and then double check that you heard them correctly. This might seem like overkill, but it can save you from needlessly wasting time and energy."
capricorn,2010-04-23,"You have an abundance of creative energy now, yet it's challenging to find an outlet for even the most practical of your ideas. Your actions may not have the positive impact you want, turning your enthusiasm to discouragement. Don't give up, for the clouds of illusion can dissipate suddenly, leaving you with clear vision. If you know what you want, your determination and hard work will eventually pay off."
aquarius,2010-04-23,"You may reexamine family issues today, especially if a current situation reminds you of something from your childhood. You aren't clear about what happened then and you might not be so sure of what's happening now. But as you continue to think about the dynamics, you begin to understand how the present events are very different from the past. Don't be afraid to take a radical approach once you see things in a new light."
pisces,2010-04-23,"The Moon's entry into your 7th House of Partners can rekindle a recurring relationship dilemma as you try to balance your need for security with your desire for individual freedom. You don't want to be alone, yet you can be obstinate now in your unwillingness to acquiesce on a seemingly petty issue. Choose your battles carefully so you don't lose what's most important to you."
aries,2010-04-24,"You may feel as if you've been riding a seesaw recently with all your emotional ups and downs. Today, however, you are more even-keeled as you begin to get a handle on the relationship between what you want and what you're willing to give up in order to get it. If you've gone overboard in your quest for independence, now it's time to be extra supportive of someone you love in order to heal the rift."
taurus,2010-04-24,"Today you could be a formidable opponent, not that you are leaning toward any sort of conflict, aside from a competitive sport. It's just that your patience and determination can wear someone down who stands in your way. Your strength comes from your ability to avoid an argument even if there's a difference of opinion. Don't push too hard; gentle persuasion will now work in your favor better than any other approach."
gemini,2010-04-24,"You might not be overly verbal about your feelings now, but your quiet acceptance of others can go a long way toward creating peace and harmony. You may as well enjoy the current calmness, for it could be the temporary eye in the center of a storm. Don't worry about justifying your unconventional goals to anyone today; you'll be better equipped to tell your story once loving Venus enters your chatty sign tomorrow."
cancer,2010-04-24,"Someone may be secretly pulling strings in order to get his or her way, but you aren't willing to acquiesce until you've tried to bend reality in your direction. It's challenging to deal with the situation if you don't know what is being done to manipulate you. But instead of trying to uncover anyone's hidden agenda, you're better off concentrating on positive action. Save the detective work and strategic planning for some other day."
leo,2010-04-24,"You now know what is possible and what is not. Your financial expectations are pretty realistic, indicating that this is a good time to make a decision about a major purchase or an investment. But don't limit your thinking just to stay on the safe side. A calculated risk could pay off if you are willing to act methodically, rather than impulsively."
virgo,2010-04-24,"Clear thinking returns today, allowing you to have confidence about making an important decision. However, it's a mistake to believe that your current choice is your final one because Mercury is retrograde in your 9th House of Big Ideas. Although you have a general understanding of where you are heading, there are still details you don't know yet. Give yourself some breathing room so you can respond to facts as you learn them."
libra,2010-04-24,"You know more than you're willing to say today and you won't let anyone coerce you into spilling the beans. Perhaps you were told something in confidence or maybe you haven't yet put your thoughts into perspective. Either way, others will appreciate your high level of integrity now and they understand that you'll share what's necessary when the time is right."
scorpio,2010-04-24,"You may realize that a special relationship is more complicated than it appears today, but you're fearful to disturb what seems to be working so well. Luckily, you're blessed with sensible friends who will tell you what they are thinking. Furthermore, the advice they give you now is not only sound, it's also useful. Unfortunately, this moment will not last, so don't procrastinate. If you want another point of view, ask for help while it's available."
sagittarius,2010-04-24,"Your close acquaintances might grow tired of the tap dancing you are doing now in order to avoid being pinned down. They would like you to say what you want without beating around the bush or talking in vague generalities. Don't let your resistance to making a commitment turn your easygoing attitude into anger. Concentrate your attention on creating stability, not upsetting it."
capricorn,2010-04-24,"Your key planet Saturn is warmed by delicious Venus today, encouraging you to nurture those you love. Others like your casual spontaneity now, but that doesn't mean you are carefree enough to ignore your responsibilities. Although you are motivated to have fun this weekend, meet your obligations before you head out to play with your friends."
aquarius,2010-04-24,"No matter how focused you are today on taking care of domestic matters, you want others to see you as someone who knows how to have a good time. But it's not all that easy for you to enjoy yourself now, unless you are involved in a creative project around the home. It's easier to be satisfied if you don't set your goals too high. Unfortunately, you can get lazy if you don't set any goals at all. Somehow, find a balance between the two extremes."
pisces,2010-04-24,"You may be struggling to get a relationship back on track, especially if your recent behavior was less than exemplary. Luckily, you can make up for lost time today by paying extra attention to the needs of those around you. But don't think that you'll earn extra points by doing all the right things now; you're off to a bad start if you are already keeping score. The best way to build trust is to combine kindness with honesty and stay present in each and every interaction."
aries,2010-04-25,"Today may be chaotic as you are distracted by one thing after another. Although you are a force to be reckoned with, you're not as invincible as you believe. Losing your temper now is not a smart idea because you could create more problems than you realize. Physical exercise can help, but give yourself permission to take additional timeouts when needed to help with your anger management."
taurus,2010-04-25,"You have a lot on your plate and you are eager to accomplish as much as possible today. But you may get tired of chasing after one too many goals. Instead of spreading yourself thin, set your priorities and focus your attention on the most important tasks first, letting the others go. Don't panic, even if you run into unexpected problems. The calmer you can remain now, the more effective you will be throughout the day."
gemini,2010-04-25,"Your charm factor is kicked up a notch now that sweet Venus is in your sign. But tension is in the air and you still can lose your patience if you don't pay close attention to your feelings. You may even find yourself in the heat of an argument, wondering how you got there. Remember, you aren't the only one who is stressed out today, so your smartest move is to take the high road by demonstrating how well you can listen and respond with kindness."
cancer,2010-04-25,"You appear to have your desires under control, but you aren't expressing what you truly want now. Your feelings are drawing you into deep waters and the emotional currents can carry you far off course. But you may reach a breaking point where it requires too much energy to hide your inner world from those you love. Don't wait too long to say what's on your mind. A gentle approach makes the most sense."
leo,2010-04-25,"Your emotions could be stressed to the max today, forcing you to explore ways to alleviate the tension. You may think you are being clever, but an edginess to your voice reveals the anger you are unsuccessfully trying to hide. You would be wise to examine your unspoken feelings if you notice that your words are becoming overly sarcastic. There are many sensible strategies for restoring balance, but saying hurtful things is not one of them."
virgo,2010-04-25,"The entry of Venus into restless Gemini today adds to your anxiety because you find it difficult to concentrate on the present circumstances. Normally, you are willing to let your thoughts wander. But your fantasies may not be that pleasant now, especially if you are doubting yourself or worrying about your shortcomings. Self-analysis leads you to endlessly spin your mental wheels, but you can break the cycle by doing something useful instead of stressing about the past."
libra,2010-04-25,"Initially, you feel a great sense of relief today as your key planet Venus enters flighty Gemini, a fellow air sign. But something doesn't feel right about having a lighthearted attitude when your life is filled with such serious issues. You are too self-aware now to feel good about trying to escape from your circumstances. Fortunately, the Moon's return to your sign later in the day can be a much-needed catalyst in your search for peace."
scorpio,2010-04-25,"You may be annoyed at having to maintain your focus in spite of all the distractions that are tugging at you one way and another. But your strength of purpose now is inarguable, like the power of an erupting volcano. You don't want to get angry, but it may be the most effective way of letting others know how serious you are today. Those who are not willing to help you along your path would be wise to quietly step out of your way."
sagittarius,2010-04-25,"You may be able to see the beauty in someone special, yet it's not easy today for you to express how you feel. It's tempting to glibly tell a story or talk about your plans for the week ahead instead of showing your vulnerability by sharing what's in your heart. Nevertheless, the real meaning now won't come from a clever verbal sparring match. Although it may take courage, it's time to be honest and clearly say what's on your mind."
capricorn,2010-04-25,"You probably won't be caught off guard today as easily as those around you. Your apparent stability could set you up to be the go-to person as others try to manage the stressful situations in their personal lives. But you're not without your own worries now, and everyone else's demands can create extra anxiety for you. Go ahead and offer your shoulder to loved ones, but be firm about drawing the line when you need time to take care of yourself."
aquarius,2010-04-25,"You remember easier days in the past and you long for their return. You might experience irrepressible anger when you realize that these times are truly complicated and that a return to simplicity isn't likely. But you need not hold on to your annoyance with the way things are now. Although you may be balancing on a tightrope, you have an opportunity to live the life you dream of; don't let this chance slip by without doing something about it."
pisces,2010-04-25,"You have a lot more strength now than you acknowledge yet your resistance to your own power can get in the way of your success. Don't succumb to feelings of low self-esteem by comparing yourself to anyone else. You have unique capabilities, whether or not they are recognized. The key now is your own self-awareness. You'll know that you are on the right course when you realize that your beliefs can have a positive impact on others."
aries,2010-04-26,"Responsibilities at work may have piled up to the point where you don't know how you're going to do everything that's expected of you. Luckily, someone can come to your rescue now, even if only to help you put things into a more workable perspective. You don't have to finish all your incomplete projects today, nor must you solve all your problems. But don't miss the opportunity to get a little more organized, day by day."
taurus,2010-04-26,"You might feel as if you have hit a creative block and you may be tempted to shake up your life to see if that helps. But you won't likely be happy if things become less stable than they already are now. Instead of seeking answers on the outside, consider what you can do to alter your perspective. Clearing out the cobwebs from the attics of your mind may be just the catalyst you need."
gemini,2010-04-26,"It may have seemed like the answers to your prayers were recently within reach, but now the path ahead doesn't appear so straightforward. Unfortunately, your current frustration could motivate you to take an unnecessary risk. Don't let your discouragement tempt you with an overly radical scheme while Mercury is still retrograde. Cut yourself some slack and take a few weeks to put your life back on track."
cancer,2010-04-26,"You may be revisiting a problem that has bothered you for a year or so. Even if the specific situation is different now, you still might have to choose between a well-known path of safety and an unfamiliar one that leads into unknown territory. Although your security is important to you, this is a chance to try something different. You'll never know what could happen unless you're willing to take a calculated risk."
leo,2010-04-26,"Once again you must consider how your core beliefs affect your financial security. You could be forced to make a decision now that changes your earning potential for better or worse, depending upon your priorities. It may appear that there are no clear answers to your basic questions, which makes this fork in the road more complicated. Even if you have a strong sense of urgency today, it may be wiser to put off your final choice for a couple of months."
virgo,2010-04-26,"Responding to unexpected twists and turns on the road of life and handling unpredictable people in your environment is beginning to take its toll. You don't like the high level of stress that's created when one too many things are beyond your control. Although you may not be able to prevent a relationship from changing, you can make your day-to-day existence easier by accepting the futility of resistance. Concentrate on ways to improve on what you have instead of living in fear."
libra,2010-04-26,"You would like to feel okay with everything that's occurring at work now, but you're worried that too much is happening too fast. You aren't sure where to place your allegiance today, for it seems like opposing camps are polarizing and you have to make a choice. Naturally, you want everyone to get along and might not be willing to commit to one side or the other. Do what you do best; work toward helping others find common ground in order to lessen the stress of conflict."
scorpio,2010-04-26,"It's frustrating when you have to conform to someone else's idea of quality and you may want to rebel against an established authority. But your self-expression, however brilliant, can also be so erratic now that it's smart to let someone else be the final judge. Leaning on others for stability today can be very reassuring, but you must be willing to listen to their feedback for it to be of value."
sagittarius,2010-04-26,"You may be a bit discouraged if your career plans aren't panning out according to your strategy. But your hard work over the last year or so could have a much greater impact on the near future than it does on this present moment. Be patient, even if you have more responsibilities now and fewer results to show for them. Your persistence is probably more important than anything else. Time is on your side if you're not in a hurry."
capricorn,2010-04-26,"It may feel as if the rules have been turned against you, but this is just a temporary misunderstanding. Even if others are resisting your efforts to do good work, don't focus your attention on them. Instead of increasing interpersonal tension, concentrate on your long-term goals. Contributing in a positive manner is more useful than engaging in an ego battle with anyone who might stand in your way."
aquarius,2010-04-26,"You aren't happy when complicated political or financial forces appear to conspire against you. Your innovative ideas often put you out in front of the pack and now you may be so far ahead that it feels like you're being pulled back toward the center. It's natural for you to question and resist authority, but don't exhaust yourself today in a losing struggle. Demonstrate your intelligence by choosing your battles carefully."
pisces,2010-04-26,"Relationships may be the primary source of frustration these days as someone attempts to exert control over you. Your need to express your individuality is strong and a friend or partner doesn't seem to understand what's motivating you. The more pressure you feel from others, the more likely you are to do something totally unexpected. Talking about your desires today is a smarter strategy than acting out your suppressed emotions in an extreme way."
aries,2010-04-27,"Although you try to remain unbiased, you do know what you want and your feelings continue to intensify throughout the day. At first, the graceful Libra Moon assists in your process of finding equilibrium but you are unable to hold on to a detached point of view once it enters Scorpio. Be willing to let go of your previous expectations in order to make room for something new to enter your life."
taurus,2010-04-27,"There could be a return to normalcy, with the Moon's visit to your 6th House of Daily Routine. Although you know that there are big changes unfolding at work, your smartest strategy is to simply do your job today without getting caught up in the big picture. It's impossible for you to know how everything will play out in the long run, so concentrate on keeping things as stable as you can for now."
gemini,2010-04-27,"You are of mixed emotions now when it comes to someone you like. On one hand, you can see the benefits of pursuing a friendship or a romantic relationship. But on the other hand, you know it's less complicated to keep your feelings to yourself. Instead of spending so much time analyzing what your next move should be, just listen to your instincts and follow what's in your heart."
cancer,2010-04-27,"It might feel as if someone is working behind the scenes to get you to do something that will benefit others more than you. Unfortunately, your resistance may appear selfish, even if you believe that you're doing the right thing. Don't be afraid to stand up for your needs; if you don't take care of yourself then you won't have much left over to give anyone else."
leo,2010-04-27,"Your creative power is strong, enabling you to manifest your intentions without encountering too many obstacles today. Nevertheless, your success will still require a fair amount of effort on your part. But it's not about putting on a performance for anyone else; you must sincerely be committed to work for what you want now in order to achieve success."
virgo,2010-04-27,"You may believe that you have a balanced approached to your finances now, but you could be misled by your own ideals. You might still see blue sky in your mind, even if in reality dark clouds obscure your vision. Positive thinking is normally a useful tool, but today it's more important to acknowledge things as they are and not as you want them to be. There is power in simply knowing the truth."
libra,2010-04-27,"Today, others might see you as more ambivalent than you truly are. And it's true that you're quite capable of understanding both sides of the current situation. Nevertheless, you still may have a distinct preference about what's happening, but you recognize that it's smarter to keep your opinions to yourself until you know what everyone else is thinking."
scorpio,2010-04-27,"You have more going on in your imagination today than anyone could possibly guess. Fortunately, you are able to hide your fantasies from everyone else without too much effort, but keeping your secrets will become more difficult as the day unfolds. Ultimately, your actions could give away your real feelings, especially if you've grown tired of pretending everything is okay when it's not. Letting the truth out little by little is wiser now than doing it all at once."
sagittarius,2010-04-27,"If you don't share your plans early in the day, it may become too much of a challenge to say anything at all. You know where you want things to go and are tempted to manipulate a situation in order to reach your goals. It's simple when you're just telling someone about an abstract idea, but it gets more complicated as you grow more attached to the outcome. Remaining open to whatever happens is a smart idea, but might not be as easy as it sounds."
capricorn,2010-04-27,"You can be quite strategic in your planning today, for your professional objectives are clear and you'll do whatever it takes to reach your destination. But nothing is as straightforward as it initially seems and as the day progresses you are required to balance your own needs with the needs of your friends and associates. Don't assume that your dreams are in line with everyone's. Nevertheless, continue to clarify your ambitions and work steadily to attain your goals."
aquarius,2010-04-27,"You are able to see the benefits along with the potential pitfalls of your current plan, but negative thoughts won't deter you from trying to get ahead now. At first, your friends might wonder if you're playing a game, but as the plot thickens they realize how important your success is to you at this time. Don't back down just because you're worried about what everyone else thinks. For now, persistence is your best guarantee of success."
pisces,2010-04-27,"Your performance at work today makes your friends see how determined you are, but you have more going on than meets the eye. Although they might think you are trying to impress them, you are actually pushing yourself to accomplish as much as you can while you still feel in control. Keep in mind that although everything seems to be very intense, you have a couple of weeks to organize yourself before the window of opportunity begins to close."
aries,2010-04-28,"You may talk about subjects today that you normally avoid, but the Full Moon in your 8th House of Deep Sharing seems to remove some of your fears. Although you are usually more comfortable doing something than discussing it, you're eager to learn from what others think about your point of view now. Don't fall into the trap of trying to convince anyone that you're right. Instead, express your feelings and listen to the feedback you receive."
taurus,2010-04-28,"Uncomfortable feelings that were previously hidden from your view can be revealed now, as the passionate Scorpio Full Moon illuminates your 7th House of Relationships. You might not understand why you are being pushed to your limit today, but it seems like there's no way to avoid talking about an obvious problem. However, keep in mind that it's more important to experience your emotions than to rationalize them."
gemini,2010-04-28,"Although you seem to be pretty sure of yourself now, someone's grandstanding at work could throw you for a loop. You would prefer that everyone get along, yet the Full Moon in your 6th House of Efficiency today could be an obstacle to productivity by focusing your attention on little things that don't really matter in the long run. Instead of sharing your concerns with anyone at this point, just try to do the best you can without worrying that someone else might get all the credit."
cancer,2010-04-28,"Your friends might think that you're making a big deal out of nothing today as the Full Moon brightens your 5th House of Self-Expression. But in your opinion, you're just telling it like you see it, without embellishing anything. Apparently there are two very different interpretations of what's happening now and there's no easy way to determine a base line for a reality check. Forget about trying to decide who is right or wrong because there won't be any winners if you get lost in an argument."
leo,2010-04-28,The fixed Scorpio Full Moon reflects your awareness of personal issues as she activates your 4th House of Home and Family. But work-related responsibilities could prevent you from spending sufficient time now with your loved ones. Be careful about allowing your anger to leak into your interactions with others who are not directly connected to your private world. Getting stuck in your own negativity can be avoided by expressing your frustration without blaming anyone else.
virgo,2010-04-28,The Sun's conjunction with your key planet Mercury in your 9th House of Big Ideas can set you on a wild goose chase today as you prematurely try to nail down specifics. But your logic isn't sufficient now as the emotional Scorpio Full Moon illuminates your 3rd House of Communication. You may think that you have all the answers until you apply what you know -- and then you suddenly realize that the most important things are beyond language.
libra,2010-04-28,"You may feel overly protective of your personal possessions today as the resourceful Scorpio Full Moon falls in your 2nd House of Money. You might even take your concerns so far that you feel like hoarding what you currently have. But putting energy into your worries can act like a self-fulfilling prophecy. Instead, be as generous to your friends as you want them to treat you. The Golden Rule really is a sensible strategy for you now."
scorpio,2010-04-28,"The magnetism of today's Full Moon in your sign can add stress to any conversation, challenging you to process your feelings instead of getting stuck in them. Someone may rub you the wrong way and your reaction can be so strong now that your emotions spill over where you don't want them. Ultimately, it's your choice. You can project your annoyance onto others or you can take the high road and express compassion instead of anger."
sagittarius,2010-04-28,"Your key planet Jupiter plays a significant role in today's Full Moon that brightens your 12th House of Imagination. Expansive Jupiter intensifies your fantasies, making it more difficult for you to take what a co-worker says at face value. Instead of simply listening to the facts, you fill in the missing information with your dreams. Don't take yourself too seriously; although you certainly inspire others now, you can also set yourself up for disappointment."
capricorn,2010-04-28,"It's tough to keep your feelings in perspective now for you may be blindly optimistic one moment and quite fearful the next. The intense Scorpio Full Moon in your 11th House of Long-Term Goals evokes your certainty, whether the pendulum is swinging toward the positive or negative side of the cycle. Instead of panicking and thinking that you must choose one or the other, keep reminding yourself to wait until the seesaw stops before making your final decision."
aquarius,2010-04-28,"You may be overly concerned with getting ahead today since the stormy Scorpio Moon illuminates your 10th House of Status. But before you push harder to reach your goals, it might be a smart idea to examine your motives. If other people's successes stir feelings of envy, you would be wise to withdraw from any competition and set a course based upon your own ambitions, rather than engaging in a contest to prove your superiority."
pisces,2010-04-28,"You have a clear idea about what you want to do and might not be willing to negotiate with anyone. Unfortunately, today's Full Moon in your 9th House of Adventure tempts you to overextend your reach, especially because she aspects boundless Jupiter in your sign. Being realistic now doesn't come naturally, for you see the potential everywhere you look. Fortunately, you can obtain a better perspective by consulting your friends or co-workers for advice, so don't be afraid to ask."
aries,2010-04-29,"You are eager to show others how easygoing you can be now, but it quickly becomes apparent that it's not as simple as you wish. Your desire to please someone you like can lead you astray as you unsuccessfully try one thing after another. Instead of coming across with clear intentions, you may seem scattered unless you find a way to reclaim your sense of self and express it from the inside out."
taurus,2010-04-29,"Your key planet Venus is adding to your woes today as she distracts you from what you should be doing. The love planet can be quite enticing as she draws your attention to something new each time you become too comfortable with what you already have. Luckily, you can shift gears by changing your goal from reaching immediate pleasure to concentrating on the distant horizon."
gemini,2010-04-29,"You like to daydream where your next lovely experience will take you, but a serious commitment now could prevent you from following your heart's desire. Perhaps it's more important today for you to create a deep and meaningful experience instead of just another interesting diversion. Fortunately, you should be able to enjoy yourself while also strengthening the intimate bond between you and someone very special."
cancer,2010-04-29,"This can be a very satisfying day for you because you can express your feelings without seeming so needy that others want to retreat. In fact, your ability to love is currently based upon your need for freedom. It's one thing to ask for a bit of elbowroom now, but it still can be tricky to balance it with intimacy and security."
leo,2010-04-29,"You are struggling to find a balance between your head and your heart today. Unfortunately, your need to reach satisfaction can add another layer of difficulty to your list of things to do. Fortunately, you are up for the task and could be a formidable force as you get closer to your goal. Don't let yourself be sidetracked by all the little things that could still bother you throughout the day."
virgo,2010-04-29,"You have something very significant to share with a close friend or lover now, but it's difficult to know how to get started. However, once you do get the ball rolling, there's a very different problem as you ponder the uncertainties of romantic attraction and wonder how to turn it off. Although you are going through an emotional phase, try not to take yourself so seriously today. An uncommitted approach makes a lot more sense than attempting to obtain something that remains out of reach."
libra,2010-04-29,"The Moon's move through your 2nd House of Values raises questions about who you are, where you are going and what you want to do once you get there. But the answers to your existential questions may not be so forthcoming today. Fortunately, you aren't being asked to defend your point of view. Instead, just incorporate your new perspective into your current beliefs and move on."
scorpio,2010-04-29,"You want everyone to know how much integrity you have, even if it means that you must struggle with some very tough issues today. But it's not easy for you to tell anyone how you feel because words seem shallow and do not express your experience. Nevertheless, verbal communication may have to suffice, for it's still the best way you have to interact with others now."
sagittarius,2010-04-29,"You are coming to the end of an intensely emotional period and it's a smart idea to tie up as many loose ends as you can. Soon you will start a new project, but you aren't out of the woods on the previous one yet. The Moon's entry into your sign tonight can remind you of the instability of your changing needs. Even if you are uncomfortable with basing a long-term decision on your fluctuating feelings, they are still more trustworthy now than your logical analysis."
capricorn,2010-04-29,"You need to make a choice today between mature love that is based on honoring your commitments and a more spontaneous type of expression. Although you are often drawn toward a conservative approach, holding back now doesn't lead to increased stability. Paradoxically, exercising your freedom may be the most important tool you have in your ongoing search for creativity and fun."
aquarius,2010-04-29,"It's apparently your turn to show off your brilliance today and you have no intention of being a shrinking violet. But your creative genius isn't reliable and you might find the spotlight shining on you while you have nothing to say. Don't try to fake it by pretending to share what's on your mind while actually hiding your true thoughts. Once you become comfortable with the idea of opening up, then the resistance to being seen begins to fade."
pisces,2010-04-29,"You have a magical aura that wraps around you today, wherever you go. This energetic layer is powered by your imagination and it is only as strong as your current belief in yourself. Don't let logic or reality spoil your dreams. If you believe that anything is possible, then you won't be limited by restrictive rules or your own self-doubt."
aries,2010-04-30,"It's amazing how quickly a complicated situation can resolve into a much simpler one. You may feel quite a bit better now, but don't fool yourself into believing that you're home free. Your current relief may largely be from the improving circumstances, but some denial could also contribute to your positive state of mind. Remember, avoiding a crucial issue can feel good for a while, but it's not the same thing as really solving a problem."
taurus,2010-04-30,"Normally you know what is true because you trust your senses. But it's difficult for you to settle down today because somehow you know more than you actually perceive. Logically, you can convince yourself not to take the leap beyond the real world, but in your heart you still believe your intuition. Ultimately, you'll feel better once you open your mind and give yourself permission to dream."
gemini,2010-04-30,"You may be uncomfortable with your feelings today and attempt to hide them from someone close to you, but this doesn't mean that you are antisocial now. Paradoxically, your easygoing banter could encourage others to believe that you are being more revealing than you actually are. Even if you are clever enough to fool everyone else, be careful about going so far that you also fool yourself."
cancer,2010-04-30,You can come across as someone with a sweeping vision today. Your associates at work are eager to place their trust in you because it seems as if your feet are placed solidly on the ground. But you may not be as sensible now as you appear. It's best to be honest and let others know that there are still a lot of details missing from your plan.
leo,2010-04-30,"Although you may be able to take the high road today, you are also in touch with something that bothers you enough to make you angry. Fortunately, you can stave off negativity for now by concentrating on your spiritual beliefs instead of being sabotaged by your own emotions. But the power of positive thinking alone isn't enough to permanently put things back in order. You will have to follow up with decisive actions or your good intentions will be for naught."
virgo,2010-04-30,"You may be stressing over issues that seem significant now, yet ultimately won't matter in the long run. You want to resolve the conflict, but the specifics of the situation are not as important as you believe. Too much information can make you anxious because you want to focus on the bigger picture. Unfortunately, it's always a challenge for you to let go of the details. Remember, the real issue today is simply about balancing your perspectives."
libra,2010-04-30,"You have high hopes about doing many things today, but you may be unrealistic in your analysis of what you can actually accomplish. Your current ability to complete your list of ambitious chores is complicated by a higher-than-usual level of creativity that you don't want to waste. Naturally, you would rather be artsy and crafty, but now you might just have to fulfill your responsibilities before you follow your muse."
scorpio,2010-04-30,"You are being asked to maintain a high level of integrity today, and yet it's challenging to convince everyone else what's really important. Each person that is involved with you and your work has a different idea about what is necessary. Unfortunately, others may be unwilling to listen to what you have to say, making your job extra tough now. Things will improve if you keep your eyes on the final goal."
sagittarius,2010-04-30,"You are more flexible today than you usually are, but this doesn't mean that you're wishy-washy. In fact, if someone at work pushes you too hard, you may become quite stubborn with respect to how you are doing your job. But don't allow your know-it-all attitude to convince you that it's okay to tell others what to do. Instead, let each person find his or her own way."
capricorn,2010-04-30,"It's hard for you to let go of your fears, but reality is offering you an opportunity to learn how to deepen your trust in that which is beyond your five senses. The veil between worlds has become thinner and you may see things now, even when your eyes are closed. Usually you do well when you rely on the facts; today, you'll do even better if you use your imagination, too."
aquarius,2010-04-30,"Messages are coming to you today in symbolic form and you may have to step out of your comfort zone to receive them. Pay careful attention to your friends and associates for clues. They will be guiding you, even if they seem to have nothing to say. You'll have to listen with your heart to hear what's going on beneath the surface."
pisces,2010-04-30,You are on automatic pilot today as you express your desire to take care of others. But this isn't about any sort of verbal disclosure on your part; rather it's about what you do. You're not interested in discussing your intentions now. Stop thinking and take direct action before you talk yourself out of a perfectly fine plan.
aries,2010-05-01,"You have grown bored with an aspect of your daily routine and are tempted to do something about it. However, if you truly want to make a change that matters, don't succumb to your emotions today or you may regret your actions sooner than you think. It's wiser now to set long-term goals instead of forcing an issue for short-term gratification."
taurus,2010-05-01,"You may be a bit too idealistic for your own good today. It's not that you shouldn't aim high; it's just that you could set yourself up for failure if you lose sight of what you can really accomplish. Don't try to shift the blame to anyone else if you fail to reach your goals. Meanwhile, keep in mind that there isn't necessarily anything wrong with your execution; it's just that you might have reached too far."
gemini,2010-05-01,"The Moon is in your 7th House of Relationships today, shining the emotional spotlight on everyone except you. However, the real lessons come from confronting your own feelings, rather than unconsciously projecting them on to those around you. Keep in mind that it would be wise to acknowledge your reactions as your own. Your response to what happens will ultimately be more significant than what other people say to you."
cancer,2010-05-01,"You often err on the side of caution, but today you're tempted to say ""Yes, I can"" before you think about how you're actually going to do it. Be careful or you might find yourself in an awkward position of backtracking. Don't be overly concerned if you need to renegotiate promises made earlier in the day. It's better to step up to the plate as soon as you realize you won't make your mark. No one will be able to find fault with you as long as you are honest and give it your best shot."
leo,2010-05-01,"You have excess energy that has nowhere to go today. If you don't find a way to express it in a positive manner, it could sneak up on you and prompt you to lose your temper. However, participating in competitive sports, going on a long hike or exercising at the gym will help to take the edge off your day."
virgo,2010-05-01,"Normally, you're the one who has plenty of common sense, but you appear to have temporarily lost your good judgment. You may feel as if your visionary approach is exactly what's needed now, but it really doesn't matter how many ways you can justify your plans. Others won't support your ideas if they aren't practical so reexamine your strategy before saying anything."
libra,2010-05-01,"It's challenging for you to relax today because you want to catch up on all the little things you've recently let slide. But even your good intentions may not be enough to shift you into gear. Although you know what you need to accomplish, you might resent the fact that you have to be productive now. If you decide to put off doing chores, at least make smart use of your time by allowing yourself to get the rest you need."
scorpio,2010-05-01,"You may be developing your plan to spend money on something you wanted for a while. Now that the purchase date is getting closer, it's time for you to do a first round of research. You have probably set high expectations and you might be surprised at how much everything costs. Don't worry because practicality will ultimately win out over fantasy and you'll be able to get what you need."
sagittarius,2010-05-01,"You may feel overly vulnerable today because everyone seems to know how you are doing before you say a word. The Sagittarius Moon is in your 1st House of Personality, setting your emotions right out in the open for all to see. Instead of worrying about what others are thinking of you now, be open to the simple idea of being recognized for who you truly are. There is no need to hide; being yourself is your greatest strength."
capricorn,2010-05-01,"You might want to escape for a while today and it's actually a good idea. You spend enough time handling business and being responsible in your day-to-day life. Now, if you dream about taking time for yourself or going off to play with friends, don't judge yourself harshly. All work and no play isn't a smart way to live; it's healthier to acknowledge your desires and give yourself permission to relax and unwind."
aquarius,2010-05-01,"Today can be a very social day for you, though you'll also need a bit of downtime at home. The friendly Sagittarius Moon is in your 11th House of Friends while the steady Taurus Sun is in your 4th House of Security. Finding a balance between the two can be a challenge, yet it's important not to overdo either extreme. As attracted as you may be to having fun now, don't push your limits. If you do, you may need to compensate by withdrawing from activities tomorrow just to recuperate."
pisces,2010-05-01,"It's easy to take charge today, for you intuitively know what needs to happen next. Events could unfold so smoothly that you grow overconfident and assume more authority than is necessary. Be careful of taking on too much because you could wear yourself out trying to keep up with your commitments. Leave time for some fun or your disappointment can sour the progress that you already made."
aries,2010-05-02,"You are driven toward success now, but you may not be ready to make all the sacrifices required to accomplish your objectives. Still, you could do your share of deep soul-searching today as you consider narrowing your ambitions by setting aside some of the less realistic parts of your plan. It's crucial to be pragmatic, but don't let anyone talk you out of your vision. Hold on to your core beliefs, even while they are being honed in the fire of everyday practice."
taurus,2010-05-02,You might resist the efforts of others to get you to join in an activity that's not interesting to you today. You may tell them that you already have your mind made up and you know what you want to do. But the truth is that you could be talking tougher than you actually feel. There's no need to let your ego get in the way. Don't be afraid to admit that you might be willing to change your mind.
gemini,2010-05-02,"It's easy for you to appear as if everything is fine, but you're not sharing your secrets today. You may be holding on to some very strong feelings because you are afraid that telling all could provoke negative consequences. Unfortunately, your strategy might backfire because others can sense that you're withholding something important. Even if you don't just blurt the truth out into the open now, keep in mind that there's no reason to hide it either."
cancer,2010-05-02,"You can easily get sucked into someone's emotional drama today as the Moon joins potent Pluto in your 7th House of Partners. Although it may feel as if it's not really your issue, the intensity of your reaction suggests otherwise. Fortunately, you may be sufficiently grounded now, enabling you to engage in a rational dialogue without being overwhelmed. Nevertheless, give yourself enough time to process any confusion that you feel."
leo,2010-05-02,"Just when you believe that you know exactly what is real, the ground shifts today and you may not be as sure as you were. On one hand, the practical Capricorn Moon and Taurus Sun can help to stabilize your daily routine, but strange things keep happening that remind you that there's something that you are missing or even avoiding. There's no need to change anything now; just remain open to previously unconsidered possibilities."
virgo,2010-05-02,"You don't know what to do with your emotions today because they seem too raw to express and you fear that they will be a bit much for others to handle. Although you want to be practical about it, don't be surprised if you spill the beans anyhow. You may start with just a small disclosure and work yourself into an agitated state. You'll be fine as long as you remember not to push for resolution now. The final answer will come on its own when the time is right."
libra,2010-05-02,"An uneasy pressure grows from a subtle feeling of insecurity that continues to build today until you stop what you are doing and deal with what's bothering you. It's tricky business because the cause of your current malaise may not be so obvious. Luckily, your willingness to talk about previously unexpressed emotions can help you move through this period of uncertainty."
scorpio,2010-05-02,"The Moon's conjunction with your key planet Pluto can heat up your emotional core. It's as if you are a volcano whose internal pressure has been increasing and it's a good idea to consider how to let the lava flow without waiting for an inevitable eruption. Take responsibility for your feelings without spewing them onto others. But remember that exerting too much self-control can intensify your emotions. When in doubt, choose the most practical approach for now."
sagittarius,2010-05-02,"You may feel as if the air has been let out of your balloon and you're losing altitude. Your recent inspiration bumps into the limitation of reality today, forcing you to reconsider your current strategy. Luckily, you won't likely crash to earth because the intensity of the current situation brings out your survival instincts, prompting you to concentrate your attention on finding a quick fix. First, deal with the immediate circumstances and then think about your long-term plans later."
capricorn,2010-05-02,"The Moon's conjunction with powerful Pluto in your 1st House of Personality can bring your emotions right to the surface today. Although you may be saying something that others have already heard, your delivery is more intense now. Unfortunately, you can overwhelm someone unless you tone down your message. A bit of self-restraint will go a long way toward establishing a fruitful dialogue."
aquarius,2010-05-02,You may want to go into hiding today as your patience with others runs out. You're not interested in explaining your motives or defending your recent choices. It's your right to explore your uncertainties on your own and not under someone else's critical eye. Don't worry about facing your own shadow now; you will be better off for having searched your soul for answers.
pisces,2010-05-02,"You may feel somewhat disillusioned today as austere Saturn aspects your key planet Neptune, removing the brightest colors from your dreams. It's disconcerting at first if anger begins to replace hope, but you can control how far this process goes. Instead of sliding into negativity, consciously reconnect with your vision. Don't let your fear of failure get in the way of living out your highest potential."
aries,2010-05-03,"You appear to be all business now as you discuss your plans in a very down-to-earth manner. And although you can keep up the serious dialogue for a while, sooner or later you'll get bored with talk about work, money, and other practical issues. You have a busy week ahead of you, yet you're already scheming of ways to have some fun. Nevertheless, it's smarter to concentrate on your responsibilities before you go out and play."
taurus,2010-05-03,"Retrograde Mercury in your sign may be creating its share of delays but today you are determined to make progress in spite of circumstances beyond your control. Managing your anger may take all your concentration if others get in your way. Still, your determination is stronger than usual, giving you the willpower to overcome a variety of obstacles."
gemini,2010-05-03,"You are spending more time in the realm of fantasy than others realize because you are able to hide your mental meanderings behind a smokescreen of witty conversation. Your special skill of being in two places at once allows you to interact with those around you while still actively daydreaming. But your inner world isn't just about escaping from reality, for it supplies you with the interesting stories and clever thoughts that everyone has come to expect from you."
cancer,2010-05-03,"You may be getting tired of hearing about everyone else's issues, especially if you have something on your mind that you would like to share with a friend. But if there doesn't seem to be enough time for you to bring up your concerns now, you might need to reconsider your tactics. The bottom line is that it's up to you today to change the topic of discussion to include your feelings; no one else is going to do it for you."
leo,2010-05-03,"Your words carry more weight today than you realize, so use them with care. Even if your intentions are honorable, you may be withholding anger that can leak out of your subconscious and into a conversation. Instead of being committed to speak the whole truth and nothing but the truth as you see it, try tempering your honesty with kindness. It will make everyone feel better in the long run."
virgo,2010-05-03,"Your key planet Mercury may be thwarting your plans these days as it retrogrades through your 9th House of Big Ideas. But your creativity is so strong today that even trickster Mercury won't get in your way. You may need to slow down and become very deliberate while dealing with details that have unraveled, but the light at the end of the tunnel will continue to grow brighter as long as you stay on track."
libra,2010-05-03,"You may be a bit discouraged because the finer things in life don't seem within reach today. It might even appear as if your boss or partner is preventing you from achieving your goals. Although you aren't willing to put up with someone's false authority, letting go of your need to be in charge may be your best move. Once you remove the pressure of being in control, pleasure may be closer than you expect."
scorpio,2010-05-03,"You see no reason to withhold information today as Mercury the Messenger slips into the shadowy world of Pluto to recover the truth. But saying too much can create more problems than it solves. What's most important is that you know the score. However, it's not a good idea to push your agenda; everyone else will find out when the time is right."
sagittarius,2010-05-03,"Although you may not feel ready to go back to work today, there are critical tasks to be completed and you should not delay doing them. Don't take your anger out on anyone else if you are annoyed at yourself for leaving things until the last minute. Just accept your current predicament and get busy; the sooner you start, the more time you'll have to finish the job."
capricorn,2010-05-03,"Your mind is like a proverbial steel trap today; whatever facts you catch will be retained and deliberately integrated into your overall plan. Although your aggressive behavior could put others off, they will still be impressed with your accurate perceptions and sound thinking. You can make things easier on yourself by realizing that you still have time to achieve your goals without hurrying. Paradoxically, slowing down will land you at your destination faster."
aquarius,2010-05-03,"Although you can think on your feet, advanced planning is quite useful now and will help you succeed. You have strengths that others don't truly appreciate and they can be used to your advantage. But you may be more effective at getting things done today by underplaying your hand so you don't arouse unnecessary opposition. Once resistance is provoked, sheer determination becomes your best tool. Don't give up; your persistence will bring positive results."
pisces,2010-05-03,"You aren't interested in trying to do something on your own today. You would prefer to be part of a group effort and share the success with others on your team. However, you may be happily surprised at the intense level of support you now receive from your friends and workmates. Keep in mind that it's a reflection of your firm commitment to them. Accept the help that's offered; you've earned it and you deserve it."
aries,2010-05-04,"Your key planet Mars has you all fired up today and you are eager to do something fun. Unfortunately, you might not be able to exercise your independence as much as you wish due to previous commitments. If you get angry with yourself because you didn't plan ahead, make sure that you don't try to shift the blame to anyone else."
taurus,2010-05-04,"Your current discomfort with a friend or family member has probably been growing for a while. You might be tempted to get it all out in the open today, but it's challenging to keep your feelings under control once you bring up the topic for discussion. Even if you know that self-restraint is wise, you don't want to lose the opportunity to play the cards that you've been dealt. Still, it's a good idea to work off some of your aggression physically before sitting down to talk things out."
gemini,2010-05-04,"You could reach the end of your rope today, but running out of patience isn't your most serious problem. Your biggest concern is what to do with your unexpressed anger or resentment. Getting into an argument with a close friend might be the easiest path to follow, but it won't help you solve any of the underlying issues. Rather than disagreeing with everyone just because you're in a bad mood, think about what's at the source of your current negativity and talk about that instead."
cancer,2010-05-04,"Although you may be stressed by a lack of money, pressure from friends and an overly hectic schedule, you are able to maintain a sense of balance throughout most of the day. Be careful if you finally give in to the stress, for it could feel overwhelming. Your smartest strategy now is to continue on your same path without making any rash decisions or sudden moves. Things should begin to settle back down starting tomorrow."
leo,2010-05-04,"It's crucial now for you to work off your excess energy any way you can. Feisty Mars in your active sign is being challenged by the Sun in stubborn Taurus, tying your nerves up in knots. If you don't keep moving, you'll feel stuck and may end up losing your temper. If you remain flexible in your attitude, the pressures of the day won't get to you as much."
virgo,2010-05-04,It's often difficult for you to act on your feelings; it's easier for you to express yourself verbally. But intellectual communication isn't enough right now; you need more. Don't wait until your frustration level is so high that you want to scream. Take a calculated risk and push through your fears before your emotions overpower your rational perspective.
libra,2010-05-04,"It's easy for you to surprise your friends today by doing something out of character. Your desires can be a bit unorthodox now, but what's most shocking is that you may actually take a chance and express what you want, even if you know that others might not approve. Ultimately, it doesn't really matter whether or not you reach satisfaction; what's important is that you are willing to try."
scorpio,2010-05-04,"You may be provoked to express what you've been holding back since your traditional ruling planet Mars is rather stressed today. You may feel as if your status is being threatened, but the situation isn't likely as dire as it seems. Standing up for your integrity is one thing, but lashing out at someone who isn't even aware of what they did is something else. Be decisive and focus your intentions on your goals, rather than falling into the vicious cycle of chasing after your emotions."
sagittarius,2010-05-04,"You may need to be extra clear today about what's important to you because someone at work might otherwise misinterpret your behavior. You could inadvertently offend a workmate as something you do appears more cavalier than intended. Of course, you could be more cautious and monitor your actions all day, but you're still likely to slip with an impulsive reaction. Don't be afraid to apologize for contributing to a misunderstanding, but then drop it and move on."
capricorn,2010-05-04,"You are not likely to get caught up in a maelstrom of anger or other negative emotions today, even though you are sensitive to those who are struggling around you. You understand the source of the problem, yet quickly realize that there's nothing you can do to fix it. The best strategy for helping others now is to remain unflappable while you express yourself in a calm and collected matter without succumbing to fear."
aquarius,2010-05-04,"Keeping secrets isn't your strong suit and trying to remain silent today, without sharing what you know, can fuel your anxiety. When you finally decide to open up, how you do it may be more crucial than what you actually say. You'll be tempted to turn your disclosure into a performance, dramatizing your position. But you'll be better off if you share what's on your mind in a matter-of-fact manner and then get on with what you must do next."
pisces,2010-05-04,"You are quite rational when it comes to setting long-term goals today, but have a harder time maintaining your laid-back approach as you manage your day-to-day affairs. You may feel as if someone is trying to control you, and your tendency is to disengage by escaping into your fantasies. However, it's important to set clear boundaries now. Don't avoid confrontation if it's necessary, for you might need to get angry in the process of defending your rights."
aries,2010-05-05,"You may be spending a lot of time today thinking about your future, but you could be stuck in a routine that's tough to break. Imagining what you're going to do next is much easier than putting your ideas into motion. Don't try to talk yourself into taking direct action now; that will come soon enough. Instead, consider the pros and cons of each possible choice without becoming attached to any single goal. Your current analysis will pay off when you're ready to make your move."
taurus,2010-05-05,"You may be certain that you know what to do about a job-related problem today, but the situation could be more fluid than you realize. Even if your plan is solid, it won't necessarily work unless you're willing to modify it in response to the unfolding events. Unfortunately, your lack of flexibility can stand between you and success. Instead of defending your original idea, be open to feedback and make revisions as needed."
gemini,2010-05-05,"You are eager to do something special today, even if you must also keep up with your regular obligations. Luckily, you might just be able to pull off doing both. However, your quick wit and wagging tongue could get you in trouble now as you say something very casually that someone takes the wrong way. Remember, you don't need to have the last word in every conversation. Sometimes it's smarter to remain silent even if you know you're right."
cancer,2010-05-05,You may feel misunderstood today and could get into a heated argument with a close friend or partner. It might seem as if your friends who should be supporting you are now ambivalent or even working against you. But a general lack of patience on everyone's part could feed your insecurities and turn a simple mistake into an outright squabble. Change the dynamics by letting others know how you feel instead of trying to convince them you are right.
leo,2010-05-05,"You might be surprised when you realize that a current disagreement is a repeat performance. It's more than a deja vu; you have had this discussion before and the fact that it resurfaces now is an indication that the issue isn't yet resolved. Unfortunately, you won't likely reach a mutual understanding today either, so don't push for a quick fix. Conclusion to this discussion cannot be forced; it will come naturally on its own."
virgo,2010-05-05,"You know what you must do today and you are resigned to hold up your end of the deal, even if your heart isn't in it. Fortunately, you are able to keep your thoughts to yourself and go through the required motions very effectively. But there is a price to pay because the high level of stress can tire you out. Don't wait until you are exhausted to take a break and get the rest you need."
libra,2010-05-05,"Although you are able to maintain an easygoing attitude today, you may be hiding your anger out of respect for someone else. You don't want to rock the boat and attract the spotlight; you prefer to transform your emotions into creatively supporting others. Luckily, you are able to downplay any negativity now because you truly believe that you're doing the right thing."
scorpio,2010-05-05,"You can become a bit self-righteous when you know that you have arrived at the correct answer to a difficult question. At first, it's a matter of proudly explaining your solution to others, but it could turn nasty if someone who has arrived at a different conclusion decides to push back. A conflict now might act like a brushfire, sparking new eruptions and then settling back down. When you accept that multiple points of view are truly possible, the fire will go out from a lack of fuel."
sagittarius,2010-05-05,"It's difficult for others to work with you today if you are overly rigid about your schedule. Unfortunately, you might not even realize how bullheaded you are now; you could actually believe that you are being flexible. The proof is in how well you are getting along with your co-workers. If you sense hostility, rest assured that it will dissipate if you can yield to someone else's needs."
capricorn,2010-05-05,"You may be fearful that there isn't enough time to complete the work at hand. Or perhaps you're worried that you won't have enough money to meet your present commitments. But even if your concerns are justified, it's helpful if you can replace some of your apprehension with hope and trust. Have faith, but don't forget to also balance it with a touch of realism."
aquarius,2010-05-05,"The Moon's return to your sign isn't making your life easier now, for you would rather not have your feelings get in the way of an already tough situation. Your ability to solve problems is usually strengthened by your logical approach. But even if you have already thought about your options, your current desires are messing with your rational style. Don't discount your emotions because they can teach you a lesson you might otherwise miss."
pisces,2010-05-05,"It's challenging for you to fit in at work today because you really don't want everyone to know how different you feel. You might choose to be an outsider now, but withdrawing from others will just bring the attention you're trying to avoid. Your co-workers might ask you direct questions about the very thing you're wishing to keep secret. Don't worry; you have the right to remain silent and hide until you're ready to come out from behind the curtain."
aries,2010-05-06,"You might try to minimize the importance of having your finances in order, but your beliefs about the power of intention won't pay the rent. Although there may be abundance in the universe, it isn't going to provide for you now unless you remain focused and work hard. Pay attention, for a unique opportunity could come your way, testing your resolve to stay on track. Even if it looks promising, a little extra caution today makes good sense."
taurus,2010-05-06,"Although you may be required to respond to a stressful situation at work, you also need to carve out some personal time for yourself. Your motivation for a bit of peace and quiet now is not for relaxation; instead, you want to think about what's coming up for you in the future. Unfortunately, with your current job-related pressures, you'll need to schedule a mini-retreat away from it all. Fortunately, even an hour or so should be enough to reconnect with your dreams."
gemini,2010-05-06,"In spite of your hectic day, you can find time to make a pleasant connection with a friend. But it's hard for you to stay in the present moment now; you are eager to talk about exciting plans for the weekend -- or your wish that you had something special to do. Luckily, an unexpected invitation might catch you by surprise and make your day. Don't turn it down because this opportunity could very well lead to more good fortune."
cancer,2010-05-06,"You may not be happy about a complex situation in your immediate environment, but there's no apparent way for you to avoid it. Still, you aren't eager to talk about your feelings because you fear that your words will be taken the wrong way. Don't say anything that could complicate things even further; your silence won't make the problem go away, but at least it won't make it any worse."
leo,2010-05-06,"Warrior Mars has been in your sign since last October and now you may be growing weary of having to do battle with the outer world. Although Mars doesn't leave your sign until June, at least you can see the light at the end of the tunnel. Even if you don't feel like you're making much progress yet, trust your instincts as you sense that your work over the previous months will soon begin to pay off."
virgo,2010-05-06,"You might try an original method to get your work done today, yet it might not be as successful as you wish. It's not a smart idea to become overly attached to your plan now until it proves worthwhile. Your untried techniques are experimental; you could make a breakthrough or you could end up just wasting time. If your new approach isn't working, drop it and return to the tried and true way."
libra,2010-05-06,"You may be proud of your social networking skills, yet you still might feel like an outsider today. You want to be accepted by others, yet you choose to do things that demonstrate your independence rather than thinking with a group mentality. Don't be afraid to dance to the beat of your own drum. However, consider the consequences of your non-conformist activities before you undermine the progress you have already made."
scorpio,2010-05-06,"Maintaining a sense of humor could be very helpful as you respond to a weird situation at work today. But you'll need to be careful about what you say, for others might not see things the same way you do. What strikes you as curious, or even bizarre, can easily go unnoticed by everyone else. You believe that your sarcasm will be received in the playful manner you intended, yet your wit may miss the mark. Go ahead and smile at the irony of it all, but keep your comments to yourself."
sagittarius,2010-05-06,"You may be pulled between two different approaches to work today because you can see the wisdom in each method. On one hand, your motivation to finish your assignment as efficiently as possible suggests that you should limit your activities and stay focused on the details of your job. On the other hand, bountiful Jupiter tempts you to concentrate on your final goal, confident that the particulars will come together in time. In reality, neither extreme will work without balance from the other."
capricorn,2010-05-06,"It's natural for you to strive for excellence, even if only to avoid harsh judgments from others. But you have more than approval now riding on your success. There may be financial considerations at play, motivating you to demonstrate your considerable skills. However, you could become inhibited if you take yourself too seriously today, so aim high and trust that your best effort will be appreciated."
aquarius,2010-05-06,"If a friend or co-worker has been relentlessly pushing against your boundaries, you might have to get tough and set clear limits. But you are moodier than usual today and could lose your temper if you don't pay attention to what you need before it's too late. Think about what you want from the current situation before presenting your case. Take your time and remember that you don't have to overstate your feelings. Just tell it like it is."
pisces,2010-05-06,"You may feel as if you're approaching the end of a personal growth phase that's lasted several years. You've probably seen your share of unexpected changes and have adapted to the lack of stability. You derive benefits today from looking back and considering what you need to do before this powerful cycle draws to a close next month. Tie up loose ends now, so you are ready for what comes next."
aries,2010-05-07,"You may go through the day as if you were in a fog, but this won't necessarily have negative consequences. Fortunately, it seems as if luck is with you and you make the right choices, even if you aren't thinking very clearly. Venus, the planet of love, nuzzles up to fiery Mars, blessing your actions with the possibility of sweet delight. Nevertheless, it's not wise to push too hard for what you want; a gentle approach is more effective now than a forceful one."
taurus,2010-05-07,Your key planet Venus can befuddle you because she cleverly tempts you with one diversion after another today. It becomes increasingly difficult for you to follow through on what you started until something happens that requires you to pull yourself back on track with a new sense of determination. It's really up to you; you can get things accomplished once you accept that they will take longer to finish than you originally planned.
gemini,2010-05-07,"Your day might not go as expected, but you should be able to enjoy yourself anyhow. Unfortunately, you may not be very productive but you can catch up on your responsibilities next week once Mercury turns direct. For now, try to be mellow and find a middle-of-the-road course between having fun and, at least, doing enough to get by."
cancer,2010-05-07,"You may feel hypersensitive today, making it difficult for you to know whether or not to share your feelings. You might inadvertently turn a passing mood into a major event by speaking up when it's smarter to remain silent. On the other hand, you could miss an opportunity to have a positive impact on your day if you say nothing at all. Be prepared to flow with the currents no matter which course you choose."
leo,2010-05-07,"Expressing yourself in a creative way today can give you a wonderful feeling, even if you know that your satisfaction is fleeting. But it's not about producing a lasting work of art now; it's about doing something that reconnects you with a sense of contentment. Don't get distracted by waiting for approval from someone else. This one's for you."
virgo,2010-05-07,"Maybe you think that your feet are planted firmly on the ground and it's everyone else who is a bit flakey today. But you are in the Hall of Mirrors now, where it's challenging to differentiate the original object from its reflection. You can begin to change what's happening once you realize that your own uncertainty is coming back at you through the behavior of others."
libra,2010-05-07,"You have arrived at a fork in the road and you can see the pros and cons of each path. Nevertheless, the final decision isn't yours alone; other people's needs must be considered, too. Fortunately, you may be content with the lack of resolution, for you haven't yet fully clarified your preferences. But once the choice has been made, don't waste energy playing ""what if?"" games. Just move ahead confidently without wondering about the road not taken."
scorpio,2010-05-07,"The floodgates of your subconscious mind open wider today as waves of creative inspiration flow through you. Although this can produce fantastic results, you must be willing to ride the currents that arise from the far reaches of your imagination. Trust in the process of self-expression, for if you are uncertain about the outcome, you're liable to impede the flow without even realizing it."
sagittarius,2010-05-07,"It's often challenging for you to set limits and today it's even more difficult because your emotions defy definition. You would rather fly by the seat of your pants now and you'll probably be able to get away with this tactic until a situation grows so complicated that you are forced to regain control. But if you wait until things have gone too far, it won't be that easy to tighten the reins. The sooner you think about clarifying your boundaries, the easier it will be to set them."
capricorn,2010-05-07,"You have been working hard and now you're ready for a bit of relaxation. Fortunately, you should be able to take it easy today without sacrificing the gains you have already made. But this doesn't mean you'll be able to avoid your obligations; instead, you'll discover that you can get just as much accomplished at a slower pace and enjoy yourself more as you go along."
aquarius,2010-05-07,"You might feel as if you've lost your sharp edge today, but this is just another phase in your creative process. If you recently had an innovative idea, it may be time to relax your grip so it can develop naturally. Forcing the next step won't work, so it's smarter to let your plans gel at their own pace. Instead of concentrating on finding the answers now, allow them to come to you naturally."
pisces,2010-05-07,"The Moon's return to your sign can free you from the restraints of logic, enabling your imagination to express your brilliance. But it may not be easy to put your ideas into words today. Don't fret if you cannot describe your vision to anyone else now. Postponing the discussion for another day is a smart strategy because your actions will surely speak louder and clearer than anything you might say."
aries,2010-05-08,"You may have had your heart set on doing something with your friends that sounded like a lot of fun. But as the time draws closer, you might feel like bailing on your social plans and giving yourself some quiet time to escape. However, the universe won't necessarily support your intentions now. Whatever happens, you can still find peace of mind, even in the midst of a noisy party."
taurus,2010-05-08,"You may be fighting against your own emotions today because you don't want your friends to think that you're being negative. Perhaps you've been waiting for the right moment to tell them what's on your mind, yet it never seems like a good time. Now you could be annoyed that you haven't spoken your truth yet it's tempting to blame everyone except yourself. Take a deep breath and express your feelings without pointing your finger at anyone else."
gemini,2010-05-08,"You might be very susceptible to what your friends and family think you should be doing today. Although your desires may be quite different from their expectations, you aren't eager to create a scene over a disagreement now. But your frustration could express as anger now if you decide to do what others want instead of following your own heart. It's better to get your feelings out into the open than to let them stew in your own resentment."
cancer,2010-05-08,"Your dreams seem bigger than usual now and you continue to feed them with your fantasies throughout the day. But they could be so unrealistic that you have no way of integrating them into your everyday life. Nevertheless, your mental meanderings serve a definite purpose as they allow you to explore a variety of possibilities in front of you. Fortunately, you don't need to transform your vision into practice yet, as long as it guides you along your path."
leo,2010-05-08,"It might appear as if you know exactly what to say because your words have the desired effect on others today. But even if you have a plan, you are likely to set it aside once a conversation begins because you want to be fully present in the moment rather than following a script. Be willing to step into unknown territory, but beware that you probably won't end up where you expected."
virgo,2010-05-08,"It seems to be harder than usual for you to concentrate on the necessary details in order to make certain that what you're working on today doesn't fall apart. But you may be attempting to exert too much control over things that just don't matter in the long run. Paradoxically, you are freed to put your attention on more important issues if you don't waste time sweating the small stuff."
libra,2010-05-08,"Your dramatic attempts to show your friends how efficient you are might backfire if you try too hard. You would be better off adopting a more laid back approach today or you could seem desperate. Additionally, you are more likely to make an error in judgment now if you act under pressure. Give yourself more time and don't worry so much about what others think."
scorpio,2010-05-08,"It's just about impossible to predict how you will react when a close friend brings a problem to you today. You fully intend to be supportive, but might find your eagerness to help turns into resentment instead. However, if you pay careful attention to your feelings, you'll be able to process your frustration before it creates negative consequences."
sagittarius,2010-05-08,"You might need a quiet day at home, away from your regular responsibilities. But even if you try to schedule your weekend so that you have plenty of downtime, don't be surprised if you end up taking on more than you plan. Compassion, rather than ambition, motivates you to get involved with helping a family member, a friend or even someone you don't know."
capricorn,2010-05-08,"Your psychic sense is activated today and it might be startling at first if you suddenly know something that you haven't yet been told. But your normal rational approach won't work now, since you may not be able to explain your current mental powers. Instead of putting up defenses because you feel uncomfortable, stay open to the waves of intuition that flood your awareness. Don't question the process; instead, be ready to act on a hunch if you believe it to be true."
aquarius,2010-05-08,"You might grow annoyed with someone who doubts the wisdom of a choice you make today because it feels as if your core values are being questioned. Normally, you would be able to stand up for yourself, but words seem to fail you now. The harder you try to get your point across, the more flustered you become. Step back from defending your decision and let your performance stand on its own."
pisces,2010-05-08,"Avoid making too many plans today because you'll be happier if you are allowed to float through the day without prior commitments. Naturally, you might not be able to avoid certain responsibilities, but the less you have on your schedule now, the better. However, this isn't about being lazy; it's about having the flexibility to stay attuned to your own internal clock rather than conforming to everyone else's agendas."
aries,2010-05-09,"Your impatience might get the best of you today, especially if something looks so good that your enthusiasm is stirred. But you could elicit unexpected repercussions if you act too quickly. Take time and be your own critic instead of provoking someone else to tell you what you should have done. Go ahead with your idea only after you've thought through your plan."
taurus,2010-05-09,"It's tough to know whether to listen to your friends or just act on your own volition without waiting for anyone else's advice. There is no right or wrong approach now; both strategies have their pros and cons. But even if you're sure that you know what you're going to do, it still doesn't hurt to consider another point of view before initiating action."
gemini,2010-05-09,"Your initial concern today is about your desire for acknowledgment from your friends and family. You could receive some support for your efforts, but it isn't consistent, provoking you to believe that you're doing something wrong. Unfortunately, changing your tactics mid-course won't help. Just continue doing the best you can and don't worry so much about what others are thinking."
cancer,2010-05-09,"You are hesitant to go ahead with your plans now because you don't want to undertake a project or go on a trip by yourself. Nevertheless, your frustration level will be even higher if you wait for someone else. Even if others nod their heads in approval, they still could back out when the time comes for their participation. Assume that you're on your own today, but leave room for your friend or partner to join in later."
leo,2010-05-09,"It seems as if everything has been taking longer than you expected, yet today you may see signs that the energy is ready to shift. But instead of impatiently pushing forward now, take time to finish up a project that continues to hang over your head. Give yourself a few more days to look back and get ready before initiating action on your new project."
virgo,2010-05-09,"You might be so sure of yourself today that you bait someone into an argument just to prove your case. Unfortunately, an easygoing conversation with a friend could turn tense if you are stubborn about your opinion. Wasting energy on debate is a distraction now. It's not helpful to be arrogant when you would be better off observing the rapidly shifting tides so you could improve your current strategy for success."
libra,2010-05-09,"You could be so hung up on details that you miss what's going on in an important relationship today. If something happens out of the blue, consider it as a reminder to pay extra attention to your feelings because repressed emotions are now likely to zap you unexpectedly. Don't wait until the tension disrupts your day; address an uncomfortable issue as soon as you see it coming."
scorpio,2010-05-09,"You may declare this a day of fun and relaxation, only to discover that there's still something you must do. Keep in mind that you don't have to avoid an obligation in order to create time to enjoy the fruits of your labor. Even if you cannot get away for the entire day, plan something special to bring you pleasure that's not associated with any sort of enduring accomplishment. Give yourself permission to feel the joy that is in the present moment."
sagittarius,2010-05-09,"As the day progresses, your sense of anticipation grows, but you might not know what's around the next corner. You could successfully talk yourself out of your excitement, only to feel the rush again a little later. Stop resisting the future; it's time for you to reclaim the optimism that you set aside in order to handle the real issues that recently required your attention."
capricorn,2010-05-09,"You may be caught off guard by the intensity of your feelings today. Although you are confident with your recent choices, you still might run into serious roadblocks that test your determination. Slow down in order to navigate through the obstacle course, but don't give up. The road clears ahead if you have the sense to push forward with unflappable resolve."
aquarius,2010-05-09,"You might be feeling anxious now because you cannot decide how to spend your time. However, the pressure to choose is a reflection of the larger issues in your life that are requiring you to balance your irrepressible dreams with a realistic acceptance of what's ahead. Instead of believing that you can do whatever you want, moderate your expectations so you can avoid disappointment later in the day."
pisces,2010-05-09,"Hopefully, you have already taken some time this weekend to check in with your own needs instead of being distracted by everyone else's. However, your period of contemplation is rapidly drawing to a close and you'll need to make a decision that you can live with for the next few weeks. Stop looking back and wondering what you could have done differently. You'll be more successful now if you look ahead and imagine all that you can possibly do in the future."
aries,2010-05-10,"It's not easy for you to control your emotions today as the Moon moves through your sign. Unfortunately, expressing your feelings may stir up a hornet's nest of tension and once things are out in the open, it won't be easy to tuck them back away. Still, it's probably better to address what's bothering you now instead of waiting until the stress is even greater."
taurus,2010-05-10,"You might try several different strategies to avoid conflict today, but chances are good that something will hook you into an argument. Even if your intentions are peaceful, you still could be a very tough opponent once you are engaged. Keep reminding yourself that your current disagreement may not be important enough to justify going to battle. More time will help you gain a better perspective, so try and wait it out."
gemini,2010-05-10,"Your sarcasm could get you into trouble today, especially if you continue to delay an important discussion. Attempts to avoid a difficult issue can increase your stress until a careless comment triggers your anger and pushes your buttons. A temper tantrum might give you a chance to blow off some stream, but it won't make anyone feel better in the long run. Instead of unconsciously provoking someone for the wrong reason, set your humor aside and simply speak from your heart."
cancer,2010-05-10,"You have the potential of being a force to reckon with today, especially if anyone tries to use his or her authority to gain power over you. Although at other times you might choose to remain quiet and acquiesce to someone else's demands, you are ready to fight in order to maintain your boundaries now. It's healthy to let others know where you stand as long as you don't take your resistance too far."
leo,2010-05-10,"You don't mind receiving support or constructive criticism from your friends and family. However, you really don't like it when anyone meddles with your work, especially if you are clear as to your current strategy. Your patience is short today and your reaction to outside interference may be swift. Be firm, but keep in mind that an overly strong reaction on your part could further stimulate unwanted conflict."
virgo,2010-05-10,"You might think that you're at the end of your rope today, but you're not going to fall. Your key planet Mercury turns around tomorrow, ending a three-week period of backtracking. For now, your wisest strategy is to just hang on. You won't lose any more ground, but you may not see the progress you want for a few more days. Don't give up; your life is already beginning to slowly change for the better."
libra,2010-05-10,"It's a wonder to you that others can be so pushy without even realizing that they're being offensive. You, on the other hand, can err on the opposite side of the equation. Don't be overly worried today that someone might think you're being too aggressive because you're probably not nearly as obnoxious as you think. If you spend more time and energy now clearly describing exactly what you need, those closest to you will back off. Additionally, you might be surprised when you actually get what you requested."
scorpio,2010-05-10,"You're back into the daily grind now that the Moon is visiting your 6th House of Routine. Although you might consider trying something new, it's reassuring to know that you can make a success out of falling back on an old habit. Don't worry about the judgment of others; what's said by your co-workers or acquaintances is less important than the results of your actions."
sagittarius,2010-05-10,"Your behavior today reflects a new wave of confidence, yet you might be feeling optimistic a few days too soon. It's not that there's anything wrong with what's happening now; it's just that you still have more things to do before you can begin harvesting the fruits of your labor. Positive thinking is a vital part of your current strategy; just don't ignore reality in the process."
capricorn,2010-05-10,"You may be thinking about the resistance you would face if you decided to live somewhere else. Whether or not a move is feasible now, your restlessness can make you aware of all your responsibilities and how they could stand between you and your future goals. Ultimately, you may decide that this is not the right time to turn your domestic life upside down. Don't hurry the process; big changes are coming faster than you expect."
aquarius,2010-05-10,"You have a lot on your mind today because you can tell how busy the next few weeks are going to be for you. But even if your anticipation is high, you still cannot just jump ahead to where you want to be. You must move into your future one day at a time and right now that means facing any obstacles in your path, real or imagined. Don't avoid difficult issues because they will only become more complicated if you wait to address them until later."
pisces,2010-05-10,"Your self-esteem is growing stronger now, but you could become so confident that you take on more than you should. Those who depend on you won't be happy if you don't do what you promise today. Listen to the advice that your friends are giving you, especially if they're telling you to slow down. A steady and methodical approach can help you avoid making an impulsive decision that you'll later regret."
aries,2010-05-11,"You may have been lazy when it came to taking care of your bills these past few weeks, but that's about to change now that Mercury is turning direct in your 2nd House of Money. Use the fiery energy you feel today to get your paperwork done or to balance your checkbook. Once your finances are in order, you'll be ready to tackle longer-term issues about your career."
taurus,2010-05-11,"You've probably had enough communication snafus to last you for a while so you are ready for Mercury's retrograde to end. Now that interactive Mercury turns direct in your sign, it finally appears that you will be able to find answers to problems that have evaded solutions. No matter how eager you are for everything to be back to normal, allow progress to happen on its own schedule. Remember, you cannot push the river any faster than it's already flowing."
gemini,2010-05-11,"Today your key planet Mercury begins to move forward in your karmic 12th House, indicating the current importance of what you say. However, it may not be apparent that you are at a turning point now. Even if you wish that you were much further along, there's no reason to waste time blaming yourself. Just set a new trajectory for the weeks ahead and rest assured that the elusive progress of the recent past will soon transform into growing momentum."
cancer,2010-05-11,"Mercury's recent backward dance in your 11th House of Friends may have put a strain on your social life or, at least, required you to change plans more than you prefer. Now as the communicator planet gets back on track, so do your interactions with others. But misunderstandings won't likely untangle themselves, so make a commitment to clear up leftover confusion so everyone can move on."
leo,2010-05-11,"This year may have started slowly with Mars retrograde in your relentless sign, followed by Mercury in stubborn Taurus. As much as you tried to get ahead, obstacles kept appearing as if to test you. Now that Mars has reclaimed its territory and Mercury is moving direct in your 10th House of Status, you should begin to feel better about your place in the world. But don't wait until everything is just right before making your move; initiate action today if you are ready."
virgo,2010-05-11,"You are highly sensitized to rational Mercury's direct turn in your 9th House of Big Ideas because your ruling planet has been revealing where your plans fall short. If you have recently been required to reconsider key pieces of your strategy, it's time to test the newest version of your grand design. You may not have to become overly focused on the details, even if that's what others think. Concentrate on the larger scenario now; this approach can bring the success you seek."
libra,2010-05-11,"Even if you have done a good job of maintaining an even keel, the winds are picking up now and could fill your sails. Logical Mercury is turning direct today in your 8th House of Intimacy, which could tilt your passions toward or away from someone. Your emotions will be intense whichever way you go. Don't try to restrain yourself now; share with conviction what's in your heart."
scorpio,2010-05-11,"You might have dealt with a stubborn person in a one-on-one relationship these last weeks as communicator Mercury back-stepped in your 7th House of Partners. Now that the winged planet is again moving forward, the ice begins to melt and tensions naturally resolve. This doesn't mean that all your differences of opinion will vanish; it just means that you have a sensible starting place, and that your discussions will become more fruitful in the days ahead."
sagittarius,2010-05-11,"Small improvements you make to your health regimen can create big results today, with Mercury's direct turn in your 6th House of Health and Habits. You might have tried to change your diet or exercise program over the past few weeks, but things didn't work out as planned. Thankfully, now you're getting another chance, so don't let it pass you by."
capricorn,2010-05-11,"The communicator planet's direct turn in your 5th House of Fun and Games may be more serious than you expect. Nevertheless, devote some of your time to scheduling a vacation or just doing something that brings you pleasure. But don't get overly distracted with planning joyful activities because you can derive immediate satisfaction by pursuing some kind of creative expression right now."
aquarius,2010-05-11,"Although you might be quite busy at work, running errands or visiting with friends today, you'll still need to take care of some domestic chores. Mercury's three-week retrograde period in your 4th House of Home and Family may have raised the bar of expectations on what others think you should be doing outside of work. Even if your energy is spread thin, make time to fulfill your personal obligations."
pisces,2010-05-11,"You may have lost control of your everyday activities when Mercury retrograded through your 3rd House of Immediate Environment for the past few weeks. However, you need to regain any authority that you lost now that it's again turning direct. You might feel as if you should do something drastic to handle everything today, but you would be much wiser to move slowly and gently. You're not in as much of a hurry as you think."
aries,2010-05-12,"Although you might talk tough today, you are actually less excitable than you were earlier in the week. Others may be able to see how impatient you are, but they're not getting the complete picture. They can misinterpret your assertive style and think that you're desperate. But your ability to be persistent now gives you greater strength than is apparent. Don't be sidetracked by what anyone else thinks; just keep your eyes focused on your goal."
taurus,2010-05-12,"You are determined to get what you want, but you could become your own greatest obstacle if you allow your fear of failure to run the show now. Your anxiety can increase your stress levels and instead of remaining flexible enough to respond to changes, you may begin to shut down emotionally. But you can ease your tension by simply reminding yourself that worrying won't help you be more successful. Each moment today is an opportunity for you to choose flexibility over stubbornness."
gemini,2010-05-12,"You may feel somewhat stagnant, as if you cannot find a way to get moving today. However, this may be less about physical laziness than apathy. Although you know what you want now, you cannot decide if it's worth the effort. But weighing the pros and cons won't bring you any closer to an answer now. It's wiser to just wait a day or two longer before doing anything about your future goals."
cancer,2010-05-12,"You may need to enter into the depths of your own fears so you can process them before exploring beneath the surface with a close friend or partner. Unfortunately, there are no shortcuts to happiness today, so you'll just have to jump in and be willing to deal with whatever happens. You are traveling through mysterious terrain and it's crucial that you take it slowly enough to fully absorb the experience as you go along."
leo,2010-05-12,"If someone asks you a question today, he or she better be ready to listen because you have a lot to say and you are eager to share your opinion. However, you may not be able to give a simple yes or no answer. You have a story to tell and won't be stopped until you've delivered your entire response, including any explanations that you deem necessary. Just remember that others may not have the time for the ""everything"" approach so keep your message as uncomplicated as possible."
virgo,2010-05-12,"You are playing for keeps today and won't be deterred from your goal. The Moon's conjunction with your key planet Mercury can trick you into thinking that your way is the best way to accomplish your work now. But there are many approaches to success and it's very likely that someone else will have a smarter idea. Remain open to what others say, for your ability to adjust your plan could bring you to your destination even quicker."
libra,2010-05-12,"You might be uncomfortable today because you often prefer to rely on your intellect rather than on your emotions. But the moody Moon's conjunction with rational Mercury can blur the boundaries between objective logic and subjective desires. Thinking with your heart is fine if you are aware you are doing it. However, your lack of clarity now should stand as a warning not to make big decisions until after tomorrow's New Moon."
scorpio,2010-05-12,"Your natural ability to delve deeply into the shadows of your subconscious mind can make you a really good friend to someone special. Your loyalty is unwavering as you jointly explore the darker side of someone's passions. It's much easier to stick with an intense process of transformation now when the spotlight is on another person, rather than you. Try to remember to be just as kind to yourself on a day when your feelings are the ones being judged."
sagittarius,2010-05-12,"Practicality comes easily to you today, but unfortunately, you can be wrong even if you're using common sense. However, you must be careful because you could set your heart on a particular goal. It's still possible to make a bad decision, even if you approach it rationally and with your feet on the ground. You'll do much better with a little more perspective, so allow a day or two to pass before giving your final answer."
capricorn,2010-05-12,"You can appear more intense than usual today because everything you say is supercharged with emotion. But you won't likely waste words, for Mercury in simplistic Taurus requires you to get to the point. Nevertheless, you may not be as rational as you think. Step back from any situation that gets you riled up now and consider all your options before sharing your point of view."
aquarius,2010-05-12,"No matter what circumstances are currently impacting your life, they are less important than how you react to them. Accordingly, you have a lot more control over what happens next than you realize. Instead of trying to demonstrate your survival skills or self-sufficiency to anyone else, focus on strengthening your own foundations. It's not about what others think; it's about your integrity."
pisces,2010-05-12,"You might think that you are being very clear about your intentions and what you are doing today, but a close friend or family member still could misinterpret your behavior. Unfortunately, the more you try to justify your actions, the less believable you become because your emotions speak louder than your logic. Your smartest strategy now is to follow through with what you started and save your explanations for another day."
aries,2010-05-13,"Instead of impulsively setting new goals to increase your chances of success, it makes more sense to apply the potential of today's New Moon in your 2nd House of Resources. There's no need to change your destination, for that will only distract you from what you need to be doing. It is a much better idea to rethink your strategy and then reallocate your time and energy so you can gain efficiency. It's not about pushing harder now; it's about working smarter."
taurus,2010-05-13,"You have reached a turning point and it's up to you to decide what comes next. It's time for you to wipe the slate clean so you aren't limited by yesterday's plans. The Taurus New Moon activates your 1st House of Self, enabling you to exert a higher level of self-determination over the weeks ahead if you are willing to make a decision today. But choosing which road to take isn't enough; you must also commit to giving one hundred percent until you accomplish your goal."
gemini,2010-05-13,"Today may be more important than you realize, for the New Moon activates your 12th House of Destiny. An apparently trivial decision made now could have unforeseen consequences. Although you are tempted to keep things light and easy, it would be wiser to be extra serious as you consider the ramifications of your possible actions. If you are unsure of yourself, refrain from making any changes until you gain clarity."
cancer,2010-05-13,"Although you may have responsibilities that must be fulfilled, you needn't be overly concerned with concrete decisions that affect what's happening at work. Instead, acknowledge the New Moon in your 11th House of Long-Term Goals by managing the present situation as efficiently as you can while also leaving time to plan for your future. Be bold in your thinking, for your current ideas are more pragmatic than you realize."
leo,2010-05-13,"Instead of getting caught up in anger over something you cannot control, apply your excess energy methodically to advance yourself at work. The New Moon illuminates your 10th House of Career, empowering you to successfully accomplish a project that you begin today. Even if you don't actually initiate work on a new venture now, at least consider your options and make a concrete plan for what's ahead."
virgo,2010-05-13,"If you have recently considered enrolling in a course to expand your career horizons, today's New Moon in your 9th House of Higher Education could push you further along that track. But if your idea of learning doesn't necessarily involve the classroom, you might want to go on a working vacation that allows you to travel and widen your vision. One way or another, open your mind to possibilities not previously considered."
libra,2010-05-13,"Yours is a relationship-oriented sign, so today's New Moon in your 8th House of Shared Resources may be a reminder that a joint venture could offer you more advantages than starting something on your own. Naturally, there are pros and cons to giving up your autonomy, but the right partner could offer the ways and means to reach your goal. Making a smart alliance now could be your best move."
scorpio,2010-05-13,"Although it's difficult to let go of a hurtful memory, you are now able to see beyond your previously limited point of view as you reinvent your frame of reference. Today, your emotional IQ is supplemented by your common sense as the earthy Taurus New Moon activates your 7th House of Relationships. It doesn't matter how much your life has changed; you can still benefit from a supportive friendship if you are willing to entertain the possibilities."
sagittarius,2010-05-13,You may not be able to say yes to a new project today as easily as you might on other days because the New Moon in your 6th House of Work reflects your need for self-restraint on the job. It's not that you lack vision; it's just that you're more concerned now with completing what you have already started before beginning something else. Keep it simple until you know where your previous commitments will take you.
capricorn,2010-05-13,"You are at the beginning of a highly creative phase. You are not interested in building castles in the air, yet this is an excellent time to start a project as long as it allows you to harness your current enthusiasm. However, today's New Moon in your 5th House of Spontaneity suggests that you could be in for some stress if you take on a job that you don't enjoy. If you find yourself facing restrictions at work, find other areas of your life where you can express your ingenuity."
aquarius,2010-05-13,"It's time for you to set a stake in the ground that can be used as a cornerstone for the foundation you are constructing. There are many changes ahead, yet having stability in your life is crucial now as the New Moon illuminates your 4th House of Security. If you feel safe, you'll be able to build on what you have already gained. However, your future will be more uncertain if you are anxious about your present vulnerability."
pisces,2010-05-13,"You must stick to the basic facts in all your interactions today, because the uncomplicated Taurus New Moon highlights your 3rd House of Communication. Although you may be an idealist, it's time to temporarily set your dreams aside and deal with things as they are, rather than as you wish them to be. Demand the simple truth from others now and give them the same in return. But don't worry about your current lack of imagination; it will surely return in the days ahead."
aries,2010-05-14,"If you have been holding back your energy, now it may be time to experiment with letting it go. But you don't need to turn your whole world upside down by initiating too much change all at once. Don't try to force anything to happen. Be patient with yourself if you aren't yet making noticeable progress, for your efforts will take time to reach critical mass."
taurus,2010-05-14,"It's one thing to anticipate the future so you can be ready for all contingencies. It's quite another, though, to be so wrapped up in what might happen that you lose control of the present moment. Even if you are already thinking ahead, you may need to slow yourself down today or your frustration will soon outweigh your enthusiasm."
gemini,2010-05-14,"The Moon's entry into your sign today can be like an emotional wake-up call that shifts you out of your head and down into the rest of your body. It's not that you become so wrapped up in your feelings that you lose perspective; it's just that you are more aware of how your thoughts are influenced by your changing moods. Nevertheless, go easy on yourself if you don't yet want to share what's on your mind. A little introspection isn't a bad thing."
cancer,2010-05-14,"At first it seems as if you lose interest in whatever you start, but it's just that your attention is being spread thinner today. You might feel easily distracted and even a tad discouraged. But your concerns should dissipate quickly once you realize how much you're doing, even if others don't see the results of your efforts. Keep any negativity to yourself for now; that way it won't have a lasting impact on your current work."
leo,2010-05-14,"Specific work-related issues may finally be under control, leaving you free to project your intentions farther into the future without having to be so practical. Of course, you won't be able to leave your current responsibilities behind; it's just that they don't require so much intense maintenance from you at this time. Nevertheless, it's still a smart idea to keep an eye on your workmates because someone might try to steal your thunder. The best offense now is a conscious defense."
virgo,2010-05-14,"It's likely that you were doing fine yesterday, but now your sense of order seems to be quickly falling apart as you are deluged with contradictory data. This is a test, but you don't need to give the right answer to pass it. Believe it or not, your best path to success today is procrastination. Avoid the negative consequences of a hasty decision by putting it off for a few days."
libra,2010-05-14,"You might have been fairly certain about your point of view yesterday, but your confidence could wane today. Part of your current dilemma is that there appear to be more choices than you initially thought. Although you like the idea of having additional options now, so much variety makes it much harder to pick one over all the others. It will be easier to choose if you realize that it doesn't have to be your final answer."
scorpio,2010-05-14,"The stubbornness of an associate or friend may have tested you over the past couple of days. You might even have reached a point where you felt as if you were negotiating or arguing with an obstinate mule. Thankfully, your annoyance might be diminishing now that others aren't so stuck in their ways. You can make a good situation even better by meeting someone's new-found flexibility with some adaptability of your own."
sagittarius,2010-05-14,"If you have been unable to break out of a rut or eliminate an old habit, you may be able to get someone to help you today. It's surprising how much a bit of support boosts your confidence and enables you to move along toward a goal. But others might not be there exactly when you need them, so don't put all your faith in anyone else's advice; trust your own wise counsel as well."
capricorn,2010-05-14,"You may feel a bit discombobulated because you don't have the same level of focus today that you had yesterday. You might start a task, only to leave it unfinished as you move on to something else. Too many loose ends can increase your anxiety, so remember to ""just say no"" to the next distraction that comes along. Even if it feels restrictive now, complete one job before beginning another."
aquarius,2010-05-14,"The light bulbs in your brain begin to flash with creativity today. You feel alive and refreshed, ready to make good use of all the ideas that are coming your way. But turning an inspiration into a concrete plan can be tricky business, so you're inclined now to handle it slowly and deliberately. Nevertheless, don't be overly cautious; respond to the current opportunities by being willing to take a calculated risk."
pisces,2010-05-14,"There's an increased amount of talk at home or on the job now, but you have a bit of difficulty keeping up with it all. It's not that you lack interest; it's just that you don't have the energy to follow up on each idea or feeling that is expressed. However, dropping out of the conversation entirely isn't a viable solution, either. Establishing limits to the amount of time you spend communicating with others today is a sensible way of managing your resources."
aries,2010-05-15,"You may have a mischievous twinkle in your eye today because you think you can put one over on reality. Unfortunately, you can be so clever now that you fool everyone, including yourself. Be careful; everything appears to be light and easy but there are powerful forces at work just beyond the limits of what you can sense."
taurus,2010-05-15,"Your mental agility can have you foxtrotting around facts and tap dancing to tall tales today. Unfortunately, you might be so distracted by your own smooth moves that you don't even notice when the music stops. You should be able to get a lot more accomplished now if you concentrate on the tasks at hand rather than demonstrating how skillfully you can maneuver around the truth."
gemini,2010-05-15,"Your mind is going a mile a minute and there's no obvious way to slow it down. Normally, you might consider this to be exhilarating, but now it's more of an irritation than anything else. It's one thing to be able to think quickly, but unfortunately your current thought process may be leading you around in circles. Nevertheless, don't resist the repetition, for it could lead to an unexpected breakthrough when you least expect it."
cancer,2010-05-15,"You are quite engaged with your fantasies, but no one needs to know what's going on within your brain. You can easily keep up normal appearances now, enabling you to come and go as you please. But don't get so overconfident that you stop paying attention to your immediate surroundings or you could miss out on something even better than your dreams."
leo,2010-05-15,"You would rather spend time today with a small group of friends or family than having to fulfill your responsibilities in the real world. Luckily, you may not have to choose one over the other. Instead of frittering away your day, make a list of things to do and then focus on each item, one at a time. If you concentrate your efforts, you'll be surprised at how much time you have left over to enjoy the camaraderie you seek."
virgo,2010-05-15,"Others may look to you for acknowledgment today, but you don't think that you should have to put your stamp of approval on everything that happens. You have enough common sense to remain uninvolved when a situation doesn't concern you directly. This may bother someone close to you because your detachment can be misinterpreted as displeasure. Take extra time to make sure that everyone knows exactly how you feel so no one's feelings are hurt."
libra,2010-05-15,"You may seem a bit distant from the real nitty-gritty of what's happening today, but it's not because you have withdrawn. In fact, your exuberance may be over the top now, yet your words seem so philosophical and conceptual that others may not even know what you're saying. Thinking in general terms can be useful, but it helps if you can bring your ideas back down to earth. Think globally, but speak practically."
scorpio,2010-05-15,"You have a special gift today of being able to talk about a challenging personal experience in a manner that doesn't make others feel awkward. You are able to feel the intensity while describing it in a straightforward style that carries no blame. Your openness can be a catalyst that stimulates a totally unexpected conversation. Even if you have an agenda, don't try to control the outcome when the discussion shifts gears and heads off in a different direction."
sagittarius,2010-05-15,"A close friend or family member might talk your ear off today and there's really no graceful way for you to stop them. You've been known to speak your mind without realizing that your direct approach could offend those with thinner skins than yours. But now you would be wise to bite your tongue and listen to what's being said. Surprisingly, your discretion might even lead to learning something important."
capricorn,2010-05-15,"At first you might freak out when you realize that you have a wild tiger by the tail today, but your calm demeanor and steady persistence will soon have it purring. Unfortunately, there's no step-by-step instruction manual for you to follow. Luckily, your intuition won't let you down. Just do what seems right and you'll have things under control sooner than later."
aquarius,2010-05-15,"You believe that you are due a real play day in return for your recent hard work and today you're ready to schedule a bit of rest and relaxation. But an unexpected complication can get in the way of your day off. Don't make it worse by falling prey to the trap of complaining, for that will only annoy everyone around you. Instead, be responsible and handle whatever comes up the best you can. You can always find time for yourself on another day."
pisces,2010-05-15,"Instead of running around in circles doing errands, retreat behind the walls of your home today. Pick up a book that you recently set aside and sink into it. Listen to music that enables you to meditate and dream. Chat online, talk on the phone or put your feet up and escape into TV-land. No matter what distractions you choose, don't let anyone make you feel guilty for taking some time for yourself."
aries,2010-05-16,"Your friends may be used to your impulsive actions and they know that you mean no harm when you step on their toes. But people who don't know you as well might question your motives today if you inadvertently do something hurtful. You may not know if it's a good idea to talk about the issue or if you should just walk away and let it be. Either way, it could be a stressful situation and although you're tempted to withdraw, you'll feel better if you don't."
taurus,2010-05-16,"Finding companions to join you in your fun today can be quite a challenge now. You just want to chill, but it's tough when those around you have their own ideas of what a good time means. You're like Goldilocks; some of your friends want to do more than you're willing and some want to do less. You won't enjoy yourself if you get swept up in something that's not your cup of tea. Be firm in your position and hold out for the activity that is just right for you."
gemini,2010-05-16,"You might have your heart set on doing something out of the ordinary today, but domestic responsibilities can put a damper on your plans. Fortunately, you can salvage a part of your original vision, but you'll need to be creative in order to make it happen. Don't sulk if things go differently than intended. Instead, make the best of the situation without comparing it to what could have been."
cancer,2010-05-16,"Your dreams may be at cross-purposes with those of your partner or close friend. Or, perhaps, circumstances that are beyond your control seem to be working against you today. Don't take it personally; this is not a cosmic conspiracy against you. Instead of playing the role of a victim and giving up, take responsibility for what you are able to change and temporarily let go of the rest. The current pressures can help you clarify larger issues you need to manage over the month ahead."
leo,2010-05-16,"You may feel as if someone is going out of his or her way to bug you today. Even if this is true, it won't do much good to confront others because that will bring them the satisfaction they seek. Instead, firmly resolve to move through your day with a positive attitude, for you can change your mind even if everyone else's feelings are beyond your control. Once you decide to take the high road, even your detractors might choose to follow."
virgo,2010-05-16,"Although your weekend might not be going according to your plan, things should begin to smooth out this afternoon. Your day will probably improve if you pull your energy back from others, thereby reducing the drama around an emotional conflict. But you need to be careful or your retreat could have you simmering in your own angry juices. Avoid blaming anyone else for your feelings. Your week ahead begins to look brighter when you become clear about your part in what's happening."
libra,2010-05-16,"Your ability to see both sides of an issue is a blessing now as extreme pressures push you one way while heightened desires pull you another. Although it may feel as if you need to make a choice today, that could be a mistake. It's not about avoiding the issues; it's about keeping your options open. Don't fall prey to someone else's agenda and prematurely decide your fate. There's no need to show your hand yet; hold on to your cards and let the circumstances continue to unfold for a while longer."
scorpio,2010-05-16,"It's not that you really believe that you can please everyone; it's just that you want to, no matter what. Unfortunately, there could be some casualties now as the pressures pile up and you are caught in the middle of a drama that has grown out of control. Your response is crucial, since you'll provoke even more intense emotions if you overreact. Acknowledge your feelings without fanning the flames of discontent."
sagittarius,2010-05-16,"Perhaps you recently said too much and ruffled someone's feathers in the process. You may believe that everyone else should be able to let go of what already happened as easily as you can, but, unfortunately, this might not be the case today. Don't look for an excuse to escape if a lighthearted discussion turns heavy. There won't be a reason for anyone to hold on to a grudge if you remember to keep bringing the conversation about the past back into the present moment."
capricorn,2010-05-16,"It's a smart idea to downplay your emotions today because you may appear more intense than you actually are. But don't pretend that everything is fine if you are uncomfortable with someone else's behavior now. Nevertheless, caution is advised because others can easily misinterpret your words by thinking that you're casting blame on them. Express your feelings without shifting the responsibility away from yourself."
aquarius,2010-05-16,"Your emotions are being dragged all over the map today as you worry about your relationships with friends and family. Your stress increases when you realize how many weekend chores still remain unfinished. Remember, you can choose where to put your attention. Although you may need to acknowledge someone's hurt feelings, it's a mistake to take responsibility for them. Don't try to fix anyone else; instead, focus on your own work and let your actions speak for themselves."
pisces,2010-05-16,"You can't calm someone else down today if you are frazzled yourself. Although your first inclination may be to escape, your involvement in an unfolding family drama could be very helpful to others and even healing for you. But don't be in a hurry to force an arbitrary solution onto a situation that has no easy answer just because it might ease your anxiety. Let your fears give way to patience and compassion."
aries,2010-05-17,"You may consider yourself a member of the ""act first and ask questions later"" club, but you would be wise now to think twice before your impulses lead you astray. Just because something feels good doesn't mean that more of it will be better. It's no fun setting limits and then having to stick to them, but it's easier than dealing with the problems that could arise from unrestrained self-indulgent behavior."
taurus,2010-05-17,"Pleasure calls today as your key planet Venus is over-stimulated by opulent Jupiter, luring you to accept the second helping of dessert, even if you are already full. The idea of luxuriating in delight could turn your need for satisfaction into gluttony or greed. Think about how much is actually enough, for even if you are happily enjoying yourself, overdoing it could create difficulties sooner than you realize."
gemini,2010-05-17,"Although you can probably justify pretty much anything you want to do today, it's a good idea to rely on your common sense now instead of intellectual analysis. Even if you bend the facts in your favor, you still know right from wrong. Trust your feelings, but if your goals differ from someone else's, don't struggle too hard against the prevailing currents. You can always make the necessary course corrections later on."
cancer,2010-05-17,"You can tell that the current situation has great potential, but you may not know the best way to get around the resistance that's lurking behind everyone's apparent support. You are eager to lead the parade today, yet still afraid that no one will be following you when you look over your shoulder. Have faith in your instincts; maintain a positive attitude but don't get too far ahead of the others until you see what happens tomorrow."
leo,2010-05-17,"You're not one to hide your enthusiasm, especially if there's a good time involved. But now it would be wise to quietly work toward your goals without giving too much away. A powerful person at work might become suspicious that you aren't being realistic if you are overly cheerful. A smart strategy is to assume the best possible outcome while planning contingencies for the worst."
virgo,2010-05-17,"You may be less optimistic now than someone else is, but your resistance could crumble as a friend or associate confidently paints the future with bright colors and good news. Nevertheless, you can see problems that still need to be resolved. Instead of being a critical naysayer, put your mental skills to work by analyzing the details and contributing a practical plan that helps to handle the unanswered questions."
libra,2010-05-17,"You may be confident that you can keep up with everything at work today, even if there's a lot on your shoulders as expansive Jupiter in your 6th House of Employment is aspected by your key planet Venus. Fortunately, this can be a time of great accomplishments, but only if you don't exhaust yourself trying to do too much. Don't set yourself up for failure; it's better to be realistic now than idealistic."
scorpio,2010-05-17,"Although a lot of praise may be coming your way, you receive it with caution because you think that some things are being left unsaid. Your concern may be based on a grain of truth, but you could also be reading more into the silence than is necessary. Instead of worrying about the political posturing that may be happening at work, you'll do better if you accept the recognition and leave the jockeying for power to others."
sagittarius,2010-05-17,"You are encouraged to set higher goals and to reach even farther than usual, since your key planet Jupiter is in the spotlight today. Your optimism can motivate you, but there is danger in overextending and losing your balance. There's no reason to deny your sense of well-being. Make good use of your confidence, but temper it with reality so you don't find yourself out on a limb that will no longer support you."
capricorn,2010-05-17,You are the one that can bring others back down to earth today because you are able to see past the glitter and glamor that has everyone else so enthralled. It's not that you are being negative; it's just that your pragmatism can help to prevent an unpleasant scene at work if expectations are blown out of proportion. But don't get self-righteous about your point of view or you'll provoke a battle for control that could get in the way of what you currently have to offer.
aquarius,2010-05-17,"You are tempted to take the easy way out today if you don't see the justification in working so hard to reach a goal that is unrealistic and may not even be that important to you. You would rather put your effort toward something that brings you more personal satisfaction. But be careful as you prioritize the tasks at hand, for immediate pleasures are fleeting while your long-term investments now will be the ones that bring the greatest rewards."
pisces,2010-05-17,"You may think that you can temporarily suspend the rules or extend a deadline today, but it's likely that your fantasies are getting the best of you. Instead of dreaming your way through the day, you would be smart to forget about the possibilities ahead and focus specifically on the tasks right in front of you. If you work hard and show others what you can do now, there will be time for relaxation and escape later on."
aries,2010-05-18,Don't worry if your day starts off slowly because it's likely to gain momentum once you get going. You could feel sluggish and maybe even unmotivated because things just don't seem to be going your way. But this may be a test to see if you're able to hold your course in spite of discouragement. Don't give up now; aim high and work hard to achieve your dreams.
taurus,2010-05-18,"This can be a very gratifying day for you as long as your expectations are realistic. You may have to scale back your plans because it feels as if time is running out. Luckily, there probably won't be any major surprises; you know what you need to do in order to reach your goals now, so just go ahead and do it."
gemini,2010-05-18,"You may be withholding your true intentions because you're afraid that you won't receive the support you need if others know what you're up to today. But there's really no reason to keep secrets now because everything will probably come out into the open anyhow. Fortunately, you still should get enough assistance for you to reach your goals in a timely manner."
cancer,2010-05-18,"Perhaps you don't receive exactly what you want today, but your fate is still undecided and will be determined by how you respond to your disappointment. Complaining won't help; it will only move you further from potential satisfaction. On the other hand, accepting the current moment without judgment can liberate you so you are open to the positive energy that comes your way later in the day. Don't hold on to failure; instead, reach for success."
leo,2010-05-18,"You may feel as if you've let someone down today, but that's just because you are judging yourself without having all the facts. Instead of worrying about what you should have done, think about what you are able to do in the immediate future. Even if one dream has vanished, now it's time to create a new one that is grounded on a foundation of common sense, rather than wasting time building castles in the air."
virgo,2010-05-18,"Sometimes it's easier for you to be open and honest when you are being critical than when everything is moving along just right. Today, as problems are handled and your goal becomes more reachable, you may not have as much to say. Don't worry about what others might think; you're under no obligation to play cheerleader for anyone else now. Just apply yourself to removing the barriers to your own success; actions speak louder than words."
libra,2010-05-18,"Even if ultimate gratification remains elusive, you can see the big difference that your attitude makes as you process your frustration today. It's quite rewarding when you can live out your dreams, even if they are simple and straightforward. But the final outcome is up to you, so consciously recreate your vision so it's not so far beyond your reach that it feels hopeless."
scorpio,2010-05-18,"Although you are being very realistic about your career, you're also more optimistic now because you can view things from a different perspective today. However, you are able to tell the difference between what you want and what you have. It's crucial to find a healthy balance between reality and fantasy so you don't miss out on the opportunities of either one."
sagittarius,2010-05-18,"You might want to get off the emotional rollercoaster you have recently been riding, but that wouldn't be such a good idea now because it's finally about to get easier. You earned what's coming next because you held on through the ups and downs. Even if you miss the excitement of the adrenaline rush today, remember that your persistence and positive outlook will bring you what you want."
capricorn,2010-05-18,"Your key planet Saturn is in the spotlight today as it shifts from its role as naysayer to one of taskmaster. Fortunately, tough love softens into guarded support if you demonstrate your willingness to dig in your heels and work hard to achieve your dreams. But stern Saturn won't accept anything less than your full commitment now, so concentrate on what you must do and get to it."
aquarius,2010-05-18,"It may feel as if someone is pulling away from you emotionally, but you might have had more to do with creating this gulf than you think. Taking responsibility for your part could be a turning point that enables both of you to concentrate on rebuilding stability instead of testing the boundaries. Allowing yourself to fantasize about your ideal relationship is fine, but don't expect anyone else to fulfill your dream without some serious negotiation."
pisces,2010-05-18,"You might not know what to think now that your eyes have been opened to a wider vision of your life, only to find yourself quickly crashing into reality. Your blind optimism turns to cynicism and then, fortunately you can settle into a sensible approach to manage your daily routine. Don't worry about what just happened or what may be in the future. Instead, keep yourself busy by progressing steadily toward your dreams, taking one concrete step at a time."
aries,2010-05-19,"You don't quite know what to make of your feelings today. Just when you thought you had everything under control, your emotions pull you in directions you're not prepared for now. Don't act on every sudden attraction you have or you could be untangling things for a while. Wait until the dust settles before involving anyone else in your rapidly changing fantasies."
taurus,2010-05-19,"You may be surprised by an unexpected turn of events today, even if you thought you knew what was happening. If you recently made a decision based upon your previous understanding, it may be time to reconsider your choice and make necessary corrections. But don't change course on a whim; take the time to delve into the heart of the matter before doing anything drastic."
gemini,2010-05-19,"You like the idea of sidestepping a difficult conversation and moving on to a topic that's more enjoyable, but something drives you toward finding the answers you seek. Fortunately, you can draw on a deep reserve of inner resolve today that enables you to get to the bottom of an unsolved riddle. But you could be so exhilarated when you finally discover the truth that you impulsively make a bad decision. Don't rush the process; a little bit of patience won't steer you wrong."
cancer,2010-05-19,"You may be exhausted by the rapidly changing emotional landscape that leads you around in circles today. It takes quite a bit of energy to fend off peer pressure now, especially if a powerful associate is trying to get you involved in mischief you would rather avoid. If you have any uncertainty at all, don't give up your individuality for the sake of being a team player. The best thing you have to offer is being true to yourself."
leo,2010-05-19,"You may be certain that you're heading in the wrong direction today; fortunately, your confidence returns only a short time later. Even if you aren't sure that the outcome will be all that you expect, you are still willing to take a risk now. But don't make this decision on a passing fancy. Your feelings are in the process of changing and it would be wise for you to wait until the mood swings begin to settle down."
virgo,2010-05-19,"Although your life may be full of distractions today, your power of concentration is intense as your key planet Mercury forms a harmonizing trine with potent Pluto. Your perceptions are razor sharp, even if your imagination kicks in, tempting you to daydream. There's nothing wrong with exploring your fantasies as long as you remember to distinguish what's real from what's not."
libra,2010-05-19,Yesterday's caution is replaced by today's need for excitement. You may be bored with a recent decision and feel the urge to stir thing up at work. But change for the sake of change isn't very useful now. It's better to have a goal in sight and put your mind toward something specific in the future instead of just trying to run away from something in the past.
scorpio,2010-05-19,"Although you may be uncertain about what to do with the information you have, at least there won't be any question about the validity of your logic. Mental Mercury's trine with powerful Pluto turns your mind into a steel trap and there won't be any escaping from the truth. Nevertheless, you can have all your facts in order and still jump to the wrong conclusion if you aren't being practical."
sagittarius,2010-05-19,"You might be looking for a bit of fun, but the need to be fully involved at work prevents you from following your heart's desire today. Nevertheless, you may struggle to keep your mind from wandering down the back roads of your imagination, even if you have more mundane obligations you should be thinking about. Trying to shut off your dreams completely could be a waste of energy; instead, remind yourself that meeting your current responsibilities now will give you more time for indulging your fantasies later."
capricorn,2010-05-19,"Try to set a steady pace for yourself early in the day because that's the best way to harness the incredible creativity that's at your disposal today. But it might not be easy to find your natural rhythm with so many enticing distractions luring you away from your work. Ultimately, you may be the most productive if you give yourself several breaks throughout the day. These scheduled mini-escapes will inspire you to stay focused for long stretches on the tasks at hand."
aquarius,2010-05-19,"Sweet Venus surprises you out of the blue today as she squares erratic Uranus. You are intrigued, maybe even obsessed, with the idea of creating a bit of excitement in your life. You might decide to get something off your chest only to find that telling the truth provokes more turmoil and confusion than you expected. It's one thing to fantasize; it's quite another to bring your unspoken dreams out into the open."
pisces,2010-05-19,You may be a bit discouraged today and your low energy has you believing that you're not up for the tasks that are demanded of you. But this isn't about whether or not you are capable of doing your work. It's more about your unflagging idealism and the challenges you face when reality doesn't match up to your high expectations. You should feel more confident in a day or two so don't undertake risky behavior just to prove that you're okay.
aries,2010-05-20,"Sometimes you enjoy the anticipation of what's next, even when the results of your actions seem uncertain. However, your current dilemma could have you tied in knots because you know something big is going to happen and you don't yet know what to do about it. You are ready for a change in the present moment, so it's not easy to wait. Be patient today; you should know more by tomorrow."
taurus,2010-05-20,"You may be longing for a less hectic lifestyle, but it doesn't look as if your daily pace is going to settle down in the near future. The difference between what you want and what you have could be enough to make you go quiet. It's difficult to express your desires when satisfaction seems so far away. But this is no time to let negativity creep into your thinking, for you are entering a time of dramatic change and your attitude can make all the difference in the world."
gemini,2010-05-20,"It's as if sweet Venus and the willful Sun are in a relay race and you are being handed off from one to the other as Venus leaves your sign and the Sun enters it. Desire fades as it is replaced by real events. A recent romantic attraction may turn into something more in the days ahead. Whatever occurs, it's time to act as if you are who you want to be, rather than waiting for an opportunity to knock at your door."
cancer,2010-05-20,"Your need for pleasure is heightened as Venus visits your sign until June 14, but increased desire doesn't come without a price. You could set yourself up for disappointment if you know what you want but fail to share your feelings with those closest to you. Don't assume that a loved one knows what you're thinking. Take a risk and give voice to what's in your heart. Even if it doesn't turn out exactly as you wish, you'll have the satisfaction of knowing that you tried."
leo,2010-05-20,"You have reached so many turning points in the past few weeks that you won't likely have high expectations for this one. But your life is truly changing and it may finally feel as if you are moving into new territory instead of revisiting the same old familiar situations. Don't settle for less just because you recently experienced a setback. You have a larger role in creating your future than you might realize, so set high goals and then stretch to reach them."
virgo,2010-05-20,"You are about to enter a more social phase of your life, so be ready to have some fun. But there's a more serious side to this shift, too, as your career goals take on increased importance during the weeks ahead. Meanwhile, the Moon's return to your sign today puts you in more immediate touch with your feelings and enables you to express them with greater ease. Even if you're not completely comfortable with the current circumstances, honesty is still the best policy."
libra,2010-05-20,"You could receive recognition at work for something you recently did. Or, perhaps, you notice that others are being friendlier to you now, even if you haven't altered your behavior. Paradoxically, increased attention might make you want to step out of the spotlight today. However, don't shy away too quickly because this acknowledgment will ultimately make you feel better about yourself."
scorpio,2010-05-20,"Your sense of commitment has prevented you from breaking free, but now you are right at the edge and ready to make some changes. Fortunately, you may not be inclined to do anything overly radical, since there are certain parts of your life that are working just fine. Still, you are antsy enough today to overreact if you don't maintain a healthy perspective about what's most important to you."
sagittarius,2010-05-20,"You have work that must be completed and time is running out. You may be tempted to take a shortcut to the finish line or try a new strategy to save time. It's possible that you might get lucky, but it's still wiser to stick with the tried and true approach. Make your progress now in the old-fashioned way of combining sheer determination with hard work."
capricorn,2010-05-20,"Although you still may have some loose ends to tie up, you're already feeling as if you have been freed from the heavy energy that was placed upon your shoulders. You might even experience such exhilaration that you forget about your commitments. However tempting it is to consider an escape, you've accomplished too much to mess things up now. Keep your nose to the grindstone today and you'll be able to relax tomorrow."
aquarius,2010-05-20,"The Sun's supportive sextile to your key planet Uranus today can remind you of your own brilliance. Although it's dangerous to assume that you have all the answers, it is very probable that your innovative thinking can produce an important breakthrough. Still, you'll need to step outside of the box, stretch the rules or question authority in order to achieve your greatest potential now. Be brave but not reckless."
pisces,2010-05-20,"Your feelings are up one minute and down the next today as alternating currents of excitement and worry distract you from what you ought to be doing. You know you should be concentrating on the details at work, but you may be too inspired about the big picture to pay attention to things that seem trivial. Remember, you do have the capability to control your thoughts, and focusing on the fine points can make the difference between a mediocre performance and true success."
aries,2010-05-21,"You could become frustrated today as you attempt to think your way through a complex series of facts, but the solution to your dilemma remains elusive. You might think that you found a satisfying answer, but then you learn something new that reveals a problem with your plan. Don't limit yourself to the same approach you previously took; you may need to set common sense aside to come up with a strategy that works."
taurus,2010-05-21,"Although you might be able to hold your life steady today, you can still feel the winds of change blowing from a number of different directions. You may be afraid that you're not going to be able to continue on your present course. If your goals are sensible, they won't be threatened by current events. But you will still need to modify your current approach or you could lose your way."
gemini,2010-05-21,"You could feel a real boost of vitality now that the Sun is back for its yearly visit to your sign. But you must manage your intensity over the next few weeks or you may squander your new-found energy. Let logic, rather than irrational emotions, be your guide as you make priorities in your attempt to balance personal responsibilities with career goals."
cancer,2010-05-21,"If you feel a bit scattered now, no one will likely know but you. Your thoughts may be all over the map, yet you're able to rein them in before you open your mouth. Others might think that you are a bastion of common sense, even if you realize that your desire for acceptance is what enables you to appear so grounded. Limit what you say today to what's absolutely necessary so you don't give away your secret."
leo,2010-05-21,"An old emotional wound can begin to heal once you see your past from a different point of view. You may have an ""aha"" experience today as a sudden realization allows you to let go of a self-imposed limitation. Be ready to move forward once you acknowledge that your previous perspective might have been holding you back in ways you couldn't imagine."
virgo,2010-05-21,"You could analyze the data a hundred different ways today and you'll still probably come up with the same answer. You want a solution that works, but you would prefer one that can break you free from the status quo. Others may be a source of inspiration now, but your decision needs to be based on your own vision and not on someone else's. Don't force it; the right path will open up just in time."
libra,2010-05-21,"You might be making lists in secret today because you don't want others to see how much you are struggling to figure things out. You prefer to show your confident side, but keeping up appearances could become exhausting after a while. You don't need to have all the answers now, nor do you have to know exactly what you're doing in advance. If you share your current analytical process with someone you trust, you might receive useful guidance that you didn't expect."
scorpio,2010-05-21,"You don't want to always be the one to bring up the important issues that everyone else avoids. You prefer to be light and easy today, but you keep coming back to a harsh reality that lurks beneath the shiny surface. Unfortunately, the truth is that others just don't see the very same things that are so obvious to you. Luckily, Jupiter is operating in your favor now, so you are able to present what you know in a positive manner that will be appreciated by those closest to you."
sagittarius,2010-05-21,"A business associate or a friend may come to the rescue now by delivering just the information that you need. A missing piece of data could make everything else fit into place, but you still need to be careful that you're not overlooking an important detail. Take your time and go over your plan again; sharing your ideas with someone else to get another perspective will help. But remember, you don't need to be in a hurry to reach a final answer."
capricorn,2010-05-21,"It's satisfying when you can see the results of your work without having to wait. Luckily, you are in your own element today as your creativity is easily channeled into very practical endeavors. But you could become overconfident now and lose your edge, so do your best to stay focused on the specific tasks at hand."
aquarius,2010-05-21,"You might try to extend yesterday's creative period, but are more concerned now with mundane tasks. You may have to scale back a big idea because you lack the time or resources. Money issues could come to the surface, but facing them head-on is much better than letting them gnaw away at your confidence. Balancing your future goals with your current responsibilities will be the persisting theme for days to come."
pisces,2010-05-21,"The Moon's current visit to your 7th House of Relationships may bring you unwanted criticism from a close friend. Don't get overly defensive or you could miss some very useful advice. But it's not helpful to go to the other extreme, either. There's no need to feel attacked or victimized if someone you trust is brave enough to tell you the truth. Instead of avoiding a difficult discussion, sink into it and allow the process to deepen a meaningful friendship."
aries,2010-05-22,"It's easy for you to underestimate the amount of time required to complete your chores today, but this problem can be compounded because the devil really is in the details. You think that if you just keep pushing forward that the little things will magically somehow come together. But you can also go to the other extreme by getting lost in trivialities. Find a workable balance between focusing on each specific task and understanding the overall scope of your project."
taurus,2010-05-22,"You have a very practical approach to scheduling your time today because you don't want to miss out on the fun. Unfortunately, partaking in recreational activities could become complicated and require more advanced planning than you think. But try not to tie your day up in too much detail or you won't be able to respond to the unexpected changes you'll likely encounter along the way."
gemini,2010-05-22,"You may be thrown for a loop today if you encounter resistance from your friends and family. You don't want to be required to justify your long-term goals or recent choices; you simply want those closest to you to support what you are doing. Nevertheless, you must be clear about your intentions and avoid giving in to self-doubt. Staying focused on your destination will improve your chances of success. Those you love will come around in time."
cancer,2010-05-22,"Although you might rather be planning a vacation getaway, chores in your immediate environment today won't likely leave you much time for idle dreaming. A display of anger won't get you what you want, but neither will just hiding your frustration. Work with the push and pull of responsibility and opportunity by expressing your concerns without putting the blame for your feelings on anyone else."
leo,2010-05-22,"The harsh realities of your finances could limit your spending now that the Moon is meeting up with austere Saturn in your 2nd House of Money. But you cannot look to others for sound advice today because they won't understand your situation and may encourage you to overextend yourself. Naturally, positive thinking can improve your situation, but being a Pollyanna and disregarding the facts is certainly not a good idea."
virgo,2010-05-22,"You want very much to be able to trust others today, but it appears that you ultimately may need to rely strictly on yourself. It's not that there won't be anyone around to help you; it's just that your friends seem a bit erratic now, as if they could disappear at any given moment. You won't be as frustrated or disappointed if you embrace the hardworking Moon-Saturn conjunction in Virgo and just get on with the day, even if you're on your own."
libra,2010-05-22,"You are on edge today because it feels as if a storm is on the horizon, yet you are unable to see it. Preparation is complicated by your inability to tell where the trouble is coming from and when it will arrive. Instead of spending your time fearfully battening down the hatches, raise your sails and get ready for an amazing adventure. If you are ready, you could be pleasantly surprised by an unusual friend who offers you a helping hand."
scorpio,2010-05-22,"Making plans is tough today because your friends might not be able to follow through with their promises. For example, your schedule could be thrown into a state of confusion if someone let's you know at the last minute that he or she is running late. Your emotionally restrained response is crucial because you will be much better off if you don't infuse your own negativity into the current situation. You don't need to rely on anyone else to have a great day."
sagittarius,2010-05-22,"You don't want to be the person in charge because you already feel the weight of the responsibility that falls on your shoulders today. It's challenging for you to find the most appropriate way to express your opinions when you can clearly see both sides of the coin. But you could respond to the contradictory options by making an impulsive choice under duress, even if you aren't ready. Encourage your friends to fend for themselves; you only have to make decisions for yourself."
capricorn,2010-05-22,"It's nearly impossible for you to focus your attention on local community events today because you have so much going on in your own life. You want to feel as if you're an integral part of an extended family or tribe, but you might take yourself so seriously now that you get wrapped up in your own personal story. Nevertheless, don't withdraw completely; what you have to offer others will also benefit you in the long run."
aquarius,2010-05-22,"Your key planet Uranus is in the planetary mix today, increasing the speed at which relationship issues are coming to the surface. Discussing your feelings is not all that comfortable for you, unless you can emotionally detach yourself from the situation, so you might wait for someone else to get the ball rolling. Keep in mind that the conversation only becomes harder the longer you delay it, so you might as well start now."
pisces,2010-05-22,"You might feel as if a relationship is dangling from a giant pendulum as you swing back and forth between optimism and pessimism. But you could be in trouble if you truly believe that you must choose one side over the other today, for everything could go out of whack as soon as you lock in on a singular point of view. Practice indecision; delaying your final answer may be the smartest thing you can do now."
aries,2010-05-23,"A recent decision of yours could be quite firm, yet it takes a lot of energy to hold steadfast now as someone shows you a different point of view. Others may say that they are not trying to change your mind, but you still might feel as if pressure is being applied. Although it's a challenge, you can open your heart and widen your perspective without necessarily surrendering your dreams."
taurus,2010-05-23,"Your key planet Venus lures you with her sweet beauty, but there may be a hidden price to pay for courting pleasure today. Although you might think that you won't fall prey to deeper passions, they could surface anyway. But total avoidance of your feelings isn't a viable strategy either. Instead, initiate a discussion about your fears in a manner that does not blame anyone else for your irrational emotions."
gemini,2010-05-23,"No matter how clever you are, it's going to be difficult to avoid the heavier emotions that are likely to surface today. You are often a champion at sidestepping tough spots, but this time it's not worth exhausting yourself while trying. If you are willing to let go of your rigid agenda, you have an opportunity now to increase the level of intimacy in a relationship. But conflict is likely if you cannot be flexible enough to compromise."
cancer,2010-05-23,"There is some tricky territory to navigate through today and you might have to confront hurtful memories in order to reach your desired destination. You would like to break down the emotional walls between you and a loved one, but may be afraid that the intensity of your needs could be frightening to someone else. Your passion is not the problem; rather, it's hanging on to a past wound that can get in your way of current satisfaction."
leo,2010-05-23,"You might act as if you're willing to go along with what everyone else wants to do, but you could harbor secret resentments if your wishes are overlooked. It's not that you need to have it your way today; you just would like others to consider your point of view, too. Express your feelings as gently as you can. Taking responsibility for your own emotions can help to alleviate your anger without shifting the blame to anyone else."
virgo,2010-05-23,"If you're having any financial problems now, they may be complicated by a struggle with your partner for control of the purse strings. But even if there's no one else involved, there still could be deeper psychological issues that bring up your fears of scarcity. Of course, a cash shortage doesn't have to imply something else, but this is an opportune time for you to consider the relationship between your self-esteem and the material world."
libra,2010-05-23,"You often find yourself in the middle of interpersonal tension which allows you to play the role of a shuttle diplomat, going back and forth until you negotiate a solution. Today, however, you could benefit from an impartial person to help you through an intense emotional struggle with someone who is pushing your buttons. But instead of looking at this as a conflict between two people, see what you can learn about the relationship issues that are now being raised."
scorpio,2010-05-23,"Your emotions are intensified as Venus opposes your key planet Pluto, turning every little disagreement into a survival contest. Even if you can see both sides of an argument, it's still challenging for you to remain objective because it feels like so much is at stake now. However, there may be more going on than meets the eye. Don't be distracted by the current conflict; instead, delve beneath the surface to understand the deeper issues that are fueling the debate."
sagittarius,2010-05-23,"You don't do well if you think that others aren't being totally honest. In fact, you would prefer to have all feelings fully aired so you can decide how involved you want to be in the developing emotional drama. Unfortunately, you may not be able to uncover everyone's subconscious motivations now, so the best thing you can do is to respond cautiously and wait for the entire story to emerge on its own."
capricorn,2010-05-23,"Your ability to remain neutral today in the midst of an emotional clash enables you to jump into the fray without choosing sides. But your apparent detachment may be a very clever strategy on your part, for that way you will come out on top no matter what happens. Be careful, for your calculated approach can also reveal your fear of following your heart. Take time to check in with your own needs even if it makes you feel uncomfortable."
aquarius,2010-05-23,"It's not that you are completely immune to the melodrama being played out around you now, but you are somewhat removed from center stage. Luckily, your intellectual approach serves you well today and you can talk about what's happening without being swept up by everyone else's intense feelings. Avoid taking sides in a dispute; your analytical outlook can be the voice of reason that others need."
pisces,2010-05-23,"It's challenging for you to find your own voice if your feelings are drowned out by the magnitude of everyone else's. But it's not that you don't have an intense reaction to the current commotion; it's just that you don't want to fight to be heard. You could be tempted to suppress your passions by giving up before you even try to express them. Nevertheless, your struggle to be acknowledged is worthwhile and could prevent your annoyance from turning into resentment."
aries,2010-05-24,"Everywhere you look today, it's as if you are seeing yourself in a mirror. Your interactions with others seem to point you back to your own thoughts and feelings that you know all too well. Still, you cannot escape the notion that you are missing information that will enable you to break out of your current rut. You are on to something important, but you'll need to give it time to rise to the surface."
taurus,2010-05-24,"There is a lot for you to do this week and you are enthused about getting started. However, you may have leftover concerns about an event that happened over the weekend and you're still not quite ready to let go of them. Think of today as a transitional period; you should be back in the full swing of things by tomorrow."
gemini,2010-05-24,"It's surprising how quickly your emotional landscape can change. If you were trying to outrun dark and gloomy clouds yesterday, the sky could clear today. Although some heavy issues won't disappear overnight, your airy feelings make it easier now to enjoy what the present moment has to offer. If you don't have time to go fly a kite, at least take a minute to visualize that you are happily soaring in the spring breeze."
cancer,2010-05-24,"An ongoing squabble could reach the point of being overwhelming, tempting you to emotionally withdraw from the situation. Unfortunately, your retreat won't solve the underlying issue. If you are only a witness to someone else's complicated struggle, disengaging is the most sensible thing to do. But it may not be kind to abandon a conversation if you are one of the two active participants. Take the high road and stick with the process until you've reach a resolution."
leo,2010-05-24,"You could be somewhat annoyed with yourself today because you are ready to enjoy life, but one thing or another keeps getting in your way. Although the obstacles may be quite real, you know that your attitude can make a big difference. Nevertheless, it's not that easy to just alter your thinking, even if you have more objectivity now. Be patient and take little steps; the big changes are just around the corner."
virgo,2010-05-24,"You have had to do your share of growing up over the past couple of years, regardless of your age. And although your ordeal may not be quite over, you are being given a chance now to clean up old business before moving on. The future may be calling, but it's more important for you to achieve balance in the present moment before jumping into the next phase."
libra,2010-05-24,"Even if you're exhausted from a recent struggle and aware that the issues are not fully resolved, you still may feel much better today. You might be concerned that your current vulnerability could lead to disappointment, but you also are intrigued by the potential of a major breakthrough in your life. Don't be afraid to take a risk in the days ahead; you cannot count on anyone else to know what's in your heart."
scorpio,2010-05-24,"It might feel as if an emotional storm is subsiding, but the squalls will continue to come and go. Fortunately, you're able to weave a tapestry in your imagination from the fragments of fantasies to create a new vision for the next phase of your life. Don't worry if your dreams are not realistic; you don't need to come up with a plan yet. For now, this is just an exercise to prepare you for what's ahead."
sagittarius,2010-05-24,"You have one foot anchored to the ground while simultaneously floating around in space today. Fortunately, your common sense will pull you through on the job now because you know what must be done and you will just do it. But your mind will probably be elsewhere as the Moon in your 11th House of Hopes and Wishes harmonizes with idealistic Neptune. Give yourself permission to dream, but make sure you still do your work."
capricorn,2010-05-24,"You feel pretty clear about your objectives, but you might not be certain how to best accomplish them today. Part of the problem is that someone may be thwarting your plans if you made an enemy along the way. It's wise to avoid confrontation now; it won't help you in the present moment. Instead, set your sights on your goal and just keep aiming in that direction. If you can minimize the distractions, your determination should carry you through."
aquarius,2010-05-24,"Life has been a bit of a roller-coaster ride as the potential for change increases. Your anticipation grows as the future encroaches on your present life, yet you still aren't sure what's going to happen. You might get frustrated if you try to fill in the details too soon, for you just don't have enough to go on yet. Instead of being so concerned with what's to come, concentrate your attention on the here and now where your immediate efforts have a positive impact."
pisces,2010-05-24,"Although love may be a ""many-splendored thing,"" it seems more like a challenge today than anything else. You might be tempted to throw in the towel if someone has been giving you a hard time or just refusing to see your point of view. But impulsive behavior is not a good idea now, especially if you're thinking about an escape route. Acknowledging your feelings doesn't mean that you must act on them."
aries,2010-05-25,"You aren't willing to go along the same path you have been following because you don't see how it will bring you satisfaction. Unfortunately, the changes you make today may not be very well thought out, nor will they likely be long lasting. Instead of flying by the seat of your pants, allow sufficient time to make a flight plan before taking off. Inaction is better now than making a wrong move."
taurus,2010-05-25,"The Moon's entry into your 7th House of Partnerships can reveal unresolved tension in a business or personal relationship. At first, it may seem as if you will be able to talk it out and resolve the problem, but it becomes apparent that it's more complicated than you thought. Stay present with your feelings and see where they lead, but don't try to force an answer too quickly."
gemini,2010-05-25,"You aren't happy if someone drags you into a complex situation where extreme emotions seem to be running amok. You may try to avoid the whole scene altogether because it makes you uncomfortable when logic is overwhelmed by irrational passions. Unfortunately, escape may not be in your cards today, so stop fighting it and just make the best of the situation. Be patient; you won't be disappointed when things start to change in a couple of days."
cancer,2010-05-25,"Your recent power struggle may not be over, even if the open conflict has settled down. Unfortunately, the relative quietness doesn't necessary mean that you are any closer to a lasting solution now. It's just that your frustration has motivated you to temporarily withdraw because you can see that you won't win. But you haven't really quit; you're just waiting for the right time to make your next move. Don't second-guess the timing; be patient and trust your intuition."
leo,2010-05-25,"You are ready for action, but your heart is telling you to remain still and wait for a better time to show your cards. Nevertheless, you really want to take a risk and lay your hand face up for everyone to see. But extreme behavior of any kind is not advised now because there is too much in flux over the next few days for any significant plan to gain traction. Hold your cards until the time is right."
virgo,2010-05-25,"You are pretty sure that you have a sound strategy for success, but somehow your ideas don't seem to translate easily into action. Your confidence makes it harder for you to willingly modify your plan, even when the course to take is obvious to everyone else. Don't let your certainty in what you know trick you into thinking that you know what to do. Remaining open to the suggestions of others could make the difference between failure and success."
libra,2010-05-25,"You could get an intuitive hit today about something you can do at work that eases the unspoken stress. Even if it's a good idea and you mean well, your strategy could still run into an obstacle, especially if someone who has been vying for power believes that you are a threat. Nevertheless, you'll help the overall situation by focusing on the common good instead of trying to improve your personal position."
scorpio,2010-05-25,"The Moon's return to your sign and her opposition with talkative Mercury are clear indicators that you will let others know exactly what you're feeling today. But your words may provoke a higher volume of emotional response than you expect. The more you try to explain yourself, the worse it could get as domineering Pluto stimulates conflict rather than understanding. Instead of changing anyone else's mind now, yours will be the only one within your sphere of influence."
sagittarius,2010-05-25,"Your intense emotional reaction to someone's rather casual remarks could be a good reason to keep your thoughts under wraps for a while. Ultimately, you owe it to yourself and your friends to share your perspective. Nevertheless, it will be more productive to wait until you can take a more rational approach than would be possible today."
capricorn,2010-05-25,"You may assume that you're everyone's friend today because you are looking out for the good of all, but others might not see it from the same perspective. Although you don't feel selfish, they could still think that your helpful actions will somehow ultimately benefit you in the long run. These differing points of view can create an uncomfortable imbalance as a struggle for control ensues. Be smart and lay low until the resistance dissipates."
aquarius,2010-05-25,"You are not afraid to take charge now that the powerful Scorpio Moon is in your 10th House of Public Responsibility. But just because you know what to do doesn't mean that others will willingly go along with your plan. In fact, you are likely to meet a silent enemy today as passive resistance stands between you and success. Instead of pushing harder against an invisible wall, relax your efforts until progress is less stressful."
pisces,2010-05-25,"There are many things going on today that could force you to alter your plans. You aren't usually this set in your ways, but now your schedule might be so tight that it's not easy for you to make the changes required to stay on track. Nevertheless, it's your flexibility that can turn a difficult situation into one that's successful for everyone involved."
aries,2010-05-26,"Things can get a little crazy today if you decide to take a risk and express yourself honestly. It's not that telling the truth is a bad idea; it's just that your timing leaves a bit to be desired. Instead of believing that you must take your shot immediately, breathe deeply and be patient. Don't be driven by your fear of missing an opportunity; there's not as much of a rush as you think."
taurus,2010-05-26,"You may be more demanding of friends and associates than you realize today, but others can misinterpret your single-mindedness as aggression. To avoid problems, be clear and say that you are only suggesting your preference. Better yet, chill out; overly assertive behavior will not bring you any closer to your goals."
gemini,2010-05-26,"It's easy for you to get so caught up in a daydream today that you miss something important that's right in front of you. Although you may be annoyed at yourself for not paying attention, you could be tempted to project your feelings and get angry with someone else. Take responsibility for your mistake; don't wait until you inadvertently hurt the feelings of an innocent friend with your misplaced frustration."
cancer,2010-05-26,"You may feel as if you need a break from the high level of emotional stress you continue to experience. Luckily, you could find small windows of opportunity today to step away from the drama. It's a bit confusing because you don't know whether the overall situation is getting better or if you are just adapting to the ongoing tension. Ultimately, it may not matter; it's important to reduce your anxiety however you can."
leo,2010-05-26,"You are at the end of a cycle, yet haven't moved into the next one, making it difficult to see where the current course will lead. You are at a fork in the road because of the pressure you feel to recommit to continue along the path you previously chose. But you can also remain open to the new options that will begin to appear over the days ahead. Don't make any big decisions yet; there's still time to choose which way to go."
virgo,2010-05-26,"If fuzzy thinking has somehow crept into your work plans, it may be difficult to untangle your schedule for the day. Perhaps you forgot about a deadline or mixed up a commitment. Avoid taking a risk to put things back in order because you could complicate the situation even more. Instead, fall back on being methodical, even if you must let someone down in the process."
libra,2010-05-26,"You might feel as if you have run out of time at work and that you should have applied yourself harder to your job. But others may not be as judgmental of your efforts as you are today. Nevertheless, you still may be happier now if you simply accept where you are and move on. You'll only waste precious time if you get lost wondering what you could have done differently."
scorpio,2010-05-26,"You may not be easy for others to deal with today because you feel secure enough to share your point of view, even if it doesn't conform to anyone else's expectations. Fortunately, your honesty doesn't surprise those who know you, for what you have to say is not out of character. Just remember that you don't need to place undue blame on others; they already know what they have done. You can speak the truth from your heart while still being kind."
sagittarius,2010-05-26,"It might feel as if you have come to the end of a long road, one that you should have already abandoned. You may wonder if you are trying to take an idea too far, but this isn't the smartest time to doubt your previous choices. You need all your faculties focused on the present moment because you have to do some tricky navigating in the next few days. Don't second-guess what brought you to this point or where you are heading in the future. Concentrate on the power of now."
capricorn,2010-05-26,"Although you may be stressed by resistance to your plans today, it's not necessary to revise them. You have probably already put your thoughts in order; now you have to wait for others to catch up to your ideas. Don't panic and gamble with your future; impulsive actions and reckless behavior have no place in your current strategy at this time."
aquarius,2010-05-26,"If you come up with some crazy, harebrained scheme today that sounds too good to be true, it probably is. It would not be a smart idea to distract others with an unorthodox plan until you have developed it sufficiently to warrant the attention that it might deserve. You could be at the edge of a significant breakthrough and will want as many people as possible to support you, so don't act before you consider all the angles."
pisces,2010-05-26,Your fantasies don't seem like dreams at all today and this juxtaposition of illusion and reality can tempt you to take a bold yet foolish risk. You have likely made more gains than you realize and an ill-considered gamble could precipitate a serious setback. Your smartest strategy now is to make no sudden moves; patience is your best option.
aries,2010-05-27,"You may be getting tired of waiting for a door to open and your restlessness could get the best of you today. But it's crucial that you keep your mind from wandering because things could change very quickly now. Focus your full attention on what's happening moment by moment, for your ability to respond swiftly to subtle developments will increase your chances for success."
taurus,2010-05-27,"You may feel as if someone has a special skill that could help you, but you don't want to overstep the boundaries of your current relationship. Asking others for assistance isn't easy and you might not know how to open a discussion on this sensitive topic. Don't give up; a sudden attitude shift may allow you to relax enough to approach the subject with ease."
gemini,2010-05-27,"Today's Full Moon increases your confidence and brightens your 7th House of Partnerships, creating the potential to make new friends. Honor your current need for excitement by seeking innovative ways to interact with others. Don't expect to attract the same kind of companions that you have in the past. Be brave and don't look back."
cancer,2010-05-27,"Others may not see the change in you today, but you are quite aware of the difference. You are less interested in your security than you are in breaking out of old patterns. Normally, you might take tentative steps on a new journey until you felt comfortable. However, this time you want immediate results and may be willing to sacrifice your safety for a little excitement. Don't wait for something to occur in the future; make it happen now."
leo,2010-05-27,"You can't decide whether you are totally jazzed about the possibilities ahead or if you're scared out of your mind. Either way, you know there are big changes afoot even if you don't know what to do about them. Consider throwing caution to the wind and living the life of your dreams. If you don't take initiative now, at least talk about your future as if you had unlimited free will. Expressing what's in your heart will help to lift your spirits."
virgo,2010-05-27,"You may feel as if there's been enough change in your life recently and you would like to be excused from the next round. Unfortunately there are no hall passes being issued at this time; your attendance is mandatory. Fortunately, you are a fast study and your hard work will attract the recognition you deserve as long as you don't spread yourself too thin."
libra,2010-05-27,"Your optimism may have encouraged you to say yes before you thought about what your commitment really meant. Now you could find yourself behind the eight-ball if you made too many well-intended promises. But there's no time to waste worrying about the past. Make your apologies, if necessary, and adjust your schedule to fulfill your obligations the best you can."
scorpio,2010-05-27,"You have lofty ideas now about what you can do, but you may not have the drive to fulfill your fantasies. However, this is not about being a failure; it's about learning how to set realistic goals so you don't have to keep altering your course. You can start by breaking an old habit and changing your relationship with your job. Taking more time for yourself doesn't necessarily mean accomplishing less; it just means working smarter."
sagittarius,2010-05-27,"It's rare for you to be so overwhelmed that you don't know what to do with yourself. Nevertheless, today's Full Moon in your sign can create so much excitement that it's difficult for you to remain rational. There are so many amazing possibilities and several of them look extremely appealing to you. Breathe deeply and remember that you have the power to change your perspective, slow down the hectic pace of reality, and maintain your equilibrium -- even now."
capricorn,2010-05-27,"The cavalier Sagittarius Full Moon activates your 12th House of Secrets, but hiding your confidence is not to your advantage. You may be a closet optimist now if you think that you will benefit by showing your more serious side. But this kind of duplicity will only lead others to withhold their trust. Letting your true self shine through -- even if it's less than conventional -- will inspire the support you need."
aquarius,2010-05-27,"Your key planet Uranus awakens you with an energizing bolt of lightning today as it enters bold Aries and your 3rd House of Communication. But you won't be satisfied with just talking to those closest to you now; you want to extend your outreach as far as possible. As networking becomes more important, don't lose sight of the heart-centered relationships that continue to add special meaning to your personal life."
pisces,2010-05-27,"It's like graduation day for you; after seven years of erratic Uranus in your sign, you are finished studying at the School of Unexpected Changes. Today, Uranus leaves fishy Pisces to enter enterprising Aries and your 2nd House of Self-Worth. You are beginning a long-lasting phase when you can improve your self-esteem and find ways to increase your income. Start by setting new goals at work but remember that the improvements will not happen overnight."
aries,2010-05-28,"It's healthy to be enthused about what you are doing or what you hope to do in the future, but today you'll need to be careful so you don't exhaust yourself. Often your waves of fervor can come and go quickly. Now, however, you are stepping into new territory and you may be required to sustain a high level of intensity for an extended period of time. Don't burn all the logs on the fire at once; save some energy for later."
taurus,2010-05-28,"You don't like the idea of having to respond to so much change all at once; you prefer a slower and more methodical approach. But there's no time to waste now, so you might as well set aside your resistance and find a way to go with the flow. Don't take your anxiety out on someone else; resistance really is futile."
gemini,2010-05-28,"Skip your morning coffee; your world is popping and you have a better chance of enjoying the high-frequency buzz of the day if you don't overdo it. Nevertheless, the temptation may be irresistible because everything looks like a potential good time. Unfortunately, each avenue of exploration is also a possible distraction. Be discriminating or you'll end up facing the music at the end of the day when you realize what you didn't accomplish."
cancer,2010-05-28,"You may think about setting aside your normal concerns to take a risk at work today, but ultimately your common sense will probably prevail. Either way, you might wish you took the other path. If you decide to go for it, don't be disappointed with falling short of your goals. If you let an opportunity slip, don't be hard on yourself because more chances are on the way. Consider the current situation a practice run for the possibilities ahead."
leo,2010-05-28,"You know what you need to do now and you're okay about doing it. Still, you might be left with an empty feeling in the pit of your stomach because something isn't quite right, yet you cannot put your reaction into words. Even if you are very busy today, take time for quiet contemplation so you don't lose sight of what's most important to you."
virgo,2010-05-28,"It's not very reassuring when you have to assimilate so much new information all at once. You would rather it arrived at a regulated pace so you have time to process the news and remain open to what's next. Unfortunately, you could be deprived of this luxury now, without any ability to slow things down. You can, however, take charge in small ways by filtering out anything that's not pertinent to your immediate future."
libra,2010-05-28,"You might want to run and hide from someone today because you're attempting to minimize the unpredictability in your life. But even if others seem a bit too wired for your laid-back style now, you'll probably still miss the exhilaration as soon as you retreat. Acknowledging your ambiguity can help relieve your current level of frustration."
scorpio,2010-05-28,"You aren't usually bothered by an emotionally intense interaction because it can often pave the way to intimacy. But another person's avoidance of an issue now is enough to make you want to scream. Someone could push your buttons today when he or she stubbornly resists taking a conversation to the next level. The more you try to broach the subject, the greater the tension becomes. Rise above your personal agenda; save the talk for another day when others are willing to meet you halfway."
sagittarius,2010-05-28,"It's challenging for you to relax today because you don't want to miss anything while you rest. You may be fearful that someone will gain an edge over you if you're not up on the latest news. But then, if you do learn something new, you could be annoyed that you have to integrate it into your existing perspective because that might mean extra work. Stop trying to second-guess what you should or shouldn't do. If it's important, you'll find out about it in due time."
capricorn,2010-05-28,"You have a story to tell today, but it may be a challenge to find the right person to listen. You don't want to open up your heart to just anyone; it needs to be someone that truly understands you. But your words can elicit an unexpected reaction that derails your original intention. Nevertheless, be willing to follow the conversation where it leads; you might be surprised by what you learn."
aquarius,2010-05-28,"You have big ideas that involve others, but it could get tricky trying to convince them to join you. It's hard for you to understand why anyone would resist the possibility of a memorable activity, but your idea of a good time isn't the same as everyone else's. You'll find more fulfillment today if you spend less energy being a ringleader and more time listening to others."
pisces,2010-05-28,"You may feel like a mother hen today as you try to take everyone at work under your wings. But you could push your compassion in action too far by letting your own responsibilities slide while you help one more person who needs your assistance. Remember, even doing good deeds has its limits. Save some time and energy for yourself or you won't have any available for anyone else."
aries,2010-05-29,"Although today starts out easy enough, running into a difficulty could make you reconsider your strategy. You may question the path you have chosen for yourself, even if you have been optimistic about your future. Fortunately, your self-doubt won't likely last for very long. Nevertheless, be careful not to overdo it by attempting to make up for lost time once you're back on track."
taurus,2010-05-29,"You might truly believe that you are being more practical than ever today, but you could be misleading yourself. If you're playing catch-up, you'll be tempted to take a risk. Or you may try so hard that your extra efforts actually get in your way. Instead of worrying about doing the right thing, just do what comes naturally. Aligning your actions with your intent will help you reach your goals."
gemini,2010-05-29,"A friend who has been telling you to be more adventurous may suddenly turn on you today. Fortunately, you won't likely listen to someone who assumes authority without having really earned it. Still, it's a smart idea to avoid open conflict if you find yourself in a power struggle with a previous ally who is now standing in your way. The tension will subside on its own if you are willing to wait it out."
cancer,2010-05-29,"You could receive a helping hand from an unknown person today. Or perhaps something just fatefully slips into place as if angels were watching over you. But fulfilling your destiny won't come easily, so be prepared for a difficult road ahead. Nevertheless, focusing on your goals, even if distracted by an odd twist of circumstances, should minimize your delays."
leo,2010-05-29,"You don't know what to make of the rapidly changing work situation you are facing now. You shift from being okay to not okay and back in just a few minutes. Although this may be confusing to you, it can be truly disconcerting to others. Consequently, it's smart to keep your mood swings to yourself until they settle down. Be patient; you will gain clarity in the days ahead."
virgo,2010-05-29,"You are feeling quite self-assured today and maybe even a bit self-righteous. But your confidence could put others off, especially if it doesn't seem to match up with what's actually happening. Instead of appearing to be capable now, you might come across as pompous or even overbearing. Lay low or tone down your enthusiasm so you don't stir up resistance that you don't want."
libra,2010-05-29,"You see opportunities all around you, but cannot seem to turn them into anything real today. Instead, you could waste a lot of time chasing rainbows, only to discover that someone else stole the pot of gold before you arrived on the scene. Ease up; there's no need to try so hard. If you relax a bit, good fortune will come to you on its own accord."
scorpio,2010-05-29,"You may feel as if you can't win, no matter what you do today. If you decide to change your mind, you might later wish that you hadn't. If you hold on to your recent decision, you could be frustrated at yourself for being too rigid. But neither of these approaches means you will fail to reach your goal. Remember, there's a big difference between judging yourself harshly and actually missing your mark."
sagittarius,2010-05-29,"You might feel like a yo-yo today as your moods swing up and down, again and again. Just as you figure things out, your perspective shifts along with your goals. Others may tire of listening to your latest and greatest plan, especially if you present it each time as if it is your closing argument. Don't be in a hurry to deliver your final answer, because it's going to change before you know it."
capricorn,2010-05-29,"The Moon's return to your sign today may not be very relaxing because of the intense feelings that she brings. Don't be so certain that an impulsive urge will set you on the right track, even if it seems like the right thing to do. Keep in mind that it's senseless now to engage in philosophical debates that have nothing to do with the practicalities you must manage."
aquarius,2010-05-29,"You might think that your persistence will pay off today, but sticking with a plan doesn't necessarily guarantee progress. In fact, success is more likely tied to your flexibility now than to sheer determination. Show others how well you can listen and that you're able to incorporate their best ideas into your own strategy."
pisces,2010-05-29,"Avoid making any long-term decisions because your thinking is all over the map today. It would be easy to make a bad choice now because you can see the big picture just fine, but you may not be able to concentrate on the details. Nevertheless, you still could create an innovative plan; just remember that it will need further development and clarification in the days ahead."
aries,2010-05-30,"You are aware of the high level of excitement in your life now, but you realize that you must maintain your cool. No matter how eccentric you feel, it's critical to filter out some of your more eclectic opinions so you can make your points on the most important facts. You can still take a radical approach; just keep in mind that others are counting on you to be real."
taurus,2010-05-30,"You don't want to be perceived as always being predictable. You might become so bored with yourself today that you do something unusual. Other people may be surprised, but it's exactly those same old expectations that you are now trying to rattle. Remember, there's no need to overstate your case, so don't go too far trying to express your individuality."
gemini,2010-05-30,"You are like a lightning rod, attracting attention by saying outrageous things today. It's not out of character for you to be clever, but now you are more likely to go out of your way to elicit a strong response. However, your shocking behavior could stir deeper emotions than you want to handle. You don't have to share every crazy idea that passes through your mind. Keep some thoughts to yourself."
cancer,2010-05-30,You may try to avoid an intense emotional interaction today by bringing the conversation back to the basic facts. It's not that you're disinterested in feelings; you just don't want to be overwhelmed by a topic that you cannot easily manage. Consider setting boundaries in a way that allows you to face your fears rather than run from them.
leo,2010-05-30,"It's one of those days when you are hyper-aware of the difference between the events in your life and your inner processing. You understand what's appropriate now and are able to move through a situation without having to bring up what's troubling you. Keeping conversations simple is a good idea. The fewer words you say, the less likely you'll open a can of worms."
virgo,2010-05-30,"Normally, you have the ability to focus your thoughts, even when you're in a situation that is full of distractions. However, it's not so easy for you to stay on track today because your ideas are lighting up whole new worlds of possibilities. Don't try to shut off this exciting intellectual current or you'll just end up frustrated. Instead, listen to your inner voice, but keep reminding yourself to come back to center in between your little mental excursions."
libra,2010-05-30,"Today you have glimmers of titillating experiences that seem to be just beyond your reach. You could end up disheartened if you mistakenly believe you can make a current fantasy real now. But if you allow the mental pictures to come and go without attempting to pull them in or push them away, you could end up closer to your dreams than you expect."
scorpio,2010-05-30,"Your gift today is that you can talk about a difficult subject in a manner that is easy for others to handle. You don't need to play the role of the heavyweight to make your point. Your friends will appreciate your direct honesty as long as they don't feel blamed in the process. If something is on your mind, go ahead and say it, but be succinct and take full responsibility for your perspective."
sagittarius,2010-05-30,"You can feel the constriction today, as if you are a snake that is outgrowing its skin. Although your strategy may be to hold still and wait it out, one really deep breath is all it would take to shed your old exterior. Be careful, for there may be an inner voice counseling you to go ahead and break through whatever restraints are now holding you back. Nevertheless, caution is advised; don't do anything you might regret."
capricorn,2010-05-30,"You are more pensive than usual today as your key planet Saturn apparently stands still to end its retrograde phase. You, too, may be immovable, obstinately holding on to an ambitious goal in spite of the hard work required. But concentrating on your ultimate destination is a challenge with so many distractions on the home front. Nevertheless, your current intentions will carry a lot of weight in the future."
aquarius,2010-05-30,"You may feel as if you are caught in the middle of a tug-of-war with your anticipation pulling you into the future and your fear of change pulling you back into the past. Naturally, you lean toward the excitement of what's ahead, but your thoughts still anchor you to the status quo. Even if you cannot rationally justify your actions, taking a calculated risk is better than letting the moment pass without doing anything at all."
pisces,2010-05-30,"You can gain much-needed strength from your friends today, for they seem to have the common sense that you lack. You may feel as if you have already tried the obvious ways to resolve an existing problem and are ready for a totally outside-the-box approach. But you could destabilize your day if you act out of frustration. Meanwhile, an additional perspective might be just what you need to bring you back to the basics."
aries,2010-05-31,"You may be unsure of yourself today, even if you thought that you already knew what you wanted. Recent experiences have opened your mind and you can see new possibilities that lie outside of your previously constructed definitions. Your awareness has grown and there's no way to fit it back inside the old container. Nevertheless, a lingering nostalgia makes you uncomfortable about leaving the past behind, so acknowledge your ambivalence and move slowly toward your future."
taurus,2010-05-31,"It appears that you should be able to escape from your mundane world of responsibility today, but your freedom is only temporary. Although your daydreams have the potential to become real, you won't be able to sustain them for very long. No matter what you have planned, you'll still need to return to take care of unfinished business before the day is done. In the meantime, enjoy yourself while you can."
gemini,2010-05-31,"The noise in your life settles down today, but you still might not be able to relax enough to thoroughly enjoy the pleasures available to you. Perhaps you are annoyed about having to fulfill a previous commitment, especially if something more interesting arises. Keep in mind that it's all about your attitude. There's no one else to blame if you are unable to appreciate what you have in the current moment."
cancer,2010-05-31,"As much as you desire satisfaction, it may be too much of a struggle to actually ask for what you want now. But it's not about feeling shy; it's more about the challenge of putting your needs into words. Unfortunately, no one will know what would bring you happiness unless you try to express yourself. Even if you don't hit your mark, at least you can start a conversation that can point others in the right direction."
leo,2010-05-31,"It would be wonderful if someone came forward to offer you the escape from reality that you need today. It's not that you are interested in avoiding your real world obligations; it's just that you could really use some downtime. But don't wait for an unrealistic dream to come true. Make a plan that's based on something you can make happen on your own. If someone shows up to share in the fun, it will be the icing on your cake."
virgo,2010-05-31,"You might try to split your day into two parts, one for work and one for play. You want to be responsible and do what's expected of you, but you don't want to miss out on having a good time. The key to your current happiness is making a realistic plan and then sticking to it. If you think about your day in advance, you'll be able to utilize your time efficiently so you can join in the fun and still finish your chores later."
libra,2010-05-31,"You are exceptionally eager to make everyone feel comfortable today, even if you're not the one who is in charge. But you can see where others are falling down on the job and it's tempting to step in and take over. Unfortunately, your idealism can lead to frustration because the task is bigger than it seems. Scale back your expectations and you will have a better chance at finding happiness."
scorpio,2010-05-31,Everyone seems to be off chasing unattainable dreams today and you may feel like the only person around who is being realistic. But your practical approach now may be a form of self-protection that shields you from potential disappointment. You don't need to sacrifice your common sense in order to entertain improbable possibilities. Reach beyond the mundane while still keeping one foot securely on the ground.
sagittarius,2010-05-31,"You may feel as if you are lost in a dream today and don't know how to find your way back to reality. Fortunately, it's not necessarily a difficult situation because you can have a unique experience once you let go of control and enjoy it. Give yourself permission to have an amazing adventure, just like Alice in Wonderland. Don't worry; you'll be back in time to meet your obligations with a fantastic tale to tell."
capricorn,2010-05-31,"Although you haven't lost touch with your ambitions, you're willing to set them aside for a while so you can explore less productive avenues of self-expression. Paradoxically, you may learn an important lesson today by blindly following your fantasies instead of calculating the potential return on each bit of energy you expend. Give yourself a vacation, even if it's just for a few hours. You'll return to reality rejuvenated and ready for the next round of work."
aquarius,2010-05-31,"You can sense the world changing around you and the speed can be quite dizzying. Today, however, you want to leave the chaos behind and catch your breath. But your peaceful dreams are not easily turned into reality and the harder you try, the fainter they become. You may feel panicky, as if you are going to miss your chance. Nevertheless, there's no need to worry, so set your fears aside and focus your awareness on making the most of the present moment."
pisces,2010-05-31,"You may feel as if you're in the House of Mirrors as your key planet Neptune subtly alters reality today. Be careful; illusory Neptune can be tricky as it lures you into unfamiliar territory now without warning you about where you are going. Fortunately, once you accept that nothing is quite as it seems, you won't be naively hooked into something that isn't even real."
aries,2010-06-01,"You like the feeling of waking up in a different world today where the potential outweighs your fears. The rules have changed and the focus is no longer on the past. As amazed as you are, you don't know what to expect. But like Dorothy in the ""Wizard of Oz,"" you don't have time to intellectualize the current situation. Events are unfolding at a rapid clip and you must respond to them without delay. Stay present with your excitement; you can analyze what happened later on."
taurus,2010-06-01,"You may be stressed by your inability to logically describe what's going on in your life now. It's not that anything bad is indicated; it's just that you would feel better if you knew where the current events were leading. Nevertheless, you have an opportunity now to envision your ideal future, without the pressure of having to make it real. Set aside your concrete goals for just a little while and let your imagination be your guide."
gemini,2010-06-01,"It's as if you are standing on the top of a hill, which allows you to see a bit further into the distance today. But what you perceive may not be an accurate reflection of what's out there. Instead, your inner world is now projected onto your surroundings, enabling you to explore a variety of scenarios before narrowing your options. Choose your goal visually, not rationally; once you have looked at the possibilities, head in the direction of your future."
cancer,2010-06-01,"It's challenging for you to coordinate your natural desire for security with your current career goals. You may need to risk some of your apparent safety in order to make progress at work. But feeling vulnerable is not as scary as the thought of missing a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Even if the future doesn't turn out quite as rosy as it now looks, you'll never forgive yourself if you don't give it your best shot."
leo,2010-06-01,"Your network of friends is changing now, yet it won't be as hard as it seems to let the old ones go. A recent acquaintance might better reflect your current interests, quickly filling in the gaps created by your evolving needs. Instead of holding on to your past, embrace the potential that enters your life through an exciting new relationship or by reinvigorating an existing one."
virgo,2010-06-01,"You could temporarily turn into a nerd as you get so excited about an idea that you lose track of your emotions today. Being detached from your feelings can help you think more clearly, but intellectualizing a decision also separates you from your heart. Pay attention to your rational analysis of the current situation, but don't forget to take time to go deeper and listen to your gut."
libra,2010-06-01,"You are in a more playful mood today with the Moon in your creative 5th House. Luckily, you are not restrained now by the same weighty issues that have been recently on your mind. Enjoy your new-found freedom and explore ways to express yourself. Just keep in mind that you still need to be a bit cautious or you'll end up wasting time on an unrealistic idea that leads nowhere."
scorpio,2010-06-01,"You may be looking for ways to lessen your responsibilities on the home front because your freedom is more important to you now than ever before. It's not that you are eager to walk out on your obligations; it's just that you don't want others to assume that you'll always show up on demand. Fortunately, you can express your needs today without having to raise awkward feelings. Stating your boundaries is necessary if you want others to start respecting them."
sagittarius,2010-06-01,"The willful Sun illuminates your key planet Jupiter today, now finishing up its current visit to your 4th House of Home and Family. Domestic issues that have been bubbling up for a while now reach a critical point, forcing you to take a stand. Luckily, you are able to see the positive side of a difficult situation. Remember, your attitude is more crucial than your actual choice, so don't diminish your power by feeding fantasies of self-doubt."
capricorn,2010-06-01,"Your unwavering belief in the good of others goes a long way now to attract people that truly care about you. Your upbeat communication style surely makes a difference, for it's not easy to harbor negativity in your presence. But don't take your optimism so far that everyone loses faith in your ability to make sensible judgments. You can be self-assured without going into denial."
aquarius,2010-06-01,"You can think clearly and express your feelings, thanks to the Moon's return to your sign this morning. You are not seeking approval now; you only want acknowledgment. Fortunately, you don't need to worry about how others will react to what you say, for you realize that it won't affect the truth of your words. Be genuine and you will be accepted for exactly who you are."
pisces,2010-06-01,"You may feel as if your dreams are slipping away today, but happily they are being replaced by the possibility of turning them into reality. Still, you might indulge yourself with one more meandering trip through your favorite fantasies now before you release them. Remember, this isn't about letting go of your hopes; it's about using your visions to create the future."
aries,2010-06-02,"Your life is more complex than it appears, but you won't let others see how much you are keeping to yourself today because it's easier if you downplay your unorthodox interests. For now, it's a smart strategy to restrain impulsive actions, for your need to be independent may clash with your current desire to build lasting relationships. Remember, you don't need to share all your thoughts and fantasies with anyone else unless that's what you want to do."
taurus,2010-06-02,"You have a very concrete understanding about what is the right thing to do in a relationship today. Unfortunately, you might not have a lot of fun if you choose the responsible path over the more playful one now. But you get to enjoy yourself in a different way as your self-discipline enables you to prepare for the future, which can bring you longer lasting satisfaction."
gemini,2010-06-02,"Even a strong dose of common sense may not be enough to keep you on task today because you are distracted by the light of your own brilliance. But shiny objects aren't as enticing as great ideas now, so you may not be motivated to work harder by the prospects of more money. Fortunately, a unique approach to your current job might enable you to make the breakthrough you need if you remember to keep focusing on your goals."
cancer,2010-06-02,"It's doubly hard for you to express your feelings today. If you find yourself in a deep discussion with a critical person, your fear of rejection is heightened and you might be tempted to withdraw to protect your security. But even if you are able to face the resistance and overcome it, your words still don't flow easily because your emotions have temporarily gone quiet. Be patient, for it's tricky to know exactly where your changing moods will lead you."
leo,2010-06-02,"Your expectations are extremely high today, making it very likely that a close friend or family member could let you down. But others may not be able to muster up enough self--discipline to rise above the confusion. If someone very close to you seems to lose his way, don't attempt to make a heroic rescue. Temporary emotional withdrawal may be your smartest strategy so you can focus on achieving your goals and setting an example for everyone else."
virgo,2010-06-02,"Nearly every task that comes your way today is an opportunity for your smart thinking to reveal a new and exciting method that saves everyone time. But it's crucial to know when to quit or you'll spend all day seeking the next breakthrough, even when the old tried and true way would have worked fine. Sometimes the same old approach is the most reliable thing you can do."
libra,2010-06-02,"Your key planet Venus is in your 10th House of Career, bringing you positive recognition at work. But with taskmaster Saturn also in the equation, you'll need to put in extra effort and give your assignments all you can. Don't expect anything less than wonderful results, for even if you don't quite meet your goals, your success will be greatly affected by your optimistic attitude."
scorpio,2010-06-02,"You are able to shine brightly because you see the good wherever you look today. But this doesn't mean that blind optimism is a wise strategy; it will only inflate and then dash your expectations. Nevertheless, your willingness to assume the best outcome could open a door to an opportunity that you would have just walked by at another time in your life."
sagittarius,2010-06-02,"You aren't interested now in undertaking a major project by yourself. Fortunately, your life is full of capable and well-educated people, so you expect it to be easy to find someone willing to work with you. Don't give up in your search for a business or personal partner now, even if everyone seems too busy or scattered. Accepting less than you want may seem wise, but it's even better to wait for the right person."
capricorn,2010-06-02,"Your key planet Saturn is softened by an aspect from lovely Venus today. Normally, hard-nosed Saturn and gentle Venus don't play well together, but now, Saturn's cold demeanor is warmed by Venus's heat. Find the balance between knowing what you want and realizing that you cannot fulfill every desire. Pick your potential pleasures carefully for your best shot at happiness."
aquarius,2010-06-02,"You are like the mythical Icarus today, flying too high for your own good. Icarus soared so close to the Sun that his wings of wax melted and he fell into the sea. Don't be so blinded by your own illuminating ideas that you lose sight of the practical realities that govern your life. It's more important now to be responsible than it is to be a genius."
pisces,2010-06-02,"You may be undecided about a personal issue because you can see both sides now. Your excitement tempts you to say yes and jump into a new project, but your heightened common sense is screaming no. If you don't expect too much too fast, the long-term prognosis is excellent. Keep in mind that a forced decision today will only lead you to change your mind farther down the road. Take your time before making a final choice."
aries,2010-06-03,"You might believe that you have your finger on the pulse of events today, but you may actually see reality as you wish it to be and not as it is. Your apparent certainty can be misleading to others as they take you at face value. Do everyone a favor and acknowledge your disorientation before you create trouble. Your happiness now depends upon your ability to be honest with yourself."
taurus,2010-06-03,You may be somewhat concerned today that you're losing your sense of good judgment at work if things happen for no apparent reason. But this isn't really about your inability to make choices; it's more about the fuzziness of your perceptions. Putting off the most important decisions for a few days is a smart idea because this will give you additional time to clarify your goals.
gemini,2010-06-03,"Your imagination is working overtime as every little occurrence triggers cascades of fantasies today. You may even be lucky enough to enjoy the show, but you could become so entranced by them that you share your flights of fancy with others as if they were real plans. You might not be able to stop the daydreaming now, but you can simplify your life by keeping the visions to yourself."
cancer,2010-06-03,"You may think that you finally have a plan, until you seek approval from someone else. A very close friend or lover could complicate your life now by trying to change your mind as you attempt to resolve an emotional dilemma. Unfortunately, others may not be able to understand how deep your feelings run, especially if you don't usually share your innermost processes. It may be a good idea to keep your ideas quiet for another day or two until you feel more confident about where you stand."
leo,2010-06-03,"Everyone seems a bit spacey today, but this may speak more about you than about anyone else. Although you have been pushing harder to gain more clarity in your life, the truth still seems elusive. You could overcompensate in your attempt to banish delusional thinking and reduce your own creativity in the process. What you criticize in others as off the wall is likely just an extension of your own self-judgment. When you become more accepting of yourself, everything else will appear to be more positive, too."
virgo,2010-06-03,"You may be feeling befuddled at work because you aren't sure of your role. Even if you have had a long history at your job, things are changing in ways that are difficult to understand. Instead of wasting time listing all the pros and cons of your current situation, drop the analysis. For now, just show up and do what's expected of you; set aside the major decisions until you're more certain about where you want to go."
libra,2010-06-03,"This can be a brilliant day of inspirational communication, but you'll need to seek out the right person or your thinking will quickly degenerate into mindless chatter. However, you truly want your conversations to be deep today; no lighthearted cocktail party banter will do. Discussing your options with someone you trust will help you take control of your life."
scorpio,2010-06-03,"You are quite content to be in motion, even if this means that you don't have a place to stop and rest today. However, your closest friends may not notice your anxiety, especially if you believe that telling them about your feelings would only complicate your life now. Don't blame others for their lack of support, unless you are willing to open up and share more of your process with them."
sagittarius,2010-06-03,"You are feeling very attached to your memories now as a current experience reminds you of an event in your previously forgotten past. But nostalgia isn't emotionally fulfilling today, so you would rather look forward to the big changes ahead. Think before you speak, and be careful that your outspoken approach doesn't hurt an old friend or lover. Letting go of the past helps you move toward the future."
capricorn,2010-06-03,"Nothing is more fulfilling today than having intimate discussions with close friends. Normally, you would want these kinds of conversations to pertain to your most down-to-earth goals. Now, however, you're more interested in exploring the murky waters of your imagination than being trapped in the boring real world. There's no need to feel guilty about your current desire to escape because you'll come back to your work feeling refreshed and ready to go."
aquarius,2010-06-03,"It's challenging to express yourself clearly because your feelings are all over the map today. Once you start talking, you may go through a wide range of emotions very quickly, making it hard for others to keep up with your mood swings. Fortunately, a more thoughtful approach will enable you to minimize the uncertainty that could arise from a breakdown in communication."
pisces,2010-06-03,"The Moon's entry to your sign today increases your overall sensitivity and, perhaps, even allows you to be more psychic than usual. But someone's inability to accept your non-rational approach to life can make you feel very insecure now. Don't waste your time responding to criticism or accusations; instead, be proud of your natural ability to tune into the creative and imaginative parts of your brain."
aries,2010-06-04,"Your ruling planet Mars is in your 5th House of Creativity, but its opposition to fuzzy Neptune can muddle your choices today. Take as much time as you need before making a decision because an impulsive judgment call could lead you down a dead-end path now, even if you think that you're doing the right thing. It's crucial to figure out the truth, for self-deception will only create trouble in your interactions with others."
taurus,2010-06-04,"You may not be able to see what's ahead because of unclear directions you are receiving from your boss. Instead of attempting to gain additional clarity about your professional goals now, it's smarter to wait it out and let the issues resolve on their own. But don't be afraid to make an important personal decision just because you feel blocked at work. You can still make progress on the home front if you try."
gemini,2010-06-04,"You may have all your facts gathered neatly in place, yet you could still draw the wrong conclusion from all the right data. It's as if your ability to generalize is hampered today because you want to take everything too far. It's one thing to know what's true; deciding what to do with all your information is an entirely different issue. Think twice before doing something that you might soon regret."
cancer,2010-06-04,"It's confusing when your intuition is so strong because you cannot justify your actions. You want to trust your feelings because you know how psychically inclined you are today. Your hunches may be correct, yet it's challenging to discern a cause-and-effect relationship between the facts at your disposal and your emotional response to what's happening. Stop trying to over-intellectualize everything; just act on your instincts."
leo,2010-06-04,"You may be so sensitive today that you know things that are beyond your range of experience. Although events can occur that demonstrate your intuitive accuracy, you should treat this new-found ability with care. Even if your chances of being correct are pretty good, they aren't perfect -- so don't assume you're right before you check out your conclusions with reality."
virgo,2010-06-04,"You stand to make a significant breakthrough, but you'll need to suspend your disbelief today in order to do it. Unfortunately, progress will be difficult to come by if you try to make a plan based only on rational thinking. Instead, take a leap of faith. Nothing is holding you back from your fate except your fear of the unknown."
libra,2010-06-04,"Normally, you can see both sides of an issue, but your ability to remain detached could be a bit unreliable today. Surreal Neptune steps in the path of physical Mars, throwing you off balance and pulling you one way or the other. You still may not know exactly what you want, but your actions now could do more to decide your future than you realize."
scorpio,2010-06-04,"You know what you need to do today but you may have a hard time initiating action. Your strategy at work could be muddled by your current uncertainty about your professional goals. Even if you thought you knew exactly what you wanted, dreams from the past resurface to confuse your present aspirations with older ones. Once you give yourself permission to float for a day or two, you won't be so frustrated by your apparent lack of commitment."
sagittarius,2010-06-04,"This is not a great day to start a project because you could easily deceive yourself about how much work it will take. Eagerness may turn into discouragement as the truth begins to surface. Instead of pushing too hard against the prevailing currents today, lay low and wait until you get a sign that the time to act has arrived."
capricorn,2010-06-04,"Your strong need for stability may be challenged by an enigmatic situation today. The more you try to decipher the current circumstances, the more perplexing they become. You may wish that you could retreat to safer ground, but even that path is more complicated than you wish. Paradoxically, once you realize that there's nowhere you have to go now, it becomes easier to stay exactly where you are."
aquarius,2010-06-04,"You have something on your mind today and nothing will prevent you from sharing your truth. But you could easily say too much, turning a concise idea into a rambling string of thoughts that bewilders others. Using fewer words will help you make your point clearly, but don't assume that your actions speak louder than your words. You'll still need to clarify your intentions because no one will understand your true motivation without an explanation."
pisces,2010-06-04,"You may be able to tap into the mysterious energies from a parallel universe today, but you won't be able to rationally account for what occurs. Unfortunately, attempts to resist the current cosmic forces may produce weird results. The outcome is equally difficult if you push the planetary players too hard. Instead, taking a wait-and-see position may be your best bet for peace of mind."
aries,2010-06-05,"It feels as if you have been fighting an uphill battle for a while. Even with sufficient motivation and stamina, you still might not have made the progress that you expected you would. But don't get discouraged because the minor setbacks you face today will seem less important by tomorrow. It's not time to give up since you're on the threshold of your dream."
taurus,2010-06-05,"You may be eager to spend time with friends today, but prior obligations prevent you from doing whatever you wish. Although it's tempting to blame someone else for the restraints you currently face, taking full responsibility for your day can be quite empowering. Instead of playing the role of a victim, take control and schedule your time so you can have fun and also do what you promised."
gemini,2010-06-05,"You may think that you have been given special dispensation today, and that you can bend the rules even more than usual. Chances are that you will be able to get away with your little scheme for a while, but your karma will catch up with you pretty quickly. Ultimately, it's not worth trying to escape from reality now; if you do what you're supposed to do, the rewards could arrive sooner than you think."
cancer,2010-06-05,"You could feel safe enough today to express feelings that you have been keeping to yourself, subsequently making you vulnerable to the feedback you receive. Unfortunately, a close friend or family member may be overly judgmental, sending you into an emotional tailspin. But don't waste time indulging negativity because something good will come from your openhearted disclosure. Be patient; it might take a few days for the positive results to manifest."
leo,2010-06-05,"You could have an unseen angel working on your behalf now. Fortunately, you won't have to wait too long to experience the rewards you seek. Nevertheless, you'll still need to traverse some bumpy territory today as you face financial pressure or emotional restraints. Don't forget to acknowledge your allies because it's good to be grateful for the extra helping hands."
virgo,2010-06-05,"You could be overwhelmed with information now, as you quickly try to find places for all the bits of data you have collected. But you run into constraints of time, money and energy that get in the way of your productivity. Nevertheless, don't worry too much because you are being more effective than you realize -- even if it takes a few more days for you to see what you already accomplished."
libra,2010-06-05,"Although you are generally feeling positive about what's ahead, you hear your own voice of self-judgment today, making you think that you aren't doing enough. Nothing will be gained by comparing yourself with others, especially since your current bout with low self-esteem could be fueled by someone who seems perfect. Instead of weighing your actions against another person's, just give it your best effort and then stop analyzing everything in great detail."
scorpio,2010-06-05,"You may feel as if your friends are holding back their approval today and you don't know why. Perhaps your current optimism is worrying them because they don't share in your same vision. Listening to what others say is crucial, but don't think that any one person has a sacred corner on the truth. The more points of view you collect now, the closer you get to understanding everyone else's perspectives, including your own."
sagittarius,2010-06-05,"Social etiquette may require you to limit your plans now, especially if you have inflated your hopes unrealistically. The optimistic Moon-Jupiter conjunction expands your unrealistic dreams of home and family, but naysayer Saturn stands in the way of your happiness. Respecting other people's boundaries today is crucial if you ultimately want to get ahead."
capricorn,2010-06-05,"You may become worried when the future looks good because you think that you're missing something important and that reality will come crashing down on you. But sometimes, when you do discover a potential problem in advance, your pragmatic approach pays off. Current attempts to escape from the truth are not helpful, but neither is looking too hard for trouble. Avoiding extreme expectations, and extreme measures, is your smartest strategy."
aquarius,2010-06-05,"It's becoming more difficult to keep your mind on the present moment because of your irrepressible excitement about the future. Nevertheless, a premature leap would be foolish now, since you've already done most of the required waiting. You only have to restrain yourself for another day or two, and then you are free to fly straight to your dreams."
pisces,2010-06-05,"It may feel as if this is your last chance to take care of several items on your to-do list. Fortunately, the winds of fate are blowing your way now as the Moon moves toward a conjunction with your ancient ruling planet Jupiter. Your optimism is uncontainable, but it's still wise to make sure that you are also being practical."
aries,2010-06-06,"It's a new deal for you Rams today as the Moon's return to your sign emphasizes the potential of extraordinary change that unexpected opportunities bring. You can no longer rely on old assumptions because the rules of the game are changing as you play it. Nevertheless, don't think that everything will turn out exactly as you envision, for there are still obstacles ahead in spite of your good intentions and hard work."
taurus,2010-06-06,"You may feel as if you are at a turning point in your life, but everything may seem bigger than it actually is. It will take months before your long-term goals clarify, yet the choices you make now will be instrumental in your new direction. Don't worry if you cannot put all your ideas into one practical package. For now, let your imagination flow without restraint; you can make sense of your thoughts later on."
gemini,2010-06-06,"You are a bit like Tigger the Tiger now as you bounce around from one exciting project to the next. You could raise your anxiety level and become frustrated if you try to restrain yourself and finish everything you start. There will be plenty of time ahead for you to concentrate on one thing at a time; today, just enjoy your high spirits, even if others think you're wasting your energy."
cancer,2010-06-06,"You might feel as if others are pushing you into something new faster than you want to go. Nevertheless, you are still excited about the prospects, even if the potential instability also brings up old issues about your fear of change. Keep in mind that you may be able to have your cake and eat it, too. You won't necessarily have to give up your security in order to take an intriguing opportunity that comes along."
leo,2010-06-06,"It's as if a new king or queen has taken over and has granted you the freedom of choice. You are being given a fresh start, but it's up to you to follow your dream. The path you choose may take time to manifest, but the moment to change your mind is now and not at some undetermined point in the future. You won't have all the details figured out yet, but you'll be able to put the missing pieces together along the way."
virgo,2010-06-06,"You may be more aware than ever of something that has been missing from your life. It's difficult to describe what you're feeling, but you know that you need to leave behind your old assumptions about what you can and cannot do. It might seem as though you are being swept up in something much bigger than you. However, if you say no, you could later regret that you missed an opportunity of a lifetime."
libra,2010-06-06,"Too much excitement might not be your idea of a good time, especially if you are seeking peace and quiet today. But someone could rock your world by bringing you surprising news, an innovative idea or a significant opportunity. Cautious optimism is advised because whatever enters your life now will likely look better than it actually is. However, if you don't throw your life out of balance, you can take an important step on a major journey."
scorpio,2010-06-06,"This is a great time for you to improve your life by injecting new habits into your daily routine. Fortunately, it will be easier than you think to let go of an old emotional pattern that has prevented you from taking the next step on your path. But there's no such thing as a halfway measure now. You know what you need to do, so don't put it off any longer."
sagittarius,2010-06-06,"Although a wave of nostalgia might tempt you to hold on to the past, you have a narrow window of opportunity to ride a rocket ship that can carry you far into the future. Fortunately, you aren't one to turn down an invitation to the adventure of a lifetime, so set your sights on a distant star, buckle your seatbelt and get ready to blast off. But don't let your confidence lead to arrogance; you are still in for some unexpected surprises along the way."
capricorn,2010-06-06,"You can reinvent your life now by revisiting your past and recreating your history anew. By developing a new perspective on the past, you'll be able to see different possibilities for what's ahead. Nevertheless, you will likely feel stressed by the conflict between maintaining the status quo and your desire to break out of a rut. Don't worry if you need more time, but rest assured that today you are better off looking forward than reviewing where you've been."
aquarius,2010-06-06,"You cannot avoid the realization that your life is changing and that the daily pace of events is speeding up. Even if you cannot keep up with everything that's going on now, you aren't likely worried because the new routine looks like so much fun that you'll figure out a way to make it work. Still it's a smart idea to remember the old adage, ""He who hesitates is lost."""
pisces,2010-06-06,"You may feel a wave of relief today, as if the pressure on you has been temporarily eased. However, your growth phase is not over; you are being given a chance to move a project along by taking a good idea and transitioning it into a practical reality. You may be tempted to act quickly, but impulsive behavior won't have the enduring impact you seek. Remember, it's more important now to build on what you have already started than to begin something anew."
aries,2010-06-07,You are restless and ready for action with three planets rocking and rolling in your sign today. But you may be perplexed when your enthusiasm is dampened by seemingly insignificant events as your key planet Mars forms anxious aspects with Jupiter and Uranus. It's challenging to know exactly how much self-restraint is necessary now so you don't overwhelm others with your irrepressible intensity.
taurus,2010-06-07,"You are ready to latch onto nearly anything that makes sense now because everything seems to be running out of control. Fortunately, action-hero Mars enters logical Virgo today, offering you an effective solution to your dilemma. Unfortunately, it still may be challenging to contain the flurry of energy that's currently being released. Don't be afraid to set your own comfortable pace, even in the midst of so much turmoil."
gemini,2010-06-07,"You enjoy being in transition because the instability gives you a sense of freedom. But today you could struggle trying to find your rhythm as the speed of change alternates between too fast and too slow. The more you attempt to control where events are leading, the greater your frustration. For now, let go of your agenda and just go along for the ride."
cancer,2010-06-07,"Your recent resistance to change could pay off today, but it's just a temporary solution to a more complex problem. You may successfully protect yourself against the urge to blindly jump ahead when you know that it's smarter to take your time. But you cannot stop the wheels of progress. Sooner or later, you'll need to take your foot off the brake and accustom yourself to the faster pace of your life."
leo,2010-06-07,"Just as you see the potential to break out of a rut, something happens to constrain your efforts. But your discouragement may not be warranted, for you are probably just feeling let down as forceful Mars leaves demonstrative Leo after being in your sign for over seven months. It may take a few days to get used to the change; although your penchant for drama will settle down, the overall intensity of your life will not."
virgo,2010-06-07,You should be able to feel the energy surge today which adds to the recent buildup of intensity. Feisty Mars can increase your vitality as it visits your sign today until July 29 when it moves on. But you must take care of yourself or you could end up depleted instead of invigorated. Don't run around chasing every little thing that looks enticing. Make a solid plan of attack and stick to it for the next couple of months.
libra,2010-06-07,"You could be bitten by another person's enthusiastic bug today, but your need to express your own dreams keeps coming back up to the surface. It's not easy to find a balance between the great adventure that awaits you in a relationship and your drive for personal success. Don't just say yes to your friends because it's even easier than usual now to take the path of least resistance. Listen to your heart before making any big decisions."
scorpio,2010-06-07,"You can clearly see the destination of your current work trajectory, encouraging you to push a project along so you won't run into problems down the line. But circumstances are beyond your control, so you might as well avoid stress by concentrating on the next baby step and simply doing the best you can. Instead of looking at the big picture, focus on manageable milestones along the way. Inch by inch it's a cinch."
sagittarius,2010-06-07,"An old familiar dilemma returns today as you must choose between boldly forging ahead with what you have and calmly waiting until you are completely prepared for the next step. You can see the wisdom of patience, but it's not your likely modus operandi at this time. Although your current drive for self-expression is strong, at least make sure that you don't ride roughshod over the needs of those you love."
capricorn,2010-06-07,"Your friends and co-workers appear to have lost touch with reality now as they become caught up in a feeding frenzy of impatience. Meanwhile, you feel like you are the lone holdout, the one with enough common sense to slow down and actually think about what you are doing before you do it. Nevertheless, it's difficult to be cautious without seeming negative. Don't worry if others criticize your need for a more deliberate approach; they will appreciate your wise counsel in due time."
aquarius,2010-06-07,"You may feel awkward today, as if you cannot settle into a sustainable rhythm at work. First you are bombarding others with one crazy idea after another; then your embarrassment has you overcompensating by keeping your thoughts to yourself. Don't put too much effort now into finding a middle path between these two extremes or you'll end up disheartened by your lack of success. Instead, rest assured that when the fluctuations settle down, you'll be able to do the right thing."
pisces,2010-06-07,"Accepting well-intended criticism may be the smartest thing you can do today, for your erratic behavior could be all over the map. Fortunately, someone's sharp perceptions and clear feedback can give you exactly the advice you need in order to turn your scattered initiatives into highly effective action. Don't over-personalize what you are told; just listen carefully and make the necessary adjustments before deciding your next move."
aries,2010-06-08,"You know that nearly anything is possible, no matter how outrageous or unrealistic it may seem, as Jupiter and Uranus, two giant planets, join in your enthusiastic sign. Although the power of positive thinking can increase your chances of success, don't go overboard with your plans. Be responsible and demonstrate your maturity by acknowledging your limits. A little common sense goes a long way now to moderate your optimism."
taurus,2010-06-08,"You see the potential for radical change everywhere you look today, but you aren't likely to gamble with what you currently have for a pie in the sky. Fortunately, the Moons' return to your earthbound sign may be enough to keep your feet on the ground. Knowing what's possible can be very empowering, but being practical is also important."
gemini,2010-06-08,"Although your plans for the future may sound overblown to your friends, you're confident that you'll be able to make them happen just as they appear in your dreams. But you might grow more reserved and keep your vision private as you begin to realize how much time it takes to defend your point of view. It's wise to conserve your energy, but don't withdraw completely. You can still build the excitement by sharing some of your ideas as long as you keep a clear perspective."
cancer,2010-06-08,"You are increasingly being drawn out into the public eye, whether you like it or not. Actually, you might even feel as if you have been catapulted out from behind your protective wall. Although the adrenaline shooting through your body could be causing anxiety, you can learn to make yourself calmer by taking time to meditate or exercise. You probably won't be able to easily change the external events, but you can change the way you handle stress."
leo,2010-06-08,"You are still on a rollercoaster ride and even if you've been enjoying all the excitement, it's beginning to wear on you. You might long for a break from the extreme highs and lows so you can relax for a while. The disparity between the current frenzy and your desire for peace can be discouraging. Try to accept that you're in the midst of an adventure and live each moment to the fullest."
virgo,2010-06-08,"You may feel overwhelmed with all that's happening now. Even if you are surprised at how well you're holding up under the pressure, you still have a lot to juggle while making an important decision. Trust your instincts today because analyzing the facts one more time won't necessarily get you any closer to the truth. It's time to move out of your head and take action."
libra,2010-06-08,"It's hard to remain true to yourself now while also keeping up with all the exciting things occurring in your life. In particular, relationships seem to be the primary source of excitement these days, but a friend or partner may be pushing you into new territory. You must learn how to be close to someone else without becoming overly dependent. The more freedom you maintain, the happier everyone will be in this situation."
scorpio,2010-06-08,"You crave intensity, but you also wish you had some time away from the hectic noise today. Unfortunately, peace and quiet might feel relaxing for a short while, but your mind still could anxiously start running your own version of the current distractions. Instead of seeking tranquility by changing your situation, create the harmony you want by calming your mind. But don't set yourself up for failure by expecting a sudden miracle."
sagittarius,2010-06-08,"It's crucial for you to filter out enough of the excess chaos so you can stay focused on reaching your destination. You may have carved out your work by setting lofty goals, but there's no good reason to scale back your agenda. Acting with common sense won't prevent you from reaching the stars; but rushing in impulsively could make your journey much harder."
capricorn,2010-06-08,"You can rise above whatever is happening now and find a way to collect your thoughts without losing momentum. In the midst of a rather crazy period, you can surprise your closest friends by maintaining a cool and calm attitude today. Fortunately, you won't need to rain on anyone's parade while being the voice of reason. Others will appreciate your logical approach during such an illogical time."
aquarius,2010-06-08,"Don't even bother attempting to regain control of your life today, for the more you try, the greater the struggle. Instead, get into the groove of things by responding to whatever happens as best you can. Your intelligence will be apparent if you don't exhaust yourself taking on the impossible task of changing that which is unalterable. Don't pursue an unrealistic goal; instead of transforming lemons into apples, just make lemon meringue pie."
pisces,2010-06-08,"There's no need to gamble with your time or money to pursue an impossible dream today, especially if you have more realistic goals to manifest. Using your imagination to create the future doesn't mean that your head must be up in the clouds. Your brilliance stems from your current ability to choose common sense over innovative theory. Good ideas are worthless now unless you can find a practical way to apply them."
aries,2010-06-09,"You might be able to convince yourself that you are on the right track, but you won't get others to believe you unless you really are. It will help if you share your current plans because your friends and associates will be able to see through any faulty reasoning. However, keep in mind that your cleverness could backfire if you're too smooth in your delivery. It's better to know the shortcomings of your new approach sooner than later or you could end up wasting a lot of time."
taurus,2010-06-09,You are caught between your natural need to be straightforward and your current desire to embellish the truth. It's not that you are purposefully trying to mislead anyone now; it's just that you can get mixed up between what you want and what is real. There's nothing wrong with sharing your dreams or taking a trip into Fantasyland as long as you acknowledge what you are doing.
gemini,2010-06-09,"Your key planet Mercury is spotlighted by passionate Pluto and dreamy Neptune today, increasing the intensity of your words while decreasing your connection to the real world. Nevertheless, you are so convincing that others may rally to your support only to discover that your plans are not as practical as they sound. Instead of having to untangle your story to get to the truth, it's wiser now to just stick with the facts."
cancer,2010-06-09,"Solving a problem today won't bring you satisfaction if your solution is less than enchanting. As the English poet John Keats wrote, ""Beauty is truth; truth beauty."" Unfortunately, if something or someone looks good now, you could mislead yourself into thinking you got it right when you are actually heading in the wrong direction. Don't let your current desires stand between you and the real world."
leo,2010-06-09,"Your spiritual path can be liberating to someone else today because you are leading by example. There's no need to tell anyone else what to do; your idea of happiness won't necessarily work for others. But your friends can see how much more you do for everyone else when you are also doing what's good for you. Being of service is important, yet you won't be able to help anyone if you don't take care of yourself, too."
virgo,2010-06-09,"Your energy may be stretched very thin now because a burst of enthusiasm recently prompted you to say yes to one too many projects. Don't wait until you have exhausted yourself. It's time to exercise sensible restraint because it's more important to follow through on what you already started, even if you are tempted to run off in search of the next great thing."
libra,2010-06-09,"You are engaged in a weird dance now between the old and the new. Your friends and co-workers are urging you to leave worn-out habits behind, but you may not be ready to let go of your attachment to the past. Paradoxically, the more you analyze your current affairs, the more confused you become. Stop thinking long enough to act on what you are feeling instead of what others are telling you."
scorpio,2010-06-09,"If you have special people in your life that you can lean on, it may be disconcerting today if they are not readily available. You may feel as if you are being abandoned, but that's not what's really happening. In fact your friends might not even realize the intensity of your current process. Let them know what you're going through now, but don't expect too much in return at this time."
sagittarius,2010-06-09,"Tying yourself to a desired outcome won't likely bring you happiness today. You may come quite close to recapturing your lost sense of stability, but it slips away as you get nearer to the magic moment. Instead of building your hopes up, only to have them crushed, keep bringing your focus back to the present moment. Let cosmic opposites, like yes and no, exist simultaneously, without taking sides. It's better to make choices when you are thinking more clearly."
capricorn,2010-06-09,"It's as if you are at the movies as you watch your fantasies unfold on the screen inside of your head. Although each scenario represents a possible turn of events, you would rather be dealing with the hard facts than dreamy illusions. Nevertheless, you cannot stop your thinking by decree. Instead of trying to force change, recognize that today's fanciful excursions are an effective way to explore the potential of the present moment."
aquarius,2010-06-09,"You are being asked to set aside your scientific persona now and see what it's like to be a poet. Don't worry so much about being productive today because you have more pressing work to do by reconnecting with your soul. Even if you cannot explain your current needs to anyone else, rest assured that the right words will come later after you've had time to dream."
pisces,2010-06-09,"You may be relieved today when you realize that you can still connect with your spiritual nature, even if you are too busy to go on a real retreat. It's not about how much time you take away from your hectic schedule now; it's more to do with how you use what's available. Just setting aside a few minutes for meditation or relaxation can be enough to get you back in the groove."
aries,2010-06-10,It's challenging to stay focused today because your mind is wandering in so many directions all at once. You are so optimistic now that you may actually believe that you can keep up with everything you have in process. But even your confidence has its limitations. Stop for a moment and take inventory of what you're doing and think about what could be temporarily eliminated so you can concentrate on those tasks that should be top priority.
taurus,2010-06-10,"You have been waiting for the right moment long enough and you could miss your chance if you don't do something today. Endless analysis won't likely bring any more clarity than you already have. Although you cannot stop the thoughts from going around and around, you can lessen the noise by boldly moving ahead, even if you aren't one hundred percent sure of your choice. Any action now is better than none at all."
gemini,2010-06-10,"You are more loquacious than ever with Chatty Mercury's yearly return to your sign. Although you may have many clever ideas to share, your message could get lost in a flurry of too many words. Consider your motives; if you're expressing yourself to be understood by others, then talk slower and be more concise. However, if your goal is just to amuse yourself, you really don't need an audience at all."
cancer,2010-06-10,"It's as if you have been given permission to go away today, even if you don't leave home. Without getting on an airplane, you can use your imagination to travel anywhere in time and space, for your thoughts seem as if they are real. Don't make the mistake of believing that fantasy is a replacement for actually doing something. Think about all the possibilities before deciding what to do next."
leo,2010-06-10,"You are moving into a phase when you'll be more socially active than usual. Your increased popularity is quite pleasurable, but it also distracts you from the work you should be doing. However, you could have the best of both worlds now if you concentrate on enjoying your time with others while you are developing your contacts for business. Networking can be fun as you establish your place within the community."
virgo,2010-06-10,"Although you may appear to be a bit overwhelmed at work, you're a lot more focused than others realize. Part of your current strategy involves keeping your options alive, but you believe that this is your most efficient path to a specific goal. Don't worry about what anyone else thinks of your plan; it has an excellent chance of coming together just as you imagine."
libra,2010-06-10,"You are usually able to go along with someone who presents a good idea, even if it was not part of your original agenda. However, you may be quite concerned now because you're beginning to realize that a current opportunity could be much bigger than you expected. You need to make a decision that will have a significant impact on the direction of your life, so take your time before choosing your path."
scorpio,2010-06-10,"You are normally the one who will turn over every stone when searching for an answer because you are more afraid of what you don't know than what you might find. However, today you will be tempted to take a shortcut and make assumptions instead of investigating every possibility. Luckily, a spontaneous and creative approach can still provide you with exactly what you need and enable you to enjoy yourself in the process."
sagittarius,2010-06-10,"It may be annoying today if someone repeats what you previously said, even if you are given proper credit for the idea. But instead of criticizing others for their lack of originality, be appreciative that your opinion was heard. It has been said that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, so accept the compliment and move on."
capricorn,2010-06-10,"Although you may be enjoying how your mood lightens today, it also makes you feel anxious because you think you should be more productive. It's challenging for you to let go of unfinished business, even if it's only for a temporary escape. The truth is that a bit of relaxation can be very rejuvenating for you. Taking some time off now enables you to accomplish your ambitious goals later on."
aquarius,2010-06-10,"It's an uphill battle if you have unpleasant or boring tasks to complete today. But if your job is enjoyable, then you'll be able to easily find your groove and create magic. It's your choice; you can turn whatever you're doing into a game, no matter what it is. It's not the activity, but your attitude that makes the difference between work and play."
pisces,2010-06-10,"You may be more animated today than usual, which makes others believe that you want to be socially engaged. But your words might be misleading and hide your current need for solitude. Fortunately, you can have the best of both worlds; if you burn off some of your mental energy with friends, it will be easier to settle down for some quiet time in the evening."
aries,2010-06-11,"Your easy way with words today may have you saying something you quickly regret. But it's not your message that's the problem; it's how you deliver it. Communicator Mercury crosses paths with warrior Mars now, prompting you to turn your rapid response into an act of war. You might not intend to stir up conflict, but you'll need to go out of your way if you truly want to prevent it."
taurus,2010-06-11,"You might not have your wits about you, especially when it comes to managing your finances today. Mischievous Mercury is blowing up a storm in your 2nd House of Money and Resources as it dynamically squares feisty Mars. You could take things too far if you know what you want and someone's standing in your way. Don't wait until it's too late and you find yourself mending fences. Instead, do what you do best: move slowly and steadily with great determination."
gemini,2010-06-11,"You must be ruthless about processing your feelings today because letting a matter of concern slide could have immediate ramifications. If you slip into denial, your unresolved emotions can act like a lightning rod, attracting another person's irritability or defensiveness. But speaking your truth might be hurtful to someone very close to you. Nevertheless, compassionate honesty is still the best policy."
cancer,2010-06-11,"Although you might have a lot on your mind today, it's wise to seek your own counsel and avoid asking others for their advice. It's not that someone will give you bad information; it's just that you aren't in the mood to be receptive now. Remember, your inner guides can talk you through this tricky period, but you'll need to show up with the right questions and then be prepared to listen."
leo,2010-06-11,"You could be doing your best to have fun today, but it looks like a stubborn person might be a thorn in your side. If you believe that others are being nit-picky, let them know right away before their behavior pattern settles into a routine. But don't approach the situation with blame, for your accusations will quickly turn back on you. Instead of being defensive, take full responsibility for your own feelings and then don't worry about anyone else."
virgo,2010-06-11,"You may be quite clear about what you are doing today, yet there's no room for self-righteousness in your life as your key planet Mercury squares assertive Mars. It's crucial for you to understand that your current choices may be best for you, but that they may not make sense for anyone else. If you try to convince someone that your way is the only way, a little disagreement could quickly escalate into a serious conflict. Give others the same freedoms that you now want for yourself."
libra,2010-06-11,"Your actions may not express what you're thinking, so don't expect others to be able to read your mind today. Unfortunately, your self-restraint isn't helpful. Consider what you really want to say and why you are so hesitant about putting words to your thoughts. The smartest thing you can do now is to directly face your fears and let others in on your secrets."
scorpio,2010-06-11,"Your traditional planetary ruler, Mars, is forming an anxious square with logical Mercury today. Being rational is much more challenging when you're sitting atop a volcano, knowing it could erupt at any time. Nevertheless, your practice now is to try to maintain a sense of calm, even if you don't have the luxury of stability."
sagittarius,2010-06-11,"Verbal aggression won't get you any closer to your goals today, but that doesn't mean you should let others tell you what to do, either. Don't waste energy and resources defending your actions with hollow words. Instead, speak from your heart; when experience is in the equation, your message will ring true with everyone else."
capricorn,2010-06-11,"You may be fighting against your worst enemy now: you. Your friends may be going out of their way to be very nice to you because they can see that you're more stressed out than usual. It's hard for you to concentrate today because there are so many little things vying for your attention. But even if you have many chores to do, it still may be wiser to delay them until after you take some personal time for yourself."
aquarius,2010-06-11,"You won't let yourself be pinned down today and may even strike back with a hurtful comment if you think your freedom is being threatened. But a defensive reaction might not be required, for you aren't necessarily being attacked. Naturally, you should do what you must to maintain your safety, but it's smart to consider the course of least resistance -- at least for now."
pisces,2010-06-11,"It's difficult for you to express what you're thinking now, without catalyzing someone else's swift reaction. You might try to employ avoidance tactics because you really don't want to be slowed down by this level of emotional dissonance. But sidestepping the underlying problem is probably what landed you here in the first place. Deal with whatever comes up, so you won't need to handle it later on."
aries,2010-06-12,"You want others to know what you're feeling, but the thought of sharing your emotions might be scary. Luckily, you can ease your fears about saying too much by consciously listening to what someone else has to say. Keep in mind that talking about what you want is actually a two-way street and today's New Moon in your 3rd House of Information reminds you to gather as much data as you dispense."
taurus,2010-06-12,"The information rich Gemini New Moon is in your 2nd House of Resources, prompting you to consider how your possessions make you feel secure. Although you won't achieve your goals overnight, clarifying your objectives now will help you on your way. If your financial situation seems overwhelming, think about what you must do to get yourself back on track and then take the first step."
gemini,2010-06-12,"It's as if today is your own personal New Year's Day because the New Moon is in your sign. You might want to celebrate the occasion by thinking about what you want to accomplish over the next six months. Although you know that wisdom can come from slowing down, you still might be tempted to do the very first thing that pops into your head. If you get off to a bad start, don't worry; instead, pick up all the pieces and begin anew."
cancer,2010-06-12,"You could be so scattered today that you aren't as productive as you wish, but keep in mind that there are many types of success. Your accomplishments may not be visible to others now, for today's New Moon falls in your 12th House of Secrets. Nevertheless, it's not wise to say no just because someone's project seems unrealistic. Accept the deal if possible; you can always weed out unnecessary growth later as needed."
leo,2010-06-12,"The chatty New Moon falls in your 11th House of Social Networking, initiating a new level of activity with friends and family. Your current optimism is balanced by a pessimistic Venus-Saturn square that still allows you to show your strengths. But heading off in a new direction with confidence can also hide your weaknesses. Admitting how vulnerable you are could help to prevent your isolation from those closest to you."
virgo,2010-06-12,"Although the whimsical Gemini New Moon can quickly disperse your energy, her presence in your 10th House of Public Life turns this into a perfect time to begin a project at work. Your concentration is being tested as you are tempted to start a journey by following several paths at once. Nevertheless, you will be better off if you make a choice now and pick just one route, even if you still need to change it down the road."
libra,2010-06-12,"It may be your goal to share your education or travel plans with others now. Although you can fantasize about your next vacation, you must get serious if you really want to make something happen later. Don't just talk about your dreams; it's a great time to initiate a productive discussion and not just spin wild stories. Use today's New Moon in your 9th House of Future Vision to write down your goals. Then, commit to one of them and be prepared to do whatever it takes to reach your objective."
scorpio,2010-06-12,"Although you are internally wired for intense situations, today's curious Gemini New Moon in your 8th House of Intimacy can be difficult for your friends to handle, especially if you want to talk about things that they would rather not discuss. Try a more laid-back approach so your desire for meaningful interactions doesn't send others running for safer emotional spaces."
sagittarius,2010-06-12,"The lighthearted New Moon activates your 7th House of Partners today, continuing to hold the spotlight on relationships. However, something seems different now that you are more willing to ask for what you want. Nevertheless, keep in mind that the quantity of words spoken is less important than the quality of what you say, so choose carefully. Express yourself as simply as you can and don't hesitate to begin again from the top if you get off to a bad start."
capricorn,2010-06-12,"You might believe that changing your attitude is all that's necessary now, but unfortunately breaking free from old habits is not that straightforward. Your current responsibilities could require hard physical work, too. Today's New Moon in your 6th House of Details indicates that you will be more successful if you take many small steps instead of trying to reach the summit in one big leap."
aquarius,2010-06-12,"You may have a lot of chores to finish today, but the New Moon falls in your 5th House of Play, highlighting your desire to have as much fun as possible. Don't try to avoid responsibility; just keep in mind that you will accomplish more if you enjoy what you are doing. Remember, the decision is yours. You can make yourself miserable by whining about what you want to do, but a lovely time may await you once you change the game by altering your attitude."
pisces,2010-06-12,"You may be encouraged to talk about your needs, since the loquacious Gemini New Moon is in your 4th House of Emotional Security. No matter how difficult it might seem at first, something may be gained if you are able to demonstrate your vulnerability by including another person in your inner process. It's not helpful for you to speak in vague terms now; positive results are more likely if you are specific about your feelings. Take a leap of faith and share your heart with someone you trust."
aries,2010-06-13,"Although you start the day off feeling invincible, your confidence could crumble because self-assurance tends to make you sloppy in your execution. Doing your homework is crucial and rewards are possible if you don't try to skip over the necessary details. If you are realistic in setting your goals now, solid preparation should bring success."
taurus,2010-06-13,"Knowing when to slow down to a sustainable pace is one of your greatest strengths. Others may rush ahead while you build foundations that can stabilize your growth. Recently, you have been tempted to surge forward in a burst of enthusiasm. Today you may be unsure about your best course of action. However, containing your excitement will likely prove to be your smartest strategy in the long run."
gemini,2010-06-13,"Your ability to interact with your world on so many levels can make you seem like a magician, but today you are so charming that your cleverness gets in the way. You may be so distracted by unrealistic possibilities that you head off in the wrong direction. It's best to take the time you need to deepen the relationships you already have, rather than running off to meet someone new."
cancer,2010-06-13,"You may be a bit anxious now that the Moon is back in your sign, stimulating intense feelings that you have recently avoided. Fortunately, you are able to reconnect with your center and feel more grounded as the day wears on. Stay aware of your emotions without suppressing them. Take whatever time is necessary to balance your internal state when you begin to feel out of sorts. Your friends and associates will respond positively if you are focused on the present moment."
leo,2010-06-13,"You may feel a bit of a letdown today, but this is only a temporary dip in the intensity, for lovely Venus enters your fiery sign tomorrow to kick the energy back up a notch. However, now it may be a challenge to balance your dreams with the harsher realities without going to extremes. The ideal situation probably isn't as perfect as you think and the current circumstances aren't that bad. Find a way to remind yourself that being in the middle is actually a pretty good place to be, at least for the moment."
virgo,2010-06-13,"Sometimes it's difficult for you to be as forceful as you would like to be when it comes to getting your best ideas across to others. Now, however, action-hero Mars is in your sign and you can take a more direct approach toward your goals. Allow yourself to be guided by your intuition, even if it doesn't make logical sense. Instead of using a detailed plan and following the script, you'll be surprised at how well everything works when you just make it up as you go along."
libra,2010-06-13,"You are usually quite skillful in how you handle others, but sometimes you can give up your power as you attempt to make those around you feel comfortable. Today, as your key planet Venus is confused by fuzzy Neptune, it's tough to know how far you should go in your efforts to be gracious. You may even end up frustrated if you focus all your energy on creating harmony for everyone else. Instead, set an example by acknowledging that your own personal goals are just as valid as anyone else's and remain true to yourself."
scorpio,2010-06-13,"Although your stamina is increasing and you have the energy now to come through for others, you need to be cautious about using your newfound power for your own personal gain. Fortunately, you are receiving help from unseen dimensions; unfortunately, it's hard to know what's real and what's not. There's no need to back down from your position, but it's a good idea to play it just a little bit cooler than you actually feel in order to give yourself some room to make adjustments when needed."
sagittarius,2010-06-13,"You may feel a little less confident today with the Moon in reflective Cancer, but a little self-doubt won't likely be enough to hold you down for long. It's usually easy for you to go off independently and move forward with your plans, but now it's wiser to include others on this part of your journey. Sharing nearly any experience will only make it more enjoyable than doing it on your own."
capricorn,2010-06-13,"Even if you are feeling quite healthy now, this is still an excellent time to consider changes to your diet and exercise program and make whatever adjustments are desirable. This doesn't mean that you are doing anything wrong in particular, yet there is always room for improvement. Pick an area of your life and set a goal that can have an enduring positive impact."
aquarius,2010-06-13,"You may be getting tired of all the high-energy people in your life now, even if they are offering you exciting alternatives to your current routines. You might even become a bit nostalgic, longing for the relaxed pace of the good old days. But there's no returning to your past. Take whatever downtime you can find today because you'll need your vitality over the days ahead when the pace picks up even more."
pisces,2010-06-13,"If issues on the home front have grown complicated, this may be your chance to concentrate on the situation. Your sensitivity is high and your determination is strong now, so don't wait for a better time to dig into the hidden dynamics of your family or close friends. As long as you don't set up unrealistic expectations for a miracle solution, your ability to listen compassionately allows you to be much more effective."
aries,2010-06-14,"You are being sent on an emotional journey, even if you don't think you have enough time to explore your feelings now. Nevertheless, you are ready to turn a corner when Venus dances into your 5th House of Love. Don't hold back; it's time to explore the pleasure that you seek, even if only in your dreams."
taurus,2010-06-14,"It's quite unsettling when you are not in control of your feelings, but try not to worry if you aren't satisfied with what you currently have. Trust your instincts, for your ruling planet Venus enters your 4th House of Security, ensuring your common sense in love even if you consider shaking everything up for the sake of change. But be careful of overreacting or your inflexibility can create unnecessary problems. Be open to meeting others halfway or you might miss the love that's already in your life."
gemini,2010-06-14,"Your love life receives a boost when popular Venus enters your busy 3rd House of Communications. But it's easier for you to say how much you like your friends today, rather than exposing your vulnerability with a more intimate emotional involvement. There's no need to fret over how to best express your feelings. Just have fun while flirting with the edge and, for now, don't worry about going over it."
cancer,2010-06-14,"You could gain a new perspective on love by looking back over the past several weeks to reconsider what the planet of romance and beauty may have brought into your life. Now, as creative Venus leaves your sign today to enter your 2nd House of Resources, it's time to build on what you already have. Although this is usually a time to stabilize relationships, you may still be tempted to start new ones now. Breaking out of your routine might feel good, but leave yourself a safe route to find your way back."
leo,2010-06-14,"Your edginess won't likely settle down now, especially if your agenda is different from someone else's. Instead of trying to maintain control, allow others to be as eccentric as they want. Meanwhile, pay more attention to how you present yourself, for you will be seen as more charming with friendly Venus in your 1st House of Self. But the choice is ultimately up to you, so don't shut down a potential admirer before you know how you really feel."
virgo,2010-06-14,"You might feel as if you missed your chance if you didn't express your desires because you were afraid of negative consequences. Luckily, all is not lost since you still have more opportunities ahead. Nevertheless, you will increase the likelihood of success if you can transform your attachment to personal love into something more spiritual as sensual Venus moves through your soulful 12th House for the next few weeks."
libra,2010-06-14,"You may mistakenly believe that you have something to hide today, but expressing your strange desires is easier and more enjoyable than you expect. Your key planet Venus is receiving a shock from surprising Uranus as you enter a phase of increased social activity. Although you may be required to go to a special event this week, don't worry because meeting your obligations can lead you to unexpected pleasure."
scorpio,2010-06-14,"You could put on quite a show now that Venus is in your public 10th House. Still, you aren't certain how much effort you should give to a current project. Although you have to manage the conflict between your personal desires and professional obligations, it's likely that you could receive recognition from others who only know you through your work. But don't try to compartmentalize the different areas of your life now; just accept the positive feedback wherever it appears with the appropriate amount of gratitude and humility."
sagittarius,2010-06-14,"If you have been working too hard lately, you may try to coast through the day. But your desires can lead you down an unfamiliar path as the balance between fantasy and reality gets tougher to maintain. Your heart and your head might pull you in different directions now, but don't be afraid to share your personal struggle. Ultimately, your vulnerability will make you more lovable. There's no need to give up on the idea of fun just because you are conflicted about what to do next."
capricorn,2010-06-14,"You may think that your life will fall apart unless you act maturely. But there is a time and a place for letting go of responsibilities and today you have more reasons to say yes than no. Don't try to be so rational; instead, explore your true desires. You have already done your fair share and now it's time to show a more playful attitude while expressing your inner child. There's no need to judge yourself negatively just because you want to have a good time."
aquarius,2010-06-14,"You could fall in love today, whether or not you're seeking romance as sweet Venus enters your 7th House of Relationships and harmonizes with your key planet Uranus. Your entire body may be buzzing with an adrenaline rush as the newness of a situation overwhelms your need for stability. Just remember that being excited is one thing; acting on your impulses is something else. Don't be afraid to make the changes you have dreamed about, but remember that some caution is always wise."
pisces,2010-06-14,"There's no simple way to escape from your obligations today, even though pleasant Venus makes work easier as she enters your 6th House of Employment. Still, you might scheme and dream about breaking free, avoiding responsibility or playing hooky from school. Unfortunately, in practice, it won't likely feel all that good. Paradoxically, you could actually enjoy helping someone else now even more than fulfilling your own needs."
aries,2010-06-15,"Your key planet Mars is often demanding and may force you into an emotionally profound place today, for you fully realize that your time is running out. You want to squeeze every last ounce of excitement out of a pleasant experience. Just remember that your good intentions can backfire if you push too hard, so try a gentler approach if anyone's feathers seem ruffled."
taurus,2010-06-15,"Your unrelenting determination is useful today as you manage a complex family situation that has created its share of stress. Fortunately, your key planet Venus forms an easy trine to lucky Jupiter, enabling you to find a solution to a problem that has been nagging at you for a while. Nevertheless, it could take a minor crisis to motivate you to investigate further. Remember that temporary patches and quick fixes are not a smart idea at this time."
gemini,2010-06-15,"You may not like knowing that you must contend with a powerful person now and it's unsettling even just thinking about it. Fortunately, things should go more smoothly once you begin a constructive conversation. Your greatest asset is your mental agility, so don't freeze under pressure. If you can remain flexible and are willing to learn from your opponent, you'll probably get what you need out of the interaction."
cancer,2010-06-15,"Issues of net worth and self-worth are intertwined now, even if they seem very separate. Today you may feel optimistic because you are in touch with the power of your emotions. Don't be afraid to ask for a raise if your confidence increases. Naturally, your performance on the job must support your request, but if it does, you are likely to get more money out of the deal."
leo,2010-06-15,"You may feel special today, as if a beautiful bloom appears just for you in a magical garden. However, Mars trines passionate Pluto making life seem a bit overwhelming. You could go overboard with all the extras now because you want to put on a show. The results can be very rewarding, as long as you don't get lost in your fantasies and try to make everything unrealistically perfect."
virgo,2010-06-15,"You are normally inclined to limit your distractions to fully concentrate on what needs to happen. But maintaining your focus gets more complex as your curiosity is tweaked. It's hard to ignore the profound information that's swirling around you because some of it could be very significant. On the other hand, additional facts won't likely change your mind. You already intuitively know what you should do."
libra,2010-06-15,"You are probably feeling pretty good about your current plans now, but no matter how upbeat you are, something's still gnawing away at the edges of your imagination. But instead of trying to escape from the uncertainty, sink into the darkness. Once you fall into the rabbit hole, you should be able to find your way around your subconscious without any external light."
scorpio,2010-06-15,"Expressing how you feel can heat things up more than you realize. Unfortunately, suppressed feelings can turn cold, agitating your unconscious and adding tension to the group process. A fiery trine between your two key planets, Mars and Pluto, stirs your emotions. Fortunately, it's easy to act on your intuition. Following your instincts now is your best defense against negativity. Taking the high road is surely your best option."
sagittarius,2010-06-15,"You may be in a very expressive mood today as you seek ways to enter new territory. Your uncharacteristic emotional intensity can get in the way of a more easygoing aspect of your own nature. Nevertheless, avoid getting angry with someone who isn't willing to be serious. Don't bother trying to change others; instead, watch your own feelings and work to transform them in a positive manner."
capricorn,2010-06-15,"You may grow bored of loved ones being so nice to you now, for their behavior appears to be a sign of weakness. But don't fall into the trap of hardening your position in order to demonstrate your strength. You can be strong and yielding at the same time. Acknowledging the intelligence of being flexible can help you move through an intense day with gratitude and grace."
aquarius,2010-06-15,"You are refreshed by your creative approach to life today, especially if it also makes you more productive. But your easygoing attitude is deceptive. You can skillfully dissipate someone's aggression while still being ready for serious business at a moment's notice. Use your ability to shift between the emotional extremes and to take command of a situation at exactly the right moment."
pisces,2010-06-15,"Someone's behavior could turn into a problem over the days ahead. Luckily, you can effectively nip a bad situation in the bud, but not if you attempt to suppress the expression of fear or anger. The best way to handle the difficulty now is to draw the other person out by asking questions and then listening to the story. Once you know what's going on, you'll be more able to deal with the tension out in the open."
aries,2010-06-16,"This is not a day for staying out of the spotlight. You may believe that you will quietly play a supportive role for a loved one today, yet you probably won't be able to contain your excitement long enough to complete your mission. Don't apologize for being yourself; just be as sensitive and kind as possible while still expressing your enthusiasm."
taurus,2010-06-16,"Someone may expect you to set aside your personal needs today so you can assist your family or friends. Unfortunately, you might get annoyed because you aren't sure what you can contribute and don't want to be burdened with extra responsibilities. Taking care of yourself may seem crucial, but try not to let others down more than necessary. Coming through for a loved one could prove to be more rewarding than you expect."
gemini,2010-06-16,"Even a minor move on your part might be very significant to someone else. Others may misinterpret your behavior because of their expectations and assumptions. Or, perhaps, your actions are truly misleading because you don't want anyone to know what you're really up to now. Nevertheless, it's still smarter to be clear about your boundaries today so you don't unintentionally deceive your allies."
cancer,2010-06-16,"You might think that clarity is returning because you're ready to make your move today, especially if you have been waiting for the right time. But something is lurking just beyond your perceptions and you cannot quite bring it into awareness. It's as if a puzzle piece is being hidden to prevent you from being overly confident. Still, following your heart makes more sense than analyzing your next move. Don't bother trying to explain yourself; your actions will be enough to tell your story."
leo,2010-06-16,"This will probably be an extremely social day, yet paradoxically you won't likely be the center of attention. You are more inclined now to love others, rather than wanting to be loved. Nevertheless, the Moon is in proud Leo, so being appreciated by an admirer could still make your day. However, if you try to get recognition today, your scheme could backfire, causing you to regret your hastily executed actions."
virgo,2010-06-16,"You may be more effective when working behind the scenes, but you might say something today that creates a stir, causing others to take notice of you. The problem is that your actions could elicit the wrong kind of attention as you accidentally reveal feelings that you would have preferred to keep secret. There's no need to be so self-protective now; hiding your intentions only draws the spotlight toward you."
libra,2010-06-16,"Life may become more confusing now, especially in respect to how you relate to others. Fortunately, you don't have to do what anyone else expects of you today, which gives you room to try a more creative solution to a current problem. Instead of choosing one thing or another, make up a scenario where both options are possible. An outside-the-box approach could bring pleasantly surprising results."
scorpio,2010-06-16,"You cannot just hang around the house, even if you just want to relax today. You must get outside and do something enjoyable like taking a long walk in the woods, going to the beach or even shopping for yourself. Unfortunately, you won't be satisfied with simple distractions. Real happiness is within your reach if you can find a fun activity that also allows you to use your mind in a creative manner."
sagittarius,2010-06-16,"Visiting a familiar haunt with a friend may sound like a good time today, but you'll likely wander beyond your home territory pretty quickly. Discovering new places is particularly enticing now if you have someone special with whom to share an adventure. However, even if you are on your own, you will probably enjoy yourself more if you do something that pushes boundaries and is outside of your ordinary routine."
capricorn,2010-06-16,"You may try to withdraw from the noisy distractions at work now so you can better focus on the details of what you are doing. Pay particular attention to your health regimen because what you do today can have lasting value. If you have been considering changes to your diet or thinking about a new exercise program, don't wait any longer. It's smarter to start sooner than later so you can feel better about yourself."
aquarius,2010-06-16,"Being active now is healthy for your body and mind. It's not sufficient to think about doing something physical; you have to actually get out and do it. Your anxiety could increase in the coming days as you face stress, so it's best to find playful ways to work off your excess energy before it reaches a tipping point."
pisces,2010-06-16,"More is happening in your life than others realize, but this is in part a result of how you are able to hide the truth today. But this subterfuge isn't about lying or even attempting to misrepresent the facts; it's just that you want more privacy now. There isn't anything wrong with creating boundaries if that is what you must do in order to feel more secure at this time."
aries,2010-06-17,"You vacillate today, considering what to say and what to keep to yourself. Although you can find smart reasons to justify your desire to work and steer clear of any emotional entanglements, you might not be able to avoid getting hooked by the positive side of a difficult situation. Don't judge yourself too harshly if you need to backtrack later so you can recover from an earlier moment of unrealistic optimism."
taurus,2010-06-17,"You naturally prefer to sail on calmer emotional waters, but you can also stir up a few waves of your own when your values clash with someone else's. There's a fine line between maintaining your integrity and just being stubborn. Don't give up your point of view, but let go of your need to convince everyone that your position is the only correct one."
gemini,2010-06-17,"You are moving into an intense period when you must learn something very important. Today, the information you receive could rattle your previous assumptions. Although you like to keep your options open, you may be forced to make a decision. Even if none of the alternatives are perfect, be as realistic as you possibly can while making an important decision."
cancer,2010-06-17,"You can see what's wrong with someone's big scheme today, preventing you from investing too much time or money in an unrealistic project. On the other hand, your critical thinking can be perceived by others as negative energy that you should overcome. The truth is somewhere in between and it's up to you to find a middle ground that works for all involved."
leo,2010-06-17,"It's not always easy to hone in on what you bring to others, but thinking about your contributions can be a very interesting exercise for you today. This is not a waste of time, for applying your energy now, even to the most mundane tasks, could turn a routine day into a magical one. Something as simple as paying your bills can be uplifting if you keep your mind focused on what's real."
virgo,2010-06-17,"You don't particularly like too many distractions, yet you still find yourself lured into gathering as many facts as you can now. Unfortunately, having an abundance of information isn't as reassuring as having certainty. As much as you attempt to let your common sense reign supreme, your optimism can sorely tempt you to mislead others. Use your natural discretion to keep yourself on track."
libra,2010-06-17,"Knowing exactly what you expect from a serious relationship now can make the difference between a brilliant success and a discouraging failure. However, if you don't have a very realistic outlook on your overall life, this could be an opportune time to gather enough information so that you are able to convince others that you are certain of what you want. You don't have to try so hard; relationships will function better if you don't oversell your case."
scorpio,2010-06-17,"Having a conversation about intimacy and actually being intimate with a loved one are not the same thing. It may be easier now for you to approach this delicate subject from the point of view of an observer, even if you are confident enough to jump right in. Keep in mind that the right amount of detachment should help you to deal with your feelings much more effectively than being overwhelmed by them."
sagittarius,2010-06-17,"Although you are usually better at describing a general concept than focusing on the individual facts, today's Virgo Moon enables you to separate the fine points from the big ideas. Meanwhile, a tough Venus-Pluto alignment makes it difficult for you to gauge how much resistance you'll face to getting what you want. Move slowly and reconsider all your options prior to making any critical decisions."
capricorn,2010-06-17,"You are easily charmed by anyone who behaves in a flirtatious manner toward you now. Unfortunately, other people's charisma can be confusing and may lead you into a pile of trouble if you fail to sort through all the incoming information. Remember that your analytical ability is your greatest strength today; think things through instead of impulsively following your instincts."
aquarius,2010-06-17,"You may feel as if you are on a creative high, yet you are still struggling with transforming your best ideas into concrete action. Unfortunately, you might give up prematurely today if you aim your sights too high and set yourself up for frustration. However, if you are resistant to setting goals, then you may never get around to doing the extraordinary work of which you are capable."
pisces,2010-06-17,"Your closest relationships are worthy of your attention because they can be just what you need to support your current growth. But you still may have such unrealistic expectations that your friends and associates might fall short of their goals and let you down today. Still, it's crucial to appreciate what you have now; you cannot afford to waste any energy on negativity."
aries,2010-06-18,"Responsibilities at work have piled up, yet you may not want to tackle your obligations head on. You are wiser to make plans now rather than actually execute them, for your actions won't likely be as effective as you want. But this is not about taking the day off. Put your energy toward detailing your production schedule for the next few weeks while checking off some of the smaller items on your task list."
taurus,2010-06-18,"Your key planet Venus is still struggling from her encounter with intense Pluto yesterday, prompting you to wonder if a current attraction is worth the emotional price or not. You can analyze your options again and again, yet you may not get any closer to a satisfying answer. Instead of trying to rationalize complicated desires today, just stick with what you know to be absolutely true and let go of the rest."
gemini,2010-06-18,"A family member or close friend may be relying on you for stability today, even though this isn't normally your greatest strength. However, you can be a real anchor for loved ones now, keeping them from drifting off in a storm of intense emotions. Maybe it's your natural skill of being able to tread lightly that makes you the go-to person of the day. Whatever the reason, don't waste energy doubting your ability to help. Just jump in and do it."
cancer,2010-06-18,"Expressing a personal preference can create a problem today, for it is easier now to work with hard facts than to deal with emotional issues. Luckily, the precision-oriented Virgo Moon won't allow you to fall into the irrational land of subjectivity. Pay extra attention to how you feel, but only act on the cool logic of useful data."
leo,2010-06-18,"You can see amazing potential nearly everywhere you look, yet it's hard to deny the complications that will likely arise on your path. Although it may be easier to dream about what you want than to actually make it happen, it's wiser to be honest about your intentions than to withhold your desires from someone you trust. Just keep in mind that sharing a fantasy doesn't mean that you should try to make it come true. Some things are okay to verbalize but not actualize."
virgo,2010-06-18,"The emotional Moon in your sign today could contribute to a temporary bout with low self-esteem as you recollect previous times when your best intentions still fell short of your expectations. Don't give up; rather than obsessing about past disappointments or failures, consider how to positively focus your energy to overcome a current obstacle."
libra,2010-06-18,"If someone in your life recently overstepped a boundary, take the time now to address the issue before letting go of it and moving on. There's no need to hesitate when expressing your feelings as long as you don't resort to blaming anyone else. You may be tempted to avoid a difficult discussion, but assuming full responsibility for your words and actions will smooth things out for what comes next. Looking ahead instead of behind will be better for all involved."
scorpio,2010-06-18,"You may be protective of your feelings today and might try to get through a situation without discussing what's on your mind. Still, you're driven to share your thoughts, which, unfortunately, can hurt someone's feelings. At first, both courses of action seem unsatisfactory. However, you can speak your truth in a caring and non-accusatory manner and still be supportive. Those who love you will appreciate your honesty."
sagittarius,2010-06-18,"You usually have your sights set high, yet you can be easily discouraged when you don't reach your goals right away. It is crucial to give your plans time to develop, even if patience is a hard lesson for you to learn. You could become obsessed with just a particular aspect of a project today, but it's healthier to concentrate on your overall goal and not just one single part."
capricorn,2010-06-18,You may feel as if someone else is holding the keys to your current success and you don't like it one bit. Your initial strategy might be to outmaneuver any resistance you face with a combination of hard work and persistence. But your aggressive approach now could raise the stakes and escalate a conflict. Taking a timeout will give others room to adjust to your ambitions and could also ease the unnecessary tension.
aquarius,2010-06-18,"You might feel let down today and your first inclination is to fill in the emptiness with additional excitement. However, further analysis reveals that you may need peace and quiet at this time, instead of more noise. Unfortunately, you won't likely get what you expect now, so be as flexible as possible and try to be satisfied with whatever happens next."
pisces,2010-06-18,"If an authority figure is critical of you today, it's a good idea to examine your role in the situation. It could appear as if others are preventing you from being productive, but it's more likely that you contributed to putting the restrictive wheels in motion. Squaring off against external resistance will probably be fruitless now; instead, improve your game plan and be ready to make another attempt when circumstances allow."
aries,2010-06-19,"Today's stress is the newest chapter in your continuing struggle to be happy without messing up all that you have gained. Your current dissatisfaction may provoke you to take action prior to thinking about the consequences, yet steady and methodical behavior is needed if you want to reach your goals. Gambling with your future now is not advised; carefully consider your options and don't expect to change everything all at once."
taurus,2010-06-19,"Fantasies about new ways to make money fill your head with useless schemes today. Instead of executing a sound business plan, you may be entranced by all your clever ideas. Nevertheless, you can exert more control over your future once you realize that practicing self-discipline makes all the difference in the world. Instead of letting your dreams run wild, make a choice and concentrate on achieving one worthwhile goal."
gemini,2010-06-19,"It's crucial not to lose sight of your obligations today. Even if you are not on the job, you cannot behave irresponsibly if you have already made commitments. But it's hard for you to stay focused and deliver on what you promised if you believe your fantasies are truly realizable. Avoid the temptation to escape; it's wiser to keep bringing yourself back to reality so you don't have to pay too high of a price later on."
cancer,2010-06-19,"Grandiose thinking about a home improvement project is not a smart idea now, so be ready to scale back your plan on a moment's notice. It isn't worth exhausting yourself by waging a war you cannot win. But you shouldn't surrender your dream either. Instead, seek a middle path without sacrificing your ideals. Balance may be elusive, but dogged persistence should move you in the right direction."
leo,2010-06-19,"Feeling emotionally lighter may be difficult these days, but it's your only sensible option. Today, a challenging situation gives you a chance to demonstrate a new and improved you. It's ultimately your choice, so surround yourself with fun-loving people who can help you remember the healing properties of laughter."
virgo,2010-06-19,"The scattered Gemini Sun continues to pull you in too many directions. Today, your anxiety level rises because you are overwhelmed by so many things to do that you must eliminate some of them. Perhaps your life has become more complex gradually, but now you must do something about it. Although change won't come easily, you can do almost anything once you set your mind to it."
libra,2010-06-19,"Your sign is well known for being indecisive because you are often able to temper extreme ideas and find common ground. Today, however, you may be ready to jump one way or the other, because you don't have much time to make up your mind. Remember that it's more important to be swift in judgment now than to be perfect. Make your decision and move on."
scorpio,2010-06-19,"Although you have a lot to say now, you might not want to be seen or heard as the Moon enters your 12th House of Privacy. It's more natural for you to face an intense emotional or spiritual crisis on your own because you aren't sure that anyone else would truly understand what you're going through. Regardless of your perspective, change is inevitable, so don't resist the current process of transformation, even if it hurts."
sagittarius,2010-06-19,"Although you may appear open to feedback from your peers, your convictions are stronger than they seem now. You are focused on your long-term plans, even if others are telling you to pay more attention to what's happening today. Nevertheless, you may think that your friends are just making matters worse by distracting you with their opinions. Fortunately, you have the tools to keep yourself on track, and it's up to you to use them."
capricorn,2010-06-19,"Today, the disorganized Gemini Sun crosses purposes with your planetary ruler, taskmaster Saturn. Although you are quite busy, you really don't like having too many things to do because you cannot sufficiently concentrate on just one specific goal. Look at this as an opportunity to sit down and make a complete list of everything you want to do. Take your time and prioritize your tasks before rolling up your sleeves and getting to work."
aquarius,2010-06-19,"A serious concern could become critical for you now as you are forced to make a decision. Even the little surface problems are tied to a deeper issue and there's no way of getting around it. Be prepared to dig your way to the very bottom, if necessary. Don't be in such a hurry; the only urgency is your own psychological pressure. Ultimately, everyone will be happier once you have cleared the air by making your choice."
pisces,2010-06-19,"You feel emotionally stretched today and something in a relationship may have to give. You don't mind constructive criticism from a friend or partner, yet it might seem as if positive feedback is hard to find. If you are being pushed too hard, set firm boundaries. Clearly let others know that more pressure will only increase your resistance. Tell them to back off and give you room to change at your own pace."
aries,2010-06-20,"Finding your way out of a maze is something you excel at naturally, especially if your adrenaline is flowing. Your ability to think in the moment enables you to put a positive spin on a messy situation today. But be careful that your strategy doesn't include denial, for misleading yourself and others won't help in the long run. Do your magic, but make sure your plan is based on reality and not just your idealism."
taurus,2010-06-20,"You have a better sense of reality today, but don't assume that your point of view is the same as everyone else's. Your current perceptual filter can make things seem more objective than they actually are as you experience the world through your subjective lens. Even if you can see the truth now, allow others enough room to reach conclusions that differ from yours."
gemini,2010-06-20,"Your thoughts fly free today, like birds soaring on thermals, yet beneath the peaceful appearance trouble is brewing. Unsettled emotions are working their way to the surface and your first inclination is to suppress them. Although you may be able to avoid your complex emotions for a while, it's not wise to bury them. Objectively processing your feelings now is easier than waiting until they erupt."
cancer,2010-06-20,"You may feel as if you're in an emotional pressure cooker and you aren't willing to just sweep away serious feelings with the power of an uplifting thought. However, you are able to use your imagination to raise your spirits rather than to avoid a difficult issue. Remember, you can remain sensitive to your inner world without having to obsess over it."
leo,2010-06-20,"Your load is lightened when circumstances go your way today, but don't get too comfortable, for things are still in flux. You may not be able to get everything you desire now, even if the decreased stress feels good. Fortunately, someone who was recently combative may return to be a supportive friend, so don't hold any unnecessary grudges against a potential ally."
virgo,2010-06-20,"Instead of trying to analyze everything over and over, put one good idea into motion today and see what happens. Although you might prefer to spend your time improving your plans, logic can only take you so far. You cannot predict how others will react to what you do now. Imagine the most ideal outcome and then take action; you can always fine-tune your strategy later on."
libra,2010-06-20,"You have a window of opportunity that won't last long, so take positive action before you run out of time. Unfortunately, the timing can be tricky now because responding too quickly raises a different set of problems. No matter how self-assured you are, wait and see how you feel a few hours later. Consider it a warning sign if your uncertainty increases as the day progresses. You'll make more progress if you pay less attention to what you do know and more attention to what you don't."
scorpio,2010-06-20,"You want to remain cool but panic could have you sifting through piles of information as you try to separate what's important from what's not. Fortunately, you can trust your instincts today; they will guide you through the current maze of complex entanglements. But don't think that you need to openly discuss everything you believe. It's time to keep a secret; it's smarter to leave some things unsaid."
sagittarius,2010-06-20,"It's difficult to keep your thoughts to yourself today because your friends encourage you to share your dreams. You might attempt to hold your tongue, but you'll still probably say shocking things. Nevertheless, your intent isn't to catch anyone off guard or to embarrass others. You just want to inspire everyone with your magical stories. Remember, you'll be more effective if you can limit what you say instead of rambling on without end."
capricorn,2010-06-20,"The Moon's current visit to your 10th House of Responsibility can actually stand in your way of success today because it restricts your options to the most conservative choices. Luckily, you are able to recognize how your past blocks you in the present moment, enabling you to overcome self-imposed limitations. But don't try to draw attention to yourself. You'll be more effective by doing your chores quietly and not playing the role of the leader at this time."
aquarius,2010-06-20,"You may be feeling that healthy competition is more important than usual. Nevertheless, you might not be motivated now to make an extra push because you prefer to relax and enjoy the company of friends. However, it's still a good idea to acknowledge your desire to win. Demonstrating your intelligence can be part of your fun, but don't get so caught up in the game that you lose your chance to enjoy yourself."
pisces,2010-06-20,"You may be in touch with the conflict between your desire for mental stimulation and a need for some downtime to restore balance in your life. Fortunately, you can combine the two by declining a social invitation and picking up a book to learn about a topic that interests you. Gathering new ideas, even in a private conversation with a friend, will nurture your seeds of intelligence."
aries,2010-06-21,"Although you are ready to rock and roll, a gnawing feeling in the pit of your stomach could have you wishing that you responded differently to a recent situation. Reconsidering past actions now is healthy for you Rams who usually don't have much time for self-reflection, especially when there's so much to do in the present moment. There's nothing wrong with admitting to a mistake before moving on."
taurus,2010-06-21,"Everyone seems pretty intense today, making it harder for you to maintain your cool. Although you may succeed in being an anchor for others, your steady outward appearance can hide your current angst. Moderating your emotions might be the right thing to do, but only to a point. Sharing your worries with someone you trust prevents a meltdown later in the day."
gemini,2010-06-21,"Normally, you are eager to engage others in conversation, but you might try to withdraw today if a situation becomes uncomfortable. You may be caught in the middle of an emotional struggle that becomes more complicated as the day wears on. It's healthier now to face the conflict directly than to let the tension simmer. But acknowledging difficult feelings doesn't mean that you must be right. Respecting a difference of opinion can alleviate the discord."
cancer,2010-06-21,"The Sun's return to your nurturing sign should feel refreshing, yet anxiety is difficult to avoid because so much is up in the air right now. You might find that even well thought out plans still need revision to adapt them to the unexpected changes. But making small modifications may be more complicated than just scrapping your previous idea and starting all over again. Today, radical action could offer you the best shot at getting what you want."
leo,2010-06-21,"You may have thought that you knew where your heart was leading you, but today something happens that might catch you off guard. It's not a good idea to pretend that you are in charge of your feelings. Let your emotions take you for a ride now; it could prove to be very exhilarating as long as you don't fight against the currents."
virgo,2010-06-21,"You may long for a resting place in your ongoing struggle to hold on to recent gains while still embracing the future. Inevitable change seems to be knocking at your front door, but just as you think it's okay to let it in, something happens that makes you question your assumptions. Don't be attached to your expectations. Instead, be ready to flow with the shifting tides until they settle back down."
libra,2010-06-21,"You want to respond to someone's apparent need for help today because you have something special to offer. But a co-worker or friend might not want you to get involved at this time. Don't worry about what motivates others to demonstrate their independence. You have plenty to do now; instead of wondering why your assistance was rejected, just get busy with your own work."
scorpio,2010-06-21,"The Moon's return to your sign today demands that you keep your heart open to the upcoming changes. Although current events aren't necessarily unfolding according to your expectations, they can still work out in your favor if you let go of some control. It may feel as if you are being tested if you attempt to run the show. Fortunately, sharing responsibilities now will give you more time to explore your own personal needs."
sagittarius,2010-06-21,"Your romantic life may be full of unexpected twists and turns now that the Sun is square to wild and crazy Uranus in your 5th House of Love. Creative sparks may fly as tensions are released and, fortunately, you're ready for the excitement. But any attempt to avoid honest emotional expression could quickly turn things sour. You cannot get away with very much today, so speak the truth and walk your talk, even if you ruffle some feathers in the process."
capricorn,2010-06-21,"A lack of flexibility on your part today could invite unexpected disruption from a co-worker or a friend. You might need to be shocked into paying attention if you are holding on to the memory of a past event. Fortunately, you can minimize your anxiety by shaking things up yourself, instead of waiting for something to happen. For now, it's smarter to be the lightning instead of attracting it from others."
aquarius,2010-06-21,"The Sun in your 6th House of Routine forms a dynamic square with your key planet Uranus today, upsetting the status quo. Interactions with friends or associates can be affected, especially if you have diverging perspectives about how to get a job done. They may see you as the disruptive force, even if you don't. Either way, your smartest strategy now is to bring everyone's ideas out into the open without requiring a final decision. Resolution will come on its own without an arbitrary deadline."
pisces,2010-06-21,"Your role in a relationship may be shifting, even if you think that things are okay as they are. But don't resist change now, for it could very well bring you the personal freedom that you desire. Holding on to the status quo will only make the inevitable more difficult. If you have the courage to let go of old expectations, you should be able to get what you want and reclaim your individuality in the process."
aries,2010-06-22,"There is much to learn from your feelings if you can hold yourself still long enough to dive beneath all of the surface noise today. It's not easy to find your way into these hidden places where you might feel vulnerable. You are more inclined to deal with problems you can solve quickly, but there isn't anything that you must do now. Being present with whatever you experience is enough."
taurus,2010-06-22,"Someone may become so emotional today that it embarrasses you. You prefer sidestepping drama whenever possible, but an intense conversation deepens too quickly to avoid it. Your key planet Venus in Leo leads you to express yourself in a straightforward manner, yet nothing you try seems to prevent your feelings from getting entangled in someone else's. Setting aside your agenda and your assumptions about love can help everyone involved get through an awkward moment."
gemini,2010-06-22,"It's time for you to use a different approach at work. Instead of rushing in to try a new technique, it's smarter now to get back to basics and reflect on your core values. This may require you to say less and listen to what's in your heart. Being receptive isn't normally easy for you, and today is no exception. As you become more vocal, you also grow more anxious about expressing your desires. If you remain silent, you'll be able to hear your own sound advice."
cancer,2010-06-22,"You are quite pensive about a relationship now that the willful Sun is in your sensitive sign and the emotional Moon is in your 5th House of Love. Nevertheless, it's not simple to share your thoughts with anyone else today. Even if you are feeling confident, you still don't want to be in the vulnerable position of discussing your heart's desires because of your fear of being rejected. Don't take a risk unless you are fully at ease with whatever might happen."
leo,2010-06-22,"Asking a family member or a friend for what you want now can be more complicated than keeping your wishes to yourself. Unfortunately, suppressing your feelings diminishes any chance for satisfaction. There really isn't any urgency except your need to experience pleasure rather than frustration. Removing the focus on immediate gratification enables you to pursue a deeper level of intimacy with someone special."
virgo,2010-06-22,"It seems easier to talk about your feelings, but that doesn't mean that others will listen to what you are saying today. You are cautious, yet your current willingness to move on to unfamiliar emotional ground might be threatening to someone close to you. Remember, there's really no need to keep secrets, yet pacing your delivery can make a delicate conversation go better than you expect."
libra,2010-06-22,"Your planetary ruler Venus won't let you enjoy yourself today, because she is agitated by the more serious agenda of relentless Pluto. You must let go of any goals that are glorified selfish needs and replace them with more altruistic concerns. Don't look at this as a personal defeat. Instead use your common sense to think about all the helpful things you can do for others. Expressing your generosity of spirit has its own priceless rewards."
scorpio,2010-06-22,"The Moon's current visit to your sign heightens your emotions yet it's complicated to know exactly what you want as your moods vacillate throughout the day. Your ability to concentrate on your goals is diminished as attractive Venus distracts mysterious Pluto. No matter how much you try to balance your desires with what's now available, something still isn't right. Hold tight, for the energy shifts this weekend to show you viable new options."
sagittarius,2010-06-22,"You prefer to keep everything light and breezy today, but you can still get drawn into a heated debate that raises questions about who is really in charge. You might have eagerly acquiesced in a recent struggle, but now you are challenged to reclaim some of your lost power. Instead of battling against others, try raising the stakes by simply doing what's ethically correct without worrying about anyone else."
capricorn,2010-06-22,"Trying to reestablish your composure is a healthy sign, especially if you are dealing with complex relationship issues now. Although you believe that it's time to put your life back in working order, it isn't all that simple. Cooperating with others and respecting divergent goals can certainly complicate your day, but you cannot proceed on your own. Give yourself time to adjust to the new emotional landscape."
aquarius,2010-06-22,"There is a peculiar blending between knowing what you want and doing what's expected of you today. You won't likely fully understand everything that's happening in your life, especially if you try to intellectualize every interaction. Letting go of your desires should significantly loosen things up. Logical analysis will not bring you any closer to the truth; just follow your irrational instincts now and let them lead you in the right direction."
pisces,2010-06-22,"You might be frustrated as you rely on common values when trying to convince others to take up your favorite cause. There's no need to give your desires any more importance than anyone else's; just stay aware of what could make you happier throughout the day. Extreme outcomes -- where everything or nothing goes your way -- are possible, but the increased stress may be too high a price to pay."
aries,2010-06-23,"It seems as if everyone wants to do something with you today, making it difficult for you to stay focused on your tasks. Your popularity is running high and you don't want to miss any opportunity to have fun. But it may not be a smart idea to say yes just because you are afraid of being left out. Maintain a balanced approach to work and play so you can get the most out of your day."
taurus,2010-06-23,"You may be very excited about all that's happening now because you believe that the current opportunities will lead to greater success. Although you have high hopes about what you can manage today, your expectations may be blown out of proportion. Instead of setting yourself up for disappointment, avoid falling for the temptation of taking on too much. It's better to do a great job at fewer tasks than trying to tackle everything haphazardly."
gemini,2010-06-23,"Your current ability to turn on the charm can be very persuasive now. However, a dynamic square between communicator Mercury and pompous Jupiter warns that you may not know when to stop talking once you start. You could inadvertently detract from your message if you say too much, so be extra careful about rambling on after you have already made your point. The adage ""less is more"" is good advice for you to follow today."
cancer,2010-06-23,"You may be involved in a controversy now because you aren't very serious about the changes ahead. Your co-workers might try to show you why you should be responsible and act more maturely, but you just want to have some fun. Enjoying yourself is fine, but don't forget about your obligations, especially if others are depending on you."
leo,2010-06-23,"You have a lot of opinions today and might create situations where you can let everyone know exactly what you think. But others aren't necessarily interested in listening to you ramble, so get to the point as quickly as possible. Wasting time with unnecessary details only makes you less believable so demonstrate your ability to be concise. The art of persuasion is a gift to be used wisely."
virgo,2010-06-23,"You might have a really good idea about an activity you are planning with your friends. But you can become so excited that the event grows by leaps and bounds within your mind until it's unmanageable. Share your thoughts with others and then listen to their feedback. Even if you want to do things differently now, don't be so stuck on doing it your way that everyone else eventually loses interest."
libra,2010-06-23,"You have a very good sense of what you stand for today, but communicating your opinions could be difficult if you lose your perspective. Your optimism can go too far, encouraging you to get involved with a project or cause that might be better left alone. But if others don't want to go along with you, don't push the issue now. Your chances for success will improve if you just let the events unfold naturally."
scorpio,2010-06-23,"These are very intense times, making it even more important for you to find healthy ways to express your feelings. Nevertheless, you are in a positive phase, but someone may still read your energy entirely wrong. If something you say or do brings a negative response from others, rest assured that it's still smarter to share your emotions rather than to bury them. Those that truly know you will understand and appreciate your honesty."
sagittarius,2010-06-23,"You might fly right over the top today because you are picking up on an exuberant wave of energy from the Sun's square to bombastic Jupiter. Remember, your ruling planet Jupiter is still awakening from a long sleep as it continues to travel along with unconventional Uranus. Don't be afraid to focus on the big picture, because the general concepts now are even more important than the myriad of details."
capricorn,2010-06-23,"Paradoxically, stress arises today from too much of a good thing as the illuminating Sun's square to jolly Jupiter lifts your spirits. You must be careful because you could go overboard with the power of your positive thinking. Practicing flexibility and moderation will bring you closer to your goals. Remember, you can make a lot of progress now if you schedule your time wisely."
aquarius,2010-06-23,"You don't want to hold on to any secrets today, yet you really should to earn someone's trust. It would certainly be in bad taste if you revealed something private that was told to you in confidence. Fortunately, there are many other interesting topics to discuss. Still, once you accept the current limitation, you'll feel good about your discretion. Some things are just better left unsaid."
pisces,2010-06-23,"Your colleagues may appear to be more serious about a situation than you are today. Luckily, you are aware of your current Pollyanna tendencies, yet still have a lot of good things to say. Don't abandon your upbeat attitude, even if others are too cautious for your taste. Remain positive as long as you can, but don't embellish the facts just to make your position more convincing."
aries,2010-06-24,"You don't want to hold on to an old resentment today because you cannot see how it could be of benefit to you any longer. You are quite capable of making your companions feel at ease, but not if you're pointing your finger at someone else. Your intentions are good, yet you still could meet a bit of resistance. Give it time; others can't help but soften under your friendly approach."
taurus,2010-06-24,"There are choices to be made, but you still aren't clear enough to make up your mind. At first your path is straightforward, but it becomes more convoluted as you tune into the feelings of someone else involved. A battle of wills can be destructive when each of you have your own specific agenda, but at least both of you know the other's position. It sounds good at first when you state your willingness to be flexible, but now you must hold up your end of the bargain and jointly decide where you want to go next."
gemini,2010-06-24,"There are still a number of significant details to hammer out, but the possibilities keep growing. You have numerous choices available to you today with the inspirational Sagittarius Moon in your 7th House of Relationships. But none of these options are useful unless you also express your interest. Remain as open as possible to the suggestions you receive from others, even if they don't make practical sense at first."
cancer,2010-06-24,"You may have grandiose ideas about what you want to do today, only to discover that you don't have as much energy as you wish. Trying to meet all your obligations is stressful because you have to work so hard just to keep up with everything. Additionally, your feelings could tire you out now as you grapple with the shadows of your subconscious mind. Instead of exhausting yourself, pace your efforts for the long haul."
leo,2010-06-24,"You might finally schedule the play day that you have wanted. Don't hesitate if you find time to relax because the window of opportunity is narrower than you realize. However, there's no need to stress about a missed opportunity if you cannot make something fun happen right away. Instead, change your attitude and enjoy yourself, whatever you are doing."
virgo,2010-06-24,"If you are feeling better now, you might not be sure what exactly happened that changed your outlook. But don't waste time trying to figure it out. Be careful; self-doubt can set the stage for a deeper level of uncertainty. If you place enough energy into worrying, something will undoubtedly go wrong. But the potential is even more obvious when you're already on a spiritual high. Concentrate your hopeful attitude on a positive outcome."
libra,2010-06-24,"As you attempt to find solutions to complex questions, keep in mind that your hope will take you further than your fear. Naturally, there are potential pitfalls to any plan, but your can-do attitude today may be strong enough to overcome any negativity. Ultimately, making a choice is simpler now than it has been for a while; believing that your dream is possible is the first step."
scorpio,2010-06-24,"Building on your accomplishments makes much more sense now than starting all over to do something completely new. Luckily, your dreams don't just spring from unrealistic hope since your plans need to be concrete enough to turn an original idea into a sensible strategy. Don't let others talk you out of something that you already know, but they haven't yet learned. Trust your instincts over anyone else's advice."
sagittarius,2010-06-24,"Your emotions are very close to the surface with the Moon returning to your sign today. You are more optimistic about your future, but insecurities could still creep back into your thoughts as quicksilver Mercury runs into a stressful square with naysayer Saturn. Fortunately, you can be realistic without having a defeatist attitude if you believe in yourself."
capricorn,2010-06-24,You still could be carrying a serious load of responsibility from last week and you need to consider what can be done to move beyond the very same restrictions that continue to hold you back. Take a break and do something that feels good. Don't let a negative attitude prevent you from trying to change your circumstances once the timing is right.
aquarius,2010-06-24,"You can feel your responsibilities building and you want to take care of your end of the deal. You may be freer to enjoy yourself once you have completed some measurable production today. But worrying about what anyone else expects from you is unnecessary. Just do what makes sense, without trying to second-guess others. Above all else, you need to remain true to yourself."
pisces,2010-06-24,"You might feel frustrated when you realize that you cannot escape and let your imagination take you for a ride. Even if you are ready to run away, you still may need to fulfill a family or work obligation first. Don't waste energy whining about what you cannot change. Instead, just do your chores quickly, leaving sufficient time later on to lose yourself in your dreams."
aries,2010-06-25,"You often act impulsively prior to checking in with your common sense. But flying on automatic pilot doesn't necessarily mean that you are following your heart's desire. Although you might have very strong convictions about what you're currently doing, it's still a smart idea to look beyond your first inclination. Taking time for contemplation today will allow you to take subtler concerns into consideration before making a choice."
taurus,2010-06-25,"Instead of doggedly pushing your way forward as usual, consider making a significant change to your current approach to getting things done. It may be beneficial to stand back for a bit in order to get a clearer perspective on where the currents are taking you. Remember, you can always modify your direction if you become dissatisfied with your present course. However, you can continue on your merry way if you are happy about where you are going."
gemini,2010-06-25,"You may nostalgically yearn for the good old days, a simpler time that appears to have slipped away. But don't worry because there are areas of your life that are in major transition now. The fun times aren't over just because a current situation demands such intense focus. Stay aware of your feelings, even if they aren't as light and easy as you prefer. The rewards will come sooner than you think."
cancer,2010-06-25,"Someone close to you may be the source of strong resistance. Unfortunately, it's difficult for you to put your finger on the origin of any ill will. Your intense investigation might put others on the defensive, which can add to the subtle negativity in the air. Instead of attempting to figure everything out all at once, it's better to wait and see how the situation turns out. You'll have a much better idea of what you can do in just a few days."
leo,2010-06-25,"You want to speak your mind, but you might choose to withhold your thoughts for just a little while longer. You aren't afraid of stirring up powerful feelings in your co-workers, although you may not be able to see what good it will do to dredge up old hurts and hidden anger. Nevertheless, finding a way to productively channel your own negative emotions could lessen the pressure during this critical point."
virgo,2010-06-25,"Reexamining old assumptions about love could shed new light on an important friendship today. Or, if you have become involved in a social group, it may be time now to balance your own personal needs with everyone else's goals. There's no need to be afraid to talk about anything. Discussing what you learn in this process with your friends could actually bring you closer together."
libra,2010-06-25,"Everything becomes more complicated today when others place demands on you in such a way that you cannot say no. It's difficult to think about letting anyone down because you want your friends to come through for you when you need them. No matter what your reasons are for saying yes, take this opportunity to face your own fears. Be certain to make decisions based on your needs now and not those of anyone else."
scorpio,2010-06-25,"Your planet ruler Pluto may be the lord of the underworld, yet it isn't really as scary as some people believe. Today, as dark Pluto receives the illuminating light of the Sun, you have a chance to see things that are usually buried far out of sight. Instead of resisting what's hidden, you can now integrate what you learn. Your personal power will increase if you are willing to let the newfound knowledge transform your current perspective."
sagittarius,2010-06-25,"Today is a reminder of the intense changes you have faced over the past several years. Your personal evolutionary process has transformed you from a lowly caterpillar into a magnificent butterfly. But no matter how much you have changed, the transition is still not yet complete. Use your memories to keep the ongoing metamorphosis vital, but keep bringing your thoughts back to the present moment while considering what work you still have left to do."
capricorn,2010-06-25,"You are beginning to realize that you cannot escape the pressure of change, even if you face it through your relationship with someone else. You aren't necessarily exempt, but others appear to be even more overwhelmed by the prospects of relentless transformation. Nevertheless, don't get cocky just because you have some extra time to integrate the lessons you've learned."
aquarius,2010-06-25,"You prefer not having to defend your illogical feelings against attack because it's stressful enough just to understand them yourself. As a general rule, being irrational is not the most comfortable position to place yourself in. Nevertheless, you know that something big is at stake and you're willing to do whatever you must. Remember, cool logic might not help you now as much as simply recognizing what's in your heart."
pisces,2010-06-25,"Even on these long summer days (in the Northern Hemisphere), you still might have to go through a dark night of the soul, questioning the purpose of your life. Luckily, this dilemma shouldn't last too long, so you can get back to more pressing issues soon. If you are doubting yourself or your goals, exercise patience. In a few days your clarity returns and you should be able to see the direction you want to take before you make any major decisions."
aries,2010-06-26,"It's tough to stay positive today as emotional insecurities usher in self-doubt. You could become quite contemplative if everything doesn't go your way as the Lunar Eclipse rattles your responsible 10th House. Your lesson is that you can be close to people who have goals that are very different from yours. Questioning your assumptions is healthy, but don't mistrust your choices now, even if they are not what others expect."
taurus,2010-06-26,The Lunar Eclipse in your 9th House of Big Ideas presses you to reconsider your opinions prior to telling an acquaintance how you feel. Your caution is justified because it's crucial to say the right thing when you finally reveal what's on your mind. But hesitating too long isn't a good idea or you might miss your chance to influence the thinking of those around you.
gemini,2010-06-26,"Saying yes to a friend could be a really smart move today if you don't inflate your expectations so high that you end up being disappointed. Unfortunately, Mercury's square to opinionated Jupiter indicates how challenging it is now to interact with others based on common ground, instead of on personal needs. Luckily, staying open to change, combined with your willingness to be surprised, can help you get the most of a current connection."
cancer,2010-06-26,"Today's Full Moon Eclipse intensifies your 7th House of Relationships, possibly reactivating hurtful memories. But your emotions may not be rational so don't assume that current circumstances are potentially harmful. Your immediate security isn't as dependent on other people's reactions to you as you might believe. Create a safe haven within, where your feelings are more determined by your own attitude than by events in the outer world."
leo,2010-06-26,"You have plenty to do before you can start the more relaxing part of the weekend, and the sooner you begin your chores, the quicker you'll be done. Nevertheless, the hardworking Capricorn Lunar Eclipse in your 6th House of Details suggests that you must focus on the little things rather than on the bigger picture. Tighten up all the loose ends first; then you will feel good about moving on to something that is more fun."
virgo,2010-06-26,"It's difficult to feel creative when you are on such a tight schedule, but too much to do now can work in your favor. Your efficiency is heightened when you don't have time to be unfocused and dreamy, so today's Lunar Eclipse in your 5th House of Self-Expression forces you to produce under pressure. Don't take everything so seriously; enjoying yourself will help you be even more inspired."
libra,2010-06-26,"Today's Lunar Eclipse falls in your 4th House of Roots, motivating you to push past the surface and get to the bottom of a complicated issue. It may be unsettling to share your fears with anyone else, but you could discover that it's not so bad once you get them out into the open. Don't delay; a significant discussion now may change things for you in a healthy way faster than you can imagine."
scorpio,2010-06-26,"Today's Full Moon Eclipse in your 3rd House of Communication joins your key planet Pluto, demanding that you remain aware of how your feelings affect your attempts to be objective. You may believe that you're considering all the facts, yet you might fall prey to the illusion of reality instead of the actual truth. Fortunately, you can gain clarity of thought throughout the day if you are committed to maintaining your integrity."
sagittarius,2010-06-26,Spending money with a Lunar Eclipse in your 2nd House of Resources isn't necessarily the smartest thing to do because you can be emotionally attached to whatever object you currently want. A purchase today could be based less on logic and more on a whim. Avoid buyer's remorse by waiting a few days before buying something you really don't need.
capricorn,2010-06-26,"Today's Full Moon Eclipse in your sign symbolizes a crisis in your emotional cycle. You may be overly worried as you get caught up in a drama that you would normally avoid. Your desires are very intense now, making it tough to establish a clear perspective on what you want. Don't make any demands on others until you can objectively clarify what you truly need."
aquarius,2010-06-26,"It may be difficult to shake off a dream today, even after you are fully awake because the Lunar Eclipse rattles your 12th House of Soul Consciousness. But instead of trying to forget about a vision, contemplate the message that's coming from your subconscious. Don't worry if it evades logic; just replaying the images in your mind can be enough to change your view."
pisces,2010-06-26,"You may feel very protective of your friends today because you truly appreciate having them on your team. The Full Moon Eclipse in your 11th House of Social Networking encourages you to connect with others, yet there may be so much going on in your head now that you just want to be left alone. Even if your day is full of activity, find a way to have a bit of quiet time all by yourself."
aries,2010-06-27,"Anything you say today could provoke an immediate reaction or even an open conflict. It's not that you feel combative; rather, your words sound intense now because you could be worried that no one wants to listen to your ideas. Your concerns aren't likely justified so it's not necessary to overcompensate. Let go of your fears and relax for the best results."
taurus,2010-06-27,"There's no need to overreact if you feel like your plans are being blocked today. It could be a blessing in disguise to have time to let your ideas mature. But your key planet Venus aligns with unstable Uranus, enticing you to take a long shot. Practice patience instead of taking a risk with an aggressive strategy. Your day grows more enjoyable once you realize that you don't have to try to impress anyone."
gemini,2010-06-27,"You may be somewhat limited now by your current lack of experience or the memory of something that didn't turn out well. Nevertheless, embracing your entire past allows you to accept yourself for who you are, rather than trying to live up to someone's unrealistic expectations. Although others will form their own opinions, ultimately your actions will speak with more accuracy than anything you can say."
cancer,2010-06-27,"You may have to manage the consequences of being in over your head if you underestimated how much time it would take to finish a job. Rather than trying to complete all your chores, don't be afraid to say what's impossible now. Figuring a way out makes more sense than attempting to bluff your way through an untenable situation. Your safest strategy today is to begin by admitting the truth to those who are depending on you."
leo,2010-06-27,Deceiving someone can get you into trouble today and there's no room for fudging the truth. But this doesn't mean that you should turn a straightforward confession into a melodrama. Don't embellish the facts or hold on to a recent judgment error. Just demonstrate your courage by being honest and simply doing what you can to help others.
virgo,2010-06-27,"You want to be practical now, yet you must first clear away any self-limiting assumptions you have made about your life. Even if the obstacles you face appear to be circumstantial, it's likely that you have contributed in some manner to the current frustrating situation. Remember that clues are everywhere; the inner truth will reveal the outer solution."
libra,2010-06-27,"Recovering a lost memory about your childhood today could change your perspective of what success means to you. Perhaps you recollect something from a dream that tempts you to set your current goals aside. But even if you aren't interested in making a significant career change, you still can start by slowly integrating your unrealized fantasies into your life."
scorpio,2010-06-27,"You are eager to dig into the mysteries of your own psyche as messenger Mercury opposes ruthless Pluto today. Fortunately, this intense planetary pair can guide you to a new place emotionally, or might even reveal buried treasure. But it's not easy to overcome your uncertainty if memories stimulate awkward interactions with your peers. Instead of getting hung up over an unimportant fact, focus on the big picture now. Facing resistance takes courage but could lead to positive transformation."
sagittarius,2010-06-27,"It's not easy living with another person who attempts to avoid your real concerns. Still, striving to get your way doesn't seem to make anything better. You just want a straightforward answer today, even if it is no. Unfortunately, satisfaction is tantalizingly close while still being out of reach. Don't fret if you can't reach the resolution you currently seek; it will happen when you least expect it."
capricorn,2010-06-27,"It's not your style to do something that goes against your principles. Even if your friends appeal to your common sense now, you'll just match their energy and push back as necessary. Unfortunately you may not be able to ease the tension today by just championing your truth. Instead, hold your ground by remaining true to your beliefs without trying to convince anyone else of your superiority."
aquarius,2010-06-27,"You could bump into a stone wall of fear, only to discover that the resistance today originates from you. Although you may be surprised by the issues that surface, don't just walk away from a tough set of circumstances. Do whatever you can to help move beyond an old story that prevents you from reaching your new goals."
pisces,2010-06-27,"Annoyance turns into anger unless you can find a way to blow off a little steam today. But you probably won't make anything better by rallying the troops around your new plan. Nevertheless, if your position is grounded, sticking to accurate facts should allow you to line up one or two key authorities who want to support your efforts. It won't take much to reach a critical mass; a very small number of key allies can attract all the help you need."
aries,2010-06-28,"You may be able to see a little more clearly today, but the fog isn't lifting as fast as you wish. Nevertheless, it's still better knowing a bit more of the truth now, instead of feeling like you are completely in the dark. Although it could take a while longer to gain clarity, in the meantime you can work with what you know. Relying on friends for support can help you over the rough spots."
taurus,2010-06-28,"You cannot take the easy way out today by just going along with the group. You may want to feel included, but it's more crucial now to follow your heart instead. It's not useful to worry about what your family and friends think, for they might not relate to your current motives. They'll probably understand more than you realize if you tell them why your goals are so important to you."
gemini,2010-06-28,"Your key planet Mercury joins the Sun today in your 2nd House of Self-Worth, requiring you to consider what is truly valuable in your life. Don't take the lazy way out by just accepting what you are told. Instead, be willing to go against the grain of other people's expectations as you set new goals for the days ahead."
cancer,2010-06-28,"You are receiving mixed signals today as the Mercury-Sun conjunction in your sign seeks emotional connections. Simultaneously, the detached Aquarius Moon reminds you that some independence is healthy. Ultimately, the closer you get to someone you like, the more you want to escape. But your desire to run away could be partially based on your fear of being rejected. Keep in mind that your concerns may be reflective of past experiences and that this time things could be very different."
leo,2010-06-28,"Your feelings flow directly from your dreams today, making it difficult to approach a situation logically. Paradoxically, you believe that you can be quite precise as you explain your needs to someone else. Unfortunately, there can be a wide gulf between what you say and what others hear now, especially if you are all motivated by different goals. Instead of playing the ""right-wrong"" game, honor the variety of life strategies. Your path isn't for anyone but you."
virgo,2010-06-28,"As your key planet Mercury aligns with the Sun in your 11th House of the Future, you may have your mind set on reasserting your hold on reality today, especially if you allowed things to slip in the past few days. But falling into old routines isn't a smart idea, even if it offers immediate comfort. It's healthier to work and play in new ways now, so be willing to stretch beyond your normal limits."
libra,2010-06-28,"You have something important to say today, but you could be hesitant to make waves. Fortunately, you can get away with saying nearly anything as long as it's the truth and you don't blame anyone else for your feelings. Try not to be too rigid in your approach to sharing your thoughts. You'll feel better after you have taken the time to express yourself, even if your disclosure is spontaneous and unexpected."
scorpio,2010-06-28,"You want to know how others feel, so it can be frustrating when they tell you what they are thinking instead. You need depth and intensity, but it appears that your friends and family prefer interactions that are cut and dried. Find time today to explore the magic that can be created with someone who is interested in matching your level of emotional expression."
sagittarius,2010-06-28,"It's okay to temporarily forget about your long-term plans. Unfulfilled obligations won't disappear, but it's wise to place a healthy distance between you and your goals to freshen your perspective. It's almost like going on a short vacation as you only take care of responsibilities that demand your immediate attention. Make sure that you set aside sufficient time for rest and relaxation because you'll be back to work soon enough."
capricorn,2010-06-28,"Pay attention to an issue that you recently set aside so you can regain control of your life. Getting back to basics can stir thoughts about eliminating unnecessary activities now. But it's likely that you'll need to talk about your new strategy with a close friend or partner in order to clarify your position. Remember, it's now time to look ahead, even if you're tempted to think about the past."
aquarius,2010-06-28,"Although you like meeting new people, you might bump into someone today who feels like a long lost friend. But the instant familiarity may frighten you and you could be tempted to close down before either of you utters a word. Just let things unfold naturally and acknowledge the magic of the universe as the fates bring a special person into your life."
pisces,2010-06-28,"Today can be a day of spiritual renewal for you, even if you are hard at work. Your imaginative powers are strong now if you are willing to let go of preconceived ideas and be more spontaneous. But don't be surprised if others don't notice that you're any different. You don't need to say anything about traveling through inner spaces; this journey is a private affair meant to be experienced by you alone."
aries,2010-06-29,"Hard work combined with attention to details should have the desired impact today, but you may have a difficult time staying focused. You keep looking around, searching for something that's more enjoyable than your current responsibilities. However, you won't likely find satisfaction because no matter how much fun you experience now, you want more. You'll be happier in the long run if you remember to appreciate what you have and follow through on your commitments."
taurus,2010-06-29,"Your key planet Venus can tempt you to ask for what you want today as bombastic Jupiter inflates your confidence and increases your desires. Unfortunately, you may incorrectly assume that you should get whatever you wish. But the world does not owe you the comfort you think you deserve. Letting go of your attachment to personal gratification now could actually make it easier to acquire."
gemini,2010-06-29,"You are even more socially inclined today than usual, yet your eagerness could be annoying to your friends. Your upbeat attitude makes it difficult for you to recognize boundaries because you won't likely take the time to consider someone else's feelings. Fortunately, if your intentions are good, you'll eventually get the message and pull back enough to give others the space they need."
cancer,2010-06-29,"If someone you like is acting a bit cooler to you now, recognize your possible role in the current situation. You might not be aware of the mixed messages you are sending. Although you may ask for an emotional connection, your words and actions are probably demonstrating something else. Luckily, you can easily change the dynamics by simply talking openly about your feelings, even if this isn't your normal approach."
leo,2010-06-29,"It's scary when you open your heart, especially if others cannot match your fiery intensity. You may overcompensate by demonstrating your ability to be emotionally detached now instead of admitting how much you care. But rather than keeping score, remember that every person expresses love differently. Your fears will dissipate when you graciously accept what is currently being offered without further judgment or comparison."
virgo,2010-06-29,"The Moon's visit to humanitarian Aquarius while the Sun is in your 11th House of Groups reminds you to get involved in a social cause. You can be of service to others now if your goals are consistent with a larger group. But if they are not, you'll just feel out of place. Fortunately, you're not seeking recognition and you don't want anything in return for your good deeds. Relishing the feeling that you did something of value is enough of a reward for your contribution."
libra,2010-06-29,"You can act very spontaneous today when your mind is liberated from an old emotional attachment. This isn't just about making an artistic statement; it's about reasserting your private connection to a higher spiritual purpose, expressing yourself in a way that helps others see their own true nature. Without a lot of effort, you can use your talents now to positively impact the lives of those around you simply by showing up and being yourself."
scorpio,2010-06-29,"The independent Aquarius Moon falls in your 4th House of Family today, reawakening your desire to get away in order to gain perspective on what's been happening on the home front. If you are enmeshed in emotional issues, it may be wiser now to step back from them for a bit, instead of trying to decide what to do next. Although your escape won't solve the underlying issue, it can help you see what's really going on with more objectivity."
sagittarius,2010-06-29,"You cannot easily separate the cause from the effect today. Even if you believe that you are being objective, you cannot discern your perceptions from your feelings. Although the logic is clear, your facts are still dependent upon opinions. You can find yourself in hot water now if too many people believe that you have the truth when you simply have a unique point of view."
capricorn,2010-06-29,"The Moon's current visit to your financial 2nd House encourages you to spend money on a technology toy that you might not need. You may recollect a time from your childhood when you coveted something but couldn't afford it. Or perhaps you recall an event when you weren't allowed to buy what you wanted. Don't make a purchase for the wrong reasons. Wait a day or two before deciding on your potential acquisition; if you still think it's a good idea, go for it."
aquarius,2010-06-29,"You like to think of yourself as someone who can make independent decisions. Today, however, you could become emotionally hooked to what others think because the Moon in your sign influences your heart. Even if you try to demonstrate how cool you are by remaining flexible, your true desires will still be apparent. Don't bury your feelings now; you are more likable when you reveal your vulnerabilities."
pisces,2010-06-29,"You might attempt to start the week by coming clean and sharing what you are feeling. But if you aren't ready to open up just yet, you should be able to get away with keeping your emotions to yourself. Go ahead and enjoy your private daydreams. Just remember that you won't be able to hold on to your secret forever."
aries,2010-06-30,"You may not be sure of how you feel today because your mood keeps changing throughout the day. You recognize that you're heading into a new phase but you don't know whether to hold on to the past or push into the future. Ultimately, you are best off if you simply keep your attention on what is happening in the present moment without looking back or ahead."
taurus,2010-06-30,"You may think that you're planning the future, only to realize that you are actually revisiting a familiar issue today. Your challenge is to balance your personal needs with those of your workmates or boss. It's not easy for you to work closely with others now, but you'll gain the most if you can function effectively as part of a team. Don't be overly concerned about being productive; instead, concentrate on cooperating  with your peers."
gemini,2010-06-30,"It's difficult to leave your personal issues at home today and yet it's complicated when they carry over into the workplace. You may truly believe that you have everything under control until your raw emotions suddenly erupt. When they do, it could be just as much of a shock to you as to others. But it's not necessary to wait until it's too late; get your feelings out into the open sooner rather than later for a less chaotic day."
cancer,2010-06-30,"Even if you were certain about your plans for the day, remembering your dreams could have you doubting yourself before you reach your goals. Your uncertainty may worry you, especially if you waste precious time processing your emotions. Fortunately, you can save the day by changing your attitude. Accept the notion that everything happens for a reason. You might not reach your original destination, but you can end up someplace even better."
leo,2010-06-30,"A close friend or partner could drag you into a messy situation today, and you might not be able to untangle it very easily. Handling the uncertainty of someone else's emotions is hard work yet it's even more difficult if money or power is at stake. Don't give up; the differences between you and others may be less consequential than the gulf between the thoughts in your head and the desires of your heart."
virgo,2010-06-30,"You could be bored with your co-workers or your job, yet there may not be a simple way to cut loose unless you're willing to turn your life upside down. Your visions could be so convincing now that you lose track of what's real. However, attempts to avoid your feelings by denying them could lead you to discouragement. Don't hold back; a little disruption in your life might be just what you need."
libra,2010-06-30,"If you are living with a secret, it's not yet time to bring it out into the open. Unfortunately, Pluto is casting a shadow over your key planet Venus today, raising feelings of guilt or shame about your recent choices. Nevertheless, there's no need to worry because you have more important tasks to handle. Focus on the mundane aspects of your life now, such as the details of a project at work. Take your mind away from your inner life so you can set the stage for the upcoming outer journey."
scorpio,2010-06-30,"Although today is a workday, the Moon in your 4th House of Emotional Security is telling you to stay at home and be close to your family. But this doesn't mean that you can be irresponsible, for others are depending on your participation. Remember, you are not in control of all the variables, so decisions about work and play might be out of your hands. Don't exhaust yourself resisting the fateful winds of change; go with the flow instead of against it."
sagittarius,2010-06-30,"You may be pulled between personal issues and career responsibilities today. Luckily, you can temporarily resolve your dilemma if you don't force your choices onto anyone else. Your passions might be aroused, intensifying your interactions with others, but you are able to downplay your inner tension. Flexibility is the key ingredient in your approach, for you might change your mind later in the day."
capricorn,2010-06-30,"You might feel doubtful about your ability to live up to other people's expectations today. Maybe you realize that you took on more than you can handle. Or, perhaps, a complex situation is too emotionally demanding and you want to escape. Don't bother to hide your error in judgment by telling an outright lie or even by stretching the truth. It's best to be brutally honest now and then deal with the fallout from your actions afterward."
aquarius,2010-06-30,"You might feel the ups and downs of your changing moods today, with the changeable Moon back in your sign. You are confident one minute yet could suffer from low self-esteem the next. Being pushed and pulled by your emotions isn't enjoyable, but you should be able to learn something about yourself in the process. Blaming others won't make anyone feel any better, so keep your accusations to yourself."
pisces,2010-06-30,"Your emotions slip from a noisy experimental lab today into the silence of a meditation hall. Although personal relationships could be your number one source of stress now, you don't have to let your feelings get in the way of things at work. Your anxiety doesn't have to wreck your positive progress; no matter how busy you are, breathe deeply and make time for contemplation or prayer to help you alleviate the tension."
aries,2010-07-01,"You like being correct yet you could be growing tired of having to fight to prove your point. However, giving in isn't as simple as it sounds, because what you gain from relinquishing control may not be worth it. Luckily, you'll probably win an argument today because the words will come easier as your adrenaline rises. Just remember that you don't need to make everyone else wrong for you to be right."
taurus,2010-07-01,"Sometimes you don't understand your friends, especially when they appear to be so much less practical than you are. However, you might appreciate their lack of common sense today because your emotions take precedence over logic now. Even if you cannot rationally justify your choices, listen to your peers and take a risk to follow your heart's desire."
gemini,2010-07-01,"You may have a tough time staying on track because every thought that passes through your mind today can open the door to another string of fantasies. Although you are tempted to resist your daydreams now, they could take you on quite a pleasant journey. You can meander through your imagination, but don't forget that the real work is back on Earth. Enjoy your diversions, but don't turn them into obsessions or your inner world might interfere with your plans for the day."
cancer,2010-07-01,Today's compassionate Pisces Moon harmonizes with the nurturing Cancer Sun to remind you that caring for others is one way for you to care for yourself. The boundaries that separate individuals are so thin now that there may be no difference between your reaction to a total stranger and a long-time acquaintance. Allow yourself to feel how every person is equal from a spiritual perspective.
leo,2010-07-01,"You may be driven to help the underdog today, but this altruism could clash with your admiration of a real winner. Still, your idea of a top dog isn't necessarily a traditional one, since you realize that success goes beyond fame and fortune. Although you may easily admire a kind and creative person who is willing to take a risk, everyone else will benefit most from your generous assistance now."
virgo,2010-07-01,"The fuzzy Pisces Moon in your 7th House of Others can make everyone seem confused, but you may actually be projecting your own feelings today. It's as if your friends and associates don't know what to do next and are looking to you for guidance. You could be frustrated now because you get annoyed when someone can't efficiently translate his or her intentions into simple dialogue. Be gentle; remember that when you're judging anyone else, you might also be judging yourself."
libra,2010-07-01,"You must focus your physical and mental energy in order to take care of today's business, but you're not really in the mood. This isn't about laziness; you have enough stamina to get up and do what's expected of you. Rather, you may be bored doing the same old routine and are more inclined to make good use of your creative talents. Shake up your workday by going out of your way to do something totally out of the ordinary."
scorpio,2010-07-01,"You might feel more like a Fish than a Scorpion now, as the dreamy Pisces Moon moves through your 5th House of Self-Expression. But you aren't necessarily interested in playing anyone else's game today; you want to make up your own rules. Compromise and meet someone halfway; it will be much easier than you think and more rewarding than going it alone."
sagittarius,2010-07-01,"You may be under your own magic spell today that makes you believe all is well on the home front. Nevertheless, it's more important now to be realistic than optimistic, for the haze of your ideals can cloud your natural good judgment. Fortunately, clarity should return tomorrow, so delay a big decision for a little while longer."
capricorn,2010-07-01,"Normally, you are very good at communicating your ideas, so be patient when your closest confidants tell you that they don't understand you now. Oddly enough, you could probably repeat everything almost verbatim, yet they still miss your point. Don't give up. Keep recycling to the basics and you'll soon see the light bulbs over their heads turn on one by one."
aquarius,2010-07-01,"Watch your pocketbook now because you may obsess over a fantasy of purchasing something that could change your image. But money cannot buy happiness, even if you're hooked by the idea of acquiring a piece of artwork, a tech toy or new clothing. Looking at material possessions as the source of satisfaction could frustrate you even more. It's time to turn your thoughts inward and consider what you can do, rather than thinking about what you could own."
pisces,2010-07-01,"Don't worry if your moods get the best of you now, because this is typical while the Moon is in your sign. Become more aware of your feelings while remembering that you don't have to respond unconsciously to whatever happens. You may not be able to control the current circumstances, but you can manage your reactions. Taking a few deep breaths when you feel emotional could be sufficient to improve your day."
aries,2010-07-02,"The dreams that have been floating around at the edge of your awareness may actually take shape today. Although this sounds lovely, fantasies can complicate your life when they become real. But there's no need to fall prey to your own fears that can turn the sweetest situation sour. Keep in mind that you don't have to prove anything to anyone now. All you need to do is show up with a pure heart."
taurus,2010-07-02,"If someone you know needs your help today, you probably won't be able to say no. You might decide that it's smarter to mind your own business and to get on with your work, but rational detachment won't win out over your feelings now. Don't fret if you are overcome with sympathy for an underdog. Naturally, there isn't anything wrong with assisting those in need, but accepting your limitations can prevent frustration later on."
gemini,2010-07-02,"Your day may not go according to your plan; it could even be turned inside out because someone else's behavior directly impacts your schedule. You may not be able to maintain control over all unexpected events, but you can change the outcome by consciously managing your reactions. Anger or negativity could be misdirected, so find a way to move to a higher place. Forgiveness and understanding will produce the most positive results."
cancer,2010-07-02,"Even if you want to be helpful today, you could easily misread someone's intentions. You might have strong suspicions that others aren't being very supportive of your efforts and it may even seem that they are working against you. But you could also be afraid of being abandoned. Managing your own emotional insecurities now is more crucial than worrying about anyone else."
leo,2010-07-02,"This is an emotionally charged day, especially if you disagree with a close friend or partner. Fortunately, you have an opportunity to turn an uneasy situation into a positive one by setting new boundaries. Instead of analyzing your current circumstances within the narrow confines of personal beliefs, step beyond your limitations. Reframe what's happening in the spirit of gratitude and abundance. But remember, it's not about getting more; it's about appreciating what you already have."
virgo,2010-07-02,"You might not have a very solid grip on your future today, so it's too early to make a detailed plan. Creating a map before you have a definite destination is putting the cart before the horse. Don't get caught up in the details. For now, keep an open channel to your heart's desire and wait a few days before figuring out a sensible strategy."
libra,2010-07-02,"Someone's unexpected actions at work could send your confidence into a temporary tailspin, but you should be able to pull out of it gracefully. At first you might believe that you made a mistake, but you were likely given incorrect information. Accept the fact that you didn't do anything wrong; once you stop blaming yourself, it's easy to turn things around."
scorpio,2010-07-02,"Without even trying you can say just the right thing today, making it easier to get what you want while also enabling you to feel good about yourself. You may need more time to think about the variety of options in front of you. Don't cave under pressure; wait until you are good and ready before making a commitment. In the meantime, feel the love that's all around you."
sagittarius,2010-07-02,"Intense feelings can pull you toward someone special today, but you may be unsure as to what comes next. Normally you are content to just make it up as you go, but now that you are on unfamiliar ground, you are more hesitant. Paradoxically, there's no hurry to go anywhere; you are already where you need to be. Nevertheless, your current position can be significantly altered once you change your mind and relax."
capricorn,2010-07-02,"Someone you know may express affectionate feelings toward you today, which can turn an easygoing moment into an awkward one. You may be unsure how to react and might decide to put up walls in order to maintain stability. But it may not be the other person you are avoiding; it could be your own emotions in a projected form that you're trying to ignore. Paradoxically, as you grow more comfortable with yourself, you also become more open to everyone else."
aquarius,2010-07-02,You could be confused at work if someone appears to be avoiding you today. But don't take it personally if he or she is a bit shy now and needs to withdraw emotionally to create safe space. There's no need to pursue others who aren't eager to interact. Let them be as they are without any heavy judgments or expectations from you. Give your friends the same room to breathe that you normally want from them.
pisces,2010-07-02,"It's not easy for you to express what's in your heart today, but the emotional Pisces Moon gives you the courage to take a chance. The response may not be what you expect, for others may feel threatened by your disclosure. Saying too much could reveal things they don't want to know. Remember, just because you feel something doesn't mean you need to share it. Pay close attention to your audience's reaction before you go too far."
aries,2010-07-03,"You must pay careful attention to your energy level today or you can find yourself in serious trouble because the Moon's return to your sign kicks up a storm. You may actually believe that you can do everything, but you cannot. Instead of exhausting yourself, make sensible choices and cut back your agenda as needed. A practical approach enables you to schedule your time and could prevent unpleasant consequences later in the day."
taurus,2010-07-03,"It's not easy to maintain your pragmatic approach to life today because unexpected events loosen your hold on reality. It's not that you don't know what to do; it's just that so much is going on that you can't keep up with it all. Prioritizing tasks is easier if you make a list, but you must be willing to modify your strategy as a situation changes. Taking a calculated risk now should bring positive results."
gemini,2010-07-03,"If having fun with your friends matters more now than fulfilling promises, you should stand back and reevaluate your priorities. Even if you're being pulled in two directions, it's not a smart idea to ignore your responsibilities for the sake of pleasure. You could come close to the edge now, but don't abandon your family obligations for the sake of a fleeting moment of excitement."
cancer,2010-07-03,"The Moon's entry into your 10th House of Status might encourage you to take care of business by nurturing others, but an inner voice may demand more. You can feel the conflict, even if you understand that extreme reactions, both emotional and physical, are not what you need now. Nevertheless, you are tempted toward riskier than normal behavior. Remember, it's healthier to get your adrenaline rush without putting anyone in danger, including yourself."
leo,2010-07-03,"If you have plans that are larger than life, you'll need to balance them with practical concerns. But this doesn't mean that you must hold yourself back; it's just a sign that you shouldn't ignore what's happening now. Don't be afraid to reach out beyond your comfort zone. However, you'll probably be disappointed today if you expect a miracle. Keep in mind that stretching past your usual limits can produce exciting results."
virgo,2010-07-03,"You normally excel at making finely tuned adjustments to your life, but now you are being called on to make a larger change. The need to get something done perfectly can be aggravating as the just-right spot remains elusive. The solution to your current anxiety lies in your willingness to graciously relinquish control. Temporarily accepting circumstances enables you to overcome frustration and relax."
libra,2010-07-03,"You may be on a life-long quest to find balance in your world. If this is true, then today can bring the birth of a new purpose, for the current imbalance may not be letting you rest. First you rush ahead into something new, yet you still struggle to let down your protective walls. Ultimate harmony may be elusive, but you'll feel better now if you simply moderate the extremes."
scorpio,2010-07-03,"You are excited by a shakeup to your daily routine and might be ready to jump in with full force. But as you do, you may suddenly wish that you'd gone slower, fearing the abruptness of intense change. If you've started a project, there's no way to go back. But you could take the next one a little slower. Remember, you are in control and can alter the pace of your day in a way that works best."
sagittarius,2010-07-03,"A surge of excitement can make you smile as the fiery Aries Moon indicates that you are ready for something new. But you are also a bit cautious because you don't want to jeopardize what you have already gained. Remember, you are best served now by exercising a bit of self-restraint as the Moon sweeps across indulgent Jupiter. Take things slow so you don't make miscalculated judgments at the beginning of your journey."
capricorn,2010-07-03,"You want to be responsible today, but ultimately might not be able to suppress your impulse to break free. You can't bear the idea of being excluded from the summer fun because you want to feel the exhilaration. Go ahead and throw caution to the wind. Ultimately, it won't likely matter in the long run, for you'll still need to change your plans again as the instability of the moment catches up with you."
aquarius,2010-07-03,"New and different activities are more tempting because you are seeking escape from the drudgery of your routine. The Moon joins your rebellious planet Uranus today, so you are eager to go over the edge. If you hold back, you'll later wish that you had the courage to relinquish control. But if you give in to your whims, you might wish that you hadn't. Accept your decision as the best one you could make for now."
pisces,2010-07-03,"You are tempted to begin a new project, but it's more constructive now to focus on what you have already started. Nevertheless, it can be challenging to find the best pace to sustain your current efforts. You might do better if you change how fast you work throughout the day. Unfortunately, your varied rhythm might annoy others. Don't worry about public opinion; instead, just concentrate on being productive the best way you can."
aries,2010-07-04,"Your sense of urgency builds throughout the day, provoking you to express yourself, no matter what you are feeling. Your self-confidence enables you to try several different methods as you search for the most efficient one to complete your work. But caution is advised because a wild, unpremeditated approach might cause more problems than it's worth."
taurus,2010-07-04,"You might wish that the weekend could last longer, but your desire for more time off could spoil an otherwise fine day. There is nothing to be gained from complaining now, so change your attitude and transform your frustration into action. Don't waste time thinking about how you can improve your life; instead, just do it. By turning your discontent into a positive force, you should be able to enjoy the day more than you expect."
gemini,2010-07-04,"You are up for almost anything that sounds like a good time today, but your spontaneous behavior could get you into mischief. Your easygoing and fun-loving style can quickly turn an uneventful family function into a thoroughly enjoyable party. Take a chance and do it if it sounds like fun, but establish limits and make sure not to overstep them."
cancer,2010-07-04,"You may have high self-esteem now, yet your self-assurance could also lead to trouble. Normally, your greatest strength is your patience; you are able to wait until the right moment before taking action. Although exercising caution prevents foolish behavior, it can also cause you to miss an opportunity. But today you are ready to jump quickly into something new. Remember, a little forethought now won't hurt."
leo,2010-07-04,"It's not easy to settle down your thinking as you fantasize about traveling to a mountain retreat or a desert isle. There's no restraining your dreams now. However, turning a fantasy into reality may be more challenging than you think. Nevertheless, it isn't impossible, so don't give up on your grand adventure until you have exhausted all your options."
virgo,2010-07-04,"You may be intrigued by what you don't know now. Unfortunately, you realize that you're missing something and this motivates you to delve beneath the surface to find what's hidden. You may strike it rich by discovering a treasure of facts that leads you into a new discipline. But there's no need to struggle, for you might already have all the data you need."
libra,2010-07-04,"A friend or family member could appear very assertive or even aggressive now, overpowering a difficult conversation with less meaningful noise. You don't want to expose your vulnerability in light of someone else's negativity. If it seems like others are on your case, it's futile to become defensive and put up protective walls. However, you can see where the discussion goes if you understand the source of the current emotional charge."
scorpio,2010-07-04,"Get away from your routine responsibilities and go have some fun today. Of course, you may need to schedule your good times because you won't be able to just walk away from a current commitment. You should be able to finish your chores later, but focusing your attention can produce a prodigious amount of work in a short amount of time now. All you need to do is find your voice, state your intentions, and concentrate on what's left to finish."
sagittarius,2010-07-04,"When you have a creative breakthrough, you want to take immediate action. Although it's often smarter to wait a while before jumping in, this time you don't need to be afraid to shoot from the hip because hesitation does not make sense now. Taking careful aim is advised when you have the time. However, don't hold back today; the fastest response contains your purest of intentions."
capricorn,2010-07-04,"The rules have all been rewritten, allowing you to say what you mean without having to worry about what other people think. You realize that holding back your feelings won't bring you what you want. Still, it's hard to know exactly what to do if discussing a certain topic makes you uncomfortable. Contemplating your actions ahead of time doesn't help; it only makes you more nervous. Don't waste any more time preparing; just start talking."
aquarius,2010-07-04,"You are quite intense now and the power of your convictions can scare someone close to you. Although you may not feel angry, you are willing to fight for what you want. Others may be confused by your intentions; assure them that you mean no harm but you're just very passionate about your position. Then be straightforward and tell your story as objectively as possible."
pisces,2010-07-04,"Something is about to change, but you can't quite put your finger on what it is today. Meanwhile, your emotions are raw and you are tired. You're on edge because you cannot express what you feel. Instead of trying to describe your perspective now, keep in mind that actions speak louder than words. If necessary, you can always explain yourself later on."
aries,2010-07-05,"Today's Aries Moon can trick you into needlessly worrying about all the wrong things. But oddly enough, you aren't likely to take yourself too seriously now, even if you stop and think about what you are doing. After a few moments of concerned contemplation you are ready to return to action, whether or not you really handled the underlying issue. Remember, you cannot escape from the truth; you will just be required to reprocess your current experience some other time."
taurus,2010-07-05,"You don't have as much to hide as you believe, for your story will probably come out into the open sooner than you realize. If you attempt to mislead anyone on purpose, even if only by a lie of omission, an otherwise lovely moment could turn sour pretty quickly. Keep in mind that secrets can get in the way of a special connection with a friend."
gemini,2010-07-05,"Today may bring more fun than you expect, even if there's a lot of work to do. But don't attempt to escape from your responsibilities; instead, find a way to enjoy yourself while meeting your obligations. Even if your mind wanders, pull yourself back from the enticing world of daydreams. Staying focused on practical issues isn't easy now, but it will allow you to take more time off later when you can truly relax."
cancer,2010-07-05,"Although you may not be eager to go back to work today, you'll quickly adapt to the idea of fulfilling your current responsibilities. Your change of heart may be fueled by your recognition of the financial or psychological benefits of putting in extra effort. Thinking about something that you want to purchase could encourage you to give a project all you have. As long as you are feeling inspired, whatever motivates you can be turned into constructive action."
leo,2010-07-05,"Your self-confidence is so contagious now that you should be able to enlist others to assist you with your project. Just remember not to say too much, for the more verbose you sound, the less sincere you appear. Pretend you are on a secret mission today to get someone's attention. Once your message is delivered, stop talking. Effective communication enables everyone to see you in your best light."
virgo,2010-07-05,"It's bothersome to you when others appear to be so optimistic, especially if you think that they are avoiding the truth. But that's only half the picture today, for you could actually benefit by loosening up and temporarily indulging in your fantasies. Fortunately, no one needs to know what happens in your imagination because you are not required to tell anyone what you are thinking. Giving yourself permission to enjoy your inner world will also soften your judgments on those you love."
libra,2010-07-05,"Business and personal relationships are emphasized, with the Moon in your 7th House of Companions today. Unfortunately, your most supportive allies might appear argumentative now, even if they claim otherwise. Keep in mind that you could be projecting your own suppressed anger onto someone else and that it might be you who is in denial. Try tuning into what's happening with your heart instead of with your head."
scorpio,2010-07-05,"Taking a chance and doing something different for your health is a good idea today. The energetic Aries Moon is visiting your 6th House of Details, encouraging you to pay careful attention to the basics. Something as simple as changing what you eat or upgrading your exercise routine could create the results you want."
sagittarius,2010-07-05,"Four planets in fire signs Aries and Leo warm your emotions and tempt you to burn your candle from both ends. The Moon in your 5th House of Romance trines sweet Venus, inspiring you to share what's in your heart. But it's crucial that you avoid spinning wheels of words that go around in the same circles. Take a gamble and try a different approach just to shake things up."
capricorn,2010-07-05,"Your honesty is your greatest strength, for when others see that you are living your truth they don't have a good reason to resist your efforts. However, your current goals aren't limited to accomplishments in the real world. Don't waste energy trying to explain yourself; just express what's most important through actions rather than words."
aquarius,2010-07-05,"Lighthearted interactions with others may seem fun and easy today, but a misunderstanding could temporarily turn a friendship sour. Luckily, this can be more like a family squabble than anything else, but don't leave hurt feelings unexpressed. Negativity can't linger to do damage if you consciously decide to talk it out. The faster you can clear the air, the better."
pisces,2010-07-05,"The Aries Moon is in your 2nd House of Money, bringing you an exciting idea about new sources of income. But don't spend all your time obsessing about any one possibility, for too much analysis can restrict your creativity, preventing you from having the next inspiration. However, if you believe that there is an infinite number of opportunities ahead, then this may be your chance to explore several of them without any pressure."
aries,2010-07-06,"The hectic pace of your life slows down a bit now that the Moon is in earthy Taurus. It's as if everything is different and you awake to a quieter world today. There's no need to charge ahead; instead consider taking time away from work to do absolutely nothing at all. At first this might sound boring, but it's probably exactly what you need."
taurus,2010-07-06,"Comfort is your key word now that the Moon is back in your grounded sign. Fortunately, you don't even need to be in denial in order to relax. Remaining open to pleasure today could actually be enough to attract a memorable experience. But you won't be able to take it easy all day. Scheduling your downtime in advance ensures that you'll get your work done, too."
gemini,2010-07-06,"Your thoughts may be racing at a mile a minute, but everyone else seems to have slowed down now, and this can be a quite annoying. It's not that you are stuck doing something that you don't enjoy; on the contrary, you may be on a creative jag and wish there were more interesting people to share your thoughts with today. Don't be afraid of stirring up some excitement if you need the mental stimulation."
cancer,2010-07-06,"You may be inclined to cancel the impulsive invitations you sent out for an upcoming party at your house. Or perhaps you wish that you could skip a social engagement and just stay home. But you'll regret changing your mind so close to the event; instead, follow through with your existing plans. Once you start flowing with the moment, you'll remember why you were excited about the activity in the first place."
leo,2010-07-06,"Your need to take care of others today might not give you much of a choice, for they are relying on you and you must deliver on your promises. You may have misgivings about prior obligations, but, fortunately, everything will likely run more smoothly than you expect. Starting off with a positive attitude will give you the head start that you need."
virgo,2010-07-06,"You are quite relaxed this week because you like it when your feet are planted so firmly on the ground. Although tension could arise later in the evening, you are still able to make the most out of a current situation by comparing what you want with what you already have. But you'll still be better off if you work extra hard now, even if you aren't worried about how things will turn out. Keep in mind that your persistence won't go unnoticed."
libra,2010-07-06,"Something different is going on and it's challenging for you to put your finger directly on the problem. Fortunately, you have a pretty good shot at having a peaceful time now, but you may try to avoid the responsibilities that are placed on you. Instead of making everyone else happy, allow others the room to go out of their way to do something nice for you. Today, contentment is found somewhere in between the extremes."
scorpio,2010-07-06,"Today you may need to contend with a stubborn person who doesn't want to meet you halfway. Instead of increasing your frustration level by attempting to convince someone of what they are doing wrong, solve this dilemma from the opposite direction. Reevaluate the issue until you can clearly see both points of view at the same time. Even if you don't get your way, you'll be left with more compassion for the other position. Everyone will appreciate your efforts to be fair-minded."
sagittarius,2010-07-06,"Unfortunately, the plodding Taurus Moon in your 6th House of Routine can saddle you with boring chores to do now, so you might just as well begin early and finish them as soon as you can. It's not a smart idea to further fuel your irritation with unsuccessful attempts to escape from your commitments. Instead, try using your creativity to find the most sensible way to accomplish your goals. Once you've met your obligations, you'll be in a better position to enjoy yourself."
capricorn,2010-07-06,"You get a beneficial boost from the earthy Taurus Moon today, but don't attempt to complete everything in a quick burst of adrenaline or you'll just wear yourself out. Unfortunately, you could work hard and still have more to do. It's smarter to slow yourself down and move through the day with less speed and more determination. This controlled burn should help make your energy last. Ultimately, you'll accomplish more while feeling better at the end of the day."
aquarius,2010-07-06,"Free-floating anxiety could plague you throughout the day for no specific reason at all. Although you may be able to rationalize your emotions, it's more essential to get past your stuck energy than to justify your negativity. Being right should not be more important to your ego than being happy. Remember, the power to turn your bad attitude into a more positive one resides within you."
pisces,2010-07-06,"You may be in for a disappointment today if you thought you could fantasize your way through a difficult issue. But facing a problem directly will ultimately give you a much-needed sense of security because you won't need to waste energy trying to figure out what to do next. Don't fight against an inevitable tide. For now, simply showing up and being real is sufficient to keep your day on track."
aries,2010-07-07,"It's great to have self-confidence, but you can take it to an extreme today. Being so stubborn that you'll argue over something unimportant isn't really in your best interest. If you're bored enough to think about stirring up some mischief, seek a more creative outlet for your restlessness. Instead of taking your frustrations out on an unsuspecting person, change your attitude and try being more flexible."
taurus,2010-07-07,"You are more interested in finding ways to enjoy yourself today than working, but others appear to have their own expectations. You may agree to go along with their plans now, but the Moon in your sign gives you the right to change your mind. If you reach a critical point where it feels like you have had enough, share your concerns right away. Take a few deep breaths and clearly let everyone know what your boundaries are so there are no misunderstandings if you choose to go your own way."
gemini,2010-07-07,"You might believe that a co-worker is trying to block your success today, but the resistance is not out in the open. It's difficult for you to prove that anyone is really against you without sounding a bit paranoid. Rather than trying to expose someone's secret motives, it's smarter to go about your business as transparently as possible. You won't achieve satisfaction if you attempt to compete because it will feel as if you are shadowboxing with a mystery opponent."
cancer,2010-07-07,"It's difficult now for you to keep your mind on the present moment. Instead, the Moon in your 11th House of Long-Term Goals has you scheming and dreaming about the possibilities of tomorrow. Nevertheless, you are quite realistic. Even if the details of your strategy aren't concrete, fantasizing is part of the process that makes your future more tangible. Common sense enables you to manifest ideas that still seem impossible today."
leo,2010-07-07,"Your colleagues might seek guidance from you now, but not necessarily for inspiration. You lack the drive today to motivate others by stirring up any extra excitement. The easygoing Taurus Moon tempts you with a day of pleasant relaxation. Taking a low-key approach to leadership is currently more your style. Nevertheless, you can still set a good example for others by enjoying what you do."
virgo,2010-07-07,"You are able to make a good case for not working so hard today, whether it's really a smart idea or not. It just seems right for you to slow down a bit and take things easier now. But you may be challenged to know how much you can get away with as excessive Jupiter tempts you to go overboard. There's nothing wrong with taking a bit of time for yourself as long as you remember to fulfill your obligations, too."
libra,2010-07-07,"You are inclined to give others the benefit of the doubt today because you want them to know that they have your confidence and support. But you must be careful because it's easy for you to gloss over an important detail in your desire to be encouraging. Instead of keeping your thoughts to yourself, take a risk and let your real opinions be known. You might be surprised with the positive impact you have when you speak from your heart."
scorpio,2010-07-07,"It's tempting for you to set aside your own agenda today in favor of someone else's. Although this may be atypical behavior for you, it's easier to relinquish control when others have a specific goal and appear capable of reaching it. Nevertheless, a co-worker can test your limits by provoking you to take a stand. Be firm yet kind, especially to the people who are pushing your buttons."
sagittarius,2010-07-07,"Your inspiration at work today comes from the simple fact that you must act soon. If you don't, the window of opportunity will close and you could lose your chance. The pressure to push a project ahead can be enough to motivate you now, even if you aren't passionate about what you're doing. The most important thing is for you to do something; non-action is not a sensible strategy at this time."
capricorn,2010-07-07,"You aren't in much of a hurry today and no one really seems to mind. You believe that everything will ultimately happen on schedule, so nothing requires your immediate intervention. Surprisingly, you might actually get away with this kind of self-indulgence now, but it won't last. Rather than wasting your time thinking about how you can extend your good feelings into the future, it's smarter to simply enjoy them while they last."
aquarius,2010-07-07,"You might have an argument with someone you like today, possibly even a family member. You are sure that the problem lies with the other person, for you don't want to fight with anyone about anything now. But on close self-examination you may see how your intolerance could force others into a more rigid position. Practicing flexibility allows everyone to be more at ease."
pisces,2010-07-07,"You know what your schedule is and may resist changing it, even if it becomes necessary now. Circumstances just beyond your reach are beginning to shift and you may be afraid that you can't stop the process. Demonstrating your control over something unimportant may be your way to show off your power rather than doing something of significance. Don't waste your energy fighting against the currents; save it for when you'll need it."
aries,2010-07-08,"You enjoy the increased pace of your life, yet it is wise for you to stop long enough today to reflect on what is happening. If you avoid spending some time in unhurried contemplation, you might be able to convince yourself that a beautiful person you recently met would make a perfect partner. However, a little reflection may reveal that you dreamed up a scenario to fulfill your fantasies, so don't be too quick to trust your feelings now."
taurus,2010-07-08,"Unrealistic expectations at work today can set you up for a major disappointment. However, you would be wise to make the most of your vivid imagination by using your unfulfilled dreams to spur you on to greater accomplishments. Don't be concerned about actually reaching the goals that you create in your mind. Simply moving in the general direction of success will be enough for now."
gemini,2010-07-08,"Now that the Moon is back in your sign, you could feel more satisfied with your daily life because you can focus your mind and shift your perspective. Instead of aimlessly drifting along within your daydreams, practice taking control of them by gently yet firmly transforming your thoughts into more positive outcomes. If you really are what you think, it makes sense to improve your day by changing the images that color your attitude."
cancer,2010-07-08,"Although you are driven to express yourself today, you aren't comfortable blowing your own horn, leaving others to their own devices to discover your extraordinary talent. But you might overvalue someone else's work as you see it through the filter of your own inspiration. It's important to encourage those around you to use their skills, but don't overlook your own. Instead of projecting your sense of beauty onto someone else, find a creative outlet for your unique vision."
leo,2010-07-08,"It's quite possible to tell a story so well today that you believe it yourself. Unfortunately, your naivete can set the stage for you to be deceived now. Motivating those around you is easier when you have confidence in them, yet your gullibility can embolden someone to mislead you. Trust your inner voice over what anyone else is currently telling you."
virgo,2010-07-08,"You might fall into a role of playing the victim today, yet you can also consciously choose to alter your fate. Prior to committing to an additional task, give serious thought to how much work it will take to deliver on your promise. You can break down the various components of a complex assignment to make it more manageable. But you might be smarter to wait a day or two for the sharp focus of your mind to return before starting something new."
libra,2010-07-08,"Your key planet Venus opposes nebulous Neptune in your 5th House of Children, making it easier to see the beauty in being spontaneous. Perhaps you are just eager to express your own inner child. But even if you have to work today, set aside a bit of time to experience the joy of simply being in the present moment. If there are young people in your life, a bit of silly fun with them could be enough to satisfy your need to play."
scorpio,2010-07-08,"When you look back down Memory Lane today, it's not wise to focus on the uncomfortable difficulties. Instead, try thinking about the most pleasant times when you couldn't help but smile. You are normally pretty realistic about what's going on in your life, but a little nostalgia might be soothing now. Don't be afraid to use your imagination, combined with your spiritual skills, to alter your attitude about what happened in your past, which, in turn, can improve the present moment."
sagittarius,2010-07-08,"If you fall behind on your very busy schedule today, it might be more bothersome to others than to you, for time seems quite elastic to you now. You want to live on subjective time, rather than being a slave to the clock. Courtesy could be the key to your happiness, so make sure that you respect your commitments. Let others know in advance if you might be late for an appointment to prevent unnecessary irritation that could unravel your day."
capricorn,2010-07-08,"Stay away from making any major financial decisions, now that cloudy Neptune in your 2nd House of Money is opposed by beautiful Venus. Keep in mind that you might not have all the facts. Your practical judgment is inspired by your spirituality today, but believing that everything is perfect won't substitute for responsibly taking care of the current issues that are demanding your attention."
aquarius,2010-07-08,"Even if you carefully explain yourself again and again, your most supportive friends may not be able to fully understand your behavior today. Rather than arguing, it's likely that others will just nod their heads in agreement now, thinking that they know what you mean. Meanwhile, you can sense the widening gulf between you and everyone else. Nevertheless, there's no need to bridge the gap; it will disappear naturally on its own."
pisces,2010-07-08,"You become disoriented now if you must focus your thinking on the mundane world, especially when you are happier to consider more spiritual pursuits. While there is nothing wrong with being a metaphysical guru, it's still important to keep up your appearances on the job. You'll be able to continue exploring parallel dimensions of reality today, as long as you don't attract any undue attention."
aries,2010-07-09,"Although your intentions are good, you probably won't be able to stay focused on work today as Mercury enters your 5th House of Fun and Games. Luckily, you can be a bit of a magician, appearing busy and productive even if you're goofing off. But instead of placing so much emphasis on outsmarting the system, it's smarter to be straightforward. You'll gain more respect if you just work first and then play later."
taurus,2010-07-09,"You might shy away from the spotlight today, yet you still want everyone to acknowledge your special contribution. You may feel more secure flying beneath the radar with communicator Mercury's shift into your 4th House of Home and Family. Being invisible has its advantages now because you can accomplish a lot when you aren't concerned about everyone else watching you."
gemini,2010-07-09,"You are entering an upbeat period now that your key planet Mercury is visiting your 3rd House of Communication. Although this is a natural place of harmony for you, it's possible to surprise someone by taking a conversation too far today. You might not even try to hide your unorthodox thinking as clever Mercury harmonizes with radical Uranus. Think before you talk so you don't create problems for yourself by shocking others with what you say."
cancer,2010-07-09,"You normally like the idea of slow and steady gains because measured progress makes sense to you. Today, however, you're more interested in making a noticeable splash than in reaching your goal. Luckily, you have an excellent chance of succeeding at both now, so taking a risk is probably a good idea as long as you are honest about what you're trying to do."
leo,2010-07-09,"Chatty Mercury begins its 18-day visit to your outgoing sign today, prompting you to share your innovative ideas. But others could grow tired of you talking about yourself. Instead of trying to convince anyone that your plan is the best, find the good in everyone else's approach. You'll be surprised at how much respect you gain when you simply open your heart and accept people just as they are."
virgo,2010-07-09,"You are able to find a sensible balance today between being conservative and radical as clever Mercury harmonizes with cautious Saturn and unpredictable Uranus. Don't worry if you make a brilliant breakthrough that isn't noticed. Remember, you are ahead of the curve now and it will take time for others to catch up. In the meantime, it won't hurt to rein in your thoughts a bit, for jumping to conclusions too much could ultimately cause more problems than it's worth."
libra,2010-07-09,"The days ahead may be overwhelming with increased social activity now that interactive Mercury is in your 11th House of Friends. But fortunately, you should be able to make it look like you are working, even when your mind is focused on your personal life. Remember that you don't need to tell everyone everything, for some things are better when kept to yourself."
scorpio,2010-07-09,"While some people are thinking about their summer vacations, Mercury's visit to your 10th House of Public Responsibility motivates you to get your life and your career back on track. You are feeling like it's time to live up to your obligations, but don't concentrate all your current efforts on getting ahead. Set aside some time to do something irresponsible, like having a good time."
sagittarius,2010-07-09,"You are able to get in touch with your emotions because you can approach them logically today, instead of having to dive into the deep waters of irrationality. For you, this means having the best of both worlds now. Paradoxically, you can demonstrate your openness to powerful emotions by maintaining enough detachment to talk about them."
capricorn,2010-07-09,"You are able to build an alliance now that defies common sense, avoids the established rules and pushes you outside of the box. Your strength of purpose to create something totally new and different motivates you to talk about a relationship issue with your partner, even if resolution seems totally unrealistic. The more you get your thoughts out into the open, the greater the possibilities for all involved."
aquarius,2010-07-09,"You are driven to be your wonderful quirky self now while simultaneously wanting to be in a relationship as clever Mercury enters your 7th House of Significant Others and trines independent Uranus. But you may think that it's necessary to sacrifice important freedoms in trade for the closeness you crave. Don't try to solve this dilemma today; instead, keep your options open and be ready to make your move when the energy changes."
pisces,2010-07-09,"You probably aren't as easygoing as you were yesterday because quicksilver Mercury trines electric Uranus, shocking your nervous system with outlandish thoughts. Some of your current ideas may be truly brilliant but they cannot take form unless you choose to nurture them. Get your required tasks out of the way so you have sufficient time to develop your unconventional inspirations."
aries,2010-07-10,You may appear so upbeat now that you are able to fool yourself into thinking that everything is fine. But unresolved feelings from your past can stand between you and your happiness. Don't pretend that you are feeling good if you are not; it is certainly healthier to show your vulnerability and talk about what's on your mind. You could even be surprised by where today's conversation takes you.
taurus,2010-07-10,"You could be busier than you planned today, but there isn't much you can do about it other than keeping up with your obligations the best you can. Your attitude can affect your productivity as much as the actual situation and your entire day can turn sour if you complain. Nevertheless, allowing yourself to feel the positive energy and sharing it with others is a key to making your day a success."
gemini,2010-07-10,"It may not matter how creative you feel because an unexpected twist to your day places additional demands on you now. You will still have to show your competence and perform your job, but you could misjudge how long it will take to complete a project, so it's best to start early. If you wait longer than you should, you might not be able to pull off the magic with your usual finesse."
cancer,2010-07-10,"You may be more emotionally sensitive now than usual with the Moon in your sign today, yet you aren't so willing to let others see how you're feeling. This can disconnect your sentimental heart from your logical thoughts. Don't attempt to pull others into your internal struggle, for they won't be able to help. Remember to pay close attention to your emotions, even if you decide to keep them private for now."
leo,2010-07-10,Sometimes your feelings get in the way of keeping up with your regular activities. Don't give up even if you are hurting inside. Just remember how tender and raw your emotions are now so be careful about exposing them. Give yourself permission to keep quiet if that makes you feel safe. Wait until you're ready to share your heart.
virgo,2010-07-10,"There's a lot that's left unsaid today, but language falls short of your ability to describe your intense experiences. Instead of attempting to wrap words around your dreams and fantasies, just sink into them. Your current lessons might not be about sharing. There will be plenty of time for analysis and discussion later on after you have had a chance to process everything."
libra,2010-07-10,"You find it very difficult to turn down a request from a friend when you are needed for emotional support -- yet you may already be spread too thin today. While your planetary ruler Venus lures you into expressing love and support, independent Uranus screams at you to head for the hills. Although a quick escape might sound like a smart idea, you will probably wish you'd stayed to help instead of cutting loose when you were needed most."
scorpio,2010-07-10,"Your emotions are flowing stronger and running deeper than usual, yet you may not want to share them with anyone else right now. Unfortunately, current circumstances make it difficult for you to keep a secret. This poses an interesting dilemma because you enjoy being close to those you love, even if you also wish to be more detached."
sagittarius,2010-07-10,"Although much is going well, something is eating at you from the inside, preventing you from being happy. An unresolved emotional issue may still be lingering, but you don't know how to make it right. Rather than trying to change anything about the current circumstances, your work now is within. Don't lean on anyone else to make you feel better. Just concentrate on shifting your perspective to a more positive one."
capricorn,2010-07-10,"Being true to your own heart is pretty straightforward, but it becomes more complicated when others are involved. You may be hesitant to show someone special that you really care. After all, once your feelings are known, there will be a whole different set of expectations put on you. Don't withhold your emotions; instead, be bold and take a risk by sharing your concerns. Ultimately, maintaining integrity is easier than dealing with the unexpected consequences of silence."
aquarius,2010-07-10,"Although you're quite busy with chores, you still find plenty of time to think about relationships today. Others in your family may be so concerned about you that they try to talk you into changing your mind. Unfortunately, you could be better off hiding any negative judgments because it won't be productive now to share your critical view. Keep your opinions to yourself until the end of the week to encounter the least amount of grief."
pisces,2010-07-10,"You may be attracted to someone special now, but you won't likely share your feelings. It's not that you are worried about the possibility of rejection; it's just that you aren't comfortable if you're not in control of your actions today. It's easier to avoid the whole situation by skirting around the edges of your own discomfort. Thankfully, you can transfer your unexpressed energy into work that others will surely appreciate."
aries,2010-07-11,"Today's eclipse activates your key planet Mars in your 6th House of Work, indicating your involvement in projects around the house. You may want to take time off for fun, but have too much going on to justify it. Being patient isn't your forte and now it's even tougher. Nevertheless, wait until you've finished your chores before allowing yourself to relax and indulge your senses."
taurus,2010-07-11,"The emotional Cancer New Moon Eclipse rattles your 3rd House of Information, encouraging you to take someone into your confidence. Sharing your most personal feelings with a friend today is a good way to show how special she or he is to you. But caution is advised; although your disclosure might be a good idea, it also makes you feel vulnerable. Make sure that the other person is worthy of your trust before placing yourself in a precarious position."
gemini,2010-07-11,"Today's Solar Eclipse in your 2nd House of Self-Esteem inspires you to do something that will make you feel good about yourself. But your key planet Mercury is under stress and your fluctuating moods make it tough to be certain about your beliefs. Although you aren't able to automatically change your emotions at will, you can alter the way you respond to others. Positive actions should lead to positive results."
cancer,2010-07-11,"The sign of Cancer is ruled by the Moon, and you're highly attuned to her regular cycles. Today's Solar Eclipse in your sign is like your own personal New Year's Day, so make a list of your resolutions. What do you want to bring to fruition at the Full Moon in a couple of weeks? While you're at it, think about your goals for the next six months. Be wise; plant the seeds of intention in your imagination and then nurture them and watch them grow."
leo,2010-07-11,"The spiritual aspects of today's New Moon Eclipse are amplified because you can't necessarily verbalize your emotions, which subsequently intensifies your dreams. Since the eclipse falls in your 12th House of Privacy, this is a day for inner journeying, rather than seeking fulfillment from activities in the outer world. Just allow your imagination to unfold your story, even if you don't understand what it means. Don't rush the interpretation; it will make more sense later on."
virgo,2010-07-11,"With this New Moon Eclipse emphasizing your 11th House of Networking, the days ahead may have you more socially active than usual. You want to be a part of a larger group or to totally lose yourself in an important cause. The sense of belonging that you seek should help you feel more emotionally secure. Don't worry too much about being productive; instead, give yourself permission to have fun."
libra,2010-07-11,"Your patience is required now, so don't react too fast, even if you think that you know the answers. Others may see you as the authority with today's eclipse occurring in your 10th House of Career, but you don't want to take the lead. Regardless, you should be able to achieve good results now. Nevertheless, it's wiser to see how the circumstances change over the next few days before assuming that everything is as you see it. Enjoy yourself, but don't become too greedy or the good times will quickly dissipate."
scorpio,2010-07-11,"You may be more hopeful that everything will turn out in your favor now that the unrealized potential of the summer becomes more concrete. Your dreams are already beginning to take shape. Still, danger comes from attempting to force action when it's smarter to wait. Playing it cool enables you to ground yourself prior to taking your life to the next level."
sagittarius,2010-07-11,"If the possibility of learning something new is likely, you are more than ready for the experience. Your curiosity is unquenchable today. When you are given a taste of information, you want more. Just remember that true fulfillment is not based on anything outside of yourself. Increased self-awareness is more important than anything else when it comes to moderating your needs."
capricorn,2010-07-11,"Today's New Moon Eclipse is in your 7th House of Relationships, offering you a new way to manage emotional conflict. If a close friend or lover clams up today and refuses to answer your difficult questions, don't try to change his or her mind. You might feel rejected at first, but supporting others is a better way to ultimately get what you want."
aquarius,2010-07-11,"You don't want anyone questioning your ability to do your job with the Solar Eclipse in your 6th House of Skills. If someone does challenge your capability now, you might withdraw and retreat into your shell. But this isn't because you're timid. You just don't want to waste time defending yourself when you could be completing your chores and then going off to play instead. Avoiding all emotional drama for a few days may be the easiest way to get through an awkward interaction."
pisces,2010-07-11,"Today's Solar Eclipse in your 5th House of Creativity encourages you to set aside a block of time for artistic self-expression. But the eclipse creates a cooperative sextile to assertive Mars in your 7th House of Significant Others, urging you to work with someone else as you incorporate fun and games into your day. Ideally, you'll find time for both activities, but remember you can always play on your own another day."
aries,2010-07-12,"You are raring to go since the Leo Moon fires up Jupiter and Uranus in your sign, challenging you to moderate your wild enthusiasm today. You may promise that you'll help a close friend or family member any way you can, but you probably will try to take over because you cannot contain your excitement. Remember that you shouldn't have to apologize for just being yourself as long as you are sensitive and act as kindly as possible."
taurus,2010-07-12,"A close friend or lover might expect you to set your own needs aside so you can assume a more active role of guidance for your family or friends. But you grow irritated by your obligations because you don't want to be burdened with additional responsibilities. Today it's just as important to take care of yourself, but try not to let anyone else down more than you must. Giving a bit of yourself to those you love might be more rewarding than you think."
gemini,2010-07-12,"A small heartfelt gesture may seem like an insignificant move on your part, yet it could be of major importance to another person. Someone could misinterpret your actions because of unrealistic expectations. Or, perhaps, your behavior is purposefully confusing because you want to throw others off track so they don't know what you're feeling. State your boundaries today so you don't unintentionally deceive those who are already on your side."
cancer,2010-07-12,"You have been improving your strategy and are ready to make a big move today, especially if you've been waiting for the right time. But there is still something that's out of your grasp; it's as if a piece from a puzzle is being hidden to prevent you from being overly confident about the solution. Don't try to explain yourself; your actions will speak much louder than words."
leo,2010-07-12,"The Moon's return to your proud sign can turn this into a very social day. However, the Sun's still in your 12th House of Privacy, so you won't likely be the center of attention. Fortunately, it's more important now for you to love others than it is to be loved. But if you go out of your way to be recognized, your plan could backfire and make you regret your actions. Your generosity of spirit is greatly appreciated by those around you."
virgo,2010-07-12,"You may be very effective today working behind the scenes, yet you still could say something that causes others to take notice of you. Unfortunately, you could bring the wrong kind of attention to yourself as you accidentally reveal a well-kept secret. Relax and blend in with the crowd, for hiding only draws the spotlight toward you like a magnet."
libra,2010-07-12,"Everything seems to be getting more confusing these days, especially with respect to love. Keep in mind that you might not know what is best because you can't figure out what others expect. Try a more creative solution to the current problem. Instead of having to choose one thing or another, develop a scenario where both are possible. You may be surprised because the most unconventional plan could quickly seem quite normal."
scorpio,2010-07-12,"You are not meant to sit around the house or take it easy at work today. A bit of relaxation sounds good, but you'll be able to enjoy yourself better if you fulfill your job responsibilities first. Get outside later and do something fun. But don't think that you can be totally satisfied with a string of trivial distractions now. For true happiness, find an activity that engages your mind with the deeper questions of life."
sagittarius,2010-07-12,"Exploring with a companion might sound like fun today, but you can push beyond familiar limits pretty quickly. Discovering new places or digging into the unanswered questions of life can be particularly enticing now, especially if you have a friend or lover with whom to share this adventure. But flying solo can be okay, too, as long as you're doing something that's outside of your normal routine."
capricorn,2010-07-12,"Stand back from the multitude of distractions in your life now and focus on the details of one project. You will be rewarded if you can change one small thing instead of trying to turn your whole life upside down. Your health regimen might be a smart place to start; if you are considering an improvement in your diet or exercise program, do it now. It's better to begin sooner than later, even if you must make adjustments over the next few weeks."
aquarius,2010-07-12,"It isn't sufficient to consider ways of increasing your physical activity now; instead, you must stop talking and get out there and do it. But today you are tempted to wait for your friend or partner to prompt you. Nevertheless, it's not healthy to shift the responsibility for your actions onto anyone else. The ball is in your court."
pisces,2010-07-12,"You might make a big deal about what you're doing at work today, but it's really not necessary to draw any extra attention to yourself at this time. It's not that you want to misrepresent anything; it's just that you need some artistic license when you're describing reality. Remember, there's nothing wrong with believing that you're special as long as you don't claim superiority over others."
aries,2010-07-13,"You want to express your creativity today, but it could upset the status quo. It's smarter to keep your feelings to yourself until they settle down a bit. Nevertheless, you may struggle because you want others to know what you're feeling but don't want to offend anyone with your upfront manner. You won't have to deny your emotions, but moderating their intensity when sharing them is a smart social move."
taurus,2010-07-13,"Letting go of control and surrendering to the power of love can be frightening, especially when your emotions are so intense. It's hard to balance your current desire for romance with more practical concerns. A passing fancy is not more important than keeping your job or fulfilling your promises, so avoid foolish behavior that only brings you temporary pleasure. Let your passions cool a while before deciding whether or not to initiate action."
gemini,2010-07-13,"A family member or a close friend might try to pull you into a complex melodrama today even though you attempt to avoid anything that doesn't directly involve you. You could be intrigued by the distraction at first, yet stuck by the time the intensity heats up and you want out. Nevertheless, instead of trying to sidestep an uncomfortable situation, open your heart and discover what you are able to learn from your emotions."
cancer,2010-07-13,"Even if you are comfortable in the illogical realms of feelings, it's hard to let go of your prejudices today. Your values can stand in the way of your success if you aren't willing to reconsider your position. But a discussion will only take you so far now that actions speak louder than words. Don't go rambling on about unimportant facts; instead, find a way to express yourself through a gesture of appreciation that doesn't require any words at all."
leo,2010-07-13,"Your attractions are strong today as the Moon in your sign enables you to express what you want. There isn't any question in anyone's mind what you're feeling, because you probably won't be able to keep your desires hidden. Even if your emotions are too much to openly share, it's best not to push them away or they could explode at an inconvenient moment."
virgo,2010-07-13,"Your frustration may grow if you cannot express what you are feeling when sexy Venus in your sign picks up on the deep passions of Pluto. It's not that you are at a loss for words; it's just that it doesn't seem like the right time or place to broach such a touchy topic as your personal desires. Instead of avoiding the issue entirely, try to raise the bar by morphing your attraction to pleasure into a spiritual practice."
libra,2010-07-13,"The Moon in your social 11th House suggests that your friends are a blessing now. It's a fantastic day to express your love and appreciation to those who truly matter to you. If you have something to say, don't hold back. Nothing short of the entire truth will get you through this intersection. Thankfully, others should be able to hear your message and respond directly on a heartfelt level as well."
scorpio,2010-07-13,"You have something urgent on your mind today and nothing will prevent you from attempting to get what you want. Although you may crave superficial sensual satisfaction, there's more going on than what is apparent. On a much deeper level you want to know the hidden metaphysical truth that stands between you and happiness. Anything short of total enlightenment might be met with your disappointment. However, it's not about achieving cosmic consciousness now; it's about accepting the fact that you're human."
sagittarius,2010-07-13,"Once you know what you want to do today, you'll be willing to pull out all the stops. But you're not likely to be attracted to simple goals now; instead, you are on a quest for a great adventure that is worthy of your intentions. Even if your ideas are unrealistic, you have much to gain by going through the motions and dreaming your dream. Anything that awakens your passion is healthy."
capricorn,2010-07-13,"Your emotions aren't easily expressed now through established channels of communication. You want to delve a bit deeper than normal because you understand that something special is hiding just beneath the surface now. Be careful, for pushing too hard will drive answers away. A gentler approach is advised; allow your feelings to lead you to the lessons you need to learn."
aquarius,2010-07-13,"You aren't happy if someone shares too much information with you today. It's not that you don't want to know what's happening; you'd just prefer a more straightforward approach instead of the emotionally charged version of the story. But your intellectual struggle is exacerbated as you get drawn into a melodrama that's not yours. Ultimately, your life grows richer once you set aside your resistance and open your mind."
pisces,2010-07-13,"You may believe that there is a specific procedure to follow today or that your perfect performance will get you the peer approval you seek. However, the truth is that it's more important to be real than to act out the script as others expect. Nevertheless, sloppy work isn't smart. Simply do the best you can while still being true to yourself."
aries,2010-07-14,"Responsibilities seem to be piling up at work these days but you may not be ready to tackle them yet. You could be less interested in doing your chores than making plans and considering strategies to get the job done. It's hard to be proactive if you are afraid that your actions won't be as effective as you wish. Even if you cannot take the whole day off, at least give yourself permission to relax and fall a bit behind in your production schedule."
taurus,2010-07-14,"Cool logic is your ally now as you fight your way back from confusion today. Your elaborate fantasies may come unraveled now, but they will be replaced by a less complicated version of reality. Avoid the temptation to weave stories, even if you are able to express yourself skillfully and entertain others. Keep things simple and stick with only what you know to be absolutely true."
gemini,2010-07-14,"Everyone seems to be relying on you for stability these days, but this is not one of your typical strengths. Fortunately, you probably can anchor a loved one now and prevent him or her from drifting away in an emotional storm. It really doesn't matter why you have become the go-to person today; instead of wasting your energy wondering how you can help, just jump in and do what you can."
cancer,2010-07-14,"You have your opinions, but expressing them today can lead you into trouble. Paradoxically, it may be easier for you to work with the facts and figures now than to handle an emotional issue. The exacting Virgo Moon prevents you from entering the illogical land of subjectivity. Acknowledge your feelings, but act on the cool rationality of raw data."
leo,2010-07-14,"It's challenging to share your opinions when they aren't as clear as you wish, for sometimes it's difficult to separate what's good from what's not. Creating fantasies about what you want is easier than actually doing something about it. Nevertheless, it may be healthy to have a few secrets now because there are some things that are better left unsaid until the time is right."
virgo,2010-07-14,"You could be losing self-confidence now as you recollect a time in your life when your best shot fell short of someone's expectation. However, there's nothing to be gained by obsessing over the past or remembering disappointments. The Moon's return to your sign can make it difficult to focus your attention, but this is not the time to give up. If you cannot change your attitude, ask your friends for the help you need. You may be pleasantly surprised at how they come through for you."
libra,2010-07-14,"If you recently overstepped your bounds, it may be time for a bit of emotional cleanup today. But don't be hesitant or shy if you made an error in judgment. Admit to it and move on. Act maturely and take responsibility for your words and actions, for they aren't likely as problematic as you think. The sooner you can look forward again, instead of worrying about the past, the better it will be for everyone."
scorpio,2010-07-14,"You may need to be protective of your feelings and might attempt to get through the day without ever admitting what's bothering you. Nevertheless, you won't be able to keep your secret for long because you are driven to reveal the truth as you see it. Naturally, you don't want to hurt anyone's feelings, but it's important for you to recognize that you can speak your piece in a kind and non-blaming manner and still be loved."
sagittarius,2010-07-14,"If you have set your sights too high you could get discouraged when you don't reach your goals. It's helpful if you cut yourself a bit of slack and allow time for your plans to develop. But you still might have a hard time learning the lesson of patience now. Remember, you cannot do everything all at once. Stay focused on your overall goal and try not to become obsessed with just one small part of your plan."
capricorn,2010-07-14,"You may be searching for an important bit of information today and might even conclude that someone is hiding something from you. But your attempts to ferret out the truth won't likely lead to success. However, you still could find what you're looking for, but it may require you to use reverse psychology. Relaxing your need to know will put others at ease and you may learn more than you expect."
aquarius,2010-07-14,"You could be feeling let down today, just as you might on the morning after an exciting event. It's tempting to fill in the gaps with additional activities, but it's probably smarter to use this time to seek a bit of peace and quiet. Unfortunately, you might not get the tranquility that you want, so be flexible and do your best to accept whatever may happen next."
pisces,2010-07-14,"It's difficult to avoid setting up a situation where someone becomes angry with you. It might appear as if you don't have the options you want or that others are attempting to get in your way. However, it's wise to consider what you may have done to help put the restraining backlash in motion. Fighting against external resistance is likely a waste of your time now when you should be working to improve your own act instead."
aries,2010-07-15,"You might think that you can rationalize your outrageous ideas today, but no one is buying your version of the story. Even if you are telling the truth as you know it, the way you're going about your work now can make others nervous because you're not following the established guidelines. Consider toning down your rhetoric and adjusting your attitude, for you really don't need to make any enemies at this time."
taurus,2010-07-15,"There's really no reason for anyone to question your integrity today for you are focused on doing the right thing. Normally, you would take the time to hear someone's ideas before saying no. However, even the slightest hint of a problem now will send you running back to the safety of your more simplistic plan. Playing by the rules is wise, but don't get so self-righteous about your stand that you miss what's important."
gemini,2010-07-15,"You may be doing battle with yourself today as the narrowly focused Virgo Moon teaches you the benefits of self-restraint. Thinking like a concentrated laser beam can certainly sharpen your analysis, but one of your greatest strengths is your natural ability to connect the dots in ways that others don't even consider. Don't limit your curiosity too much, or you could do yourself a disservice and miss a crucial piece of data."
cancer,2010-07-15,"You might feel more secure now if you err on the side of being too quiet, rather than stepping on someone's toes to make your point. Fortunately, you don't have anything to prove, so being right doesn't matter that much. Nevertheless, it's not a good idea to sacrifice efficiency for the sake of political expediency. If you have a good idea, find a way to share it without offending others in the process."
leo,2010-07-15,"It's not easy for you to step out of the spotlight, but playing a supportive role today may be your smartest move. Even if you know that you could do more than you are currently contributing, a methodical retreat demonstrates your confidence in others. You'll have your chance to shine soon enough; for now let someone else take center stage."
virgo,2010-07-15,"Others may be having a tough time reading your energy today, for you are cautious and impulsive, analytical and intuitive, and respectful and rebellious. Your ability to hold opposing views now is a great strength for you, yet it can also appear confusing to everyone else. They may think that you are being wishy-washy, but your decision to follow multiple paths requires extra brain cells and a dose of real courage. Trust your own voice to steer you in the right direction."
libra,2010-07-15,"Your mind is probably already made up, but you might not be ready to announce your decision. It's not that you are trying to hurt anyone's feelings; it's just that you want everyone else to choose based on his or her own best interests. Don't get caught up in playing any misleading games by saying something that you don't really believe now. Honesty is almost always the best policy."
scorpio,2010-07-15,"Making the best use of your time today is crucial, for you won't be satisfied if you're unproductive while hanging out with your friends. But it's not really important whether you are alone or with others. Keep focused on your original agenda. No matter where you go or what you do, if you bring your attention back to your goals, you'll feel good about your day."
sagittarius,2010-07-15,"A little bit of common sense goes a long way today as you deal with others at work. Instead of trying to take responsibility for things that are out of your control, narrow your focus and put your efforts toward fixing that which you can change. Spreading yourself too thin now is a mistake. It's better to do one little task well than attempting to handle everything all at once."
capricorn,2010-07-15,"You can excel today because your managerial skills support your goals. Even though you are usually able to tackle a complex job by breaking it down into smaller tasks, now you seem to be at the very top of your game. Just be careful that you don't let other people's expectations get out of hand or you'll end up disappointing them no matter how much you really accomplish."
aquarius,2010-07-15,"There may be unspoken emotional issues that are complicating your relationships with others at work now. Although your intentions may be clear, you don't know how to go about bringing the complex web of interrelated personalities out into the open so everyone can simply deal with things as they are. Instead, you might feel as if you are walking around on eggshells, afraid that one wrong step could cause a catastrophe. Be smart and wait a day or two before doing something you'll soon regret."
pisces,2010-07-15,"You may feel as if someone is raining on your parade today and it makes you angry enough to react without thinking. Unfortunately, your unrestrained response could just make matters worse. You would be wise to observe your feelings without actually doing anything about them until tomorrow when you'll be better able to take action without turning a disagreement into a major conflict."
aries,2010-07-16,"You don't think it's fair when you are asked to choose between your personal and professional life. But your job is changing and your work may impinge on your private world more than you wish. Unfortunately, resisting this new arrangement can bring frustration. Even if you are stressed, try to be optimistic about the future without slipping into denial about what's happening right now."
taurus,2010-07-16,"You don't like to ignore the facts, but you are tempted to avoid the truth now to get through a complicated situation. Luckily, you can see the positive side of a difficult issue today, even if it feels irresolvable. Although the ultimate answer might remain out of reach, keep in mind that you'll still feel better once you go through the motions of looking for a sensible solution."
gemini,2010-07-16,"You are struggling to figure out what's happening within your family, but you might not be able to determine which stories are actually true. Usually, you are good at telling the difference between fact and fiction, but now you are holding everyone to a higher standard. Don't waste time on seeking an unattainable level of accuracy; instead, just do your best with what you already know."
cancer,2010-07-16,"Someone may think that you are gullible enough to believe anything, so think twice before you believe what you are being told today. But it's not about you being overly naive; rather, you are currently capable of seeing the potential where others pass it by. Remember, there isn't anything wrong with having a positive attitude; just be sure that you check your facts before making assumptions that will get you into trouble."
leo,2010-07-16,"You cannot decide if it's a smart idea to accept additional work today. A new project could lead to the recognition you want and even to a promotion. But you might underestimate the amount of effort that's required to meet your deadline. Even if the whole thing sounds promising, don't make your life more complicated by taking on more than you can deliver."
virgo,2010-07-16,"It's hard to rely on your common sense now, for you keep changing your mind as new information comes in. It may be challenging to maintain a positive attitude, yet it's important to consider if you are actually misleading yourself. You can see the world through two different lenses today. One makes everything appear better and the other one makes things look worse. Keep in mind that the truth can be found somewhere between these two extremes."
libra,2010-07-16,"You are challenged to put your feelings out into the open, but if you don't, your frustration will likely push you over the edge. Fortunately, once you choose to share what's on your mind, everything will become easier for a while. You still have a lot of work to do, but you can accomplish what's necessary if you start believing in yourself."
scorpio,2010-07-16,"Although the overall outlook may be good, you still might have to face your own shadow before you can fully engage the potential that's all around you. This isn't about any one specific deal or a single decision you are required to make today. Your attitude can be directly impacted by your thoughts; if you believe that you are a success, then you are. Put your legendary intensity to work and make it happen now."
sagittarius,2010-07-16,"Extra effort will likely pay off with a bonus check, the possibility of a promotion or words of praise. But it's not a smart idea to think that the world owes you something, for you aren't entitled to rewards you haven't earned. You won't do as well if you believe that personal satisfaction is your right. Stop worrying about what you want in the present moment and set your sights on a more significant long-term goal."
capricorn,2010-07-16,"You may not understand why others aren't acknowledging you today for what you have done. You feel as if you're doing well responding to all the stressful circumstances and you know that you deserve more credit. Nevertheless, your current lesson is that accomplishing your goals will require more time than you expected. Once you accept that fact, you might not be so frustrated in the moment."
aquarius,2010-07-16,"You want to be known as a concerned friend, one who puts the wishes of others first. But taking care of everyone else's needs except your own won't ultimately bring you happiness. Unfortunately, you could be so involved with doing what's right that you inadvertently miss the support of an ally. Show your vulnerability by acknowledging that you have needs, too, and you don't always know the best way to get what you want."
pisces,2010-07-16,"You might appear quite enthusiastic about something you are doing today, but you could just be hiding your concerns. You may feel as if there are no correct answers to any questions you ask, but don't let this stop you. Instead, respond to the stresses of the day by showing up with an open heart, even if you don't have a long-term plan. It turns out that being in the present moment is the best possible strategy you could have now."
aries,2010-07-17,"You are eager to work out the kinks in a relationship today, but the discussion might not go as well as you wish. Even if your intentions are good, you'll need to be more flexible than you'd prefer. Suppressing your emotions isn't a smart strategy. You don't have to hide the truth; you only need to acknowledge the reality of someone else's feelings, too, and then find common ground where you can both stand."
taurus,2010-07-17,"The same methods that might work on another day won't be good enough now because of your desire to surround yourself with beauty. It's not sufficient to simply answer a nagging question; today's Libra Moon wants the solution to a problem to also be elegant. Unfortunately, you might have to let go of your high expectations to arrive at a strategy that will be practical enough to work."
gemini,2010-07-17,"You may be feeling some relief today and look forward to a play day now that the Moon is in your 5th House of Fun and Games. If you have children in your life, take this opportunity to do something special with them. If that's not possible, then find a way to unleash your own inner child. Even if you have to throw previous plans out the window, a spontaneous activity could turn the weekend into one that is memorable for all involved."
cancer,2010-07-17,"You may be feeling ambivalent about participating in a social event with close friends or your family. You look forward to having time to relax, but you might believe that others will pressure you into taking sides in an ongoing conflict. Spending some time alone could be a wise choice so you don't have to justify your feelings to anyone else."
leo,2010-07-17,"You prefer to maintain some control over the flow of events, but your advanced planning may fall apart when an unforeseen obstacle slows you down. Instead of struggling to maintain your schedule today, it's smarter to respond with common sense. Take care of the most immediate issues and be willing to let the less important things fall temporarily to the wayside. Setting priorities is a smart idea as long as you are flexible when change is required."
virgo,2010-07-17,You might find it challenging to make a financial decision today because you are yearning for an item that's outside of your budget. But it's a waste of energy trying to rationalize buying something you don't really need. Save your money for now and make your purchase another day when you are clearer about the real value of what you want.
libra,2010-07-17,"It's even harder to take sides because you can see an issue from multiple perspectives now that the Moon is back in your sign. Don't succumb to anyone else's pressure to choose one answer over another unless it's quite clear to you. Your ambivalence might annoy others, but it's also your greatest strength. Maintaining an open-minded approach enables you to save the day as you play the role of a shuttle diplomat, going back and forth until the best solution becomes apparent to all."
scorpio,2010-07-17,"The Moon in your 12th House of Spiritual Mystery amplifies your dreams today, but this doesn't mean that you'll be able to give them concrete interpretations. Although you want to know what is being symbolized by your subconscious mind, you could work yourself into a state of frustration if you assume that everything has a hidden meaning. Too much analysis can actually detract from the magic of myth, so trust in the process and let go."
sagittarius,2010-07-17,"You may be discouraged today if you share something that's important to you with your friends, only to receive their disapproval. But they probably aren't as negative as you think because you could have set your expectations too high. Tone down your presentation and ask for feedback. You'll receive more support if you involve your friends in the process than if you overstate your case with a dramatic show and tell."
capricorn,2010-07-17,"If you have an opinion about a current situation, go ahead and let others know instead of playing games and keeping it to yourself. It's better to have everything out in the open and to know exactly where you stand, rather than trying to deal with anyone's hidden agenda. Don't worry if you meet some resistance now; overcoming someone's objections will serve to strengthen your plan."
aquarius,2010-07-17,"It may appear as if a close friend or partner is trying to get credit for something that he or she doesn't really deserve. But your annoyance may become an issue because you don't think that others are paying enough attention to you. Even if you believe that you're being fair-minded, you could have biases that arise from your lack of support. Don't blame anyone else for your hurt feelings; instead, work on improving your own game."
pisces,2010-07-17,"You have a very low tolerance now for people who make promises and then spend time on public relations instead of doing the work. You are trying to avoid making judgments, but it becomes more challenging when someone doesn't hold up his or her end of the deal. Openly criticizing others won't likely improve the current situation. It may be better to bite your tongue and wait to see what tomorrow brings."
aries,2010-07-18,"By the end of the day, you may be wishing that you hadn't expressed yourself so freely. Even if your ideas are correct, changing your tactics is probably in order anyway. Offending someone with your overbearing certainty isn't to your advantage. Instead, soften your stance and remember that there's a lot you don't know about how others feel."
taurus,2010-07-18,"You may not be very receptive if someone places emotional demands on you today. You can get quite defensive when others make assumptions about your availability without even asking you. Nevertheless, it's not a good idea now to put up resistance just because you want to remain detached. Ultimately, you will feel better about yourself if you help out as much as you can, without allowing your negativity to stand in the way."
gemini,2010-07-18,"You may start your day convinced that you will be able to stay neutral in a complex political squabble that's developed at work. But as the day wears on you grow more involved in a melodrama and less interested in idle chatter. Forget about gossiping or social networking, even if it's a lot of fun. Remember, you can't afford to have too many distractions now so it's best to concentrate on the job at hand."
cancer,2010-07-18,"Your mind is sharp today, yet you might be suffering from lingering anxiety as you try to put the pieces of your life back into place. The mists are dissipating and you have more clarity than you've had in a while. Even if you must do your chores first, make enough time for creative and playful activities later in the day. Rest and recuperate now so that you can build up your immune system as much as you can."
leo,2010-07-18,"You want some quiet time today so you can explore childhood memories, yet you won't likely find exactly what you are seeking. Naturally, your perspective is changing, but you still could be reluctant to declare a new allegiance. Nevertheless, you gain power from expressing yourself with integrity. The depth of your convictions is intense, so don't be afraid to say what's on your mind so others know where you stand."
virgo,2010-07-18,"You are attempting to live your life within the limitations of other people's ideas, rules and expectations now. But it's not always a smart idea to color within the lines of your coloring book. Extending beyond your current boundaries should prove to be quite exciting, especially if you are willing to let your emotions be your guide."
libra,2010-07-18,"It's not easy for you to be around others who lose their composure over unimportant things. But even if you feel like you're the one on an emotional rollercoaster, you probably have enough common sense to wait for a better moment to express yourself. When the moody Moon leaves your sign this afternoon, it may finally be time to say what's on your mind."
scorpio,2010-07-18,"You are on edge today as the Moon moves into your sign. You may feel exhausted because your mood swings can be hard to manage. Fortunately, you are able to take them in stride when you know what to expect. Nevertheless, delaying an important decision is a good idea now, so don't let anyone talk you into making a choice under pressure. It's your prerogative to wait until you're completely ready before making your move."
sagittarius,2010-07-18,"You are riding waves of strong feelings that may be better kept to yourself for a few more days while the Moon transits your 12th House of Privacy. Make sure that your motives are clear if you think you need to keep a secret now. Keep in mind that withholding the truth to garner more power is a strategy that will ultimately backfire on you. However, acting for the good of all is an insurance policy that should work well for everyone involved."
capricorn,2010-07-18,"It's difficult for you to make use of your good intentions today because you feel a bit scattered. However, as the day unfolds, you may regain your focus and catch up on the productivity that you lost in the morning. Although it's hard to trust your intuition now, it's better to override your self-doubt and do something positive, rather than taking no action at all."
aquarius,2010-07-18,"You can be quite intense about your job, which enables you to take on more responsibility today without a lot of extra effort. But with clever Mercury aligning with your key planet Uranus, you aren't in any mood to do everything in the same old way. Don't hold yourself back, even if you think that your actions will surprise your co-workers. You have more latitude now, and it would be smart to shake things up a bit."
pisces,2010-07-18,"You may be obsessing about going on a trip and no one can talk you out of it, no matter how hard they might try. Go ahead with your planning and choose your destination as soon as you can, because you will have to make a lot of preparations before you leave. Don't worry if your adventure doesn't happen; exploring your fantasies without restraint has the potential of opening up other possibilities you haven't even considered."
aries,2010-07-19,"You may be feeling the pressure at work, but there's no quick and easy way to escape. Although it's summer vacation for many, you must stay focused and fulfill your obligations. You might need to exercise caution because you could get a crazy idea today that is meant to save you time and increase your productivity. However, it is wiser to stick with the tried and true method now, even if it ends up taking you longer to finish."
taurus,2010-07-19,"You may receive more advice from a friend or partner than you prefer today. You could feel as if someone is overstepping their bounds and encroaching on your space. But you need to remember that you don't live in an isolated vacuum, so you would be better off listening to what others have to say. Don't overreact, for constructive feedback may be exactly what you need to hear now."
gemini,2010-07-19,"You are often attracted to paradoxes, but a situation today may remain an unsolved puzzle. The more you focus your attention on work, the less certain you become about what you should be doing. Unfortunately, seeking another perspective from a friend or associate will only confuse you even further. Oddly enough, relaxing your need to control things will help the day go smoother."
cancer,2010-07-19,"You are ready to work any emotional angle possible today, but you need to be careful or your ambition will backfire on you. Strategizing is fine, but you must be absolutely straight up about your motives. Don't be afraid to let others know what your needs are without embellishing them. If your friends understand why you are acting in a particular manner, they are more likely to support what you are doing rather than resisting your efforts."
leo,2010-07-19,"Beneath the appearance of clever Mercury now in your fun-loving sign, something may be awry as the winged messenger anxiously aspects Jupiter and Pluto. But feeling sorry for yourself because you are arguing with your partner or you don't have romance in your life is a waste of energy. Happiness doesn't only come from finding someone and living out a fairy tale. Rather, it can be about your commitment to expressing your love, no matter what you receive in return."
virgo,2010-07-19,"Three planets in critical and analytical Virgo continue to sharpen your point of view. Unfortunately, you can become so convinced of the importance of what you know that you disregard other people's perspectives. Don't dismiss an idea just because it's different from yours. It can be a struggle to remain open to alternatives now, but you'll make better decisions if you do."
libra,2010-07-19,"You may be so concerned about your friends' opinions today that you lose sight of your own. Your ideas are just as important because ultimately self-esteem comes from within and not from what others think. Just be careful about misinterpreting the facts, for you can easily stretch the truth and lead yourself astray. Remember, extreme reactions may be a clue that emotions are now overtaking reason. Moderate your responses by filtering out extraneous noise and listening to your own inner voice."
scorpio,2010-07-19,"You are being pulled one way by your feelings and another by logic as the Moon in your emotional sign intensifies your moods. You have a high level of self-awareness now, but it's hard to know whether to trust your heart or your head as mental Mercury gains prominence in your 10th House of Status. Keep in mind that your uncertainty won't likely stop your progress, yet you could change your direction in the very near future."
sagittarius,2010-07-19,"You can talk yourself into nearly anything today because your key planet Jupiter is aspected by persuasive Mercury. You are able to motivate others by sharing the power of your own dreams. But your performance could be disconnected from your real purpose now, leaving you with a hollow feeling. Instead of trying to inspire anyone else to support your idea, check in with yourself to confirm what you really believe. It's most important to be in integrity with yourself."
capricorn,2010-07-19,"Solid plans won't necessarily assure success today, but don't let that be of too much concern. You really don't need your own harsh judgment just because you may not reach your original goals. Instead of relentlessly pushing toward the summit, take the scenic route of discovery. Your purpose now is not to reach your destination; it's to get as much as you can out of your journey."
aquarius,2010-07-19,"You may not be satisfied with a simple answer and you're eager to do the necessary research to get to the bottom of an issue today. But digging beneath the surface can take you out of your comfort zone. Although you may be unhappy with what you discover, it will be better than accepting the easy way out. Don't worry if others find you overly intense; it's just what you need to do to set things right."
pisces,2010-07-19,"Although there may be multiple paths to your future, none of them stand out as the absolute winner, making it tough to put your plans into action. Your response to the current uncertainty may be to concentrate on one specific option, even if it's not the only one. Don't worry if your original choice fails because any progress you make now will move you closer to your goals."
aries,2010-07-20,"Although you begin the day with high expectations, a combination of events hijacks your day and diminishes your productivity. Your lackadaisical attitude can mess things up even more. Fortunately, you are able to prevent a downward spiral by simply paying attention to the situation instead of burying your head in the sand. Surprisingly, no direct action is required; problems should start to resolve later in the day if you maintain a high level of vigilance."
taurus,2010-07-20,What appeared to be annoying interference only yesterday now seems like well-intentioned help. Your friends are willing to stand up on your behalf or even go to bat for you. But problems may arise later if your long-term goals are not quite compatible. Taking the necessary time to compare notes about your destinations can prevent disappointment when you realize the truth.
gemini,2010-07-20,"It's all about concentration today because there are so many details for you to track. Unfortunately, you're not really in the mood to handle so many seemingly insignificant things. However, your lack of attention to the minute particulars will make them much more important in a negative manner when your overall plan begins to unravel. If you fool yourself into believing that you can take a shortcut, it will take even longer to reach your goal."
cancer,2010-07-20,"Fuzzy Neptune can place a magic spell on you today that tricks you into believing the opposite of what's going on. You may experience stress as you attempt to draw a line between the objective facts and your subjective feelings. Fortunately, your anxiety dissipates when you accept the temporarily imbalanced relationship between your head and your heart."
leo,2010-07-20,"You may have to explore your own confused emotions for a while today until you reach a point of realizing that it's a smart idea to let go of your control. But just when you're ready to confidently loosen the reins, the clouds of illusion return to diminish your visibility and throw you back into uncertainty. Nevertheless, the Moon's entry into cavalier Sagittarius later this evening gives you the courage to move ahead."
virgo,2010-07-20,"You are more apt to rely on your feelings as the watery Moon harmonizes with the Sun in sensitive Cancer today. But it's nearly impossible for you to fully acknowledge your emotions because nebulous Neptune is lurking around the edges of your consciousness, creating self-doubt and even mistrust. Still, it's a smart idea to hunker down for a spell and wait for clarity to reemerge before doing something you might regret."
libra,2010-07-20,"You can trick yourself into believing nearly anything today, but you probably won't be inclined to share your experiences until later this evening. However, once you begin talking, it might be difficult to know when to stop because your judgment isn't as sharp as usual. Remember, less is more. You're likely to get into trouble for what you say, rather than for what you didn't."
scorpio,2010-07-20,"Being led to make changes in your life by a vision instead of by logic can result in an awkward situation. Others may criticize you for avoiding the objective facts, but you are attempting to reinvent yourself and have little patience for other people's rationalizations or expectations of what you should be doing. Even if you reconsider your choice tomorrow, it's still a good idea to follow your dreams today."
sagittarius,2010-07-20,"The more work you finish during the day, the more prepared you will be to take advantage of the new cycle that begins this evening when the Moon returns to your sign. But in the meantime, you need to be responsible and set aside your dreams while you handle more practical matters. Don't worry if you get bored easily; the humdrum routine won't last much longer. Be patient; you'll be released soon enough."
capricorn,2010-07-20,"You like the idea of exploring your fantasies, but you hate the thought of wasting all that time. Unfortunately, you may have such a strong belief in the mundane world of business that it's nearly impossible to set it aside and slip into your imagination. Nevertheless, you will find it easier to justify guilt-free dream chasing if you call it ""strategic planning"" and actually put it on your calendar for the day."
aquarius,2010-07-20,"Forgiveness isn't just an intellectual act; it must also come from the heart if it's to be real. Your sensitivity is higher than usual now, which can also increase your compassion. When you truly put yourself in someone else's shoes, you can begin to see things from a whole new perspective. Don't miss this opportunity to express your vulnerability with those you trust."
pisces,2010-07-20,The illuminating Sun in your 5th House of Self-Expression is being deceived by your key planet Neptune today which muddies the waters of your mind. It's challenging for you because you want to take control of a situation that may be just out of your reach. Your overconfidence may cause you to jump to a conclusion and build a strategy on an incorrect assumption. It's helpful if you move slowly now and leave the bigger decisions for another day.
aries,2010-07-21,"You can see around the next bend now and you may be surprised that what's ahead is more familiar than you expected. Nevertheless, it's frustrating when you know what you want but cannot reach your goal by yourself. Once again you are faced with the realization that you must take other people's feelings into consideration when making your own plans. Luckily, with a little patience, you'll be able to establish relationships that support your vision of the future."
taurus,2010-07-21,"Don't take yourself too seriously now because if you do you can turn a trivial matter at work into a major crisis. An offhand comment could seem like harsh criticism in your mind. Someone's words can stir up old memories as you mull over what you might have done wrong. But rather than comparing now with then and worrying about your future, keep focused on the present moment. Balance the energy by doing whatever you possibly can to soothe tensions in the here and now."
gemini,2010-07-21,"A positive interaction with someone you don't know very well could bring you just the inspiration you need today. Normally, you might disagree with someone else's point of view, but now you're more open to hearing what others have to say. Try not to form an opinion yet; instead, continue gathering information to strengthen your case and wait a bit longer before making up your mind."
cancer,2010-07-21,"You may know exactly how you feel about a recent decision at work, but you don't know what you can do about turning your emotions into practical action. It's increasingly difficult to talk yourself down from an intense perspective because you want something big to happen. Fortunately, as the tensions continue to build, you'll have more opportunities to initiate action to bring about the desired change, one way or another."
leo,2010-07-21,"No matter how good you are at showing your positive side, you still may feel as if there are some things you should keep to yourself. Nevertheless, it isn't likely that you're shy about revealing what you want others to know. Your boundaries are being redefined now and you may be pushing for more resolution than is possible. It's smart to know where to stop, before you find yourself out on thin ice. However, if you stay conscious of what's going on, you won't slip and say too much."
virgo,2010-07-21,"You have big ideas about shaking up things at home in the name of adventure. You don't want to do everything the same old way as you always do. Your life is lightening up and you feel ready to proceed full speed ahead with your new plans. Meanwhile, assertive Mars in your sign moves toward a restraining conjunction with Saturn that's exact by the end of the month. If you move too fast now, this speed bump will surely slow you down and force you to learn your lessons."
libra,2010-07-21,"You fair-minded Libras are tougher than many people believe, and now with Saturn back in your sign, you'll have a chance to show them what you're really made of. You are entering a period when you'll be required to judge which parts of your life are acceptable and which ones need an overhaul. Even if you take action today, remember that this is a long-lasting transit that will take a couple of years to play out."
scorpio,2010-07-21,"It seems as if you have spent a fair amount of time waiting for something that hasn't yet happened. Nevertheless, you still cannot dissipate the tension unless you are willing to push yourself forward. Don't give up, for you are at a critical point in your development and things can start moving very quickly. Holding steady on your current course could bring positive results sooner than you think."
sagittarius,2010-07-21,"It doesn't matter how good your intentions are today, you still could get yourself into trouble with friends if your boundaries are too flexible. Although you might know exactly what your limits are, it still can be very confusing to others. It's okay to take charge now by telling everyone exactly where you stand, but don't forget to listen to what they have to say in return."
capricorn,2010-07-21,"Completing old business should be at the top of your list today, for you need to be ready to assume new responsibilities. Make a comprehensive list of your unfinished tasks and then put them in order of importance. Be smart and start with the highest priority items first, then methodically work your way down the list. You'll have a lot to show for your efforts at the end of the day if you stick with your plan."
aquarius,2010-07-21,"Being impulsive doesn't work for you now because your first response probably isn't your best. Your intuition might be a bit off today, so instead of relying on your feelings, keep bringing yourself back to the facts. Think about the consequences of your actions before you try something that could land you in trouble."
pisces,2010-07-21,"You may be dazzled by so many possibilities in your life that you don't know which way to turn today. You could be distracted by the lure of love which further confuses your current decision-making process. Thankfully, magic is working in your favor now; when you finally stop your expert analysis and simply begin to move, you will be heading in exactly the right direction."
aries,2010-07-22,"Although you may be excited about what's ahead, you would be very smart to slow down enough to integrate your adventurous ideas into what you are doing today. Instead of jumping into the next activity, stop and think about the recent changes so you are able to build onto the stable foundation you have already created. Although you are tempted to blindly charge ahead, keep in mind that small, safe steps are better than leaping into quicksand."
taurus,2010-07-22,"You may feel somewhat relieved today because you are able to focus your attention at work and make steady progress toward your goals. Luckily, you can make very good decisions as long as you base your choices on common sense rather than your emotional needs. Be careful that you don't become overly indulgent now or you could miss an important opportunity."
gemini,2010-07-22,"You may be so busy today that you won't even be able to complete one unfinished project. Don't worry; you'll have sufficient time later when you need it. But it's important not to take yourself too seriously or your plans could fall apart. Remaining detached from any single course of action can, paradoxically, engage you in a dance with others. Maintaining objectivity and a sense of humor goes a long way to bringing successful results."
cancer,2010-07-22,"You may have grown tired of being responsible for taking care of your boss, your co-workers and even your kids. But it's unproductive to waste energy berating yourself because too much self-criticism leads to unhappiness. Maintaining balance is tricky, for obsessive behavior could transform a lighthearted thought into a lengthy treatise. A bit of overdue rest and relaxation is in your best interest."
leo,2010-07-22,"Although you have obligations to fulfill, it's going to be hard for you to be serious when there are so many fun distractions today. But it may seem as if your options are limited and that free will is less available to you now. Don't give up, even if you must work harder than you prefer. Keep reminding yourself that your perseverance should pay off soon enough."
virgo,2010-07-22,"It may feel as if a weight has been taken off your shoulders now that heavy Saturn has moved out of your sign. The cooperative Sun-Saturn sextile makes for a rather comforting day as you begin once again to make plans for your future. Nevertheless, today's free-flowing energy can be misleading, for you have consistently worked hard over the past few weeks. Don't expect too much or you will be disappointed with whatever you receive. Your biggest reward is the satisfaction of a job well done."
libra,2010-07-22,"You realize that you cannot always have everything go your way, but sometimes you can get really close to what you want. The Sun sextiles karmic Saturn today, announcing that your success is near, yet it probably won't quite live up to your expectations. It's way too soon to judge your progress, so continue working toward your hopes, dreams and wishes with a positive attitude."
scorpio,2010-07-22,"Your ability to focus your attention can turn an opportunity into a success, but you may need to face the music and make some tough choices now. You can't take everything into the future with you, so consider what you must eliminate. It's naturally painful to let go of a past attachment, but the current excitement should help to compensate for your loss."
sagittarius,2010-07-22,"You may be relieved because you don't have to be very social today. But you cannot let go of the thought that you are being excluded from something important. Although you don't likely have an alternative plan yet, you are diligently working on an idea. There's no need now to take desperate measures but if you simply stay present, some of your anxiety will dissipate by itself."
capricorn,2010-07-22,"You may choose to stand back if you are extremely close to the edge of your comfort zone in a relationship. From your point of view, the ordinary might seem a bit extraordinary now. Something is gnawing away at you from just beyond the reach of your conscious mind. Don't force the issue; the tension will surface on its own accord when the time is right."
aquarius,2010-07-22,"You are ready for a challenge but it's more important now to learn to live with a dichotomy than to resolve it. Let your feelings flow without attempting to control them, even if they are in conflict with more rational decisions you made earlier. Don't marginalize your emotions. Pay attention to them while also being aware of your logical process as much as possible."
pisces,2010-07-22,"Concerns about money might become a problem today, but your attention to the underlying issues could bring some relief by this evening. Don't try to take any shortcuts, for this will only complicate matters further. Consider what you want and then give voice to your request using as few words as possible. Stating your intentions is a good start, but you must follow through on your commitment with hard work."
aries,2010-07-23,"Trying to control your feelings today may be a good idea, but it won't likely be a successful strategy. Of course, it's not wise to express everything because some of your emotions are better kept to yourself. You could land in a pile of trouble if you broadcast your wants and needs to everyone before considering the ramifications of your actions."
taurus,2010-07-23,"Although you might have had a chance recently to do something exciting, you did the responsible thing and acted with self-restraint. By now, you should have enough information to go for it if all still looks good. You are smarter because of your experience, but the window of opportunity is closing. If you don't put your newly gathered intelligence to work quickly, you could lose the chance forever."
gemini,2010-07-23,"You are tired of shallow conversations and idly hanging out with friends. Unexpected events at work today can increase your insecurity about your future, but there shouldn't be much to worry about if you have continued to work hard. Even if it feels like you are at an impasse, the changes you have been dreaming about could occur now without much resistance. Don't waste time analyzing your options; just make your move. Your life is on the upswing, even it doesn't unfold exactly as you imagined."
cancer,2010-07-23,"You may feel more courageous than usual because you're attracted now to the idea of being different. You're not that worried about what everyone else says these days, so unsolicited advice won't have as much impact on your life. This is your chance; go ahead and be the nonconformist that you secretly want to be, even if it's just for a day."
leo,2010-07-23,You can become quite insistent about your work plan because you really need to shake things up a bit. The same old thing may not be very interesting to you now so your strategy becomes more revolutionary. You aren't interested in lighthearted love; casual interactions are a waste of your precious time. Take the time to dream up a new and more inclusive way to approach relationships. Love is all around you if you are willing to try something different.
virgo,2010-07-23,"You don't want to be overly reliant on anyone else now because when things get serious, the other person might do a disappearing act. Ultimately, someone else's instability may be an acute reflection of your unwillingness to partake in an unhealthy relationship. Nevertheless, you really don't have to convince others to do your bidding. Be the lightning instead of waiting to be struck by it."
libra,2010-07-23,"It's hard to adhere to your own schedule now, for unexpected changes make it nearly impossible to carry through with your original plans. Nevertheless, try not to get agitated by the things you cannot change. Let a few of your less important patterns slip for a day or two. Once the cycle is broken, you should be able to put the pieces back together in a more constructive manner."
scorpio,2010-07-23,"Be careful about trying to run your life according to a preset agenda, for change is in the air today. It's possible that your plans may even fall apart because of your own whimsical moods. Still, putting together a playbook for the day is a wise strategy. Instead of only focusing on what you want, figure out a way to do what's best for all."
sagittarius,2010-07-23,"Life is complicated now because the Moon forms an intense conjunction with Pluto. But you are being pumped up by an anything-goes Sun that trines high-tension Uranus. Don't be so confident that you take a foolish chance on something that's not important. Being creative is great, but not if you jeopardize the positive gains you have already made."
capricorn,2010-07-23,"The illuminating Sun in your 7th House of Partners receives a jolt of lightning from shocking Uranus. This is a call for you to involve others in your latest scheme. Luckily, taking action is not difficult because you don't have as many restraints operating in your life now. Go ahead and share your plan, even if it's not yet ready for prime time. Others can see the potential in your ideas and will likely support your endeavors."
aquarius,2010-07-23,"You are able to do the inner work today, but changing your mind is only part of the picture. Even if you can see the positive potential in a relationship, it won't be that easy to overcome the other person's resistance to your suggested changes. Unfortunately, the harder you apply yourself, the more distant your goals get. But withdrawing would also be a mistake. Back up just enough to alleviate the tension, take a few deep breaths and try again."
pisces,2010-07-23,"Today may be a totally exciting day at work that is filled with surprises, yet you may not be amused with all the uncertainty. You have had plenty of unexpected twists and turns in your life and you're not looking for any more. Fortunately, your upbeat mood should enable you to make the best of nearly any difficult situation, so don't hold yourself back too much."
aries,2010-07-24,"You may believe that you have a plan that cannot fail but it's easy for you to overlook something very obvious now. Even if there's nothing wrong with your strategy, you still need to exercise caution so you don't inadvertently overstep any boundaries. But this doesn't mean that you have to retreat or worry about every move you make. Don't overcompensate; just make sure that you stay aware of other people's feelings so you don't ride roughshod over them."
taurus,2010-07-24,"Your perceptions are very keen and your logic is sound, so trust the conclusions that you draw today. Establishing priorities can help you be even more efficient as long as you make use of your common sense. However, listing your intentions isn't enough. Don't be lazy; work hard and proudly cross each item off your list as you finish it."
gemini,2010-07-24,"You may feel as if you're out of step with your immediate environment today if your heart isn't into handling the tasks currently on your plate. Your boredom probably arises from being able to see farther into the future than normal, making it harder to focus on the present. Still, attending to your immediate responsibilities is the best thing you can do to assure your future success."
cancer,2010-07-24,"You are determined to make progress on your long-term goals today, but you can get sidetracked along the way. A family member or close friend may ask for your advice or present a serious proposition to you. Although saying yes can be a setback to your plan, it's hard to say no because you immediately see the positive impact you can have. Helping others is fine, but don't forget to also take care of yourself."
leo,2010-07-24,"You may be eager to do something adventurous or to kick back and relax, but it's difficult to find enough time now. You have practical concerns putting pressure on you, unfinished chores needing your attention and unfulfilled promises to keep. Nevertheless, you don't have to stop shining your radiant light. Being responsible also includes making time for rest and rejuvenation."
virgo,2010-07-24,"You have had to learn tough lessons about self-restraint over the past couple of years, but, thankfully, your days of retreat could be over. Just remember that as you start to make progress, it's not a smart idea to jump ahead too quickly. You will be more successful if you let cautious optimism be your guide. Remember, this isn't about instant success, so be practical and take a long, methodical approach."
libra,2010-07-24,"Domestic chores may have piled up, preventing you from enjoying the summer as much as you want. Even if you have a lot on your shoulders now, your attitude can make a big difference. Remember, you can work yourself up into a state of frustration if you try to ignore your feelings. Acknowledging your resistance to current obligations will help to release your tension so you can focus on your responsibilities before heading out to play."
scorpio,2010-07-24,"Sometimes you don't mind engaging the day's energy and simply going along with the unfolding flow of events. But today you may struggle with your resistance to change; even if it's wiser to modify your plans, you might not want to abandon your previous agenda. Prioritize those things you need to accomplish, but don't be afraid to shift the order and then move on to the next item if that makes more sense. Remember, you can come back later to complete what you didn't finish."
sagittarius,2010-07-24,"You may find yourself facing an unexpected financial problem today, but it's not likely to be as big a deal as it currently seems. It may be something as simple as forgetting to pay a bill and you should be able to quickly fix the situation by attending to the matter. Nevertheless, it's not a good idea to let a little glitch go unchecked or it could grow more serious."
capricorn,2010-07-24,"You may be overly sensitive today with the Moon back in your sign, which can add to your overall moodiness. However, avoiding your emotions might create more stress than just going ahead and sharing exactly what you feel in the moment. There's no need to control how others react; just let them express their feelings, too. It's not about forcing any particular outcome; just be willing to engage in an honest conversation."
aquarius,2010-07-24,"The Moon's visit to your 12th House of Secrets may tempt you to keep a significant piece of information to yourself now. However, your reticence to share could stir up insecurities in someone around you. Ultimately, it's smarter to be straightforward and tell the truth today. Whatever you withhold will still come out into the open soon enough and when it does it could make even more trouble. Honesty really is the best policy."
pisces,2010-07-24,"Your friends will come through for you today as long as you don't have unrealistic expectations. Thankfully, the conservative Capricorn Moon is in your 11th House of Community, keeping social interaction to a very practical level. Maintaining a sensible perspective on all relationships is crucial now, for it's a lot easier to reach your goals when you have the support of those around you."
aries,2010-07-25,"You might need to retreat today as you manage the unexpected consequences of your overly ambitious commitments, even if your intentions were good. But it's not very useful to worry about where you have fallen short of your goals. Instead, take time to replenish your creative juices and do something that enriches your soul. The big issues aren't going away; you'll still need to deal with them when you return -- hopefully with a renewed sense of vitality and purpose."
taurus,2010-07-25,"Today's Full Moon activates your 10th House of Career, indicating that you could be considering a professional move or somehow changing your role in the community. No matter what you do now, it will probably have a strong impact on your relationship to your family dynamics. You don't have to make decisions by yourself; it's smarter to involve others in the process."
gemini,2010-07-25,"You could learn something important today that has a long-term effect on your spiritual beliefs or political opinions. Recent studies may have already opened the door to more possibilities, which, in turn, attracts you to new ideas. Curiosity lures you further into your own explorations while more altruistic interests can add a deeper meaning to your life."
cancer,2010-07-25,"You are overly sensitive to today's Full Moon in your 8th House of Deep Sharing. You may be able to feel deep emotional rumblings from within your psyche. Waves of self-doubt enter the picture, which can, in turn, negatively impact your financial condition. Ultimately, if you are willing to dig beneath the surface, the current metamorphosis could be very positive."
leo,2010-07-25,"The Aquarius Full Moon floods awareness into your 7th House of Partners. It's directly opposed to your proud Leo Sun, indicating that you are ready to break out of an entrenched pattern of a current relationship. Keep in mind that a change to the dynamics of a partnership might lead to an improvement in your overall attitude. Once you're feeling better about yourself, others will notice the difference and come forward to support you."
virgo,2010-07-25,"The effects of today's Full Moon in unusual Aquarius may not be immediately apparent, but its powerful influence is absorbed on a subconscious level. You might not be very clear about your role, especially if others aren't being clear about what they want. Stop going through endless mental loops and simply settle in to enjoy the day. Paradoxically, the benefits of pampering yourself are greater now than any specific work you might do."
libra,2010-07-25,"Today's Full Moon illuminates your 5th House of Romance and Creativity, making this a day for love. But excitement can bring a few surprises along with it. You may not be assessing others realistically now, although it's a gift to be able to see the highest potential in anyone you meet. Be careful not to judge things by their appearance alone, for the truth may not be as pretty as the attractive veneer."
scorpio,2010-07-25,"The Full Moon in your 4th House of Roots can stir old memories and nostalgia today, leaving you feeling a bit empty. Nevertheless, revisiting an old fantasy can be cathartic if you are then willing to move on. Fortunately, you should be able to process an emotional wound quickly, along with any residual negativity. Concentrating on a magical moment in the present allows you to detach from the past so you can enjoy the love that's around you now."
sagittarius,2010-07-25,"It might feel like you don't have a single moment to take it easy today because your 3rd House of Communication is activated by the brilliant Aquarius Full Moon. However, you would be wise to focus on your own projects, even if everyone wants to talk to you about their crazy ideas. Make the time for more pleasurable activities that add something special to your life, such as redecorating your home or working in your garden."
capricorn,2010-07-25,"Your overconfidence can lead to trouble today unless you pay close attention to the details. You may be feeling pretty good about yourself, but the Full Moon in your 2nd House of Money can tempt you to spend more than you should on something you don't really need. Be smart and wait a few more days before reevaluating your options."
aquarius,2010-07-25,"Today's Full Moon in your sign stretches your emotions to the extreme. You may believe that you know what you need, yet your moods are inconsistent and your desires change throughout the day. This can be particularly confusing to a partner or close friend who isn't accustomed to you expressing your whims. Nevertheless, it's better to deal with someone else's uncertainty about you than it is to deny your feelings."
pisces,2010-07-25,"The Full Moon shines in your 12th House of Privacy, making you less likely to let others in on what you're feeling today. However, avoidance isn't a practical long-term strategy on which to build a relationship or your life. Don't put off an important discussion just because the thought of it makes you uncomfortable. It's not necessary to fill in all the details, but the sooner you can get some pieces of the puzzle to fit, the better."
aries,2010-07-26,"You may have a day that is filled with lots of things to do that need your attention. Your intentions are good, but you might not be eager to work too hard today. Keep in mind that your peers will support your future ideas if you do what you're supposed to do now. It doesn't matter how you get yourself into gear; start early in the day so you can enjoy yourself later on."
taurus,2010-07-26,"You may feel fully responsible for those around you today, but remember that you are only one person. You want everything to go according to your plan so you have time to relax later in the day. Unfortunately, everyone may be tied up in their own worlds now, making it unlikely that you'll receive the help you need. If others don't want to share in the work, perhaps they shouldn't share in the fun."
gemini,2010-07-26,"You could have an unpleasant run-in today with an authoritative person. At first, it may appear as if he or she is an obstacle to your progress, but if you slow down and pay attention, you can learn something important about yourself. It's crucial to be honest now, so don't try to charm your way through a critical situation. Listen more than you talk."
cancer,2010-07-26,"You don't need anyone to tell you what to do today, for you can be your own taskmaster, but you are likely to rebel if someone else tries to take charge. Unfortunately, happiness won't come from rigidly forcing your agenda onto the day. Be flexible, for you could be ready to join in the fun if you can let go of your expectations. Don't hesitate if someone invites you to do something very cool; just say yes."
leo,2010-07-26,"You could obsess over your current need for efficiency and accuracy as you consider what you value most in yourself. But instead of making a big deal about something you don't have or cannot do today, just keep a stiff upper lip and get to work. There are probably many other things you would prefer to be doing. However, if you can limit unnecessary distractions, you should be able to improve the overall quality of your life."
virgo,2010-07-26,"You may not be inclined to openly share your feelings now because you don't want your uncertainty to muddy anyone else's waters. You want clarity, yet involving someone else will only make things even murkier. Luckily, your flexibility can help to save the day, turning the tide your way by making it easier for you to get along with others."
libra,2010-07-26,"You could be feeling a bit isolated today as restrictive Saturn in your 1st House of Self opposes independent Uranus. Be careful, for discussing a sensitive topic may leave you disillusioned because you cannot find common ground. But don't succumb to negativity that festers beneath the surface; it's far better to face the consequences of your true beliefs than to compromise your integrity."
scorpio,2010-07-26,"It seems as if you have been worrying about your future for a long time. You could be tired of running around on the same mental circuits as you try to make something different from the life you have. But fighting against the resistance is tiring, so try to let go of the attachment that you have to your long-term goals. You may be totally surprised by what happens once your mind is freed from the limits of your own expectations."
sagittarius,2010-07-26,"You may be called upon to take more responsibility for those who are close to you. However, you might not be up for the task, especially if you doubt your own capabilities. You might feel like escaping your obligations, but doing the right thing now will ultimately increase your self-esteem. Don't seek any immediate rewards. Instead, enjoy the satisfaction of a job well done."
capricorn,2010-07-26,"You may have a strong yearning to learn about something completely different or to travel to someplace very far away. Unfortunately, it's more pressing for you to focus on the mundane side of your life, such as paying bills, being responsible at work and honoring your personal commitments. Don't worry about losing touch with your dreams; you'll get your chance to follow a more distant star later if you deal with what's right in front of you now."
aquarius,2010-07-26,"You might feel as if you want more out of a current relationship, yet the other person could be a source of resistance. Paradoxically, your companion may feel that you are the one avoiding closeness. Talk it out, even if you start from an uncomfortable place of misunderstanding. If you are honest about your feelings and are gently persistent, then eventually the discomfort will fade and lead the way to clarity."
pisces,2010-07-26,"Someone may want more from you than you're willing or able to give, but you don't have to become a victim of anyone else's guilt trip today. If you want some time alone to contemplate your options now, clearly let others know that you need a bit of space. Remember, you don't have time to wallow in emotional uncertainty, because your current attitude is establishing the pattern for weeks to come."
aries,2010-07-27,"You may need to attend to a complex array of desires that make it difficult for you to take action. You probably have so much on your plate now that it's impossible to find time to do anything outside of what's absolutely required. Luckily, today you can focus your mind like a laser beam, enabling you to accomplish a lot more than you expected."
taurus,2010-07-27,"You can be so methodical about your self-expression that you may appear to be more mechanical than creative. However, you can still be quite ingenious these days, even if it seems as if you are being cautious. You may even be inspired, yet your uncertainty makes it look like you're worried about what everyone else is thinking. Don't be overly concerned with the opinions of others; your results will speak for themselves."
gemini,2010-07-27,"Your co-workers don't seem to be very interested in accomplishing very much today. Or, perhaps, their goals are so utterly unrealistic that failure is all but assured. You cannot and will not assume responsibility for someone else, but you can practice making your own choices wisely. Don't take on too much; if you scale back your expectations, you should be able to get enough done so that you'll feel good about your progress."
cancer,2010-07-27,"You may want to extend your thinking out past your regular boundaries, yet this is also your stumbling block right now. Don't try to evade this uncomfortable chance for personal growth, even if you need to overcome your own resistance. Keep in mind that just because something appears to be sensible today doesn't actually make it a smart idea."
leo,2010-07-27,"You could get confused and lose your way today, even if you had the foresight to mark your trail. Unfortunately, everything seems different now and it's not obvious where you placed your markers. Retrace your steps and don't give up until you find them. Your best bet would be to pay close attention right from the start so you can figure out where you are going and the best way to get back."
virgo,2010-07-27,"Your mind is hyperactive now that quicksilver Mercury is back in your practical sign. Mercury is at home in discriminating Virgo, making it easier for you to sort through conflicting bits of information. Nevertheless, it isn't easy to make a decision because there are tough consequences to any choices you make at this time. Wait a few days and you will have a better sense of what you should do next."
libra,2010-07-27,"Be especially aware of what you should or shouldn't say in a social setting today, because others could misinterpret your words or misunderstand your intentions. Even if you're trying to be kind, your ability to cut through the chatter and speak the truth can be hurtful to someone else. Although everyone expects you to be nice, it's okay to be honest as long as you also remember to be considerate."
scorpio,2010-07-27,"The Moon in your 4th House of Family may have you traveling back through your memories today. Unfortunately, nostalgia can be overwhelming, reminding you that you're lacking something on the home front. The real work is to consider what you have in your life now and project it into the future, rather than regressing into your past. Lean on your most reliable friends for the emotional support you need at this time."
sagittarius,2010-07-27,"You may be required to open your eyes and see your world differently today. You are continuing to learn lessons about the pitfalls of pushing forward too fast. There are serious issues that must be handled and they won't disappear until you are willing to face them head-on, so don't waste time trying to hide. Get busy by dragging things out in the open, for the sooner you begin this process, the sooner you are done."
capricorn,2010-07-27,"Although you are probably quite serious about what you've just learned, you still could say something outrageous today that clears the air of tension. On the other hand, your fear of hurting someone's feelings may provoke you to give the silent treatment. Either way, it's difficult for you to kick back and relax, but this is exactly what would be the most beneficial. Don't stress about changing things that are out of your current control. For now, just take your life a day at a time."
aquarius,2010-07-27,"You may tend toward shying away from emotionally intense conversations, but now that mental Mercury has joined Venus and Mars in your 8th House of Intimacy, you're more intrigued by the idea of sharing emotional spaces with someone you like. But it still can be tough for you to enjoy closeness while feeling vulnerable. Facing your irrational fears can push you through your own resistance and allow you to experience the love that's nearby."
pisces,2010-07-27,Rational Mercury's shift into your 7th House of Companions drags the challenge of relationships into the spotlight. You are more eager now to honor your desires and have less trouble justifying what you want. But you can become confused by mixing up your personal satisfaction with the needs of your friends and family members. Supporting your loved ones is admirable as long as you remember to also take care of yourself.
aries,2010-07-28,"There is no need to worry if you encounter deep emotions today. It's tempting to step into the murky shadows, for you may believe that you can gain a new perspective. But don't stay in the dark too long. Why spend so much time in an unfriendly environment when transformational beauty is nearby? Learn your lesson and then move on."
taurus,2010-07-28,"The Moon's shuffle into your 11th House of Community may create a situation where your friends emotionally support you, but you might pay more of a price for their help than you expect. Being accepted by your peers is so important to you now that you are tempted to set your agenda aside in order to focus on your relationships. However, it's wiser to concentrate on your tasks and let everything else fall into place."
gemini,2010-07-28,"You aren't looking for anyone to give you instructions today since you intuitively know what you must do. Unfortunately, carrying out your plan isn't a piece of cake, for a powerful individual could be standing in your way. Even worse, others may be resisting your efforts outright. Instead of just pushing ahead, you would be wise to find out what's on everyone else's minds and modify your course of action as needed."
cancer,2010-07-28,"Your unwillingness to see your desires from a wider perspective can get in the way of your happiness. It's not that you are looking to make any trouble for yourself; it's just that your mind is not on pleasing your boss today. But even if you're tempted to do as you wish, the price for your independence may be greater than you want to pay. Instead of acting impulsively, take a deep breath and acknowledge that your long-term goals are now more important than immediate satisfaction."
leo,2010-07-28,"There is something that's not being said aloud and it still bothers you today as you embark on an adventure. Luckily, truth lurks in the shadows, just beyond the bright light of the summer Leo Sun, requiring you to face an old fear. But don't fret; the Sun is at home in your sign and can temporarily give you the courage that you need to erase any lingering negativity."
virgo,2010-07-28,"Someone may be so concerned about you now that they go out of their way to connect with you. Nevertheless, you cannot be sure about their motives. It's not that anyone is purposefully trying to mislead you, but it appears that they might not be telling you the whole truth. Don't go looking for a fight; you won't benefit by forcing an issue before its natural time. Let the story unfold on its own and then you will know whom to trust."
libra,2010-07-28,"Don't be deterred from your work duties and responsibilities today, even if you aren't completely clear about what's expected of you. Unfortunately, your inquiries won't likely uncover the information you seek. You probably won't learn a whole lot more than you already know. Instead of filling your mind with useless details, just attend to the most immediate problems as quickly as possible and let go of the rest."
scorpio,2010-07-28,"It seems as if a phase of your life is falling away, yet you aren't that unhappy about its demise. If you are floating along, waiting for something to come up and inspire you, this could be it. It's like expecting guests, yet you don't know who they are or when they will arrive. Nevertheless, there is a lot to do right now, so get busy without wasting a precious moment."
sagittarius,2010-07-28,"Too many things to do at work today may prevent you from enjoying time at home and connecting with your family. Ultimately, you desire a long conversation with someone you trust. But this level of relaxation will probably have to wait until you have fulfilled your more pressing obligations, which obviously must take precedence for now."
capricorn,2010-07-28,"Your work situation is about to change and, even if you don't know what's going to happen, you can feel the anticipation in your bones. Perhaps you recently experienced a positive interaction with a workmate who truly understands you; now this relationship is about to go through a powerful metamorphosis. Don't worry; whatever transitions you face, you'll be able to take them in stride."
aquarius,2010-07-28,"The Moon in your 2nd House of Money suggests that you may run into a financial obstacle early in the day. Luckily, your undivided attention should enable you to easily clear the hurdle. Handle the most important issues, but don't waste your time getting lost in the details. Keep in mind that avoiding problems could cause them to snowball and become less manageable in the future."
pisces,2010-07-28,"The Moon's return to your sign can signify confusion today, but the source of your anxiety may prove difficult to pin down. Naturally, it's impossible to decide on a perfect course of action until you know the reason for your uneasiness. Even if you believe that you must do something right away, it's smarter to wait a bit and to allow your unconscious feelings to bubble up to the surface."
aries,2010-07-29,"You cannot escape the fact that you have a lot to finish up now and there are still many loose ends yet to be tied. Unfortunately, you might not get much done today. No matter how eager you are to get started, you're wiser to consider the relative importance of your goals and then make a game plan for the days ahead. Work with the flow instead of pushing against it."
taurus,2010-07-29,"You may feel somewhat anxious today because you believe that your time is running out, leaving unfinished business on your hands. But there's no purpose to worrying today; it makes better sense to jump into tackling the list of chores that await you. You can take the time in a few days to regroup and tighten up your strategy for the weeks ahead."
gemini,2010-07-29,"You have an optimistic attitude today about life in general. Your assumption that everything will be good for you in the short run can actually be a self-fulfilling prophecy. If you have been working under a lot of stress, it may finally feel as if your extra efforts will improve things. Start a creative project and then watch your ideas begin to take shape."
cancer,2010-07-29,"You may be right, but you still have a hard time today revealing how certain you are of yourself. On one hand, you don't want to upset others; on the other hand, you could be scared of rejection. Either way, you really don't have to remain totally silent. Instead, express your feelings a little at a time, and test the waters as you go. If you don't take a risk and speak up, you'll never know what might happen."
leo,2010-07-29,"You continue to grow stronger every day as you move closer to realizing your goals. There is a lot to be accomplished, yet you are rather lackadaisical about your ambitions. Although there is still work to do, there's no reason you can't take a less hectic approach to your life. Ease off on the gas pedal just enough to enjoy the ride. You'll still reach your destination on time."
virgo,2010-07-29,"You may feel as if a new race is officially beginning, yet you are barely stepping up to the starting gate. Balancing your need for perfection with your desire to reach the finish line can be tricky business, especially if there are others involved. Eagerly pushing ahead won't work any better than lagging far behind. Seek a sustainable pace that works for you and don't measure your progress by anyone around you."
libra,2010-07-29,"It's time to get in touch with your unexpressed anger because it will only make your life more challenging if you don't. Although you have a few difficult days ahead of you, your overall energy level is rising now that feisty Mars is visiting your sign. If you become bent out of shape, you'll feel better if you can transform your negativity into direct action that moves you closer to your goals."
scorpio,2010-07-29,"Your personal agenda may need to be temporarily set aside. Even though you could be thinking about doing something specifically for your own gain today, circumstances require you to wait for a while. Remember, there's a spiritual aspect to downplaying your goals while helping others reach theirs. Still, you must manage your frustration or it could delay your gratification even longer."
sagittarius,2010-07-29,"Your social life is in the process of taking off, but probably not until after the weekend. Weigh your individual wants with the needs of your friends and associates. Fortunately, you are quite aware of how other people's wishes may differ from yours now, yet it may take a few days to work through the logistics. Don't be in such a hurry or you'll only increase the resistance you must overcome."
capricorn,2010-07-29,"You may believe that you've worked long enough and now it's time to reap the benefits of your careful planning. But as much as you want to succeed, you are also tired of carrying so much responsibility. Don't expect public acknowledgment or a coveted promotion unless you are willing to continue with your superhuman efforts for a while longer."
aquarius,2010-07-29,"If you have recently been through a period of profound change, it's now time to lighten up and consider all the possibilities ahead. Luckily, you can maintain an even keel as you navigate through new currents. Don't be afraid to extend your goals far into the distance. Look out beyond the horizon, set your course, and then follow it."
pisces,2010-07-29,"Although you are able to be more logical today as you analyze your feelings about a relationship, you still can feel like a fish out of water, unable to find the soothing support you need. There's no need to worry too much about your current discomfort because it won't last longer than a few days. In the meantime, ameliorate your stress by partaking in pleasurable activities and just let yourself relax."
aries,2010-07-30,"The Moon's return to your sign kicks the energy up another notch higher as your key planet Mars provokes you to take initiative even if you don't have a real plan. You may be a bit out of control today and could do something that you soon regret. Fortunately, you also have the ability now to take a more measured approach to your relationships. Don't be in such a hurry; a little self-control goes a long way to help you achieve success."
taurus,2010-07-30,"It's challenging for you to concentrate on your assignments today, but you probably have tasks to do that shouldn't be postponed. And even though it's not like you to just walk away from a commitment, this could be a tempting option now. If you find yourself getting all worked up by the exciting possibilities, remind yourself that you'll be happier in the long run if you stick to your original agenda."
gemini,2010-07-30,"You don't know what to think as your key planet Mercury is bounced around by impassioned Pluto and pompous Jupiter. It's difficult for you to keep a balanced perspective on your social life; you could go overboard by accepting too many invitations or you could overreact and become a recluse for the weekend. You're totally psyched up one minute yet subdued the next. However, inaction isn't a smart strategy; choose a path and follow it the best you can."
cancer,2010-07-30,You will benefit from carefully watching your energy output today because you could easily exhaust yourself by doing too much. It's helpful to also monitor your feelings so that unexpressed anger doesn't drive you to do something foolish. Consider your motives before acting recklessly. Taking time out to contemplate your actions might very well save you from embarrassment.
leo,2010-07-30,"Although you realize the importance of acting with forethought, it's still a challenge today to think about the consequences of your reckless behavior. Others may caution you to refrain from spending so much money or warn you about taking a trip. But their advice may not be useful for you now because it doesn't lead you in the right direction. The situation isn't as complicated as it appears, but it's still wise to have your contingency plan in order and ready to go."
virgo,2010-07-30,"Your summer is suddenly in full swing, but it may feel discomforting going from being quiet to being a social butterfly. Even if you like the idea of spontaneously going out and having fun, you can still make a strong case for working before you play. Naturally, you shouldn't run out on your responsibilities. Nevertheless, having a good time can be rejuvenating so make sure to schedule it into your day."
libra,2010-07-30,"You don't know what to do today because someone is trying to convince you to try something new. Luckily, you won't likely be talked into doing anything that's not already in your plans, but you still can get thrown off course by your own weird ideas. In fact, your crazy thoughts may be unsettling to you, instead of inspiring your creativity. You'll be fine if you just think about the consequences before you act."
scorpio,2010-07-30,"Your extreme emotions may provoke you to express yourself, especially if you are angry with someone and haven't shared your feelings. Telling a friend what you're thinking may be the first step, but this won't likely make a problem disappear. Don't accept things as they are because a strategy that aims for a long-term solution instead of a quick fix makes the most sense."
sagittarius,2010-07-30,You must be patient because so many things are now distracting you from finishing a project. You could feel like you're getting nowhere fast and your growing frustration can motivate you to take an unnecessary risk. Acknowledge that your perspective is warped by your dreams today and remember that you'll be better off if you wait a few days before doing anything rash.
capricorn,2010-07-30,"You have too many alternatives in front of you and it's almost impossible to pick just one path. Nevertheless, you may feel the pressure to make a choice today, prompting unsound speculation. Normally, you are willing to wait for clarity prior to taking action. Now, however, your enthusiasm gets in the way. Remember, patience should work in your favor."
aquarius,2010-07-30,"Doing what you are told now could end up costing you more time than you realize. It's not very likely that anyone is trying to do you harm, yet you could easily jump to a conclusion and misunderstand what was said. Your eagerness to take immediate action could cause you to accidentally twist what you hear to support your intended actions. If you are uncertain about someone's message, ask for clarification before you land yourself in trouble."
pisces,2010-07-30,"Pay careful attention to your money today because a spontaneous buying spree could cost you a lot more than you think. You may be able to justify a large purchase because of how much you believe it will change your life for the better, but you'll be disappointed when it doesn't. Instead of attempting to find the logical thing to do, it's smarter now to rely on your intuition."
aries,2010-07-31,"Your key planet Mars usually advises you against taking no for an answer. The more resistance you run into, the easier it is for you to activate your inner warrior. Today, however, you need to be a diplomat and not a fighter because conflict won't be resolved by forceful means. The only way you can succeed now is if everyone comes out a winner."
taurus,2010-07-31,"You are often the one who uses the most methodical approach to get a job done. Unfortunately, you could take this so far that you don't accomplish as much as you prefer. Perhaps it's your fear of failure that makes you so cautious now. Instead of worrying about what others think, focus on the quality of your work and simply do the best you can."
gemini,2010-07-31,"Your flirtatious behavior could land you in trouble today unless you pay careful attention to how others react to you. Even if you mean no harm at all, you could still overstep someone's boundaries. On the other hand, acknowledging social etiquette could open doors for you now. Don't wait until it's too late; showing proper respect will gain you the recognition that you ultimately want."
cancer,2010-07-31,"Good news out in the community may create harder times at home. The more you leave your family in order to connect with others and their issues, the less time you have for those closest to you. Balancing your public and private life may be slightly out of your grasp now, but ultimately it's the key to succeeding in your new lifestyle."
leo,2010-07-31,"You may feel unsupported by those you love as the storm clouds of the Mars-Saturn conjunction travel through your 3rd House of Immediate Environment. You might even feel shortchanged, especially if you have been thinking about getting away from it all and now realize that you cannot. But measuring yourself against anyone else's success will just confuse matters and slow you down even more. The only true gauge of happiness comes from within."
virgo,2010-07-31,"You may feel as if you've lost your momentum and the more you try to recover it, the more elusive it becomes. Luckily, this process of slowing down has its advantages, but you must be willing to listen to the feedback that reality gives you now. Incorporating what you learn into your plans should help to dissipate some of the resistance you face."
libra,2010-07-31,"Today's Mars-Saturn conjunction is in your relationship-oriented sign, indicating an imbalance in the workload. You may feel as if you are carrying an unfair proportion of the responsibilities, yet this could be part of a larger issue. Consider previous situations where someone didn't live up to your expectations, but then take note where they differ from your current dilemma. Being honest about your needs will make everyone feel better in the long run."
scorpio,2010-07-31,"Perhaps you woke up this morning, remembering a difficult situation that you faced in your dreams last night. Unfortunately, it may not be all that easy to brush off the lingering heaviness that filtered through from your unconscious mind into the day. If you do find yourself facing an existential dilemma, start looking forward, instead of looking back to your recent past."
sagittarius,2010-07-31,"It may be difficult for you to hear what's being said to you today, especially if the messages are coming from your closest friends. Others may have good intentions, but their resistance to your ideas can send you into a tailspin. Nevertheless, it's good to remember that you don't have time to take the current feedback personally. Instead, separate out the facts from your emotions and then make something worthwhile happen."
capricorn,2010-07-31,"Instigator Mars conjoins your key planet Saturn today in your 10th House of Responsibility. Your ambitions are running high, but first you need to put some structure in your professional life. Perhaps you have to get some papers in order, or maybe you should update your resume. Either way, pushing ahead is fine, but don't move too quickly or you'll just have to redo what you already started."
aquarius,2010-07-31,"If you went overboard yesterday, it's time to make amends today. Don't be afraid to apologize for an inconsiderate action, even if you meant well. Looking to the future may also require a bit of caution. Cutting back on travel plans is a good idea; if you do it now it will be less painful than doing it later. The more responsibility you take for yourself, the better you will feel about your life."
pisces,2010-07-31,"You may face a familiar obstacle to intimacy and you won't be able to ignore it today. Your partner or lover could refuse your affectionate advances without you knowing the reason why. Instead of just withdrawing and feeling sorry for yourself, break the cycle by showing your vulnerability and asking the necessary questions. But remember, there's no point in blaming anyone else for your current position."
aries,2010-08-01,"You may believe that you have all the facts today, yet you still aren't satisfied with what you know. It's not that you think that more information will give you the answer. Instead, you are searching for a new way to put it all together that will lead you out of your current dilemma. Don't push yourself too hard because a solution will come to you sooner if you aren't struggling so much."
taurus,2010-08-01,"You have a pretty straightforward idea of what will make you happy now, but satisfaction is just out of your reach. Your ruling planet Venus is in earthy Virgo and her hard aspect to the Sun indicates that what is being offered to you today is not exactly what you want. Unfortunately, your determination can make you so stubborn that you would rather deprive yourself of any pleasure than settle for less than your true desires. Keep an open mind: you can't always get what you want, but you just might get what you need."
gemini,2010-08-01,"You can have a fine time today, even if you cannot find a way to settle down and relax. But taking it easy isn't as important to you now as having spirited interactions with friends. Fortunately, you have a variety of options. Make your choices based upon what you can learn, rather than how much fun you might have in the moment."
cancer,2010-08-01,"You are so eager to do something out of the ordinary today that you jump at the first offer. But as you begin to think about your upcoming adventure, you may realize that you really don't want to put out so much effort. Unfortunately, the wheels have already been set in motion, making it complicated for you to back out. If you can let go of your need to be hypercritical, you could surprise yourself by having a good time."
leo,2010-08-01,"You are feeling a bit better about yourself today and are looking forward to finding time to relax with a friend. However, it's hard to swallow your disappointment if someone lets you down at the last moment. Remember, you don't have to take everything so personally; ultimately, it's your choice. Giving others the same freedom of movement that you want yourself is the kindest thing you can do."
virgo,2010-08-01,"You could live up to your sign's reputation by being overly critical of someone's behavior today. You may not mean to do any harm, but your sharp words can cut deeper than you intend. Keep in mind that everyone has different values and others may not share your keen eye for perfection. Being less judgmental now will increase the possibilities for a more meaningful connection."
libra,2010-08-01,"You are trying to be more fair-minded today because that's how you want others to treat you. But your friends or co-workers may be rather abrupt with you, which makes you feel uncomfortable. You are easily annoyed because of affable Venus' anxious aspect with the Sun in your 11th House of Community. If you are unsure of your standing with your peers, a temporary retreat can act as a cooling down period for everyone involved."
scorpio,2010-08-01,"You have new ways to attack an old problem today. The Sun's magical aspect to your key planet Pluto enables you to sidestep the rules of the real world as you slip into the depths of your subconscious mind. But your fantasies are not just whimsical thoughts now; they are powerful symbols that can unlock the hidden secrets of alchemical transformation. The bottom line is that if you can imagine it, then you have a chance of making it happen."
sagittarius,2010-08-01,"It may be hard to believe, but too much pleasure can actually become exhausting today. It's not that you don't want to enjoy yourself; it's just that you need to have extra adrenaline mixed with your fun now or you'll quickly grow bored of what you are doing. Instead of planning all the details of your day ahead of time, leave yourself the flexibility to shift gears so you can quickly change the scene when you're ready for something different."
capricorn,2010-08-01,"You may not be thrilled with how much uncertainty you have to deal with today because you prefer to know what's going on ahead of time. But a difference of opinion can suddenly put you in the middle of an emotional drama. The more you try to avoid it, the crazier it gets. Stop resisting; letting go of your need to control other people's feelings will allow them to express their negativity so it can dissipate faster."
aquarius,2010-08-01,"You may be enjoying the emotional high-wire act until you realize that it's you up there without a safety net. But this is no time to let your anxiety get the best of you; instead, take a few deep breaths so you can catch your balance. Once you regain awareness of your center, you'll be able to continue on your journey without any fear of falling."
pisces,2010-08-01,"You have a different way of framing your strengths today and are eager to test your new strategy. Unfortunately, it's difficult to tell whether your idea makes sense or not, because even the best tactics can run into unexpected problems now. Don't lose faith, even if your efforts aren't eliciting the positive response you expected. You could come out of this with flying colors if you can find a way to be patient."
aries,2010-08-02,"You would be wise to step back from the center of the action today, so you can take stock of what you have and regain your perspective. The Moon in your 2nd House of Money quickly shifts the focus from fulfilling your psychological needs to taking care of practical matters. Managing your financial affairs now may be the most rewarding thing you can do."
taurus,2010-08-02,"You may become a bit discouraged today because you think that you won't get what you want. However, the real source of your frustration isn't that you are being denied the pleasure you seek; if anything, your problem is handling excess. Downsizing your over-the-top expectations is a smart strategy that can help you find satisfaction now."
gemini,2010-08-02,"You could actually believe that you're being sensitive to other people's needs, but they won't likely view things that way at all. Your friends probably see you as more overbearing than you feel. It could be helpful for you to reexamine your role in what's happening around you, for you seem to be sending out mixed messages that contribute to the misinterpretation of your actions. Ultimately, if you continue to just be yourself, everyone will eventually understand your intentions."
cancer,2010-08-02,"You may become more committed to what you're doing as the day unfolds. It's difficult to keep up with your social commitments, especially if you have family obligations, too. If necessary, change your plans to buy yourself more time. If your last minute cancellation offends someone, apologize and then move on. Trust your instincts, for you know your limits better than anyone else."
leo,2010-08-02,"Your responsibilities at work could detract from your desire to take care of others today, but they may have to fend for themselves. You need to fulfill old promises before making any new ones. Even if you truly want to help anyone who needs assistance, you just don't have enough time or energy, so don't judge yourself harshly for what you cannot do."
virgo,2010-08-02,"Although today's down-to-earth Taurus Moon brings your common sense into play when you think about travel plans, don't let an overly analytical approach prevent you from considering less grounded possibilities. It's not impossible to be practical while simultaneously imagining a dream vacation. Just keep in mind that you will need to do the research and create a solid itinerary if you are going to escape to a place that's truly exotic."
libra,2010-08-02,"You could use a little downtime today so you can integrate the recent events and get ready for what's just ahead. You've been tempted to take a chance on something or someone new, but you're still hesitant to leave the safety of the status quo behind you. Your friends might encourage you to take a risk, but don't do anything unless it feels right. Remember, you are not required to justify your actions; trust the intuitive hits you receive and act on them with confidence."
scorpio,2010-08-02,"The fixed Taurus Moon in your 7th House of Relationships indicates that a stubborn friend or partner could be quite annoying today. Fortunately, you'll be able to hold your position because of confident Jupiter's square to your key planet Pluto. Others will quickly discover that they are no match for you now. Just remember not to expect success immediately; objectives worth working for will take a while to reach fruition."
sagittarius,2010-08-02,"It's a good idea to watch your cash flow now that extravagant Jupiter is squaring intense Pluto in your 2nd House of Money. But it's challenging to be responsible and act with restraint when you know what you want and see a way to get it. Ultimately, it's your choice; staying focused on the details of work today can be your best strategy to prevent spreading your resources too thin."
capricorn,2010-08-02,"Love could come easily today with the sensual Taurus Moon in your 5th House of Romance, but it's not likely to turn out as you expect. You may not be able to tell if you have changed, but something seems different now. Even if you aren't happy with the new situation at first, be patient. Don't be so stubborn that you can't see the good in what is happening around you."
aquarius,2010-08-02,"Your inflexible beliefs about someone in your family or about a situation at home could become problematic today unless you're willing to meet others halfway. Instead of wasting your time with territorial posturing, try consciously discussing what's happening so you can establish common ground. A negotiated settlement based on mutual trust is more stable than a unilateral one built on fear."
pisces,2010-08-02,"You could run into problems today if you have created a schedule that is overly rigid. If you don't allow for some flexibility, a small delay in the morning could jumble your plans. But if you lighten your load by postponing an appointment or two, you'll be able to enjoy the slower pace of the day. More importantly, you will also be able to easily manage a surprise visitor or invitation, if necessary."
aries,2010-08-03,"You may not be good at completely restraining yourself today, but self-discipline can be a very effective strategy, even in small doses. It's not that you are so over the top; it's just that you could commit to delivering more than you can handle now. You can ruin a good thing if you accept too much responsibility too quickly. At least, think twice before saying yes."
taurus,2010-08-03,"Trying to juggle so many chores at once may impress someone at first, but everything changes if you cannot complete what you start. Luckily, you can effectively break down a large task into smaller components and then concentrate on each separately. Although the entire job may be overwhelming, it's not so bad if you just take it one piece at a time."
gemini,2010-08-03,"Your playfulness can be a bit much for someone else. A friend or partner might complain that you aren't working hard enough, but you believe that you're actually doing more than your part. If anyone else says something about your lack of productivity, try not to let a battle of dueling egos take over your day and cover up the underlying problem."
cancer,2010-08-03,"You can be so critical today that you accidentally hurt someone's feelings. You are a bundle of extremes now as you push the envelope at work, enabling you to see many possibilities along with the obstacles. You are ready to explain exactly where another person has gone wrong, but being hard on everyone else won't help anything. Your smartest strategy is to simply continue improving your productivity so you may lead by example."
leo,2010-08-03,"You could take the meaning of the word ""busy"" to new extremes today, but secretly you would rather be relaxing. You really want to have fun but you intuitively realize that your current temptations are like a test. Don't just give in to your irresponsible inner child; you'll feel better about yourself if you act maturely and behave like a grown-up instead."
virgo,2010-08-03,"You may be having trouble getting a handle on your spending today, especially if you are considering the purchase of a luxury item in order to add something special to your life. Unfortunately, buying something beautiful now may still leave you feeling empty. You need to look beyond the material world to find the fulfillment you seek."
libra,2010-08-03,"You usually take pride in your appearance and like to look your best, no matter what you are doing. Now, however, you could take this too far as irrepressible Mars in your 1st House of Self opposes overindulgent Jupiter in your 7th House of Partners. You can inadvertently set up a power struggle if you don't rein yourself in. Save your grandstanding for another day."
scorpio,2010-08-03,"It really doesn't matter if your dreams are unrealistic; you're not going to give up on them just yet. Paradoxically, in spite of what's happening in your life, you're quite optimistic about your future. You think that your logic is clear, but it's hard for you to be productive if your perspective is warped. If you ask your closest supporters for advice, make sure that you actually listen to what they say."
sagittarius,2010-08-03,"Your key planet, grandiose Jupiter, continues to be at the center of your life, giving you the potential to speculate about money and power. Someone may offer to buy you something for nothing, but rest assured that same person will be around later on to collect on a debt or promise. Instead of having to deal with your disappointments later, don't inflate your expectations now."
capricorn,2010-08-03,"You can feel your intensity building again, but you are unsure whether to trust your instincts. You may be smarting from a recent problem with an authority, yet you have new ideas to turn previous setbacks to your advantage. Don't worry about winning or losing; doing your absolute best is good enough."
aquarius,2010-08-03,"You want desperately to see both sides of a complicated issue now, but this exercise won't bring you closer to a solution if your mind is already made up. Fortunately, finding a true resolution isn't nearly as important as you think. Just fleshing all the hidden agendas out into the open is enough mischief for any one day."
pisces,2010-08-03,"You can actually see the benefits of believing in yourself today, for you cannot always count on others to support you and your work. It might surprise you if an associate takes the time now to help you without expecting anything in return. This isn't the moment to pretend how independent you are now; instead of feigning self-sufficiency and pushing others away, accept their generosity with a smile."
aries,2010-08-04,"You can tell that something is changing, but you can't figure out exactly what it is. You may be thinking about a recent situation when someone at work disappointed you and are fearful that it will happen again. Try not to be so judgmental if a current friend or associate doesn't live up to your expectations. Rather than comparing the present with the past, focus on what's happening now so you can get the most out of your current experiences."
taurus,2010-08-04,"There's no need to be concerned if your day gets off to a slow start. Enjoy the relaxed pace without attempting to push things along faster. You could become frustrated if you pack your schedule with too much to do because you can feel scattered if you are spread too thin. Remember, leaving incomplete chores is okay now since you can easily return to finish them later."
gemini,2010-08-04,"The Moon's return to your sign turns your attention toward the day-to day events in your life. But you may be afraid that you'll miss a significant opportunity because you are so caught up in what's happening right now. Don't give up just because you cannot leave your current responsibilities to head out on a great adventure. Keeping your dreams alive is important for your soul, even if fulfillment is far off in the future."
cancer,2010-08-04,"You might like the idea of being part of a close-knit family, but without all the day-to-day dramas that appear to go along with the deal now. But don't think that you have failed because your life doesn't match up with the expectations you once had. Comparing an old fantasy with your current situation is like trying to mix oil and water. Live in the present moment instead of retreating back to your past."
leo,2010-08-04,"You can appear energetic and enthusiastic, but your inner world may be less cheery today. You understand that you must push forward and that's why you are wearing a smile. Although it seems like you can't shake your current disillusionment, you really do have the power to snap yourself out of your malaise. Instead of seeking perfection now, just practice accepting things as they are and finding joy in the moment."
virgo,2010-08-04,"Your dreams can only motivate you so much; today you also have to connect with the realistic side of your life. Anything that helps you get more grounded now should be pursued, especially a practice that combines a spiritual outlook with physical movement such as yoga or martial arts. Committing to a concrete discipline can help to distract you from obsessing about your unfulfilled fantasies."
libra,2010-08-04,"One of your primary paths to fulfillment is through your exploration of relationships. Unfortunately, your current analysis might lead you to the conclusion that you are falling short of your personal goals. But rather than wallowing in doubt, let go of any self-criticism. Harsh judgments only further limit your potential at this time. A positive attitude will enable you to move on."
scorpio,2010-08-04,"You may feel as if you have been shortchanged and that something is missing in a relationship. But this can be a reflection of residual childhood longings, especially if you're reminiscing about your family, children or a pet. Exploring memories can be helpful to a point, but letting go of sentimental feelings frees you to find real happiness in the here and now."
sagittarius,2010-08-04,"Friends and associates can be the source of a drama that is begging for your involvement. However, it may be best to observe circumstances from a distance if they don't directly concern you. Worrying about matters that are peripheral to your main focus will only stress you out. You may even complicate the situation if you add your two cents. It's advantageous to everyone if you can establish a clear boundary and stick to it."
capricorn,2010-08-04,"No matter how great your current accomplishments are now, you'll still probably fall short of your own expectations. Keep in mind that you can learn a lot about yourself by examining your individual history. When you begin to understand what motivates you to be successful, you'll also be on the road to finding out what makes you happy."
aquarius,2010-08-04,"You might wake up today with a discouraging dream from last night still on your mind. Unfortunately, it's complicated to untangle the symbolic meaning of this message from your subconscious. Forget about trying to explain your feelings now to anyone else. Instead, sink into the uncomfortable shadows and let the strange images wash over you. If you take the time to meditate on your vision, understanding the lesson becomes possible and uncertainty won't stand in your way any longer."
pisces,2010-08-04,"You may be feeling down and out today because you can see how so many people fall short of their goals. But your dreams are very alive now, and their clarity accentuates where reality fails to meet your expectations. Don't waste time making lists of everything that's wrong with your life at this time. Instead, shift your attention onto whatever has a good chance of working, then put your efforts toward trying to change what you can and leave that which is unchangeable alone."
aries,2010-08-05,"You may not be able to recall all the details about what recently went wrong, but that won't prevent you from becoming discouraged about a current relationship. Some of your disappointment could be intertwined with your personal history that you might be trying to forget. However, filling in the missing gaps in your story frees you from endlessly repeating a pattern that no longer works."
taurus,2010-08-05,"You may be considering how to avoid the pressure of work today, but unfortunately, you cannot just slip away on a whim. Even if you try to escape into your past, thinking about your parents or your childhood won't likely offer you the solace you seek. Your thoughts keep returning to the present moment and what you are currently lacking. There's no need to force a change; just let your thoughts wander back and forth between the past and present until they settle down."
gemini,2010-08-05,"Your moods shift quickly today with the Moon back in your changeable sign, but the pressure still may feel like it's too much to handle. It will help if you consider which feelings are worth sharing and which ones should be kept to yourself. Ultimately, it's easier to talk compassionately about other people's problems than to open yourself up to observation by talking about your own. Choosing the safest route is not the best choice if it means avoiding your feelings."
cancer,2010-08-05,"Your core values around material possessions can strongly impact the decisions you make today. If you have childhood recollections of dissatisfaction, you could be motivated now to accumulate more than you need. If you link the idea of happiness with collecting money or things, you might wonder what you are missing. You can free yourself from your past if you stay focused on the present moment."
leo,2010-08-05,"You can be very committed to living in the moment. Nevertheless, it's still a challenge to leave your past behind. Of course, denying who you are or avoiding the truth about someone else is not an option. Dwelling on a previous disappointment in your life could close the door on a lovely time before it even has a chance. Sharing your story can be healing if you don't carry it like a shield to protect you."
virgo,2010-08-05,"It's hard when others at work don't understand what you're all about. You could actually believe that you told them what is most important to you, yet they still don't get it. Instead of adding to the frustration by further attempting to explain yourself, try a new approach. Stop reaching for a connection that isn't there; just interact without expectations. Your detachment alleviates tension and makes room for better communication later on."
libra,2010-08-05,"Relationships are important to you, yet now they are more significant than ever as you work through very deeply rooted issues. Your current expectations could come from lessons you learned in your childhood or even from remembering early family dynamics. Rediscovering your origins can clear the idealism from your current perspective that could set you up for disappointment. Try engaging in social activities without turning them into anything but the simple pleasures that they are."
scorpio,2010-08-05,"Your over-analytical mind may provoke an uncomfortable exchange with an old friend now. Although your intentions are good, other people's reactions can leave you frustrated, making you believe that you weren't truly heard. You bring more baggage to your conversations than you realize which could cause confusion and misunderstanding. Being aware of your assumptions can save you from a headache later on."
sagittarius,2010-08-05,"You feel like a lot is at stake because nearly everything appears to be a big deal today. Fortunately, you can overcome your fears and step into a situation with a healthy attitude. Keep in mind that someone may choose to resist your current enthusiasm, but don't take it too personally. The fewer assumptions and expectations you have now, the better it will be for everyone involved."
capricorn,2010-08-05,"Naturally, you ethical Goats want to do what's right, but someone's wounded feelings might tempt you to say something you don't truly mean. But ultimately, it's not really about what you say; it's more to do with how you say it. If your needs are different than someone else's, be up front with what you want. It's healthy to acknowledge your desires if you do so without putting any blame on anyone else in the process."
aquarius,2010-08-05,"If you have been led toward love by an unsatisfied fantasy, you now have an opportunity to change your pattern. But this doesn't necessarily mean a new relationship. It can, however, be the beginning of a deeper kind of intimacy, based on being totally honest with yourself and with others. Romance gets even sweeter when illusions no longer muddy the water."
pisces,2010-08-05,"Transforming a dream into reality isn't easy, yet the results can be very convincing now. Forcing a resolution isn't your smartest strategy today, even if you think that you're clever enough to pull it off. Instead, try letting go of your personal needs while opening your heart to a more fulfilling kind of relationship that's based on spiritual principles."
aries,2010-08-06,"You may be feeling quite smart, but your intelligence won't help you much now when it comes to the more routine things in your life, such as the details of your diet and exercise program. You might claim that you shouldn't be bothered with such unimportant matters when you are busy elsewhere. Ultimately, nothing is more critical to your happiness than taking care of your health."
taurus,2010-08-06,"You may be trying to stabilize your finances, yet there isn't an easy fix to your cash flow problems now. At first, you assume that spending less money on pleasurable activities is your best answer. Sure, cutting obvious expenses is a good idea, but it's not enough. Consider doing something to increase your income, like asking for a raise or even taking on a second job."
gemini,2010-08-06,"Making up your mind about something of significance can be a challenge today because the Moon in your sign causes your moods to swing one way and then the other. You cannot even count how often you change your final answer now. But don't try to force a resolution; instead, continue watching your thoughts go back and forth like a pendulum until they slow down and finally come to a rest."
cancer,2010-08-06,"You don't want anyone to know what you're feeling today because talking about your stuff can get in the way of your plans. If you try to be overly secretive, others may prevent you from knowing what they are thinking, for hiding the truth can be contagious but so can sharing it. When you bring what's in your heart out into the open, others are able to join you in the process."
leo,2010-08-06,"You prefer not to be by yourself today, so you seek out your colleagues and friends to establish the connections you want. You should surround yourself with forward-thinking people so you can share your plans for the future. But beware; all this social activity can interfere with your more mundane responsibilities, so don't forget about your obligations in the process."
virgo,2010-08-06,"You would prefer that others not lean on you for emotional support now, but this may happen anyway. Your experience, combined with natural leadership skills and integrity, make you a valuable commodity and you don't want to let anyone down. Just keep in mind that you'll be better able to take care of your own emotional needs if you also do a good job for others."
libra,2010-08-06,"It's not easy for you to keep your mind focused on your work today, especially when you are dreaming about an exciting upcoming adventure. Fortunately, you don't need to worry that you're not being very realistic because it doesn't matter what you do next. However, what's important is giving yourself the permission you need in order to have fun right now and not far off in the distant future."
scorpio,2010-08-06,"It can be distracting for you today when you meet someone who is charming and can make you laugh. You might enjoy your time with such a person, but clever conversations about trivial subjects may leave you feeling empty. Instead, you want more depth, intensity and passion. Ask for what would make you feel good -- and don't take no for an answer."
sagittarius,2010-08-06,"The Gemini Moon in your 7th House of Partners opens your life wide enough to include more people with diverse interests in your personal life. Normally, you are ready to head out on your own, but now you may desire company while doing even the simplest errands, such as grocery shopping or going to the post office. Everyone else has his own agenda, so don't make others feel guilty if they don't want to come along with you. It makes more sense to set aside some quality time for those you want to get to know better."
capricorn,2010-08-06,"Your mind is on the details at work today as the Moon finishes up her visit to your 6th House of Daily Routine. Unfortunately, you might not be as effective later on trying to follow up with professional opportunities that are on the horizon. Someone might try to warm up to you when the Moon enters your 7th House of Relationships. But don't be overly rigid in mapping out your day, for too much planning can end up limiting your freedom."
aquarius,2010-08-06,"You aren't very excited about working so much today, especially if you have your heart set on finding time to kick back and relax. You may be presented with the opportunity of teaching or playing with youngsters; don't hesitate to say yes, if asked. But don't wait for something magical to happen; in the meantime, have some fun with your friends."
pisces,2010-08-06,"You may be experiencing tensions in your work relationships now because there are important things to do at home. Yet you cannot escape from the heavy load of professional obligations. Even if you feel like a bit of a loner today, it's still not wise to do too much by yourself, for you'll only grow lonelier without the warm connections with others that you desire."
aries,2010-08-07,"You can win someone's approval today by wearing him or her down with your honest and innovative approach. Unfortunately, you might not know when to call it quits. Even if there isn't anyone you can talk to now, you can still carry on a discussion within your own head. It's great if you are learning something about yourself from your new attractions. But if you're not, then it could be wiser to let go of your hopes and move on."
taurus,2010-08-07,"It's nearly impossible to think logically today when your key planet Venus opposes radical Uranus. You might as well set aside your responsibilities for a while and do something outrageous that you've never tried before. Whether it's bungee jumping, speed dating or trying a new restaurant, just go ahead and do it. If expressing your desires doesn't hurt anyone else and could add to your happiness, then try to make it happen."
gemini,2010-08-07,"You are waging a war between extremes today. You crave more action and yet you probably already have so much going on that your excitement can turn to anxiety. Meanwhile, even a meager attempt to find some peace and quiet could work surprisingly well, leaving you to feel isolated in your seclusion. However, there's no need to choose between these opposite approaches. For now, just watch to see where the currents carry you."
cancer,2010-08-07,"Your gut reaction to emotional stress today is predictable because you want to distance yourself from the powerful feelings reflected by the Cancer Moon. You might choose to lose yourself into the vast reaches of the Internet where you can stay in touch with your changing moods while maintaining anonymity. If you begin to obsess over your digital distractions, it may be time to walk away from your computer and make connections in the real world."
leo,2010-08-07,"You have lots of big ideas about doing all kinds of amazing things, but your goals could be so unrealistic that you don't have a chance of reaching them. You may feel trapped by your previous commitment, but your frustration could feed your impulsive decisions. You want a chance to make something exciting happen -- and you want it now. Unfortunately, your sense of urgency isn't helpful; it's more productive to adopt a slow approach and maintain a steady pace."
virgo,2010-08-07,"A friend or associate might turn your day inside out when he or she tries something that's not very sensible. But you may react too quickly and judge someone before you even stop and think about it. Others just want an opportunity to be free today and, unfortunately, this can lead to reckless behavior. But don't think that playing the role of an authority figure will be useful, for this will probably push away the very person you're trying to help."
libra,2010-08-07,"Your ruling planet Venus is electrified by shocking Uranus today, attracting unusual people, places and things like a magnet collects iron. Your unwillingness to do things the same old way encourages you to test the waters by interacting with someone who is completely different from anyone else in your life. It's not time to listen to what others are saying; just do what you want to do."
scorpio,2010-08-07,"You may feel agitated by someone who is trying to control you. You might prefer to stay on the periphery of other people's lives now; you really don't want to get too close at this time. But the attraction to a totally new experience stimulates your curiosity, making it difficult for you to turn it off. Remember, whether you follow through with your crazy idea or not, the tension will subside in a few days."
sagittarius,2010-08-07,"You may have issues at home to handle that could get in the way of more ambitious plans. Perhaps you thought that others would support your ideas, but something doesn't go as expected, setting your agenda on its ear. Nevertheless, don't worry too much about your previous strategy, for it can be changed in the flash of a moment by someone's surprising reaction. Instead, willingly leap into the great unknown. A bit of uncertainty now will keep you humble."
capricorn,2010-08-07,"You can be quite cavalier in your thinking now that logical Mercury is in your adventurous 9th House. But it's a challenge to follow through on your plans if your goals are in flux. People's attitudes are quickly transforming, forcing you to alter your own course of action. The more accommodating you can be today, the better you'll feel tomorrow when you start to regain control of your life."
aquarius,2010-08-07,"Today you can make an exciting conceptual breakthrough that turns your life around and forces you to come up with a whole new set of plans. The idea of a sudden shift may be quite exhilarating now, but keep in mind that you cannot just forget about previous responsibilities. Playtime is yours for the asking, but you must still honor your commitments first."
pisces,2010-08-07,"If you are in a relationship struggle that involves a disagreement over finances or the use of your assets, it's time to reevaluate the pros and cons of your current arrangement. Naturally, there are both positives and negatives that you each bring to the party, so there's no easy choice available about whether or not to hold on to your course. Discussing what you each want is wiser than taking drastic action now."
aries,2010-08-08,"You might withhold support from someone because you are trying to send a message of disapproval today. Or, maybe, you want to separate yourself from a project that has gone astray. In both cases, your actions won't be helpful if your responses are based on fear. Naturally, pacing yourself makes sense so you don't burn out, but don't blame others for your lack of planning or preparation."
taurus,2010-08-08,"Your ruling planet Venus is held back by the dominance of restrictive Saturn today. Although you may fight against the resistance at first, letting go of control can quickly turn an uncomfortable situation into a very sweet one. Give up a little independence voluntarily; it's a small price to pay in the big scheme of things and can improve your chances of receiving the love that you currently desire."
gemini,2010-08-08,"You may be offered a tough choice today, especially if you aren't one to make a commitment easily. You could be very convincing as you explain your desire for intimacy, but you'll likely retreat if someone gets too near to your heart. However, you would be quite wise to muster up enough courage to overcome your fears. Luckily, you don't have to repeat the same old patterns just because you are scared of getting hurt."
cancer,2010-08-08,"It appears that you could get the support you need from a close friend or a family member if you asked for it, so you don't really have a logical reason to retreat now. But it's difficult, for you cannot easily imagine that someone will actually be there for you. Nevertheless, taking a calculated risk may turn out fine. Instead of seeing your current situation as requiring an all-or-nothing decision, try to establish enough common ground for the basis of a solid partnership."
leo,2010-08-08,"It's just not very much fun for you to engage in a casual conversation now because your feelings may be exposed and you're afraid that you won't get what you want. Your fears could turn into a self-fulfilling prophesy, especially if you withdraw from lighthearted social interaction. Fortunately, the Moon's return to your proud sign this evening might be enough to push you over the edge, enabling you to share what's in your heart."
virgo,2010-08-08,"If you are facing a stressful financial situation now, it's time to make a serious decision about how best to spend or save your money. But this goes deeper than being a simple cash flow problem because the underlying issue is probably about your self-esteem. When you realize what you have to offer, your earning power could grow, so don't fall into the trap of thinking that you're worth any less than you actually are."
libra,2010-08-08,"You are not inclined to fritter away your energy sharing your feelings today because you are very practical now that your key planet Venus joins austere Saturn in your sign. You may be quite rational about cutting back on frivolous pleasures to assure that you will have what you need on a rainy day. Although caution makes sense, remember that there is an unlimited supply of love, so you can splurge where it matters."
scorpio,2010-08-08,"You really don't have to suffer in silence today if you're willing to face an old fear. Your current isolation is probably more voluntary than you care to admit. This has very little to do with what happened to you in the past. But it's your choice; you can respond emotionally based on worn out habits or you can live totally in the present. Ultimately, being realistic is a much smarter strategy than being pessimistic."
sagittarius,2010-08-08,"If your friends let you down today, consider your role in what's happening by creating trouble where there doesn't have to be any. Now, however, it may be too late to avoid the discomfort if negativity has already been generated by your feelings of inadequacy. Instead of unconsciously projecting failure onto others, openly talk about your disappointment without pointing fingers at anyone else."
capricorn,2010-08-08,"It may be rather disheartening if you don't receive the professional respect you now deserve as vulnerable Venus joins your key planet Saturn. You've done the hard work, yet unfortunately, your ego can get in the way. Don't fall for its trick that leads you to think that you should be more appreciated. Don't waste your time dreaming about recognition and fame. Just do the best job that is possible and the appropriate rewards will soon follow."
aquarius,2010-08-08,"Your key planet Saturn receives a friendly kiss from sensual Venus today to tease you with the prospects of delicious pleasures. But there's no room on your agenda now to give in to hedonistic desires. Don't waste any time complaining about what you're missing. Instead, derive happiness from your journey, rather than just rushing to your destination."
pisces,2010-08-08,"Too much pressure from a partner doesn't give you an excuse to go off brooding today. Don't isolate yourself from someone you love deeply just because you think that everything is not ideal between you. It's tempting to hide your head in the sand like an ostrich, but this is certainly not a sensible long-term solution. Facing the shortcomings of a relationship can actually put you back in touch with your heart."
aries,2010-08-09,"You don't have to hold back your creativity with the New Moon in your 5th House of Spontaneity. If you've been waiting to start a new project, it's smart to strike now while the iron is hot. Nevertheless, anything you do today should be done with a playful attitude. If you aren't having a good time, perhaps you should be doing something else."
taurus,2010-08-09,"You could be standing on shifting sands as today's dynamic New Moon falls in your 4th House of Roots. Although the extravagant Venus-Jupiter opposition enables you to exhibit an air of confidence, you may not feel as secure as you seem. Even if you are usually supported in your efforts by your close friends and family, issues can now come to light that have you wondering if you can truly count on them. Ultimately, your answers won't come from anyone else; they must come from within."
gemini,2010-08-09,"Your schedule could fall apart today because you attempted to fit too much into one day. Now, the Universe is sending you a private message, reminding you to slow down. The dramatic Leo Full Moon illuminates your 3rd House of Immediate Environment, affecting your interactions with those closest to you. If a seemingly innocuous event turns into a more serious problem, don't feed the drama with additional negativity of your own. Your positive input can quickly put things back on track."
cancer,2010-08-09,"Today's New Moon falls in your 2nd House of Personal Resources, indicating that you might have to change how you handle your money. You could be spending your cash under the illusion that you have more than you actually do. But you should consider your overall relationship to your current possessions and whatever else you want in your future. As you already know, having more material things is not the true source of happiness."
leo,2010-08-09,The New Moon in your fiery sign makes today your own special New Year's Day -- the most effective time for you to create a list of resolutions. But merely writing them down isn't sufficient because it is the act of concentrating your intentions that sets your life into motion. Visualize what you want in your mind's eye and then make a commitment to be unrelenting in reaching your objectives.
virgo,2010-08-09,"You have come to a crossroads with your intuition telling you one thing, but you might do something else anyhow. You probably can rationalize your uncharacteristic behavior if it is different from what you know to be best. But this New Moon falling in your 12th House of Destiny prompts a spiritual crisis as you try to align your actions with your beliefs. Don't worry if others can't appreciate what you are experiencing. It's not about what anyone else thinks; it's about you. Trust in the process."
libra,2010-08-09,"Social plans might change at the last minute with today's New Moon occurring in your 11th House of Social Networking. But rather than taking it personally, it's wiser to realize that some things are just simply out of your control. Whatever happens now could run you through a gamut of emotions. Remember, your feelings are still in flux, so avoid drawing any final conclusions yet."
scorpio,2010-08-09,"With today's showy Leo New Moon falling in your very public 10th House of Status, it can be challenging to hide your feelings for long. Keeping a secret voluntarily is one thing, but being pressured to remain silent is entirely different. Go ahead and say what needs to be said, but be gentle in your delivery. There's no room for blame or meanspiritedness. Any unnecessary negativity will be reflected back to you quickly."
sagittarius,2010-08-09,"This could feel like a party week instead of a back-to-work day, yet, paradoxically, you could increase your chances for pleasure if you tone down your need for action just a little. It's not that you can't have a good time with the New Moon in loud Leo; you're more than ready as your 9th House of Adventure is activated. But extravagance can get in your way, especially if you are trying to prove something to someone else. There's absolutely nothing wrong with seeking fun, but you'll feel better if you avoid competition."
capricorn,2010-08-09,"Trouble surfaces in an intimate relationship if either you or your partner has been anything less than fully honest. Today's New Moon falls in your 8th House of Transformation, making it tough to hide any secret agendas. It's even more challenging to keep unpleasant feelings to yourself. Although emotional discomfort is likely now, it should be fleeting if you can get the issues directly out into the open."
aquarius,2010-08-09,"The lively Leo New Moon activates your 7th House of Partners today, indicating an energetic shift in your business and personal relationships. Unfortunately, your resistance to change can fuel a heated discussion. But your disagreement is really with yourself -- even if someone else appears to be involved. Instead of avoiding an unresolved issue, learn what you can from anything that comes to the surface now."
pisces,2010-08-09,"Pay careful attention to your physical body now, for the New Moon falls in your 6th House of Health and Habits. The smallest details of your daily routine can be important enough to make you feel better or worse over extended periods of time. Pick something that you can do every day, such as making an improvement to your diet or exercise program, to enhance your total well-being."
aries,2010-08-10,"There are no shades of gray in your life today. If there is someone or something that you want, your feelings may grow so strong that you act in a foolish manner. Fortunately, you can avoid causing problems for yourself if you are able to wait a few days before doing anything you will later regret. But this is not about suppressing your emotions; you can be aware of your own feelings without necessarily sharing them just yet."
taurus,2010-08-10,"Even if you thought that you knew what you wanted to say, you may have to rethink your strategy today. Contrary to logic, the more intense your desires become, the easier it is to rationalize inaction. Take as much time as you need to make up your mind. But once you decide, push yourself forward to take action. There's no reason to delay just because you are afraid of the outcome."
gemini,2010-08-10,"You may run into a problem with someone who has your feelings tied up in knots today. Fortunately, you are clever enough to transform a complicated situation into a memorable time for all involved. You can be the hero of the melodrama as you escape from other people's controlling behavior. Remember, this is your show; you're not responsible now to play a supporting role in anyone else's movie."
cancer,2010-08-10,"You can bring a lot to the table at work, but it may be difficult to open the channels that are necessary to make this happen today. One sensible place to start is to weigh your positive and negative traits, so you know how much you have to offer. Unfortunately, if you're not appreciated at work, your current annoyance may turn into resentment. Nevertheless, it's not wise to openly express negativity now, unless it leads you directly to satisfaction."
leo,2010-08-10,"You don't see any sensible reason to tell anyone about your inner pain today, even if you have been hurt by someone you love. It's not likely that you will be eager to show your vulnerability because you feel that this gives too much of your power away. Your self-esteem depends on being in control of your own emotions now, so don't allow anyone to talk you into saying more than you want."
virgo,2010-08-10,"You have tried to maintain an easygoing attitude with everything that's happening, but you could be feeling more judgmental now. You are riding an emotional wave and may not have very much control over suppressing your intense feelings. At first, you aren't interested in retelling stories from your past just so you can demonstrate how strongly you feel about a current situation. But there may not be a simple alternative to shaking things up. Taking the slow and steady approach is better than upsetting the proverbial apple cart."
libra,2010-08-10,"You usually can appear refined and gracious as you make others smile or, at least, be comfortable. But you may not be in the mood to play host to someone you don't feel connected to now. Meanwhile, if your needs aren't being met today, you could become very angry. Unfortunately, losing your temper isn't a smart strategy. Instead, shake off your current negativity so you can prepare for what's around the next corner."
scorpio,2010-08-10,"You have to complete your current assignments before moving on to what is next, but to you it may seem as if you're already finished. There's still a lot more to accomplish and your resistance only prolongs the stress. Three planets in your 12th House of Endings is your signal to swing into motion before you lose your chance. Don't wait; do it now."
sagittarius,2010-08-10,"You would like to get a little time off now, because responsibilities are stacking up and you need a break before jumping back into the fray. Unfortunately, you may not get the rest and relaxation you want because you take your workload with you, wherever you go. Before getting involved in an unnecessary conflict, remember that the current tension will likely disperse on its own in the next few days."
capricorn,2010-08-10,"It's all about work as strategic Saturn, lovely Venus and impudent Mars pile up in your 10th House of Career. You are considering your professional role and are trying to better understand where your current path leads. Just remember that there's no need to make anyone uncomfortable with an emotional display. Keep your intentions clear and follow your bliss."
aquarius,2010-08-10,"The emphasis on relationships continues now, but a discussion about pragmatic issues could quickly turn to more substantial topics such as the meaning of love and life. You may dream about becoming a student again yet you also like the idea of teaching others what you already know. In either case, just committing to reconsider your intentions can clear the unknown path ahead."
pisces,2010-08-10,"You are growing tired from fighting with those who resist you. The pressure continues to build as your boss or someone else who claims to be in charge puts stop signs in your path. Instead of acting out in rebellious behavior, try handling each blockage separately and not just lumping them into one major obstacle. Remember to pick your battles carefully now, for your perceptions could be bent out of shape more than you realize."
aries,2010-08-11,"Now that the Moon is in your 6th House of Health, you may become more concerned about changing your habits to sustain your physical energy or improve your overall well-being. It's a smart strategy, however, to avoid doing anything too drastic if you are feeling under the weather. Instead of announcing that you've adopted a radical fad diet, simply make small improvements to your eating habits. Tiny steps can take you far."
taurus,2010-08-11,"Think about taking up a new hobby while the analytical Virgo Moon is hanging out in your 5th House of Fun and Games. However, it's not a good time to avoid your work because you really want to have a purpose to your life. You may be more interested in combining a playful distraction with something that's useful, such as arts and crafts. Scheduling some downtime for relaxation is the best way to make sure that it actually happens."
gemini,2010-08-11,"You might be tempted to sneak out for some fun today, instead of meeting all your obligations at home and on the job. You aren't interested in working all day long, even if you have pressing responsibilities to fulfill. Nevertheless, it's not a smart idea to avoid your commitments. Keep your promises first; then you'll be free to join the other kids at play with a clear conscience."
cancer,2010-08-11,"An unsettling conversation with a friend or family member doesn't have to ruin your whole day. You Crabs like to hold on to your experiences, nostalgically replaying the wonderful times and even recreating the pains attached to more difficult memories. But a sudden lightning strike of awareness can shatter the reverie of your contemplative mood. Remember, good times are waiting for you in the present moment if you can leave the past behind."
leo,2010-08-11,"Someone may show up now by talking his or her way into your life and turning your entire world upside down by confronting you with values that are different from yours. Don't try to control the emotional currents, for you could exhaust yourself. Instead, just go along for the ride to see where it takes you. It's better for you in the long run if you aren't so critical of yourself and others."
virgo,2010-08-11,"The Moon's conjunction with your key planet Mercury in your sign today blesses you with the ability to say what's on your mind. But having the right words to describe your emotions can be dangerous, for you are more likely to share things now that you might normally keep to yourself. Ultimately, your self-expression can have a positive impact, but you'll need to follow through on a conversation once it's been started."
libra,2010-08-11,"The quiet Virgo Moon's visit to your 12th House of Spiritual Retreat can be a problem today because of preexisting commitments you made to others. It may be difficult, if not impossible now, to find time to check in with your inner world. Nevertheless, you can benefit by reserving a bit of mindshare to remember that there are bigger things than what's happening in your own life right now."
scorpio,2010-08-11,"No matter how busy you are now, it's crucial to set aside a block of time where you can sit and dream about the possibilities ahead or freely talk about your hopes for the next phase of your life with a close friend. The Moon's current visit to your 11th House of Long-Term Goals takes your mind off the everyday noise of your job. Give yourself a break; instead of worrying about tomorrow or next week, extend your vision much further into the future."
sagittarius,2010-08-11,"You want to play out your role as an efficient leader at work or in the community now that the Moon is in your 10th House of Public Responsibility. Nevertheless, it's not useful to force your personal agenda onto others because your insistence will only stir up resistance. Instead, you can win the support of generous allies by maintaining a high level of integrity in all that you do."
capricorn,2010-08-11,"If you are considering a vacation or even just a weekend getaway, this is an excellent day to make your plans. Fortunately, you are more grounded than you think, yet you're also able to hold on to an adventurous spirit now that the Moon is in your 9th House of Big Ideas. But don't get too wrapped up in figuring out all the details. Set a date and the rest of the missing pieces will fall into place later on."
aquarius,2010-08-11,"The Moon's visit to your 8th House of Shared Resources marks a good day to consider making a financial investment. But the Moon's conjunction with logical Mercury can add subjectivity to your thinking, so be sure to stick closely to the facts. You have enough information to choose now, even if you don't take action on your decision for a few more days."
pisces,2010-08-11,"You may be involved in a dispute with an authority figure that increases tensions between you and your friends. Your frustration tempts you to throw in the towel and walk away from the whole thing. However, trying to escape isn't such a smart strategy because you'll just have to deal with the same issue again if you avoid handling this situation now. A straightforward approach makes the most sense when dealing with a current conflict."
aries,2010-08-12,"It doesn't matter what you want now, for you have to balance everything with the needs of someone else. However, you must be careful because you cannot just bury your emotions. Avoidance as a strategy does not work in your favor, but neither does overreacting. Fortunately, you can prevent a minor disagreement from turning into a significant problem if you simply consider other people's feelings, too."
taurus,2010-08-12,"The Moon runs you through a full spectrum of emotions today, tempting you to go so far that you find yourself out on a limb in search of a simple solution. But resolutions are elusive and won't come easily because your inconsistent needs are all over the place. You can ease the pressure by being grateful for what you have in life, instead of believing that you should have more."
gemini,2010-08-12,"It's difficult for you not to turn each molehill into an insurmountable mountain now because your perspective may be a bit off. But, honestly, life just isn't as complicated as it seems. Nevertheless, it's challenging to scale back your needs without suppressing your desires. Take a risk and share your frustrations. Open communication should be helpful if you don't assume someone else should fix your problems."
cancer,2010-08-12,"You can intuitively sense that you are on the edge of change, which pushes your anxiety level higher. You know that something big is about to happen, yet you aren't sure what it will be. Your path is not clear now, even if you are certain about what you want. Your emotional needs won't likely be fully satisfied. Instead of just wanting more, it's wiser to put things into perspective by appreciating what you already have."
leo,2010-08-12,"You want to balance work with play today, yet you have so much on your plate now that relaxation may have to be postponed. Complaining about your super-busy schedule won't make things any easier. Even if you are feeling lazy, take care of your chores. Instead of seeking ways to escape your responsibilities, find ways to enjoy yourself in spite of them."
virgo,2010-08-12,"You might have a hard time today because you cannot clearly state what you want. Part of the problem is that by the time you do speak up, your feelings have already shifted. Unfortunately, you can be so exacting that you set an unrealistic goal. Keep in mind that you won't need to lower your standards to allow others additional flexibility in how they respond to you."
libra,2010-08-12,"Friends and associates may ask you for more than you can give now, but with all the energy that's cooking when the Moon returns to your sign, you won't likely be stopped. Your desire to put others at ease can be so strong that your actions seem exaggerated. You can save everyone from a serious headache by promising less. Remember, it's better to disappoint someone today than facing the consequences of unrealistic expectations."
scorpio,2010-08-12,"Today's ambiguous Libra Moon in your 12th House of Secrets reminds you that some things should not be shared. Although you may agree with this idea in theory, in practice it is best to keep everything out in the open now. Explaining your motives may be the most straightforward way of showing everyone what's significant to you. Even if others don't understand your perspective, at least they will respect your courage."
sagittarius,2010-08-12,"You try to be very fair-minded as you approach others in a group situation today. Although your plan of attack might be quite different from the one that everyone else agrees upon, you are smart enough to go along with the collective decision for now. Be careful not to give in too quickly or your resentment may end up getting in the way of success."
capricorn,2010-08-12,"You are challenged to keep your mind on business today because so many things are pulling you this way and that way. Even if you have a lot to do, your desire to enjoy yourself is stronger now than your need to succeed. The Libra Moon in your 10th House of Career reminds you to be balanced and seek a middle path between work and play. Get your chores out of the way early in the day because you won't even want to think about them once you start to unwind."
aquarius,2010-08-12,"You feel the pressure to work out an unresolved relationship issue today. Unfortunately, tension arises from a complex mix of circumstances and it won't likely dissipate, even if you try to get to the bottom of the situation. For now, it's probably wiser to set differences of perspectives aside and simply enjoy the positive aspects while you can."
pisces,2010-08-12,"Your ability to cut through all the things that are holding you back and express yourself spontaneously is a true gift today. But you can inadvertently stir up a hornet's nest of practical issues and there isn't enough time in the day to sort through all the details. Although your patience is surely being tested now, leave a few loose ends untied so you have more flexibility later on."
aries,2010-08-13,"You often make decisions based only on your own needs, but today's Libra Moon asks you to also consider what others want, too. Nevertheless, you still might be a bit aggressive once you make your choice. But if you actually believe that you can ignore everyone else, you could provoke some serious consequences to your current actions. There's no reason to try to outsmart anyone now, when being pleasant and doing as you're asked gets such good results."
taurus,2010-08-13,"You may not agree with a co-worker today, but seeking common ground still has far more advantages than you might realize. Stop worrying about how you will be able to get what you want because there just isn't room for selfishness with the Moon in cooperative Libra. What's currently the most important thing is to move through your resistance to the inevitable."
gemini,2010-08-13,"The smartest way to get in step with your world now is to let go of your control and have some fun. Don't make yourself crazy by being overly serious because all work and no play could turn you into a bore. Although you cannot avoid your responsibilities, it feels good to get some of your restlessness out of your system. You should be able to focus on your tasks if you aren't distracted by every enjoyable activity that crosses your path."
cancer,2010-08-13,"Sometimes you are better off when you're stressed by too much opportunity rather than none at all. Perhaps it's easier for you to face a disappointment when other things are going so well. Nevertheless, heightened expectations will set you up for a letdown, so it may be smarter now to scale back your ambitions before you inadvertently set yourself up for failure."
leo,2010-08-13,"Although things seem to be improving, you still might feel as if you are on a collision course with reality. Even if nothing appears out of the ordinary now, your energy may be stretched to the max. Try setting aside your long-term goals for a while and focus on finding peace and harmony in the present moment, instead. Cut back your activities just enough to free up a little time to relax."
virgo,2010-08-13,You may be under pressure to make money or to contribute your creativity to a project. The stress continues because your closest relationships are going through changes and figuring out where you fit in can occupy a lot of your time. Knowing what to do can be tough since it's uncomfortable to set boundaries that may interfere with your career advancement. Remain open as possible and keep your boss and your co-workers appropriately informed about your schedule.
libra,2010-08-13,"You are well into the first phase of a significant shift in your life that is impacting all types of your relationships, yet you aren't quite ready for all the pieces to fall into place. You might even postpone an important personal event so you can buy yourself some much-needed time for productivity. There's really no need to worry about what will happen in the future because current circumstances will ultimately lead you to your final destination."
scorpio,2010-08-13,"The Libra Moon buzzes your 12th House of Secrets and you're likely to have a few things that you're not going to tell anyone. However, you are tempted to reveal something very private about yourself and you could go overboard and share more than you should. Don't think that everything you say now will turn out fine. If you are thinking about confessing, take a few minutes to remember your reasons for keeping quiet in the first place."
sagittarius,2010-08-13,"You can still feel the pull between your own personal needs and those of your friends and workmates. You may attempt to redefine your values and your current situation, but the more you look at all your options, the better the status quo appears. If you aren't sure what your next action should be now, try checking in with your friends, for they can be the source of profound advice at this time."
capricorn,2010-08-13,"It's not easy now to balance your professional ambitions with your personal life, for the two seem less compatible with each other than ever before. It's hard to restrain your positive attitude when others are telling you how great you are. Nor do you want to hear about the dangers of inflated goals and how they will only lead to disappointment. Instead, consider this a gentle reminder that an even-handed approach is your smartest strategy at this time."
aquarius,2010-08-13,"Even if you are close to a breaking point, the big change you're seeking now begins to slip away as your ruling planet Uranus temporarily retrogrades back in imaginative Pisces. Facts get fuzzy and plans can sound like excerpts from an adventure tale. But this isn't a smart time to get creative with the truth because you won't be able to justify how you bend reality to your perspective, even if you do it very skillfully. Instead, get out of the way and let the facts speak for you."
pisces,2010-08-13,"You may feel as if someone is trying to prevent you from being successful. What starts as a passing thought can grow into an obsession as you attempt to untangle all the emotions and objectives that are involved. It won't be easy now to overcome the current obstacles, unless you can be patient and persistent. This is especially difficult because the return of restless Uranus to your sign today amps up your nervous system until next March."
aries,2010-08-14,"Although yours is often considered the sign of self, today's accent is on everyone else. It may even be relaxing to take a break from thinking about yourself and maybe, even, letting go of your personal agenda. Instead, concentrate on what you can do for others to make them feel at ease. Your current graciousness reflects the good feelings back to you."
taurus,2010-08-14,"The Moon brings you an abundance of pleasurable experiences today, yet it still might not feel so good if you only take care of your own needs. Being of service to others now can turn into a very sweet path to happiness. It's not worth trying to change the day to match up with your preferences; instead, offer your assistance wherever you think it might help most."
gemini,2010-08-14,"Today can offer you a bit of respite from a rather tumultuous few weeks. Although the larger issues loom close, friends and family appear congenial, adding to your happiness. Even with heavy issues on the horizon, go ahead and let them slide for now. They will still be here tomorrow when you return to your normally scheduled responsibilities."
cancer,2010-08-14,"Even if you can't take the entire day off to relax at home, spend as much time with your family and loved ones as you can while the Moon is in your 4th House of Domestic Conditions, along with three other planets. You are eager to show everyone that you have what it takes to be a gracious host now, so invite a few friends over and fire up the barbecue. It's time to bask in the love of those closest to you."
leo,2010-08-14,"Don't say yes to every invitation that has your name on it, because you could end up so busy that you lose your current spark of excitement. You may have many tasks to complete, especially if you are in charge of today's gathering. Rather than running in circles trying to accomplish everything, try sharing your social responsibilities with your friends. Letting go of control isn't easy, but it's the wisest thing to do now."
virgo,2010-08-14,"No matter what, keep your feet on the ground while also flitting around like a social butterfly. You are able to turn on your charm now, but you can't escape from the pressing concerns that are weighing on you. Spending a little time on more serious matters may be a smart idea, but don't be too hard on yourself for taking it easy."
libra,2010-08-14,"It's challenging for you to stay objective as the Moon activates three planets in your sign today. Your emotions continue to leak out, even if you think you are keeping them to yourself. Don't fight against it; if you put extra energy into hiding your feelings, you could end up angry or resentful. Instead of trying to be something different, just show up and be yourself."
scorpio,2010-08-14,"You have too much on your mind now, but that doesn't make it easy to share your long-term concerns with others now. There may be so much happening that you don't want to create additional problems, yet you also have some significant information that is worthwhile to express. Keep in mind that what you say is less disruptive than how you might say it. Instead of tying your conversations to anyone else's actions, just put your feelings out there with no expectations."
sagittarius,2010-08-14,"Spending quality time with your best friends is just what you need. It's looking good for a party now, even if it is a work-night. With four planets in your 11th House of Groups, it's wise to surround yourself with like-minded people. Be thankful that you are a part of a growing community, for your sense of belonging to something greater than yourself grounds you in ways that may not be apparent at first."
capricorn,2010-08-14,"You are interested in gaining more respect at work now with the Moon in your professional 10th House. Fortunately, you're able to do the right thing which elevates your status in the community. You enjoy the company of others, but may be too focused to have much to do with anyone. Instead of pursuing social goals now, limit your interactions to those that can move you closer to your destination."
aquarius,2010-08-14,"You may feel as if you're up for anything that sounds like fun today, especially if your friends are involved in the activity. Although you might attempt to escape from work, business concerns could eventually push more pleasurable pursuits into the background. Still, you should be able to squeeze a little break into your day as long as you don't overdo it. Paying attention to your limits allows you to enjoy a well-balanced day."
pisces,2010-08-14,"You would like to approach your interactions with others as even-tempered as possible, but you're not likely ready to give up on what you need. Unfortunately, even if a friend, family member or your boss makes an unreasonable demand, you still might do what you can to fulfill it. But don't be afraid to establish some healthy boundaries because someone will probably push you too far if you don't stand up for yourself."
aries,2010-08-15,"The distinction between love and friendship may become an issue today with the Scorpio Moon now in your 8th House of Intimacy. But with so many other planets in your 7th House of Partners, it could be harder on someone else than it is on you. Nevertheless, it's your awareness of the concerns of others that can make a difference, so don't try to avoid a discussion about a difficult subject that needs your attention."
taurus,2010-08-15,"Your key planet Venus in harmonizing Libra and your detail-oriented 6th House continues to focus your attention on the everyday routine of relationships. But balancing your needs with someone else might not be as simple as it sounds as your desires clash with reality. Nevertheless, don't be in too much of a hurry to make changes because you could be overreacting now; you'll have a clearer idea of what to do in a few days."
gemini,2010-08-15,"The idea of love may sound better than your current experience of it today, but don't let your fears stop you from trying. Difficult emotions may come to the surface now, but they can open a door to greater intimacy if you aren't afraid to step through it. Keep in mind that romantic interactions aren't always as light and easy as you wish, but pushing through your discomfort could be well worth it."
cancer,2010-08-15,"It may be necessary for you to be the referee in a domestic disagreement today, but ironically you also might be in need of some counsel for yourself. You aren't on trial, though; it's just that your current uncertainty may hinder your actions and you could benefit from the expert advice of an objective observer. Whether you are offering your opinion or receiving assistance from others, keep in mind that no one can claim an exclusivity on the truth."
leo,2010-08-15,"A misunderstanding with a family member could pull you off track today and might require a bit of time and energy to resolve. If you live alone, a conflict could develop with a friend or a neighbor. Fortunately, you can minimize a potentially difficult situation by avoiding gossip, since superfluous conversations about other people's affairs is surely fertile ground for dissension."
virgo,2010-08-15,"You are usually very exacting in your approach to managing your finances, but an uncharacteristic bit of sloppiness could cause trouble now. Perhaps you missed a bill payment or lost a receipt that you now need. It's not fun wasting valuable time and energy to take care of something that should have already been done. Nevertheless, it's a lot better to do it today than to postpone it for another day."
libra,2010-08-15,"Your love life may be in the midst of change as things get better and worse over and over again. Now, differences between you and your partner could surface and stir new doubts. Thankfully, this isn't likely a cause for concern, since two people don't normally approach everything in a similar fashion. However, it's a good idea to initiate a discussion without necessarily trying to resolve the conflicts. Remember, your relationship gains strength when you can agree to disagree."
scorpio,2010-08-15,"The Moon's return to your sign emphasizes your emotions, making it tougher to let a mood pass unexpressed. Telling secrets to a friend or intimate partner can bring you closer together as long as you don't take it too far. If you do, you could alienate the very person you want to impress. Instead of trying to share everything, let some parts of your story wait for another time."
sagittarius,2010-08-15,"The Moon's visit to your 12th House of Secrets tempts you to keep your desires to yourself. Surely, hiding controversial feelings is safer than sharing them and exposing your vulnerability. But you have a better chance to get what you want if others know something about your needs. Even if you don't find satisfaction today, take a risk and open your heart to let someone in."
capricorn,2010-08-15,"You might want to change your direction as you consider how to best handle the next phase of your life. Things at work may have already begun to change, yet you're not ready to push the transformation any faster than it's currently going. A well-balanced approach to your career aspirations will work best for you now if you don't let your attachment to your goals get in the way."
aquarius,2010-08-15,"You may be avoiding commitments to long-term plans now because you feel as if your entire life is changing, making it tough to know what will be important around the next bend. Don't stress yourself out by trying to foresee the future; instead, concentrate on what is right in front of you. After you are done with this intense phase, you will be able to return to figuring out the rest of your life."
pisces,2010-08-15,"The passionate Scorpio Moon is in your 9th House of Big Ideas, revealing your grand vision of the future. Unfortunately, the dramatic Leo Sun is in your 6th House of Details, and you could become so obsessed with the little things that you lose track of what's most important. Maintaining an objective view of your relationships can help you keep a balanced perspective on your plans for the days and weeks ahead."
aries,2010-08-16,"You aren't barging ahead so fast now, for you realize that accomplishing a lot could be a hollow victory if you exhaust yourself in the process. The problem is that your current objectives may be very demanding, but they're only a small part of a much larger set of goals. Get some sleep; it's more crucial to reserve some energy for tomorrow than to overdo it today."
taurus,2010-08-16,"If you have left too many chores undone, you'll need to concentrate your energy today and finish what you can. You might be annoyed if someone has placed unrealistic expectations on you because you don't want to work any harder than you have to now. Nevertheless, nothing will be gained by complaining; it's wiser to change your attitude and just do the best job possible. You will feel much better once everything is done."
gemini,2010-08-16,"You may be searching for ways to make your creativity more of a part of your regular routine. It's one thing to get inspired and express yourself in ways that touch others, but it's entirely different if you need to do this every day. Remember, turning your art or craft into something more productive requires just the right mixture of self-discipline and wild abandon."
cancer,2010-08-16,"Balancing loyalty to your family with your desire for adventure can be tricky business and responsibilities at home may limit what you can do. It could take more careful planning than you wish in order to develop a solid career path. Keep in mind that there's no need to be in a hurry. If you continue putting in a small amount of time toward your goals every day, you will be a success."
leo,2010-08-16,"Naturally, you want to shine your light in a manner that others can appreciate. However, previous commitments may prohibit you from having too much fun now. But instead of being discouraged because you cannot do what you want, focus your attention on the possibilities ahead. Your positive attitude can go a long way toward making you happier today while also creating opportunities for tomorrow."
virgo,2010-08-16,"Financial restraints could send you into a tailspin today, but money isn't the real issue. Your discouragement may be tied to feelings of low self-esteem and a lack of cash just exacerbates the issue. Although it's not likely that you'll be bailed out by a government plan, a friend might come to the rescue. Just remember that there is a price to be paid for someone else's involvement."
libra,2010-08-16,"You are resigned to doing the right thing now that Saturn is in your 1st House of Self. However, the opposition from indulgent Jupiter in your 7th House of Others may bring an irresponsible person into your life who encourages you to leave your current obligations in order to have a good time. Fortunately, with a bit of common sense and self-restraint, you should be able to do both."
scorpio,2010-08-16,"It's easy for you to get bent out of shape today because the Scorpio Moon forms uncomfortable squares to the Sun and Neptune. You can easily misjudge how long it will take to complete a job, leaving you with less downtime than you prefer. Inflating other people's expectations just because you want them to be happy isn't a smart strategy. Instead of making commitments that are difficult to keep, promise less while delivering more."
sagittarius,2010-08-16,"You are inspired to show others how creative you are today, whether you are making something for yourself, partaking in a competitive sport or managing the playful activities of kids. Unfortunately, the good times are a bit more elusive than you may realize. Social plans may fall apart when others have different priorities than yours. Forget about trying to coordinate everyone else; find something enjoyable that you can do on your own."
capricorn,2010-08-16,"You want to be amongst your friends now so you can share your ideas for the future. But they may not be as interested in hearing what you want to do as you are in telling them. Instead of forcing your agenda on others, be prepared to meet them halfway. The goals you set today will still be there tomorrow; in the meantime, flexibility is your key to happiness."
aquarius,2010-08-16,"You aren't interested in flying by the seat of your pants now. You want a concrete plan with a workable timeline so you know where you are going and when you will arrive. Unfortunately, your planning may be so rigid that you don't leave enough time to adapt to last minute changes. Opening up your schedule by cutting back on your appointments or increasing the amount of time between them will build more stability into the day."
pisces,2010-08-16,"Although it's not a smart idea to just disregard your budget, you might be able to justify spending more than you planned in order to purchase something that you really want. Still, you can demonstrate your responsibility by asking for financial advice from a trustworthy friend. But you'll need to share more personal information than you expect, which can leave you feeling vulnerable. And you'll need to actually listen to what is said, or the whole exercise will have been for naught."
aries,2010-08-17,"Even with all your grand visions of amazing adventures, the routine drudgery of work calls today and you have no choice but to answer. Although you may be sorely tempted to attempt a getaway, it's not a very smart strategy. Forget about all your big ideas and just do what is expected of you now. Leave the great escape for some other day. You will have something to celebrate once the job is done."
taurus,2010-08-17,"A steady approach won't necessarily lead to success because you may not have the patience needed to pull it off today. Naturally, you want to be seen as reliable, yet you're still willing to try something new, even if it means putting your reputation at risk. Taking a small chance is probably a good idea as long as you don't gamble with more than you're willing to lose."
gemini,2010-08-17,"People could tell you tall tales and you might believe them today, so make sure to verify everything you hear. Take the time to discover how reality differs from what others are saying to you now. You might have to listen in between the spoken words so you don't miss what's not being said. It's best to know the shortcomings of a plan before you endorse it. Remember, even when something sounds really good, there are still two sides to the story."
cancer,2010-08-17,"The Moon's entry to your 6th House of Routine today can make you want to rebel against doing your job the same way you do it every other day. You're eager to try something new, but it's hard to know the best method unless you try a few of them out. Ask your co-workers for their input because someone else will see your work from a different perspective. Even a small procedural change could be enough to increase your efficiency and bring you satisfaction."
leo,2010-08-17,"Obstacles that appear in your immediate surroundings seem to follow you around, even when you're doing everything just right. But don't admit defeat, for your current problems will be easily overcome if you face them with confidence. Don't bury unresolved issues from your past; embrace your shortcomings by accepting where you are in life. You cannot change the current situation by reinventing your history. Instead, create your future."
virgo,2010-08-17,"Your life may be moving too fast these days, yet you truly have the power to slow it down. But this isn't about modifying your calendar or canceling activities that are already on your schedule. Rather, it's about decreasing the noise in your life by reducing the internal stress. A firm commitment to meditate or do yoga for a few minutes every day would be enough to see for yourself what is possible."
libra,2010-08-17,You can mislead yourself today by acting on your hopes instead of on what's actually happening. You can further mix up fantasy with reality by trying to convince others to believe in nearly everything that seems real to you. The planets pack a powerful combination punch now that isn't easy to handle. A relationship that is based on blind optimism will likely fall apart quickly. Set your dreams aside and stick strictly to the facts.
scorpio,2010-08-17,You know what needs to be done but don't want to exhaust yourself doing things for everyone else today. Meeting your obligations can be draining because you don't want to waste your time on anything that's not that important to you. Conserve your energy to be with a special someone or just to enjoy some downtime by yourself.
sagittarius,2010-08-17,"Sharing your emotions indiscriminately today can be rather exhausting, but it also can create moments of intimacy as you widen your social sphere of influence. You might prefer being less emotional now, talking about ideas and philosophies instead of your changing moods. But it's healthy to express what's in your heart, even if you aren't exactly sure why you're doing it."
capricorn,2010-08-17,"Keeping your feelings to yourself can seem like a sensible thing to do today, especially if they are standing in your way of being effective. But you are happier and even more productive at work when you don't suppress your emotions. Nevertheless, it isn't a good idea to overwhelm your associates with your inner process. Don't be afraid to tell them the truth, but do it on a need-to-know basis so there aren't any regrets later on."
aquarius,2010-08-17,"The optimistic Sagittarius Moon in your 11th House of Networking encourages you to invite some friends over for a social gathering. However, it might not be wise to call everyone you know, for they all might show up, transforming your idea for a little get-together into a major event. Remember, if you choose to go forward with your party idea, make sure to give yourself enough time before for planning and after for recovery."
pisces,2010-08-17,"You want to take care of everyone at work now that the Moon is in your 10th House of Public Responsibility. You have a high level of dedication and are willing to be an integral part of a team. Unfortunately, there's so much going on in your private life today that relationships can be quite demanding. Remember, you don't need to choose between the personal and business dimensions of your life. You can sustain both worlds if you simply put your mind and heart to it."
aries,2010-08-18,"You may be feeling upbeat today, but your newly discovered optimism could make you a little too much to handle. Others may tire of hearing your stories about how great your life is going. Temper your excitement with a strong dose of compassion for everyone else. Toning down your enthusiasm just a notch creates an environment for more balanced relationships."
taurus,2010-08-18,"You are not shy about wanting to deepen the level of emotional disclosure with a very close friend or intimate partner today. Although your straightforward approach may startle others, they might be more open to your ideas once they adjust to your style of direct communication. Being aware of someone else's boundaries doesn't come easily to you now, but helps to build trust in the relationship."
gemini,2010-08-18,"Today's Moon in your 7th House of Relationships can shift the energy away from your needs and toward those around you, making you more attentive to what others are thinking. You may not be so quick to go off on your own now, for the idea of working with a buddy sounds quite appealing. Keep in mind that your discrimination skills may be lagging, so exercise extra caution when choosing your partner."
cancer,2010-08-18,"It's great to think that you can power your way through your chores today and have enough time left over to unwind. Unfortunately, you could underestimate how long it will take to accomplish your work. Make certain that you allow extra time, for if you leave a task unfinished, you may not be able to relax, knowing there is still more to do."
leo,2010-08-18,"You may be all fired up to have fun today, even if you haven't met your obligations. But unfulfilled responsibilities need not prevent you from having a good time. You might be so excited that you're prepared to do whatever is necessary to enjoy yourself. If you must leave some chores unfinished, at least let others know that you are cutting out early."
virgo,2010-08-18,"If you have been working too hard, now it's time to start claiming your slice of the fun. But the Moon is in your 4th House of Home and Family, suggesting it might be nice to have a short ""staycation"" instead of going out of town. You may even end up getting your kicks today by undertaking a simple domestic project or, perhaps, by inviting a friend over to share some quality conversation."
libra,2010-08-18,"You have a difficult time controlling your restlessness today as the outgoing Sagittarius Moon visits your 3rd House of Short Trips. You might even make an extra run to the store or head out to the mall just to get out of the house. Don't be too self-critical now if you haven't made much progress by the end of the day. If you can't concentrate, it's probably smart to just call it quits and start again tomorrow."
scorpio,2010-08-18,"You could be riding high today and feeling good enough to spend a bit of money on something special. You may have grown more optimistic about your income potential, enabling you to justify a luxury purchase. Nevertheless, it's smarter to wait and see how you're feeling in a few days before making a large expenditure that you might regret."
sagittarius,2010-08-18,"The Moon is in your sign all day today, putting you in touch with your own vulnerability. Nevertheless, you're still more than likely to take a risk and share your feelings with someone special. But just telling others about your needs or fears is only part of the equation. Keep in mind that real intimacy is not one-sided, so make sure to leave room for the other person to share their heart, too."
capricorn,2010-08-18,"Keeping your optimism to yourself doesn't usually make sense, and yet it may be socially savvy for you to do that now. You might think that your overconfidence could offend someone and you want to avoid that today as you rally support for an idea of yours. Thankfully, your diplomacy skills are currently polished enough to take you far if you can trust your instincts and do whatever you believe is best."
aquarius,2010-08-18,"The Moon in your 11th House of Groups prods you to surround yourself with friends and associates. It can, at best, create just the kind of congenial atmosphere you crave. Your dreams are vivid now and it's exciting to share them with like-minded individuals. A party would be a perfect place to find the camaraderie you want, but a smaller and more intimate gathering could work just as well."
pisces,2010-08-18,"Defending your political or social beliefs can be quite empowering today, whether it's at work, home or in your community. Your unique perspective can be inspiring to others now, so there's no need to hold back when sharing your ideas about the future. But remember, taking care of business in the present moment is more important than daydreaming about unrealistic possibilities. Seize the day by being the creative leader that others want to follow."
aries,2010-08-19,"You may be living a split life today. On one hand your imagination is fired up, encouraging you to take a creative risk. Your confidence is high and you are ready to go for it. But your dilemma is that the pressure is on at work and anything you do that could possibly detract from productivity is not a smart idea. Make responsible choices, even if you feel like your inner child wants to come out and play."
taurus,2010-08-19,"You could lose your temper today if someone doesn't deliver on what was promised. You want to be fair-minded and give others the same freedom that you want yourself, but work-related pressures limit your options, making you dependent on the performance of your co-workers. Still, offering positive support is a smarter strategy than succumbing to your fears and expressing negativity."
gemini,2010-08-19,"You may not feel very lighthearted today because you have so much on your mind. You probably realize how important it is to filter out the unnecessary distractions so you can focus on what must be done right now, but taking a break sounds like a welcome relief. There's nothing wrong with a bit of healthy escape as long as you don't overdo it. Balancing work with play will help you be more productive."
cancer,2010-08-19,"You will have an opportunity to demonstrate how well you can listen if someone comes to you today with an intense story. But providing an ear and a shoulder to lean on may not be sufficient. Instead of being a sponge and taking it all in, you'll be more helpful by being a mirror and reflecting back what you see and hear. Instead of keeping others at a distance, nurture them with your kindness and love."
leo,2010-08-19,"If you work hard and take care of all your assignments and chores, you should have enough time left over today to pursue more creative interests. But if you're going to tap into your artistic side now, it would be wise to set productivity aside and just express yourself for the sheer enjoyment of it. If your process leads to something useful, consider it a bonus."
virgo,2010-08-19,"Today could be one of those days when everything you do turns out differently than you expected. But it's not about being surprised; it's more about seeing where your creativity takes you and then deciding what's of value and what's not. Cut yourself enough slack so you can feel good about your current work, even if you don't know yet how it may pay off in the future."
libra,2010-08-19,"You may think that you have a sensible plan for the day, but you could get sidetracked by a family issue along the way. The responsible Capricorn Moon squares Saturn in your sign, requiring you to make a decision -- even if you aren't ready to commit to one side or the other. Although you lack clarity, go ahead and choose if you must; you can always reconsider later if your perspective changes."
scorpio,2010-08-19,"The Moon's conjunction with your key planet Pluto can intensify your feelings in a way that strains your interactions with those around you today. But this isn't about hiding your emotions; instead, frame your words so that others aren't scared off. If someone shuts down before hearing your conclusions, your message will be lost before it's even delivered."
sagittarius,2010-08-19,"You may have to handle a financial problem with the sobering Capricorn Moon in your 2nd House of Money Matters today. It may be as simple as paying an overdue bill, but it could also raise deeper concerns about your cash flow that point to a precarious situation in the future. Don't try to fool yourself by thinking that everything will just take care of itself. Your involvement now can prevent bigger headaches later on."
capricorn,2010-08-19,"If you have been sitting on the fence, the Moon's return to your ambitious sign today can reawaken a passion and motivate you to swing into action. Although you'll have a better chance to succeed if you first consider all your options and then make a plan, you might not have enough time for such a rational approach. Nevertheless, staying focused on your final destination should be enough to keep you on track now."
aquarius,2010-08-19,"You may have stepped into the middle of a complex set of dynamics and you cannot avoid getting involved. However, you aren't ready to share your perspective yet because you don't want to be unduly influenced by other people's opinions while you're still gathering information. Besides, whatever you do at this point could be misinterpreted, so it's smarter to wait a few more days before letting others know what you're thinking."
pisces,2010-08-19,"You have a good feeling about your current involvement with a team of co-workers or a group of friends, but there may be more going on than meets the eye. Unfortunately, you could become discouraged today if your interactions with others don't live up to your high ideals. Although you wish you didn't have to settle for less, relaxing your expectations just a little can help everything to flow better now."
aries,2010-08-20,"Like the mythic Narcissus, you could fall in love with your own shadow today. The alignment of your key planet Mars and sweet Venus amps up your passions and enables you to sweep someone off his or her feet. Although this could lead to a lovely experience, make certain that you really mean what you say or your charming words could get you into more trouble than it's worth."
taurus,2010-08-20,"You may be extra careful about doing all the right things today, yet somehow might still mess up if someone misinterprets your actions. Even if you are only trying to be nice, it's difficult for others to believe that you don't want something back in return. However, your kindness now can truly be an altruistic act of service. It's best to be very clear about your motives in order to help minimize any misinterpretation of your good deeds."
gemini,2010-08-20,"You may think that today is just another day, but your key planet Mercury is up to mischief as it suspends movement to turn retrograde. Others may be surprised if you change your tune in the middle of a song, but they also could be quite amused with your current antics. Be very careful about what you ask for because you just might get it."
cancer,2010-08-20,"Although you may be feeling quite upbeat about your present circumstances, it's possible that you are fooling yourself. Naturally, it's useful to see both sides of an issue, yet your current tendency is to gloss over anything that may prove to be difficult. Unfortunately, denial will only act as a magnet, pulling in the very thing you are trying to avoid. Keep in mind that you don't need to embrace the shadows, but talking about your fears is the best way to dissipate them."
leo,2010-08-20,"It's nearly impossible for you to see others in their true light, for illusory Neptune in your 7th House of Partners is being opposed by the Sun in your sign. You could be overly self-critical today while simultaneously letting another person off the hook. But it may be healthier now to be tough on someone else and forgive yourself, as long as you are trying to do the best you can in the present moment."
virgo,2010-08-20,"Although you may believe that your life is in good order, your key planet, Mercury, turns tail in your sign today, possibly messing with your plans. The more you resist the current changes, the greater they are likely to be. Don't pretend that everything is fine if it is not. Just remember that your reality filter isn't functioning up to snuff now, so ask others for help in keeping your feet firmly on the ground."
libra,2010-08-20,"Your key planet Venus is in your gracious sign, but is now powered by a conjunction with feisty Mars. It may be challenging to go after something or someone you want today because you might come across more aggressive than you wish. Your friend might not appreciate your direct approach, which could prompt your quick retreat. Avoiding extremes is wise; it is best if you neither push too hard nor withdraw too fast."
scorpio,2010-08-20,"Others could see you in a better light than you see yourself now with the Sun illuminating your 10th House of Status. But regardless of what you're experiencing, you aren't likely to publicly reveal what's going on as Mercury turns retrograde in your 11th House of Community. Keeping things to yourself is fine, but there's no reason for you to isolate yourself from those who love you and would support you no matter what."
sagittarius,2010-08-20,"You may have inflated expectations around a creative project or a romantic interest. The best way to avoid disappointment is to share your thoughts, hopes and plans with a trusted friend. It may take a while for others to truly understand what you are going through now, but the process will be well worth it. The more you share, the clearer you become, which can help minimize the stress of a letdown later on."
capricorn,2010-08-20,"It's hard to hide your feelings with the Moon in your sign. Unfortunately, it's also challenging to express your emotions verbally with loquacious Mercury holding still in your 9th House of Big Ideas. Your words can lead others around in circles today because your desires keep changing throughout the day. Ultimately, it's wise to acknowledge your fluctuating moods before you say anything about what you want. No one will be hurt later on if everyone knows that you haven't made up your mind yet."
aquarius,2010-08-20,"The Moon in your 12th House of Privacy may tempt you to keep one too many secrets today. Withholding your feelings can stir up apprehension in others, pulling a relationship out of balance. Unfortunately, your secrecy could send the wrong message. Paradoxically, instead of projecting your uncertainty or vulnerability, you might actually appear overly confident -- which could scare someone away. Being open about your current fears can be more of an invitation than you realize."
pisces,2010-08-20,"Your key planet Neptune is in a tug-of-war with the willful Sun in your 6th House of Self-Improvement. Your fantasies may be more powerful now than your grasp on reality. You cannot force positive changes today; instead, you must be more subtle and dream your way toward your goals. Remember, if you can imagine it, then it can happen."
aries,2010-08-21,"Unrealistic fantasies must be set aside and replaced by the facts as you now know them. Naturally, your imagination is still a useful tool for conjuring up your future, but you must ground your dreams in the simple truth of what you know in order to make them come real. Concentrating your thoughts on what's most important today may not be fun, but it will lead you to the success you seek."
taurus,2010-08-21,"You are very aware of the difference between how things are in your life and how you want them to be. Unfortunately, there are certain situations that have come to a turning point and it seems they will play through the same way, no matter what you do or don't do. Nevertheless, this isn't time to hold back the expression of your true intentions. Even if you don't change what's happening right now, your actions can impact the future as it continues to unfold."
gemini,2010-08-21,"You know that there's still good times to be had, but they might seem a bit distant today and seeking fun in the present moment might create more stress than anything else. One of the lessons you can learn is how balancing your playful nature with the more serious side of life can enrich your experiences. Instead of taking the easy way out, explore the unknown by digging deep right where you are now."
cancer,2010-08-21,"You are no stranger to the hidden realms of unexpressed feelings. Now, however, you have an opportunity to confront something from your past, bring it into the present moment and free yourself from its gravity. This could involve sharing an emotionally intense experience from your past with someone you trust, enabling you to reach a new level of closeness. But don't push too hard; bring up the subject and let the conversation take its own course."
leo,2010-08-21,"The Sun is nearing the end of its yearly visit to your sign, but must pass opposite wounded Chiron the Healer today, reawakening your unresolved feelings about a recent emotional hurt. But this transit isn't meant to put you into a negative frame of mind. Rather, this is an opportunity for you to process forgiveness that can free you from self-limiting judgments you have placed upon others and yourself."
virgo,2010-08-21,"You are convinced that taking yourself seriously now will help you make the right decisions, but you could be so focused on the facts that you miss something else that's even more important. Sometimes, a leap of faith can make all the difference in the world. If there's something that you're thinking about leaving behind, set the facts and figures aside long enough to check in with your heart. Don't discount the power of your own intuition."
libra,2010-08-21,"You might have believed that you had everything under control, but the messages you're receiving from deep within your subconscious can indicate that something else is going on. It's one thing to filter out your own mental noise in order to fully show up in the present moment. But buried desires don't necessarily go away and now they may be coming back to remind you of what you truly want. Embrace your unfulfilled  dreams, even if you cannot manifest them at this time."
scorpio,2010-08-21,"You have as much, maybe more, ability than anyone to endure hardships along the way to getting what you want. Now, when taskmaster Saturn squares your key planet Pluto, you may have to grit your teeth, bury your uncertainties and push through with what you know you must do. But don't waste any energy on blaming others or yourself. Even if you are short on money or time, your intense focus can turn this into a highly productive time that will earn you what you seek."
sagittarius,2010-08-21,"Your friends and family may not appear to appreciate you as much as you wish, especially if they are expecting you to be overly optimistic. Unfortunately, you may not be very happy-go-lucky today, especially if only to please someone else. Give yourself permission to be as serious as you feel as you consider the significant issues about your future that you now must handle."
capricorn,2010-08-21,"It's especially tough on you when you're unable to rely on those same things that were built to provide enduring security. You may revisit your recent doubts about your current life direction as your key planet Saturn squares transformative Pluto in your sign. But there's no room now for fear of the unknown. Obviously, you cannot see what's ahead, yet a bold and imaginative vision of your future is in order as long as you are willing to work hard to achieve your goals."
aquarius,2010-08-21,"Although fantasyland may seem like an excellent destination point today, the weight of your current responsibilities won't let you stray too far from reality. Acknowledge the power of your own inner world, for you won't be able to do an end run around your unconscious desires, compulsions and fears. Instead of riding the waves of your emotions, use your reasoning power to figure out a long-term plan that can bring you the satisfaction you seek."
pisces,2010-08-21,"It can be difficult for you to know what to do today if you're unwilling to face the facts. Your feelings are warping your perspective, so it's a good idea to acknowledge your emotions prior to attending to the real issues. And even if you put off an important decision for a while, don't try to avoid the obvious fork in the road that will force you to choose which path to take."
aries,2010-08-22,"You might think that you're going to take the day off, but you could find it difficult to relax because it feels as if you're running out of time. Nevertheless, you still believe that you have earned some downtime and may build resentment toward those who seem to push you toward doing more. Be careful, for your anger isn't created by anyone other than yourself. Changing your attitude can improve your day almost immediately."
taurus,2010-08-22,"An unusual acquaintance can lure you to the edge by simply showing you an unfamiliar path today. You are excited about exploring new territory, so you may be eager to take the next step. Unfortunately, moving forward can be more complicated than doing nothing at all. Remember, you can find ways to enjoy yourself without avoiding your obligations."
gemini,2010-08-22,"You have an unconventional leadership style that can include taking charge suddenly today without considering other people's feelings. Luckily, your peers may be looking to you for guidance while you want everyone to just take personal responsibility. No matter what, this is your chance to march in the front of the parade instead of cheering from the sidelines."
cancer,2010-08-22,"Your common sense keeps you from going off the deep end today, especially because you can use your intuition to see what's around the next corner. But others might not be attracted to your plan now because they don't trust the hunches that you receive. Just remember that you can still hold on to your dreams, even if you cannot get the support that you want."
leo,2010-08-22,"It may be difficult for you to express your changing perspective today because it's like trying to hit a moving target. Something or someone very dear to you can become a trap that leads your idealistic hopes so far astray that it's challenging to find your way back. Once again it feels as if time is running out, yet acting immediately is a smarter strategy than waiting any longer."
virgo,2010-08-22,"Your friends and acquaintances seem to have a few surprises up their collective sleeves, yet it's crucial that you take everything in stride. Keep calm, even if your stability is being tested and remember that, ultimately, change isn't as problematic as your fear of change. However, it's not wise to totally relinquish control now, although employing some flexibility and faith will surely help."
libra,2010-08-22,"You might feel like a rebel with a cause as you seek ways to burn off your excess energy today. You may be running on adrenaline, but sooner or later you will still need to give an extra push so that others will listen to what you are saying. Don't count on anyone showing up to help you through this hectic phase; instead of waiting to be bailed out, just do it yourself."
scorpio,2010-08-22,"You may attempt to stay even-tempered today, but a simple misunderstanding between friends could heat up a bit of emotional trouble. Your current need for independence is not likely from an avoidance of intimacy. Consider how you may be posing a threat to your partner and what you can do to strike a healthy balance between a deepening connection and detachment."
sagittarius,2010-08-22,"Transitions aren't easy and your personal life may be thrown for a loop, especially if a new scene is emerging before the old one has faded away. A complicated issue about your emotional security can pop into consciousness now and require you to handle it, even if it means that you drop something else. But don't force your solution on others because they need to decide for themselves."
capricorn,2010-08-22,"You may attempt to stick to your preconceived schedule today, but the more you try to hold it together, the less likely you'll stay in control. It's much better now if you can be fluid, making decisions throughout the day instead of being a slave to the clock. Although your self-esteem can be severely tested, you should be able to accomplish a lot more if you are a bit less ambitious."
aquarius,2010-08-22,"The Moon's return to your sign enables you to shift your perspective as rapidly as needed. But this ""Aha!"" experience doesn't arrive out of the blue. You have thought long and hard about your life's purpose and when you learn something new, you can quickly integrate it into your core beliefs. Even if you feel pressured to take your current ideas public, remember to follow your own instincts first."
pisces,2010-08-22,"Someone may accuse you of being immature or irresponsible today, but neither of these labels actually fits. Although you may be quite serious about the decisions ahead, others could read you entirely wrong. It would be a mistake to get into an open conflict, for arguing will only create more polarization. Keep your thoughts to yourself, for your perspective will likely change once again."
aries,2010-08-23,"Love continues to play strongly as sweet Venus begins to separate herself from macho Mars. They met up recently in your 7th House of Partnerships, helping you to be more creative when working closely with others. Don't be afraid while bouncing original ideas off someone else in a fun-filled manner. Paradoxically, a playful attitude enables you to work more efficiently. However, even if you're not interested in developing intimacy, it's enough to know it's within reach when you want it."
taurus,2010-08-23,"Your ruling planet Venus received a shot of adrenaline from red-hot Mars just a couple of days ago. Although you may be feeling very optimistic about the changes you're going through, this transit can increase the heat under the collar. The best way to stay in touch with all that's happening now is to channel your excess energy into a rigorous exercise program, get optimum nutrition and plenty of sleep."
gemini,2010-08-23,"If you have been obsessing over someone you love recently, now you have an excellent shot at receiving what you want. Unfortunately, an upbeat day won't necessarily glue a long-term relationship back together, but it still could be a sensual surprise that you remember for a long time to come. Don't push your luck; it's crucial that you know when to stop."
cancer,2010-08-23,"You may be tiring of your role as a mediator and wonder how long you'll be able to keep it up. You might prefer to step back from the action because you don't how much you should get involved. This isn't about questioning your potential; instead, stay current on the information you gather and concentrate on what you know. You can make the biggest difference by being attentive to everyone's concerns without choosing sides."
leo,2010-08-23,"Although you have been working harder than usual, you cannot seem to get ahead. Don't worry too much about this predicament for your luck is likely to change, especially if you don't give up too soon. Today, your positive attitude can be enough to turn things around for you, but quitting prematurely will surely prevent you from reaching your goals."
virgo,2010-08-23,"If you are experiencing financial stress, now is the time for you to begin working your way out of it. The recent Venus-Mars conjunction in your 2nd House of Income indicates your ability to combine originality with good judgment to increase your income and feel better about your situation. Keep in mind that it could take a few days for your current actions to have any significant impact."
libra,2010-08-23,"Your lovely key planet Venus is in your sign now, reminding you of what you want in no uncertain terms. The close presence of courageous Mars adds arrogance to your sense of self-confidence. But conveying your agenda can be tricky because you could come across sounding cocky. Use a bit of your famous Libra sweetness to soften your sharp edges, so you can win over your audience."
scorpio,2010-08-23,"Your traditional planetary ruler, Mars, is a kinder and gentler planet since graceful Venus joined it a couple of days ago in your 12th House of Spiritual Practice. Compassion comes easier to you now, but this isn't just a lofty concept. You are ready to put your feelings into action by trying to help anyone who is less fortunate than you are and who could benefit from a caring friend."
sagittarius,2010-08-23,You usually get along well with others and make friends easily; your social charm comes even more naturally today. You are the life of a party and your easygoing attitude can be contagious. But this isn't only about pleasure as you turn your inspirational attitude toward community issues or politics. Don't hesitate to get involved for you have a lot to offer.
capricorn,2010-08-23,"You have your sights set on long-term goals now and you should be able to make a lot of progress if you don't expect too much, too fast. Your 10th House of Status is amped up by energetic Mars, yet you can still get away with being a bit too pushy. No one seems to mind your straightforward manner today as long as you also take the necessary time to listen to what others have to say, too."
aquarius,2010-08-23,"You are ready to let someone know how you are feeling today. The Moon's visit to your sign now is an indication that your emotions are highly charged. Meanwhile Venus and Mars, the cosmic lovers, are kissing in your 9th House of Big Ideas. Give yourself permission to dream about your ideal romance and then move gently yet firmly in that direction."
pisces,2010-08-23,"Your romantic fantasies are beginning to settle down today so you can focus on the real issues that are raised when you let yourself get close to someone. But it's no use believing that your dreams will morph into reality, for that may be too large of an order. Be methodical now and your chances of getting what you want should continue to improve."
aries,2010-08-24,"Today's Full Moon occurs in your 12th House of Privacy sending mixed messages and bringing awareness as it shines light into your subconscious mind. You may promise a co-worker that you'll keep a secret, but your intentions are better than your follow-through as flamboyant Jupiter in your sign runs through some tricky territory now. However, sharing what you know could be smarter than anyone currently realizes."
taurus,2010-08-24,"The Full Moon in your 11th House of Social Networking lures you away from your tunnel vision to get a glimpse of the outside world. And although you are normally happy to remain exactly where you are, today you're just as eager to see where things could lead. Take a chance and reach farther than you have in the past. The future is waiting for you if you are ready for it."
gemini,2010-08-24,"Today's psychic Pisces Full Moon illuminates your 10th House of Professional Life, presenting you with many options you hadn't previously noticed. Now, however, the problem flips to the other side as you try to narrow the field of contenders. Several possibilities look so good that you can already see things happening in your imagination. Nevertheless, don't count your chickens before they hatch."
cancer,2010-08-24,"The emotional Pisces Moon shining in your 9th House of Philosophy can reflect your eagerness to justify how you feel by talking about your high ideals. But all the flowery language in the world won't pull you off track if an idea doesn't make practical sense, too. Remember, you'll be fine as long as you keep bringing your conceptual ideas back down to earth."
leo,2010-08-24,"Working with others now can complicate things because there are fundamental differences between your needs and those of a partner. You might even try to avoid an emotionally tense discussion that touches your core beliefs, but evasive action won't sustain you for very long. Instead of running from the truth, stop for a moment and embrace it."
virgo,2010-08-24,"Today's imaginative Pisces Full Moon opposes your Sun in no-nonsense Virgo. You know better than to immediately choose one side in an argument just because you have the facts in front of you. Unfortunately, there's more to the current issue than simply playing by the rules, since you may need to make a few allowances for what isn't yet apparent."
libra,2010-08-24,"It's difficult for you to put your tools away, but they may not be as useful as you think. Consider that your imagination will take you farther now than executing your plan according to the book, since the rules may need to be bent for you to succeed. If you get a strong hunch about what to do next, stop asking questions and just do it."
scorpio,2010-08-24,"If you cannot justify taking a substantial amount of time off from work now, then at least try to be more creative when you're on the job. But it's pointless to be following a previously created recipe for success or living your daily life by using someone else's map. Instead, utilize the playful 5th House Full Moon to add spontaneity back into your daily life."
sagittarius,2010-08-24,"Today's Full Moon in your 4th House of Domestic Conditions suggests that you don't know as much as you think about what's happening on the home front. You may be fooling yourself by believing that everyone is happy when, in fact, someone close to you is working hard to cover up his or her insecurities. Although you think it's best to pretend that you don't notice, you won't get away with ignoring the truth for long."
capricorn,2010-08-24,"You may feel unsettled today because you normally prefer to have your feet firmly planted on the ground, know exactly where you are standing, and be in total charge of where you are going. But the confusing Pisces Full Moon makes it hard for you to see the map and to discern navigational markers in the landscape. Nevertheless, trusting the forces of the universe is a wise idea. There's no need to struggle now. Give up the reins of control, for you'll only be able to hold on for so long."
aquarius,2010-08-24,"Today's imaginative Pisces Full Moon in your 2nd House of Finance might make it difficult for you to get a real handle on your money situation, but you should be able to make progress if you have the right people assisting you. If you don't have good answers now, then don't be afraid to lean on a trustworthy friend or find a professional adviser to set you straight."
pisces,2010-08-24,"The Full Moon is in your sign today, turning up the volume on your fantasies and challenging you to be objective in spite of your strong feelings. The Sun's aspect to confident Jupiter can make it even harder to maintain a healthy perspective on your relationships. Instead of stressing about making any decisions now, just put them off for a day or two until you have regained clarity."
aries,2010-08-25,"You may feel strongly about doing what's right at work today and finishing what you start, yet you become even more serious as the day continues to unfold. The pressure of understanding what needs to be done reaches a threshold and you have no other option but to take care of unfinished business. Once you get going, it's not necessary to work fast; keeping up a steady pace is all that's required."
taurus,2010-08-25,"Romantic issues that might usually upset you can be taken in stride today because you believe that you can safely say what's on your mind. You might even think that no one is listening carefully to your words. Don't expend extra energy on an emotional outbreak when an even-keeled, rational discussion is more effective and takes less out of everyone involved."
gemini,2010-08-25,"You are totally confident that you can get your ideas across now since you expect that others will take notice of your charisma. Although you have enough energy to swing into action without making a plan, this cavalier attitude clashes with a more contemplative side of your personality. You don't need to ignore your careful analysis, for it can help you hit your target with even more accuracy."
cancer,2010-08-25,"Your brain may win out over your heart today in an internal battle between logic and emotions. But it's not a good idea to react to a situation before you allow sufficient time to process your feelings. It is fully acceptable to do something that overrides a strong attraction now, but don't just shut down prematurely out of fear."
leo,2010-08-25,"It may feel as if you have reached the end of the road, and that summer is already over, even though it's not. Nevertheless, your anticipation of the unknown heightens your sense of urgency today. Remember, there's no need to squeeze too much into one day, for there will be plenty of time for fun during the busier days ahead."
virgo,2010-08-25,"Your key planet Mercury leads you into discussions that have no sensible outcome today. It is opposed by the sensitive Pisces Moon, which can make your words sound very emotional even if that's not how you feel. Although you may attempt to keep your vulnerability a secret for now, the truth will probably leak out in the next few days, anyhow."
libra,2010-08-25,"Although you want to rely on others now, everyone seems to be on the edge of change and therefore somewhat unreliable. Meanwhile, you feel as if you are able to keep your life balanced. However, you may be operating under an illusion based upon what you don't want to know. Keep in mind that it is easier to just take care of a problem by responding quickly than it is to wait and see what will happen next if you leave things alone."
scorpio,2010-08-25,"Don't stop now just because your work is piling up and you are feeling overwhelmed. Have faith; you can get through all your assignments if you just stay focused on what's important. No doubt, there are all kinds of distractions that can pull you from your mundane commitments, but you'll need to set them aside for a while. Fortunately, the Sun's trine to your key planet Pluto gives you the ability to maintain your concentration so you can reach your targeted destination."
sagittarius,2010-08-25,"You may be overly enthusiastic today and ready to take on your commitments with an ""I can do it!"" attitude, but optimism alone isn't enough. You must clearly demonstrate that you are prepared before you ask others to accept you as their leader. Don't try to fake authority; you won't be successful if you do."
capricorn,2010-08-25,You may be feeling a bit of anxiety today that's coming from all the uncontrollable energy floating around. But this isn't necessarily anything bad; it's just that you aren't comfortable when you can feel that something's out of your control -- and there is too much happening now for you to find peace of mind. You're better off if you let go and enjoy the ride while it lasts.
aquarius,2010-08-25,"If there are any lingering questions from a close friend or partner, respond to them immediately because your window of opportunity is shutting quickly. Today is the last day of the Sun's yearly visit to your 7th House of Others, so bring any concerns you still have out in the open while you can. Once all your cards are on the table, it will be much easier to talk about what is wrong and discuss some possible solutions."
pisces,2010-08-25,"The Sun in your 7th House of Partners is harmonizing with profound Pluto in your 11th House of Friends. Say what's on your mind, for your words now carry the conviction of your beliefs. You might be quite fired up about a relationship issue and, thankfully, you are able to make a lot of sense when you talk. Aim your thoughts carefully and don't stray from your truth."
aries,2010-08-26,"If you have been trying to learn the truth, barriers fall today, allowing the information you've been seeking to reach you. Fortunately, you finally understand what's really happening. Unfortunately, you may learn a lot more than you want to know. It may be difficult at first to adjust your perspective but you'll be better equipped to make decisions about the future when you have all the facts at your disposal."
taurus,2010-08-26,Your friends may catch you off guard today as the Moon in your 11th House of Pals joins up with unexpected Uranus. Even the most stable plans are now likely to change. Don't attempt to resist the natural flow of events; unnecessary rigidity can create more problems. Remaining flexible is your simplest path to happiness at this time.
gemini,2010-08-26,"A sudden change in the emotional climate at work could free you up to pursue something of long-term interest. But don't worry if everything you do these days seems more like a diversion, for even a casual fascination could grow into a new career path over time. Keep in mind that it isn't necessary to know all the details of a new venture yet. Start off by following your fancy without worrying about the results."
cancer,2010-08-26,"You could learn something now that makes you reconsider your position about an important religious or political issue. Even if you are ambivalent, go ahead and make a choice anyway. Although the outcome of this period could impact the flow of your life in years to come, today's decision may not ultimately be the one that matters, for you might change your mind again before everything is set in stone."
leo,2010-08-26,"The Pisces Moon in your 8th House of Shared Resources places unexpected stress on your finances now. If you have any possessions or investments that involve others, attempting to resolve the issues could become quite complex. Taking a risk today could actually pay off for you and your partners if you have sufficient patience and fortitude."
virgo,2010-08-26,"Someone that you normally lean on may not be very trustworthy today, making it better to simply take care of everything yourself. If you are relying on others, don't worry if they don't come through for you now. Rather than wasting time blaming anyone else, focus your attention on what you can do to change things, instead."
libra,2010-08-26,"The Moon joins unconventional Uranus in your 6th House of Details, exposing the shortcomings of doing your work the same old way. Don't be afraid to experiment now and try a radical new approach to a routine task that has become monotonous. Fortunately, a different way of doing the same old thing can shake up the energy, increase your efficiency and enable you to finish faster than before."
scorpio,2010-08-26,"You are on the lookout for some playful competition today and, with a little bit of luck, you should be able to find it. Trying your hand as a teacher or a coach makes sense now, but your need for fun could take other forms, too. Whatever activity might put a smile on your face is worth pursuing at this time. Don't waste time explaining what you're doing; instead, just do it."
sagittarius,2010-08-26,"A minor upset in the home could draw your attention away from your job. But unfortunately, pressure at work may prevent you from taking time off to attend to your personal business. The Moon in your 4th House of Security can stir issues about your own basic foundations. Once you are attuned to your immediate environment, everything else will be easier to change."
capricorn,2010-08-26,"Today's spacey Pisces Moon falls in your 3rd House of Immediate Environment, temporarily suggesting that your life can be quite hectic now. Normally you don't like to have too much going on, and you might be ready to pull the plug and make the excess noise disappear. Be careful; you can easily eliminate an activity or two but if you attempt to avoid important interactions, they will become more difficult later on."
aquarius,2010-08-26,"Your 2nd House of Net Worth is active today, especially when the Moon aligns with electrifying Uranus. It's impossible to tell how this surprising aspect will manifest, for it also increases your need for independence. One thing is for sure, you aren't likely to just take off for a few days because you have too much to do. Finding a healthy balance now between your needs and those of others is essential."
pisces,2010-08-26,"You've been waiting long enough and it's time for others to learn who you are and what's important to you. Don't worry about what's helpful for anyone else. It's not even necessary to ask for advice now, for the answer will most likely be of no use. Pushing your own agenda forward will not only get you closer to your goals, but will also make everyone more aware of your abilities."
aries,2010-08-27,"You truly believe that you know what you want today as the Moon in your sign reflects your needs. But declaring your desires isn't necessarily the smartest thing you can do now. Unfortunately, others don't necessarily share in your current passions, creating an awkward situation at best. It may be in your best interest to keep your feelings to yourself for a while."
taurus,2010-08-27,"You might think that you don't have to say anything today because a friend or co-worker already knows what you are feeling. There are many ways to demonstrate your emotional warmth and although verbal communication might seem to be the most obvious, it's not always the most efficient. Acts of kindness toward someone you love will get your message across faster than any other way."
gemini,2010-08-27,"Your unleashed enthusiasm could have a major effect on your partner or lover today, but a long and drawn-out speech may be the wrong approach, unless you quickly follow through with sincere actions. People will tire of your smooth words and easy promises. Remember that fulfilling your obligations doesn't require a lot of talk, just action."
cancer,2010-08-27,"It shouldn't be so difficult to let someone know how you feel. Unfortunately, it can be complicated to express yourself today, making others think you're not being very sincere at all. This may be quite frustrating, but you can avoid a big misunderstanding by sticking to the facts and simply speaking from your heart."
leo,2010-08-27,"It's hard for you to know if you should call it quits today or launch a major initiative. Unfortunately, your words cannot tell the whole story. Lovable Venus is still hanging out with feisty Mars in your 3rd House of Communication, tempting you to embellish your tale, but it's smarter to cut it short to make it more believable. You may be pushed up against the wall with no way over it. Don't be glib; covering up the truth won't make this day any easier."
virgo,2010-08-27,"Social diplomacy is needed today, for you want to dig beneath the surface to get to the truth. But you first must get others to agree to partake in your search. Nevertheless, a visit to a counselor or therapist won't replace a long talk with someone who really knows you. Most significantly, remember there's no right or wrong when it comes to matters of the heart."
libra,2010-08-27,"Codependency is a trap, yet it's still easy to base your responses on how you believe someone else will react. Forget about weighing the impact of your words; just say them aloud as they enter your awareness. Your attitude is crucial now, so express yourself in a way that also conveys kindness and demonstrates flexibility. Others will be so appreciative to know how deeply you feel that they won't likely care if you agree with them or not."
scorpio,2010-08-27,"Approach your work from a different angle today because as you change your attitude, you also alter the roles that others play in your life. But it may not be that easy now to choose your part in the play because your emotions are being pulled in many directions. Instead of forcing a familiar character onto the stage, try getting to know yourself and others better first. This radical strategy could also bring alternative choices to the table, offering you paths you haven't yet considered."
sagittarius,2010-08-27,"You might be scared to open your heart because everything is happening so quickly today. But don't take the easy way out by building self-protective walls or you'll only increase your loneliness. Instead, muster up enough courage to come out and say exactly how you feel to someone you trust. Healing old wounds begins with acknowledging the truth first."
capricorn,2010-08-27,"It's no fun walking around on eggshells just because you don't want to stir up difficult feelings now. Unfortunately, your self-enforced caution could have an effect that is the exact opposite of what you want. If you find yourself in a conversation about your feelings today, don't hold back. Be as brutally honest as you can while remaining sensitive to others."
aquarius,2010-08-27,"You may be excited about the prospects of pushing your feelings into new territory today, but you tend to be much less passionate with your words than how you actually feel in your heart. Paradoxically, it's much easier to express what you want through bold actions rather than writing or talking about your needs. Remember, you aren't responsible for how others react to you. Just walk your talk and you'll be okay."
pisces,2010-08-27,"You might be feeling quite positive about what you have to offer a close friend or potential lover. Or, perhaps you're ready to explore your newly found confidence by sharing a big idea with friends or coworkers. Just remember that they may not react with the same level of optimism. You'll sound more convincing if you speak matter-of-factly, without trying to sell anyone anything at all."
aries,2010-08-28,"You might believe you can play all day long and still finish your chores. Unfortunately, reality probably won't support your fantasy. Nevertheless, the Moon in speedy Aries helps you to accomplish a lot more than you expect once you get going. Be kind to yourself; don't wait so long that you don't have enough time to make things right and meet your earlier commitments."
taurus,2010-08-28,"You could be feeling pretty good about yourself yet your confidence can actually create a problem for you today. Your key planet Venus is aligned with unyielding Pluto, making it nearly impossible for you to change your mind now. Your legendary stubbornness may kick in if someone accuses you of doing a sloppy job. Instead of spending your energy defending your performance after the fact, put extra effort into doing your job to the best of your abilities in the first place."
gemini,2010-08-28,Be very careful about committing to something you won't be able to deliver today because you may not be very good at estimating how long a job takes. You might be so eager to squeeze a lot into a small amount of time that you are almost guaranteed of falling short of your promise. You can make things run smoother if you just schedule your projects more carefully and add a little allowance for unexpected complications.
cancer,2010-08-28,"Be wary of taking on too much responsibility today because the enterprising Aries Moon in your 10th House of Public Life is stressed by planets in your 4th House of Roots. The needs of your friends and family might be more important to you than the urge to accomplish something. Instead of worrying about what you'll get finished, think about what you can do for someone you love."
leo,2010-08-28,"It's hard to understand why you are working so much and still feeling as if you're not getting what you need in return. You may be worth more than you earn or, perhaps, are overqualified for the job you do. You can usually motivate yourself by aiming high, but now it's not the best strategy. Don't set such lofty goals that will only assure that you fall short of your mark."
virgo,2010-08-28,"Your current dilemma is that you know what's expected of you, but you're totally enthused by a very different course of action. You aren't planning on doing something that's shady; it's just that you aren't excited about the prospect of having to rationalize your actions. Think carefully about your strategy, for you might realize that you're misjudging the situation now in order to justify your behavior."
libra,2010-08-28,"You could have too much adrenaline coursing through your body today, yet, paradoxically may feel as if you are running on empty. Thankfully, you seem to be able to function just fine, but you should be careful about exhausting yourself. Instead of accepting an invitation to a fun social event, you may be smarter to opt for a bit of relaxing time at home. Whatever you decide, though, make sure you get some extra rest at some point."
scorpio,2010-08-28,"You are eager to look good today, but may not want others to know that this is important to you. Not too much will escape your critical perceptions, but you could become so overwhelmed by the details that you miss something big. Although it may sound counter-intuitive, your best strategy now is to let quality suffer just a little so you can complete your tasks on time."
sagittarius,2010-08-28,"You might feel invincible now, but your overconfidence could actually be a symptom of denial. There are no sensible reasons for you to hide your shortcomings today. A stellar performance is not a worthy substitute for real substance. Polishing your delivery is always worth the effort, but don't think that you'll get away with using glamor to cover up what's truly happening."
capricorn,2010-08-28,"Establishing a bond with others won't work if you're only doing it to score points. Although you may have an opportunity to deepen a friendship today, it cannot be successful if your mind is only on getting ahead. Be aware of every moment throughout the day, even if nothing happens. Just being present with someone you love, without having any kind of agenda at all, is enough for now."
aquarius,2010-08-28,"You may want to pull back from a lot of social interactions today, even if someone you like wants to work more closely with you. Although you want to hang out with your friends, it's more important to get some rejuvenating time alone instead. Luckily, you should be able to set up your day so you can have the best of both worlds. Don't be afraid to engage with others, but establish firm boundaries so you can also be on your own for a while."
pisces,2010-08-28,"What everyone else thinks of your contribution may be quite important to you now, especially if you are a bit insecure about the quality of what you are doing. However, being concerned about someone else's judgment isn't as useful as developing your own critical eye. Thankfully, as you become more discerning, the judgment of your peers grows less meaningful."
aries,2010-08-29,"You may be so overwhelmed by everything that you have been doing that you're ready to walk away out of frustration. Naturally, this kind of irresponsible behavior will not be helpful. Luckily, you could experience an irrepressible wave of passion for your life today that makes you want to finish whatever you already started. Even if you don't like making to-do lists, itemizing what's next helps you to establish priorities and minimize wasted energy."
taurus,2010-08-29,"Even if you're excited about taking some time away from work, you still want to be practical. The Moon's return to your pleasure-seeking sign has you seeking rest and relaxation. Your determination to take the course of least resistance might also make you lazy. However, you'll feel better about yourself if you reach a little further than is required; if nothing else, it will be good for your soul."
gemini,2010-08-29,"You may be so comfortable with your current situation that you temporarily stop paying attention to what's happening. You might forget what you were striving for and no longer want anything you don't already have. But this bucolic condition won't last. Boredom will set in soon enough, tempting you once again to stir things up and create a bit of mischief."
cancer,2010-08-29,"You might actually believe that you can hold your breath today and be so quiet that no one will even notice you. But in your desire to be invisible, you must still pay attention to everything that occurs in your environment. Even if you're feeling low key, it's crucial for you to plan on doing something outrageous in the next few days just to shake up the energy."
leo,2010-08-29,"You may already be missing summer, even though it isn't over yet. But your nostalgia won't last long because sleepy fantasies can stimulate realistic desires and you would be smart to act on them. Go ahead and meander through your memories, but don't try to make something happen out of desperation. You'll be happiest by simply accepting things as they are for now."
virgo,2010-08-29,"You may have expressed powerful emotions over the past weeks, but you might not have shared the full story of your process yet with anyone. You could feel some pressure to tell your version of what's happening, but don't cave in to the demands of your peers; say as much or as little as you wish. The real discussion will take place when the time is right so there's no need to force any issues now."
libra,2010-08-29,Others see you as very energetic these days with Mars in your 1st House of Self spilling your upbeat attitude onto others. But if you are annoyed or angry about someone else's lack of ethics you could work yourself into a tizzy before finding a way to change your attitude and chill out. Your self-awareness is your most important tool because it can help you to use negative emotions to nudge your life in a more positive direction.
scorpio,2010-08-29,"Although your schedule may be very hectic, it's still smart to take time off to enjoy the company of others. Whether you head out for a leisurely lunch with co-workers or a casual get together with a few friends after work, the social atmosphere will ultimately lead your mind back to more serious concerns. Nevertheless, be careful about what you share since impulsive communication can be well intended yet miss the mark. Think the whole thought through before you say anything at all."
sagittarius,2010-08-29,"Even though it's the weekend, you are still concerned about your job today and where it may take you. You could find yourself thinking about leaving your current position, but this may not be the best idea, unless you have been planning it for a long time. Radical action may be seductive now, but a more conservative approach makes the most sense."
capricorn,2010-08-29,"It's easier for you to get comfortable now that the Sun is in practical Virgo, a fellow earth sign. Luckily, the Sun, the sensible Taurus Moon and passionate Pluto all join forces as they create a very useful Grand Trine that enables you to embrace change without feeling stress. Calculated actions should lead you to success, but if you need more time, waiting a bit longer won't damage your chances."
aquarius,2010-08-29,"You may be more interested today to hang out with friends and family at home than to go off and have a big adventure. And although you'll likely steer the activities to your advantage, it may require extra patience on your part. Fortunately, you are probably able to get your way, but victory will come with a cost. Instead of aiming to win, let your goal be to create common ground. Finding a way for everyone to have fun will create a day to remember."
pisces,2010-08-29,"Although you may feel very confident about reaching your goals now, this isn't the smartest time to set out on your own. With the Sun and Mercury both traveling through your 7th House of Others, working with someone else should give you the boost of energy that you need. But pick your partners very carefully; an alliance could fall apart pretty quickly unless everyone is in full agreement about the destination and the best path to get there."
aries,2010-08-30,"A touchy relationship problem may be reactivated today by a relatively unimportant event, as if a recently visited issue was waiting in the wings to be called back onstage. Unfortunately, if you were unable to fix the problem earlier, you won't likely solve it now. Paradoxically, the harder you strive for resolution, the more elusive the answers become. Nevertheless, gentle persistence is advised because the tides will eventually turn and you'll be free to move on."
taurus,2010-08-30,"The Moon is visiting your sign today and is currently forming difficult aspects with several planets, including karmic Saturn in your 6th House of Employment. Although you may believe that you can power your way through the resistance you're facing at work, it's smarter to slow down, figure out what you're doing wrong and create a new plan. Dogged persistence is not as successful now as finding the smartest strategy."
gemini,2010-08-30,"Don't expect others to be able to understand what you know today, for the Moon in your 12th House of Spiritual Mystery can put you in touch with metaphysical truths that cannot easily be explained. Your friends and colleagues might not be ready to follow your irrational lead just because it makes sense to you. Although you can see the beautiful complexity of it all, your best bet now is to stick with the simplest approach."
cancer,2010-08-30,"Your friends should be there for you today, so asking them for help is a smart idea if you need it. You may resist placing yourself in such a vulnerable position, but showing your true self can actually create a more balanced flow of energy between you and others. Although it's ultimately about feeling safe, you should be able to follow the advice of a trusted companion without worrying too much about the consequences."
leo,2010-08-30,"You may try to play the role of a caretaker today, but you really don't want to encourage others to be dependent on you. You have an intuitive ability now to know how to quickly win others over to your side. Don't be scared of acting without full justification, as long as you do so with integrity. You won't go wrong if you stick to your true convictions."
virgo,2010-08-30,"You may be feeling a higher level of confidence about yourself and your goals. Even if you doubt your abilities, things should finally begin to turn around. Nevertheless, it can be difficult to reserve your judgment just enough to accept life as it is and other people just as they are. Still, once you choose to take the high road, you gain the gift of a truly empowering vision."
libra,2010-08-30,The romantic buzz could be drowned out today by a real disagreement over your future. Your dreamy mood might be suddenly overtaken as fears and insecurities arise from the depths of your subconscious. The Moon in your 8th House of Transformation indicates that there is a lot happening beneath the surface. Don't attempt to hold on to the current moment; letting it recede into the past will make room for the present.
scorpio,2010-08-30,"Before you can settle down into a more regular pattern, you may exhaust yourself trying to keep up with everything that's happening. Although you should be able to complete what's expected of you, your life may be overly complicated now. Instead of frantically attempting to get back to the basics, resign yourself to living your current complex life until it starts to simplify on its own."
sagittarius,2010-08-30,"You have a hard time maintaining your focus today, yet still might try to finish one too many tasks that elude completion. But you can get everything done if you are conscientious about being practical and say no again and again to the parade of distractions. Ultimately, it's your unwavering desire to be productive that will make it harder for you to be pulled off course."
capricorn,2010-08-30,"Although you can be more effective today than you thought possible, you also may feel as if you're missing something crucial. Undoubtedly, there's more going on now than meets the eye, yet you cannot put your finger on it. Don't attempt to solve the unsolvable mysteries; instead, make a commitment to accomplish as much as possible and then get to work."
aquarius,2010-08-30,"You start the day knowing exactly what you have to do, yet you could grow less certain as the hours pass. New possibilities are presented to you and each of them has its own merit. But ultimately, it's up to you. You must decide how you will connect your goals with those of everyone else. Taking care of your own needs alone won't make you any happier today, so consider the needs of your companions, too."
pisces,2010-08-30,"You are very busy today with the Moon in your 3rd House of Immediate Environment. Still, you are able to remain totally focused. You can ruthlessly concentrate your attention with such persistence now that those things that would normally distract you won't even catch your eye. Others may think that you are being a bit obsessive, but don't listen to them. It's just common sense to make the most of the current moment."
aries,2010-08-31,"Whatever you do today, it may not seem to be enough if someone isn't willing to accept what you bring to the table. Or, perhaps, if others don't want more from you, then you could be the one who is harshly judging your own shortcomings. Fortunately, the negativity should pass quickly if you don't measure up to expectations. Don't worry; you will soon be back to your old optimistic self."
taurus,2010-08-31,"You are moodier than usual today with the Moon lingering in your sign and could easily get into an emotional tussle with someone who stands in your way. Although you might mean well, it's easy to encourage conflict by tempting others to fight back. Staying aware of your propensity toward rigidity or negativity could change everything, allowing you to sidestep a difficult situation before it fully develops."
gemini,2010-08-31,"You enjoy talking about lots of subjects, but this doesn't mean you are emotionally accessible. Bringing your feelings out into the open may be an uphill battle for you, but your persistence can make a big difference. Unfortunately, your positive intentions are not enough; the information you share could be problematic for someone else. Express yourself as clearly as you can and then don't back down from what you know to be true."
cancer,2010-08-31,"You have something on your mind, so speak your piece early in the day. Although your thoughts continue to grow louder, along with your need to communicate them, you're likely to keep things to yourself if you wait too long. Be as open and forthright as you can for the best results. Your audience will appreciate your honesty more than you know."
leo,2010-08-31,"Your emotional steadiness plays a significant role as you continue on your professional path. You derive strength from your convictions, enabling you to provide a shoulder to support those you love. Everyone appears to be making demands as you try to do the best you can. But don't give out all your energy without receiving something in return. Generosity is best when shared."
virgo,2010-08-31,"Your big idea might have seemed like a really smart one, but now you must deliver on the promises you made. It's not that you can't manifest what you dream; it's just that you could be scared of taking a chance. Don't hold back; if anything, it's smarter to overshoot your mark at first and then ease into a pace that you can sustain."
libra,2010-08-31,"Try to see past your uncertainty today if self-doubt creeps into the emotional mix. Stay focused on your goals, especially when you receive mixed signals from the Moon, once she enters flighty Gemini. On one hand, you know that your ideas are sound and your enthusiasm is irrepressible. But on the other hand, you may underestimate how much work you have ahead of you. You'll be more successful if you remember to consistently moderate the extremes."
scorpio,2010-08-31,"Other people's inflexibility is more reassuring to you today than annoying. Even if you are committed to hearing both points of view before you take sides, you can still respect the integrity of someone who stands up for his or her beliefs. Don't waste your energy trying to change anyone else's mind; you'll exhaust yourself as surely as if you attempted to move a mountain. Instead, just honor the differences of perspective and agree to disagree."
sagittarius,2010-08-31,"Although you might believe that a relationship has grown stagnant, there is definite movement today. At first you think that everything is up for grabs, but then, when you try to make something happen, you may get your hands slapped quicker than you expect. Be ready to take advantage of an opportunity if it appears, but don't push too hard."
capricorn,2010-08-31,"You normally have a no-nonsense approach to relationships, but today something could happen that changes your attitude. You may feel as if someone with authority is trying to use his or her influence to get you to do something that's not in your game plan. Instead of tackling this potential conflict head-on now, you'll do better if you just pretend it's not there. It will be much easier to handle tomorrow after you have had a chance to cool down."
aquarius,2010-08-31,"You would rather keep your feelings private, but you may eventually be pressured into making them known today. Letting your pent-up frustrations out into the open could stir up trouble, but, fortunately, it will make you happier in the long run. Pushing through your own fears of being judged by family members will take extra effort on your part, but staying true to yourself is your only sensible choice."
pisces,2010-08-31,"You may be tempted to stick to your old goals, even if you are beginning to doubt that they still make sense. Unfortunately, it's difficult to know the source of your current worries, yet uncertainty about your future continues to grow. Instead of trying to force everything into your preconceived agenda, set aside your previous strategy and just see where the present situation takes you. Be wise and steer clear of conflict today, so you'll be more prepared to get back on track tomorrow."
aries,2010-09-01,"It's hard for you to remain low key now because your thoughts are moving quickly and you are wittier than usual. Unfortunately, someone could resent you if you draw too much attention to yourself. Although there isn't anything wrong with wanting to be appreciated, there's no need to steal the spotlight from anyone who deserves it. Don't waste time worrying about what others think; just concentrate on doing the best job you can."
taurus,2010-09-01,"You might get so caught up in wanting to be creative today that you lose track of what's really most important to you. Fortunately, you don't have to be as productive as you think now. In fact, letting your efficiency slip for a while could give you a chance to recharge your batteries. Replenish your energy by relaxing for a while, rather than frantically expending it all day long."
gemini,2010-09-01,"Relationships can be tricky now because you don't have the patience to follow through with an intense discussion, even if that's what your partner wants. Although your avoidance mechanisms are working well today with the Moon in your clever sign, sidestepping a difficult conversation will only charge the issue with more passion. However, showing up with a willingness to dig into a tough topic can ultimately lead to increased intimacy."
cancer,2010-09-01,"Someone may be blocking your way now, but a direct confrontation will only increase the resistance. You could be tempted to withdraw completely and proceed in secret on your own, but there are advantages to working out in the open. Whatever you decide to do, don't put off your decision. Make up your mind and live with it. Be kind when you let others know what you want to do, but don't waste time giving endless justifications for your choice."
leo,2010-09-01,"Making a financial decision could be difficult with the Moon's square to the Sun in your 2nd House of Money today. You may believe that purchasing beautiful things for someone you love is a simple expression of your affection, but others might not care as much as you think they do. Putting on a show with a gift may be a source of enjoyment, but it would be more meaningful to demonstrate your natural generosity by expressing yourself in non-materialistic ways."
virgo,2010-09-01,"Childhood memories add complexity to a current emotional situation because old experiences get mixed up with what's happening now, making it even harder to be receptive to someone else's feelings. But if you can let go of your need to gain control, at least you have a chance to share a magical moment with someone you love."
libra,2010-09-01,"You might attempt to keep something to yourself now since the Moon's dynamic square to the Sun is in your 12th House of Privacy today. But with the Moon in talkative Gemini, your secrets could be brought out into the open, no matter how hard you try to stay quiet. Rather than protecting yourself or someone else, examine what brought you into the current situation and why you are being so protective of what you say. Ultimately, you'll be happier when you have nothing to hide."
scorpio,2010-09-01,"You might get angry if you think that anyone is trying to take something that's yours. Your hostility may be directed at a friend who really doesn't appear to have your best interest at heart. But before you say what you feel, remember that the Moon is squaring the Sun today, increasing the intensity of your emotions. Take a deep breath and choose your words carefully."
sagittarius,2010-09-01,"Other people's energy can seem a bit scattered today, as the whimsical Gemini Moon is in your 7th House of Companions. An inconsistent partner can inadvertently push you to concentrate your energy even more. You don't want to seem like a lightweight, so you might overcompensate and act overly annoyed to get your way. Be careful not to fabricate a problem where there is none, for once you stir up trouble, it won't be so easy to fix."
capricorn,2010-09-01,"You have a feeling now that something big in your life is about to change and you may want to plot ahead in order to hold on to what you have. You will need your physical energy as the shift gets underway, so don't fritter it away on unimportant activities. Self-discipline goes a long way toward establishing a healthy routine to prepare you for the future."
aquarius,2010-09-01,"You might want to set off on your own, but you still can use the assistance of a partner now. There may be some crucial skills that you are lacking or perhaps you're seeking financial support. Start looking for the right person who can provide you with exactly what you need to get your project rolling. However, caution is advised; don't let others add more than you bargain for or you may not be happy with the end results."
pisces,2010-09-01,"One of your friends may be trying to hand you responsibilities that shouldn't really be yours. Unfortunately, there isn't much you can do about it today without creating even more problems. Even if you think that you are being treated unfairly, you're better off letting it go for now. Move through the day with minimum resistance; you'll have plenty of time later on to make it right."
aries,2010-09-02,"Lingering relationship tensions begin to dissipate now, yet it's wise to wait and see how things progress over the next few days prior to assuming that everything is better. Although you are free to use your imagination, you may not act in a practical manner today. Fortunately, this means that your thinking process won't be restrained. Exploring your fantasies in great detail can actually help you manifest your dreams."
taurus,2010-09-02,"You know what you want to accomplish at work today, but your plans may be totally unrealistic, even if you believe them to be doable. The sooner that you recognize that your feet are not touching the ground, the sooner you can start to work on restraining your fantasies. It's better to recognize your dreams for what they are so you can save yourself from being disappointed later on."
gemini,2010-09-02,"You may be more emotional than usual with the Moon back in your sign -- but oddly enough, your feelings now stem from your thoughts. You may try to find balance but you could be bounced around by unexpected events. Instead of trying a logical solution to your current predicament, trust your intuitive hunches because they will probably steer you in the right direction."
cancer,2010-09-02,"You know what it's like to have a powerful emotional reaction to a personal situation, but it still might be very challenging today to tell someone what's on your mind. You are eager to break the mold, but you don't want to disturb anything in the process of your escape. Take it slow at first while continuing to plan big."
leo,2010-09-02,"You are able to dig down into your feelings today, but at least you are well equipped for the trip. You are unusually comfortable now as you delve into unfamiliar emotional realms. However, don't stress if your follow-through is lacking because social activities come first and there may be no time left over for quiet contemplation."
virgo,2010-09-02,"Reviewing a variety of alternatives is a wise strategy now before you jump into the next major project. Decisions should be carefully thought out because impulsive actions won't likely get you very far. But if you cannot put off making a snap decision today, at least take time to weigh and balance the pros and cons first."
libra,2010-09-02,"Your life may already be shifting direction with karmic Saturn in your sign for the next couple of years. But first you must get a firm handle on what you are currently doing or you could end up wasting the day. It would be so easy to just kick back and relax today. Nevertheless, you'd still like to have something to show for your hard work, so make a plan, rather than just shooting from the hip. Great ideas are not very useful unless you have the common sense to do something concrete about them."
scorpio,2010-09-02,"Although this may be a workday, it still can offer you a spiritual retreat, even if you just take a bit of time for yourself in nature or spend a while at home without a lot of distractions. You may be scattered at first, but you should be able to unwind once you finish your job assignments. Don't worry about getting lost in your dreams; it's a perfectly safe journey today and you'll feel better when you return home later."
sagittarius,2010-09-02,"You are fast on your feet today, along with being very funny. Luckily, you are quite the charmer now and should be able to get away with a little irreverence or a bit of edgy sarcasm. But don't push your luck, for your idealism could influence your thinking and cloud your judgment. It's time to talk less and accomplish more."
capricorn,2010-09-02,"You are motivated to do something that will turn heads and make others take notice of you today. But, somehow your efforts to gain acceptance or attention are thwarted, leaving you frustrated, especially if that's all you can think about. However, you can raise the quality of the day by simply changing your mind and deciding that you don't need to be the star of the show."
aquarius,2010-09-02,"You may become enamored with something or someone now, yet falling in love won't likely be what it appears to be in the moment. With dreamy Neptune so active today, it's quite likely that a brush with romance will seem mighty wonderful at first, but transforming your fantasy into reality could prove to be beyond the scope of your human abilities."
pisces,2010-09-02,"You might not realize where your current drive is coming from today, but its strong presence can spur you on to be more spiritually inclined with compassionate Neptune floating around in your 12th House of Divinity. You may not be able to easily separate your religious connections from your desire to increase your awareness about the mysteries of the cosmos. However; it may be useful to bring a confidante into your life so you have someone to talk to about your dreams."
aries,2010-09-03,"You are eager to share your ideas about romance now, yet your unconventional approach may create conflict between what you want and what you know is right. Honest communication with a loved one ultimately can lead you to see that your assumptions might not be correct. Ultimately, what you learn today will help you feel independent without sacrificing intimacy."
taurus,2010-09-03,It can be difficult to be yourself and also live up to other people's expectations. But your current interpretation of what's happening now could be slightly off. It might not be someone else's judgment that is causing your worry; it could be your own beliefs that are problematic. Don't assume that you know what others want. Ask them -- and be specific with your questions -- before you draw any wrong conclusions.
gemini,2010-09-03,"You can become more scattered today and feel as if you cannot get anything done. Meanwhile, everything changes when a close friend engages you in an intense conversation. But even if you don't want to admit your lack of focus, it will be more helpful if you do. Once you begin talking about your frustrations, you will realize what you must do next. Don't delay getting started, for your concentration may not last too long."
cancer,2010-09-03,"It's perfectly normal to be pulled in two directions today, and it's okay if you cannot choose which feelings to act on. Fortunately, your need to decide becomes less pressing as the day proceeds, for circumstances might make the choice for you. You are wise now to just do the best with what happens while waiting for a smarter time to assert your will."
leo,2010-09-03,"You might actually believe that you are being very clear in your communications, only to discover that someone heard something quite different from what you said. Instead of trying to go back and untangle a misunderstanding, work from the present moment and go forward. Although you still may run into a detour that temporarily derails your progress, something valuable can be gained in the process."
virgo,2010-09-03,"You shouldn't assume that people know what you want now, even if it seems totally obvious to you. Keep in mind that others can't read your mind and they'll jump to an erroneous conclusion if you don't say anything at all. It's really up to you; taking the time to share your thoughts today can diffuse a conflict before it ever happens."
libra,2010-09-03,"You might become the center of attention today in spite of the complaints of friends or associates, as they express their concern about your participation with the group. Of course you have the right to withdraw from a social crowd if you desire, but ignoring your workmates might be more difficult. Either way, you have some explaining to do and clearly stating your intentions can greatly simplify the situation."
scorpio,2010-09-03,"Speak boldly and get right to the point, for others are listening carefully to what you say and will take you quite seriously. But don't be overly dramatic because this could alienate those who already support you. In fact, if you let your feelings run amok, your message could get lost or turned around so that you are misunderstood. You will be most successful by containing your emotions while communicating with conviction."
sagittarius,2010-09-03,"Your thoughts could take others for a ride today, but just because your ideas are far out doesn't necessarily make them better. Instead of rambling on and spinning tales of remote lands, try to keep your thinking process closer to home. Talking about your feelings and your needs will encourage intimacy between you and your loved ones instead of increasing the distance."
capricorn,2010-09-03,"Although you may think that what you have to say is extremely important, it's best not to make too big of a deal about it. Some things are best talked about with a quiet respect, and when it comes to the mysteries of your soul or the inclinations of your heart, there's no need to shout from a mountaintop. Remember, your words will have more impact now if you speak softly and keep an open heart."
aquarius,2010-09-03,"You may be overwhelmed by what someone says to you now, and you just want to have a bit of time to yourself to process your feelings. Unfortunately, you might not be able to escape because of the social requirements that have been placed upon you. Don't waste too much energy resisting, for a highly spirited conversation you have today could teach you something important about your core values."
pisces,2010-09-03,"Although it's out of character, you could get so caught up in the details of your plan today that you cannot clearly convey it to anyone else. This can be very exasperating, especially if there's something crucial to express. Part of the problem may be that you over-explain yourself if you get too excited. A bit of preparation will help; write down the main thoughts you want to communicate and use this as an outline to help you stay on track."
aries,2010-09-04,"You have entered a zone where your memories of your dreams may be quite intense. However, you shouldn't think that they will come true just because your recollections are so clear. It's wise to give some thought to whatever flows from your imagination. However, working hard to actualize your potential is still your smartest move no matter how attractive your fantasies may be now."
taurus,2010-09-04,"Your desires are shifting from the physical world into more imaginative realms, as your ruling planet Venus receives a magical kiss from ethereal Neptune today. Acknowledging your dreams is the first step to making your wishes come true. Metaphysical teachings remind you to concentrate your attention on what you desire most, but then you must let go of your attachments and simply believe in what you know to be true."
gemini,2010-09-04,"You are ready to share your dreams with a loved one today, but you might accidentally create a misunderstanding if you don't think everything through before you open your mouth to speak. Unfortunately, you aren't very motivated now to do the work on your self-esteem that may be required. Instead of being hard on yourself, consider taking some time off to relax, before you get down to serious business."
cancer,2010-09-04,"You may try to stay as objective as you can today when telling a close friend about a current problem at home. Your companion will probably be eager to listen to whatever you need to share, but he or she might not be able to offer you the advice you seek. Instead of expecting more from everyone else now, find what you need from within."
leo,2010-09-04,"Your love life seems to sparkle and shine today as beautiful Venus draws you into fantasyland. Her trine to nebulous Neptune replaces the reality of your relationships with what's in your mind. Although this might bring a smile to your lips, remember that your view of the real world is warped by your desires now, so be careful about assuming that things are as you see them."
virgo,2010-09-04,"You could easily have a minor meltdown and then recover today, but one thing's for sure: your daily life isn't unfolding as you expected. Your logical analysis can only take you so far, so eventually you must set rational language aside. Luckily, your emotional involvement won't lead you into dangerous territory. Instead, it could soothe your nerves, for this is a time to practice chilling out and being flexible."
libra,2010-09-04,"Your sensitivity is running strong now that the Moon is in empathic Cancer, allowing you to play out your role as the artist or poet today. It's a smart idea to pull out your craft supplies or musical instruments and get busy. But this is more than just a reminder to create or perform; it's also about contacting your subconscious through your meditations and dreams. Anything that keeps you in touch with your spirit guides will ultimately bring you closer to your desired destination."
scorpio,2010-09-04,You may have so much going on within your head today that you aren't so quick to share your fantasies with others. You can be very clever at avoiding a discussion about anything you want to keep to yourself. But don't worry if some information leaks out because you will certainly be able to handle the consequences. Your charm is irresistible now so use it wisely.
sagittarius,2010-09-04,"It's not easy today to find a place of balance that moves you beyond your feelings of jealousy. Naturally, you want to talk about what's going on with your friends, but once you open your mouth, you can say too much. Be careful; your boundaries aren't likely to be very clear now. If someone asks a question that pushes your buttons, you could become so reactive that you forget what you initially had to say. Spending some time alone will give you the chance to gain objectivity on the situation."
capricorn,2010-09-04,"You may not feel very comfortable today if you are confronted with facts that cannot be woven together into a coherent story. You could have so much data at your disposal now that you don't know how to integrate it all. Even if you try your best, you won't likely be able to make your point. Remember, there's no need to argue; just stand firm for your beliefs while also respecting everyone else's right to do the same."
aquarius,2010-09-04,"Don't spend a lot of time trying to turn an assumption of yours into a political discussion. It's futile to defend your position with opinions rather than facts. Your best bet is to have all your research in a neat and tidy package so you can get to it quickly when needed. Nevertheless, it may be necessary to change your mind once you consider the alternatives."
pisces,2010-09-04,"Your expressions of your heart's desire are not necessarily light and breezy today with loving Venus in your 8th House of Emotional Intensity. This isn't the kind of day when you can simply forget about the complex issues of passion, jealousy and control just for the sake of expediency. But instead of worrying about how others will respond to your feelings, just make sure to be honest and kind when talking about those you love."
aries,2010-09-05,"You are so concerned with impressing others with your competence today that you may miss your chance to be happy. You need to accept the fact that you are appreciated because you are good at what you do. But even if all is well in your world, you still may feel unfulfilled. Look beyond appearances to discover what's really important to your heart."
taurus,2010-09-05,"Tell your close friends and family exactly what you are feeling now, for your day will flow better if you share what's on your mind. The Moon in your private 4th House of Roots makes you feel safe and fulfilled while you are at home. There's no rush to conquer the world; just be aware of how your shared vulnerability can be a special invitation to love."
gemini,2010-09-05,"There's too much happening at work now and you may feel overwhelmed. You might want to ask your colleagues for help, but it may be politically incorrect to do so. Although you may not find time to talk about your problems in depth, at least broaching the subject with a few friends will help you feel better today."
cancer,2010-09-05,"Thankfully, you can't hold on to your recent moodiness as the lights get brighter and everything appears to be on the upswing. It's nearly impossible to be anything other than happy when the Moon is in fun-loving Leo today. But don't waste your excess energy on play while you still have some work to do. Hurry through your chores so you can enjoy the rest of the day."
leo,2010-09-05,"You are the life of the party today, for the Moon in your playful sign enables you to easily respond to everyone in an open manner. You are excited and eager to meet up with your friends to have a good time. However, you could become impatient if others are slowing you down. Make sure that in your rush to play you don't say something harsh to someone who isn't in the same lighthearted mood. Stop and apologize if you run roughshod over anyone's feelings."
virgo,2010-09-05,"Managing your life can be a bit tricky now because everyone thinks you are being totally honest, yet you might actually be covering something up. It's not that you are telling an outright lie about anything that is significant. However, keeping a secret isn't quite the same thing as telling the truth. Nevertheless, don't wait until it's too late. Take some time to prioritize what's most important and then share your thoughts with someone you love."
libra,2010-09-05,"Even if today is an errand day, make sure that you also schedule some downtime with your friends or family. However, this is not about getting together with others to discuss your schedule or business strategy; it's about relaxing. It's important to share your dreams with those who will accept them for what they are, without criticizing you for being unrealistic or questioning your motivation."
scorpio,2010-09-05,You are forced to recognize your current obligations and to acknowledge that you can live up to them since today's loyal Leo Moon falls in your 10th House of Public Responsibility. But don't just attempt to look busy because you must have verifiable accomplishments. There's no time for idle dreams now; you can pick up where you left off in a day or two once your work is done.
sagittarius,2010-09-05,"The colorful Leo Moon in your 9th House of Adventure is a vivid symbol of the exciting times ahead. But you might not have as much free time as you wish, for your life is getting busier and you cannot avoid the professional responsibilities. Do whatever helps you to get by on a day-to-day basis while you continue planning your big escape."
capricorn,2010-09-05,"An odd set of circumstances puts a weird psychological spin on the day and it's hard to say exactly what will be stirred up. You are usually results oriented, but now you might prefer to meander around with no particular destination in mind. Don't worry about what others think; your current task is to keep all of your options open and, if possible, leave final decisions until after Wednesday's New Moon."
aquarius,2010-09-05,"You could meet up with a dramatic person who expresses admiration toward you while the showy Leo Moon is in your 7th House of Relationships. But rather than basking in the spotlight of center stage, turn it around by thanking him or her for bringing something special into your world. Avoid any temptation to tell others what's wrong with their approach. A simple acknowledgment is all that's needed at this time."
pisces,2010-09-05,"It's a smart idea to cut a few enjoyable activities out of your routine while today's Moon is in your 6th House of Service. The goal is not to limit your fun, but to create the required time for you to meet your commitments. You may be eager to show others that you can hold up your part of the bargain by working hard, but you're not interested in being the only one. There's nothing wrong with standing up to anyone who tries to push you around."
aries,2010-09-06,"Expressing what's in your heart can lead you in a positive direction now as long as you connect what you're feeling to those around you. It's exciting when you can be creative, but this doesn't mean indulging in narcissism. Of course, you can still share what is most important to you; just remember that it's not about being the center of everyone else's attention."
taurus,2010-09-06,"You are thinking about placing your past on display now, especially if something stimulates a childhood memory. Connecting your present feelings with a previous situation may be healthy, but not if you are remembering something that never really happened. Don't embellish the truth or you could create problems rather than solving them."
gemini,2010-09-06,"You might not be able to avoid noisy distractions today as the responsive Moon moves through your 3rd House of Immediate Environment. It's not necessary to turn the humdrum of the day into some kind of drama in order to get a bit of attention. Instead, be clever and involve others in your scheme. Remember, you'll be appreciated more if you play as an integral part of the team."
cancer,2010-09-06,"You don't have to overstate your case today, for saying fewer words now is more effective than endless rambling. Keep in mind that your insecurities may set up blockages to deeper intimacy by tricking you into acting more confidently than you feel. Any attempts to avoid the truth or to inflate your ego will likely backfire. However, others will see you clearly if you just show up as yourself."
leo,2010-09-06,"Although you may be able to imagine yourself as royalty now with the Moon in regal Leo, it's better to understand that you have more in common with others than you might think. Trying to build your self-esteem by setting up situations where others are dependent on you won't make you feel any better. Instead, cultivate objectivity by letting go of your attachment to be anything other than what you already are."
virgo,2010-09-06,"Digging into your own fantasies might not be as fruitful today as it can be at other times. In fact, self-analysis could lead to a virtual dead end. Instead of venturing within, focus your attention on the world around you now. As you know, a methodical and pragmatic approach is the most sensible way to take care of business."
libra,2010-09-06,Even your best-laid plans can unravel as the Moon forms an annoying aspect to Saturn the Tester today. But don't try to avoid an unpleasant discussion because doing something else could bring you more pleasure. There is an important reason why you are being asked to revisit an issue you assumed was in the past. Pay careful attention to all the details or you will only have to repeat the lesson again sooner than you think.
scorpio,2010-09-06,"You may be placing too much importance on making sure that others know what you're doing on the job today. But it's not that you should slack off; it's just that other activities besides work should also be considered now, too. Don't be afraid to let your thoughts wander into the shadows of your subconscious, for it is there that you can discover the deeper meaning that you seek."
sagittarius,2010-09-06,"You could have vivid dreams of far-off lands today, but you must also pay attention to what's happening right in front of you. Staying close to home could provide more fun and games than you can imagine. Meanwhile, a lively conversation with a dear old friend may bring just the right advice to remind you that everything you really want now is in your own backyard."
capricorn,2010-09-06,"Sidestepping a really tough conversation about your feelings isn't a wise idea today, especially if you are letting your fears and other negative emotions stand in the way of a necessary discussion. There's no reason to delude yourself. You may be smarter to shift your focus from your avoidance of intimacy to whatever someone else needs to talk about at this time."
aquarius,2010-09-06,"You may feel misunderstood these days, but you need to fully own your role in what's happening. You might have inadvertently created a smokescreen between you and others that now gets in the way. Instead of overcompensating with dramatic acts of generosity, just soften your approach and respond from your gut. Don't fall into the trap of believing that there's something to be gained by hiding your true feelings."
pisces,2010-09-06,"Although you cannot solve complex global issues by simply working harder, there are things you can do to help. Overextending your reach isn't a smart move and could exhaust you in the process. Your real gift is how you show compassion to those around you. Offering a kind word or a shoulder to lean on takes very little and returns so much."
aries,2010-09-07,"Establishing firm boundaries with your friends might produce an unexpected response if they interpret your expressed need for formality too seriously. On the other hand, you're only following the rules because you believe that this strategy can help you. Too much rigidity can get in your way; paradoxically, letting go of control can begin to settle the energies."
taurus,2010-09-07,"You may believe that something is happening that you don't quite understand, but you cannot be certain enough to do anything specific about it. Risky behavior is tempting, but it's out of the question now. You should relax while allowing others to pamper you for a change. Nevertheless, there's work to do and you need to get back to the present so you can, at least, finish your old tasks before you start anything new."
gemini,2010-09-07,"You like gathering information even when it's not helpful. Today, however, the earthy Virgo Moon gives you the analytical tools you need to sort through the data and keep only what you can use. Although you may find a way to balance your unquenchable curiosity with your current penchant for practicality, it's still easy for you to forget what you're doing now and get distracted by something that looks like fun."
cancer,2010-09-07,"You could be licking your wounds today, but the crucial issue is not about anything that occurs in the present moment. Your obsession with a past event can actually block the flow of feelings. Gently bring your thoughts and fantasies back to where you are now. Keep in mind that you don't want to miss the good stuff that is right in front of you."
leo,2010-09-07,"It's challenging to separate your current feelings from your fantasies today, especially when you try to express what's on your mind. Nevertheless, don't lean on others for support now, for they cannot tell you the whole truth. If you are willing to be vulnerable and share your inner process, even without receiving feedback, you'll still feel like you made some progress."
virgo,2010-09-07,"The Moon's return to your sign today can give you an energetic boost. Unfortunately, your feelings may be difficult to manage, leaving you exhausted from sharing too much with a friend or lover. You might try to advance your cause by overstating your case. The smartest thing you can do now is to recognize your limitations and save your good intentions for tomorrow."
libra,2010-09-07,"It's all too easy to get lost in your own dreams and schemes with the Moon in your 12th House of Escapism. Luckily, one of your fantasies might actually turn into a practical plan. However, your sense of timing may be slightly off today, so don't mess up your chances by revealing your intentions too soon. Continue to develop your strategy without involving others until after tomorrow's New Moon."
scorpio,2010-09-07,"You are buzzing with excess energy today, yet you don't want to waste it on unimportant social interactions. Even if you have an enjoyable event to attend, it might seem more like a chore than a party. Still, it's probably a smart idea to go because you could make an important connection with someone you meet. You never can tell where a new friendship might lead."
sagittarius,2010-09-07,You really don't know what your next move at work should be because you may be heading off in one direction while really wanting to go another way. But this isn't about geography; it's about discovering places within your heart. Consider what your life would look like if you were actually working toward a new and exciting set of goals.
capricorn,2010-09-07,"Your down-to-earth approach to success can bring you rewards today, but you must stay focused on your original intentions. If you have an important decision to make, do it as early in the day as possible, because as the evening approaches, you may grow increasingly negative. Be as objective as you can in order to balance your pessimism with optimism."
aquarius,2010-09-07,"Your complex schemes may fall apart today for no apparent reason. You might even feel as if you can't maintain a clear perspective on what's happening now. But you are capable of doing nearly anything, as long as you concentrate on working with the resistance instead of against it. The more you fight what's in your way, the more strength you give it. Your flexibility makes you stronger and more resilient, like a willow tree that bends in the wind."
pisces,2010-09-07,"Don't over-personalize someone's criticism of your work today. You may just be extra sensitive now or others might actually be very harsh in their judgment. You could exhaust yourself trying to please a picky person who won't be satisfied by anything you do. There's no need to prove yourself to anyone. Instead, aim to meet your own high standards for a real sense of fulfillment."
aries,2010-09-08,"You must be careful about taking on new projects at work as today's New Moon in your 6th House of Employment challenges you to consider the pros and cons in great depth before making a final decision. But it's not just about work; intimacy doesn't come easily now, yet you can still be successful if you are willing to go out on a limb and say what's on your mind."
taurus,2010-09-08,"The Virgo New Moon activates your 5th House of Romance, creating the possibility of sweet love. Your ruling planet Venus enters your 7th House of Partners today, drawing you further into the complex web of relationships. Nevertheless, you must be serious and finish all your work chores before you go off and play. Ultimately, you should be able to relax and enjoy the day as long as you don't shirk your responsibilities."
gemini,2010-09-08,"You're not very eager to share your feelings with others today. In fact, you could be unusually reclusive as the timid Virgo New Moon hides in your 4th House of Family. You are more likely to stick close to home so you don't have to be around large groups of people. Don't fall into the trap of thinking there's something wrong just because you aren't particularly sociable now. Even you need an occasional break to recharge your batteries."
cancer,2010-09-08,"Eliminating unnecessary tasks helps you manage your busy schedule because you won't be able to accomplish everything. You could work yourself up into an anxious state by trying to carry out your ambitious plans. Save yourself a headache and take some time to indulge in a bit of peace and quiet. With the New Moon in your 3rd House of Immediate Environment, it's smarter to concentrate your energy than to scatter it."
leo,2010-09-08,"You won't be able to spend as much money as you want today, for the Virgo New Moon in your 2nd House of Finances requires you to cut out unnecessary purchases. Although you may have less in your bank account than you thought, the real reason to postpone buying something is because you don't need it. Make your life more efficient by streamlining your finances."
virgo,2010-09-08,"You might be more willing to share your feelings now that the New Moon is in your sign. No matter what you plan, though, everything seems to take more work than you expect. Nothing is easy, but don't slip into negativity or you could end up wasting the useful wisdom that is at your disposal. At least, the decisions you make today will be fiscally sound and quite practical."
libra,2010-09-08,"You don't want everyone to see how fussy you can be today and you might want to hide your finickiness by presenting a more acceptable side of your personality. The New Moon falls in your 12th House of Secrets, so don't be afraid of keeping to yourself. Although alluring Venus enters passionate Scorpio it won't likely be enough to offset your solitary mood. Don't let others assume the worst; it's smarter to explain why you are concerned instead of pretending that everything is okay."
scorpio,2010-09-08,"You are someone who usually takes your friendships quite seriously and today's New Moon in your 11th House of Social Networking reaffirms your need for meaningful relationships. Unfortunately, you can become overly concerned about something that isn't very significant. Don't let your high standards turn into unrealistic demands because your intensity could push others away. Instead, be more accepting now; your flexibility will ultimately strengthen the connections that matter the most."
sagittarius,2010-09-08,"Your thoughts are drawn to getting ahead at work, with the sensible Virgo New Moon falling in your 10th House of Public Responsibility. Making plans for the immediate future is an intelligent use of this lunation, yet Mercury's retrograde could slow you down until next week. Balancing what's on your plate now with what you want to do later is the right thing to do."
capricorn,2010-09-08,"You are the designated ""answer person"" because you just seem to know what to do next today. Your calm demeanor and common sense appear to do the trick in nearly any situation now. Fortunately, your organizational skills are in tip-top shape, so you should be able to execute your plan smoothly. Don't wait; get busy and use your planetary advantage wisely."
aquarius,2010-09-08,"Exploring beneath surface appearances today can bring you down because emotional subjects aren't usually your first preference. However, you know that there's something for you to learn if you don't go racing off to solve a complex intellectual problem. Fortunately, asking tough questions about delicate issues can recapture the intensity that has already started to wane. Expressing your vulnerability could bring you closer to someone you love."
pisces,2010-09-08,"This is the beginning of a relationship cycle because the exacting Virgo New Moon falls in your 7th House of Partners. But your hopes may be quite inflated as romantic Venus is now visiting your 9th House of Grandiose Thinking. Fortunately, if you scale back your expectations right away, you could avoid disappointment later."
aries,2010-09-09,"It may seem as if you must handle one detail after another today, and if you don't pay attention to the little things, there could be trouble down the road. It's important that you respect your current commitments, for a lack of concern on your part could convey the wrong message. It's not helpful to argue with your boss or to ignore a deadline now; instead, do your job the best you can."
taurus,2010-09-09,"You could be tempted to avoid hard work today or, perhaps, do as little as possible. But your irresponsible behavior might be a symptom of your lack of interest rather than laziness. You may be more highly motivated to do something joyful, yet you also know that an unsatisfactory performance could bring trouble. Go ahead and enjoy yourself, but try to fulfill your commitments along the way."
gemini,2010-09-09,"You may be called upon to assist a close friend or family member today and you cannot say no, even if it puts a strain on the rest of your day. Your sense of compassion is so strong now that you may not take too much time to consider your options prior to answering yes. Nevertheless, it's still a good idea to have a sensible plan before you leap into the unknown."
cancer,2010-09-09,"Making a plan and sticking with it is the smartest strategy today, even if you are tempted to fly by the seat of your pants. It feels as if everything requires additional research and clarification before you respond, so every choice takes time you don't really have available. For now simply follow your previous agenda and don't waste energy attempting to deviate from it."
leo,2010-09-09,"You may have recently received a financial surprise yet now realize that you still have your share of hard work to do. Or perhaps your intentions are thwarted before you finish what you promised because of a lack of time or funds. Making the tough decisions that can put you back on track can be difficult unless you're willing to see things as they are, rather than how you want them to be."
virgo,2010-09-09,"Although you have a very specific agenda today, it will become increasingly difficult to follow your schedule as the day wears on. You may feel as if you have your need to run the show under control, but now others may see you as more heavy-handed than you actually are. Instead of trying to convince anyone of your true intentions, allowing your actions to speak for you will ultimately demonstrate your high level of flexibility at this time."
libra,2010-09-09,"Your dreams may have become more serious recently, and today one might follow you around throughout the day. Instead of trying to shake it off, it's smarter to consciously take the time to recreate it as best you can. Important messages are coming through from the depths of your subconscious and they can bring the answers you are seeking. Unfortunately, they won't likely be heard if there are too many noisy distractions in the background, so do what you can to find some peace and quiet."
scorpio,2010-09-09,"You may be feeling a bit reclusive today, but that doesn't mean that you should withdraw from the world. Consider accepting a social invitation from a friend, even if you think you don't want to go. Interactions with others now are not necessarily about having fun. However, if you simply set out to make some business connections, you'll be surprised at what an enjoyable time you have in spite of yourself."
sagittarius,2010-09-09,"Even if you would rather be listening to music and dancing today, you can still accomplish a lot at work. You may find yourself redoing something that hasn't lived up to your expectations. Just make sure you know what you're getting into before you actually begin a task or a project. Your greatest success will come from carefully balancing your ambition and hard work with your hopes and dreams."
capricorn,2010-09-09,"The Moon's conjunction with your key planet Saturn in your 10th House of Public Status reveals how hard you're willing to work to achieve your goals. Instead of inflating a smart idea into a totally unrealistic one, you are gifted with the common sense to know when enough is enough. Nevertheless, once you have set your goals and your boundaries today, you might, on a whim, allow a fantasy to dictate your next move. Tempering your optimism with solid facts should help you aim in the right direction."
aquarius,2010-09-09,"You aren't ready to give up on your plans, even if today is a bit of an emotional rollercoaster ride that pulls you all over the place. You might be aware of your fear of failure now, yet your imagination is strong enough to overcome nearly any resistance that stands in your way. Work to improve what you have, rather than starting from scratch. Remember, you can turn fantasies into reality if you stay grounded throughout the transformations ahead."
pisces,2010-09-09,"You won't have much fun today if you run into a stubborn partner who says no to everything you want. However, fighting won't bring happiness as warrior Mars harmonizes with dreamy Neptune in your 12th House of Spiritual Mystery, making it next to impossible for you to figure out a logical solution. Instead, trust your intuition to bring you the answers that you need."
aries,2010-09-10,"Although you may want to say what's on your mind right away, you'll be better off if you let the other person speak first. It won't be helpful if you are thinking about your response while someone else is talking; you need to be listening to everything being said. After you have thoroughly digested what you heard, then you can begin to communicate your point of view. You are more effective now if you are flexible enough to meet others halfway."
taurus,2010-09-10,"It's a real challenge for you to demonstrate your competence while also being open to receiving help from others. You might believe that you know how to do your job better than everyone else, but a different perspective could be exactly what you need. Although you may be annoyed if someone offers assistance, acknowledging your insecurities could be the key that allows you to accept support."
gemini,2010-09-10,"You want to express yourself to someone you love, but it still might be difficult to follow through with concrete action. Although your words can have a positive impact, you could be so charged with emotion that you appear overly aggressive unless you tone down your message. Making a real effort to soften your words allows you to convey your intentions without upsetting anyone else."
cancer,2010-09-10,"It's difficult for you to be as generous as you want to be if you think that someone is taking advantage of your willingness to help. If your warmth and good intentions turn cold with anger or suspicion, your ability to care for those you love might be compromised. Overreacting isn't useful; calmly express your concerns and then stick with the limits you have set."
leo,2010-09-10,"You could convince yourself that you are doing the right thing today, yet overstating your case is a symptom of trouble. If your behavior isn't in alignment with your intentions, the resistance you now face could lure you to be more forceful than usual. However, everything should flow quite easily if you are walking your talk. Take a moment and review your actions to be certain you are on the right path."
virgo,2010-09-10,"Spending impulsively isn't a very smart idea now because it could upset the delicate balance between your living expenses and what you actually make. You are usually very careful about managing your cash flow, but could easily mislead yourself today if you don't pay attention. Avoid problems by watching your wallet before it's empty."
libra,2010-09-10,"Plotting and planning make sense now that the Moon is back in your strategic sign, but this doesn't mean you should try to get away with any shady dealings. You have a good sense of action and reaction today, making this a sensible time to take control of your life. But don't push too hard because you'll probably reach your goals faster if you ease off the gas pedal so you won't have to hit the brakes."
scorpio,2010-09-10,"Your passions are heated and the warrior in you is stirred as the Moon conjuncts your key planet Mars tonight. But don't grab your weapon and head off to fight a battle, for your greatest challenges now are spiritual ones within the confines of your own mind. You cannot make your negative emotions go away by avoiding them. Instead of trying to transform anger into love, just let yourself feel what you feel and then move on."
sagittarius,2010-09-10,"You fiery Archers enjoy dreaming of new horizons, and now it's even easier to see farther ahead into the distant future. Unfortunately, you could become so enamored with the possibilities based on what you see that you take a foolish risk just to make something happen right away. However, you really don't need to do anything rash because you are progressing at the right speed, according to the cosmic plan."
capricorn,2010-09-10,"Your ambitions are running strong with three planets in your 10th House of Career, bringing out your natural affinity to this public sector of your chart. You might try to keep your calculating nature in check today, but you cannot stop from thinking about how you can get ahead. If you notice that you're being too aggressive at work, be wise and consciously pull in your energy so you can regain a healthier balance."
aquarius,2010-09-10,"You might think about impulsively buying an airline ticket to quench your thirst for adventure now that the Moon is in your 9th House of Travel. But your current wanderlust isn't just about having itchy feet; you have a strong desire to experience something outside of your current reality. However, if circumstances don't allow you to take time off, remember that you can go on a journey within your mind and never have to leave home at all."
pisces,2010-09-10,"Your intense passions may be difficult to ignore with the Moon conjuncting red-hot Mars in your 8th House of Intimacy. Intuitively, you know what you want and are ready to go after it, even if the consequences will complicate your life. Remember that it's smarter to think about what could happen next instead of unconsciously blasting your way ahead."
aries,2010-09-11,"Your passions rise as the Moon enters emotional Scorpio and your 8th House of Intimacy. You might try to keep everything light and easy, but others aren't necessarily playing by the same rules. You don't know whether to heat things up by expressing your true feelings or to cool off by withdrawing until you can regain your equilibrium. Letting go of control enables the winds of fate to carry you along even farther."
taurus,2010-09-11,"You may not understand why others need to be so intense today, yet a close friend or colleague appears to be unable to let go of an unnecessary drama. It's all very annoying and it may be a study in futility if you try to logically correct him or her. Your discomfort becomes less problematic when you finally realize that you don't have to empathize with anyone else. All you need to do is be present and listen."
gemini,2010-09-11,"You may be feeling irritated today because your key planet Mercury is ready to end its retrograde period and turn direct tomorrow. Your restlessness is heightened by the Moon's entry into the deep waters of Scorpio, drawing you into emotional issues that you would prefer to avoid. Instead of wasting energy resisting the currents, sink into your feelings with the understanding that everything should settle down gradually in the days ahead."
cancer,2010-09-11,"You are comforted by the change of dynamics as someone close to you acknowledges your feelings and seems to support you in a non-threatening manner. Paradoxically, the more you talk, the more you realize that you are not in agreement about what you want. Keep in mind that you may be a bit oversensitive, so don't be so fast to judge others just because their assumptions are different from yours."
leo,2010-09-11,"You may feel the need to retreat today as your thoughts pull you into the shadows of your inner world. Exploring the hidden realms of your imagination can be quite healthy, but others might be worried about you and attempt to lure you back out into the sunshine. Remember, it's not necessary to live up to someone else's expectations now. What's important is to learn what you can from your visit to the dark side."
virgo,2010-09-11,"You feel secure when you have useful information at your fingertips, but being flooded with unnecessary data does nothing but fill your head with noise. Unfortunately, you may be caught in a complex swirl of emotions, making it difficult to figure out what to do with what you know. It's frustrating if you don't yet know how to apply what you are learning. Practicing patience is your smartest strategy; give yourself sufficient time to integrate your current experiences before deciding what to do."
libra,2010-09-11,"You're feeling quite attached to your possessions now that the Moon joins acquisitive Venus in your 2nd House of Resources. You may even appear to have more than you really do, for ultimately your outlook on material things is more minimalistic than others realize. But feeling good about yourself may encourage you to also feel more positive about your finances. Don't delude yourself and spend more than you have because banking on future income can be dangerous."
scorpio,2010-09-11,"Your persuasive powers are strong today as the Moon returns to your sign, joining sweet Venus who just entered magnetic Scorpio a few days ago. You can put a spell on someone you love or easily convince others to see a situation from your perspective. But there is more going on than meets the eye, so don't use your charm for anything other than the common good of all. Trying to control others for selfish reasons is likely to backfire quicker than you think."
sagittarius,2010-09-11,"You may appear smug today because you think that you know something that others don't. Rather than taking the time to explain your point of view, you are tempted to bask in the superiority you feel with your privileged perspective. Don't take advantage of your position, for it won't last. As soon as everyone else discovers what was missing, the playing field will be even again."
capricorn,2010-09-11,"It's easier for you to get along with your friends and family today because you are able to cut through the distractions and be fully present in your personal interactions. It's not that you forget about more serious issues, but you are able to put your ambitions on hold while you deepen your most important personal relationships. Don't waste energy doubting this approach; you can always put your professional aspirations back on the front burner next week."
aquarius,2010-09-11,"Being appreciated for your contributions is a boost to your confidence today, especially if your current recognition is from people you respect in return. But you might be worried that someone isn't being honest and it's not just about acknowledging you. Even if political complexities exist that could justify someone's motives, don't let your fears prevent you from enjoying the present moment."
pisces,2010-09-11,"If you have been considering a vacation or a quick getaway, this is an opportune time to discuss it with others and get their reactions. Fortunately, the Moon is conjunct amenable Venus in your 9th House of Travel, so you'll likely receive the approval you want. Don't hold back; dream big and share your ideas. You may be surprised at the response."
aries,2010-09-12,"You may attempt to hold conflicting positions today as your brain tells you one thing and your gut says something else. Although you want to meet others halfway, you can't deny your own needs, even if they differ from everyone else's. Hiding what's important to you could avert an unpleasant scene, but it won't create happiness in the long run. Being honest isn't necessarily the easiest route, but it's the best policy."
taurus,2010-09-12,"Although today should be a day of rest and relaxation, you may have relationship issues that need your attention. There's no reason to put off a discussion about a sensitive subject now, for you should be able to traverse some pretty tricky emotional territory without creating any ill will. Don't worry if you don't reach a final agreement; just talking about things will make you feel better."
gemini,2010-09-12,"You may be questioning the usefulness of some of your daily routines now, and you could reach a critical decision later in the day. You are torn between a spontaneous, creative attitude and a more serious approach to things. But ultimately, today's practical Virgo Sun will spotlight your common sense over your desire to express your artistic side. Anything that pulls you back to earth is healthy in the long run."
cancer,2010-09-12,"Don't blame anyone else if your feelings are not being recognized by your close friends and family. You may not share enough of your emotions because you worry about rejection. Or, maybe, you expose so much of your old wounds that your disclosures become white noise. If you don't think you're being heard, take responsibility for your own role in the current situation and be silent until you regain clarity."
leo,2010-09-12,"You may be feeling uncomfortable with your current feelings, but paradoxically, you don't want to ignore them. You're probably in agreement with the sentiments of your heart, but you're not necessarily okay with an obsession taking up so much of your day. Instead of trying to avoid a challenging emotional drama, simply practice putting the situation in perspective with everything else that's happening in your life now."
virgo,2010-09-12,"A quiet tension between your assumptions and those of your peers can make for complicated interactions today. You don't want to compromise your basic values just for the sake of getting along with others now. Fortunately, your rational thought process enables you to maintain your unique perspective while also acknowledging someone else's."
libra,2010-09-12,"Your hard work on unmemorable chores around the house or on a complex project for your job may go unnoticed today, but this is not a valid reason to withdraw your energy. In fact, it's smarter for you to dig in your heels and get ready for a fight. Luckily, your willingness to demonstrate your integrity by standing up for your beliefs garners you more support than bringing attention to yourself for something you did in the past."
scorpio,2010-09-12,"You are usually comfortable with keeping secrets, yet now with the intense Scorpio Moon in your 1st House of Self, it could be tougher to hide your feelings. However, this might increase your anxiety because you don't want to get into it with someone over something that shouldn't be anyone's business but your own. Unfortunately, resisting today's naturally expressive flow can be harder than showing your vulnerability. You have less to hide than you realize."
sagittarius,2010-09-12,"You may be caught between the need to be seen out in public and the desire to retreat into solitude. Acknowledging your reticence to get involved socially is healthy, but it may be futile to think that you can hide yourself away now. Like it or not, others need you and you probably won't be able to ignore them. Thankfully, it will be easier to enjoy yourself in the present moment if you just stop wishing that things could be different."
capricorn,2010-09-12,"You might be uncertain about the work you have ahead, yet you're still able to quickly process what you know, develop a strategy and jump in with both feet. However, it all starts with thinking the process through and figuring out what makes the most sense. Unfortunately, the most practical approach isn't always the best one. Do your analysis, but then have the courage to let your intuition be your guide."
aquarius,2010-09-12,"You are trying to maintain an objective way of looking ahead, and your plans for the next month may be based more on cool logic than on your emotional desires. You should be able to prioritize your life, temporarily set your personal needs aside and quietly focus on your commitments at work. Being serious and managing your business is second nature to you these days, so accomplish as much as you can while you have the time and energy."
pisces,2010-09-12,"You like to sink into your feelings, yet this often means losing your sense of perspective. Now, however, you can avoid being overcome with attachment or aversion. Emotional intensity makes you rather convincing if you don't give up your rational point of view. Instead of compromising for the sake of conformity, hold onto your dreams and share them with those you trust."
aries,2010-09-13,"Your energy can seem a bit disjointed today as your ruling planet Mars explores some pretty tricky territory. You have a lot on your plate and it may feel as if time is running out. You may be tempted to take on more than you can do, yet it's wiser now to maintain a steady pace even if your expectations are high. Be patient; your work rhythm will settle back down in a few days and then you can reevaluate your schedule."
taurus,2010-09-13,"Although you may be tempted to play the strong-but-silent hero today, it's not in your best interest to keep your feelings to yourself. Even if your current tendency is to remain quiet, your close friends and loved ones will see through your facade. An uncomfortable situation at work is likely to change very soon, so it's not a sensible time to make new plans. Instead, share your concerns with a trustworthy individual for a second opinion."
gemini,2010-09-13,"If you're feeling insecure about your job, you might overcompensate and try to schedule too much into your day. Showing others that you are competent is a smart strategy, but it's also important to have some quiet time to reconnect with your inner thoughts. Even if you attempt to avoid your feelings now, you still must face them once the current noise dies down."
cancer,2010-09-13,"There is a lot of exciting activity behind the curtain today, but you aren't overly eager for the show to begin. You are currently satisfied as long as you feel safe, making you fearful of what might happen once you are in the spotlight on center stage. Your reluctance won't put off the inevitable; instead of wasting energy trying to hide, embrace the possibilities of what can happen when you shine for all to see."
leo,2010-09-13,"You have been busier than usual with energetic Mars in your 3rd House of Immediate Environment, but you might not be moving that much closer to your goals. Your frustration could provoke risky behavior today as you attempt to push through the resistance that seems to be preventing your progress. But impulsive actions won't be rewarded now; it's better to keep your rebellious attitude under wraps for a few more days until things begin to settle down."
virgo,2010-09-13,"You can present the illusion of handling matters in a highly professional manner today, but your precise communication style might just be a way to hide your self-doubt. If you convince others that you are fully engaged in your work, they will probably leave you alone. But you aren't as involved as it seems which tends to feed your insecurity. Mend your relationships instead of further separating yourself from everyone else. There is absolutely no need to create unnecessary boundaries."
libra,2010-09-13,"Your discomfort grows today, but you aren't yet ready to face an intense and possibly sticky situation. Instead, you might find yourself seeking distractions on the sports field or just by hanging out with friends. Spending time with your peers is a healthy activity, unless you are doing it to escape. Ultimately, you should be able to enjoy yourself now as long as you don't overextend your energy or overindulge your senses."
scorpio,2010-09-13,"You may be ready to start a new project but, unfortunately, cannot move as fast as you wish. It's more important now to add stability to something you already began than to jump into the next big thing. Remember, your life won't be very stable if you push too hard or too fast at this time. Even if your thoughts are racing ahead, slow down and do each task in the proper order."
sagittarius,2010-09-13,"This is a stimulating day for you as Mars energizes your key planet Jupiter, but it may be hard to keep your mood swings in check now that the Moon is back in your sign. Mercury's direct turn means that the history lesson is over, you are eager to see what's next. Be ready to walk away from your professional gains, because the real magic is not about what level you have reached. It's about maintaining your connections with others in each and every present moment."
capricorn,2010-09-13,"You may be motivated to demonstrate to others what you can do under pressure today, but it's not necessary to go overboard proving yourself. Unfortunately, a dress rehearsal performance won't show your true colors like a real emergency can. Fortunately, your cool and calculating style enables your talents to shine if and when something goes wrong."
aquarius,2010-09-13,"You may be quite sociable today as the Moon enters your 11th House of Friends and Colleagues. But your desire to share fellowship only takes you so far and you are now seeking more than just relationships with your peers. You crave a physical or metaphysical adventure that comes from going on a long trip, engaging in a course of study or committing to a long-term spiritual practice. Instead of just visualizing your future, make it happen."
pisces,2010-09-13,"Someone may be acting in an underhanded manner to thwart your progress today, but instead of whining or playing the role of a victim, you might just choose to work harder. This uncharacteristic response is strengthened by the confident Sagittarius Moon in your 10th House of Career, squelching your tendency to daydream about your ideal job while you work tirelessly to prove yourself. Fortunately, you have the determination to succeed even if there's a long way to go to reach your goals."
aries,2010-09-14,"You're ready to apply what you recently learned to something new, but you might not realize the consequences of your current actions. There are very large shifts on your horizon now as your ruling planet Mars finishes up his visit to social Libra. It's time to ask yourself what you want from others while you can still see the potential of what's ahead."
taurus,2010-09-14,"Although your focus should continue to be on working with others when Mars enters your 7th House of Partners today, you can now see beyond the doubts that limit your thinking. Instead of wondering how you can get everything done, think about what motivates your partners. Ask questions and listen to what is said, for you can learn much about yourself as you discover more about someone's experiences."
gemini,2010-09-14,"You may not be able to tell if your life is becoming simpler or more complicated. You've been able to create a schedule for yourself that allows you time enough for fun, but now things seem to be changing. Go ahead and grab an opportunity to play while you still can, for your job may not afford you so much free time during the coming weeks."
cancer,2010-09-14,"You could be quite upbeat about your job today, although you may need to work on recapturing your earlier vision. You might start your day feeling resentment toward someone who won't cooperate with you. But there's no reason to hold onto negative feelings. As others become more supportive, make a choice to accept what they offer while still pushing your agenda forward."
leo,2010-09-14,"Resolving interpersonal conflicts in the morning gives you the maximum amount of time to make the most of the rest of your day. Someone at work brings you an opportunity that looks good, but you would be very wise to do your research before saying yes. It may turn out great, but don't jump into anything new until you check the offer out thoroughly."
virgo,2010-09-14,"Your sense of nostalgia today might lure you back into your past, but paradoxically this can put you in touch with someone who shares your search for meaning. Fortunately, your memories activate feelings in the present moment. But don't fall into the trap of believing that a current situation is the same as a past one. Ultimately, you will succeed by looking forward, not backward."
libra,2010-09-14,"Today may be busier than recent days, partly because you are enthused about getting a lot done. Additionally, the cheery Sagittarius Moon wires your 3rd House of Immediate Environment, but you could spin your wheels throughout the day and still not finish much. Avoid the temptation to scatter your energy. You'll be more effective by slowing down and doing one thing at a time."
scorpio,2010-09-14,"You're at the threshold of a new dream and are very enthused by Mars' entry into your powerful sign, provoking both excitement and fear. You are quite aware of the change that's in the air and realize that you can no longer rely on your old ways of doing things. It's time to leave your engrained habits behind and try something new. You'll feel better about yourself as you step away from the familiar and into the unknown."
sagittarius,2010-09-14,"You may have experienced an emotional meltdown recently and were forced to relinquish control for a while. Now, with the Moon in your sign, you are feeling a reawakening of your desires, along with the motivation to get what you need. Don't scatter your energy or hide your vulnerability today; letting others see past your protective walls can catalyze the very change you seek."
capricorn,2010-09-14,"If you are reconsidering your long-term plans, don't forget to also think about how to set new goals and aim your life in an entirely new direction. It's time to put away your fantasies, but this isn't about giving up. Instead, detach yourself from what you want in order to make room for the necessary growth. You might be surprised with the speed of change once you let go of your expectations."
aquarius,2010-09-14,"Today is a split personality day, so be visionary in the morning and sensible in the evening. The expansive Sagittarius Moon in your 11th House of Future Dreams can alter the way in which you relate to the present. But when Mars enters your career-minded 10th House later in the day, you'll need to shift your thinking to handle practicalities instead of possibilities."
pisces,2010-09-14,"It's time for you to wake up and snap out of your dreams, especially if you've been lost in fantasies about exotic adventures and far-off lands. There's nothing wrong with letting your thoughts wander, but you have work to do now and can't afford the luxury of drifting in the impractical realms of your imagination. Nevertheless, don't lose touch with your hopes; just express what you can in the real world, for that's where your vision must manifest."
aries,2010-09-15,"Although you may act impulsively today, eventually you'll need to make a plan and stick with it. It doesn't matter that you feel constrained when you limit your options with exacting schedules and commitments because you can waste time and energy when you lack accountability. Stop working against the rules and instead, use them as guidelines to increase your productivity."
taurus,2010-09-15,"You have no choice but to figure things out today, and will feel better once you know how much work you have to do and when you'll get it done. You may be concerned, though, because you don't want to miss out on all the fun. Don't worry about the wrong things; you can always find pleasure another time, but your current deadlines are not negotiable."
gemini,2010-09-15,"You start out the day expecting things to go your way, but you may need to get serious in order to take care of your obligations. It would be a mistake to think you can simply ignore the tension that's building around you. Family dynamics and politics at work can be distracting, but you don't have the time to do everything. Prioritize what's on your plate while taking everyone's feelings into consideration. For the best results, plot a course of action based upon the good of all involved."
cancer,2010-09-15,"You can see right through someone's emotionally cool demeanor today, because you know all too well what it's like to protect yourself by hiding behind a wall of detachment. But now the tables are turned. You feel comfortable with your vulnerability, but might not have anyone around who is sensitive enough to hear what you have to say. Therefore, it's best if you can keep your communication focused on practical concerns and save a tender discussion for the right person on another day."
leo,2010-09-15,"What starts out as a good time can turn into hard work when the Moon enters your 6th House of Service. Your job can be annoying today, for it gets in the way of the fun you're supposed to be having. You might even try shuffling your schedule in an attempt to escape your obligations. Still, you must be rational and weigh what you want to do against your responsibilities. Remember, being practical is more important now than anything else."
virgo,2010-09-15,"You're in your element today because you arrive at a sensible solution to a problem and then are able to put your plan into action. Fortunately, you are quite flexible now and have limited expectations, so you'll be okay even if your desires are not fully satisfied. Accepting your current situation no matter how it turns out in the moment should eventually lead to your success."
libra,2010-09-15,"There is more complexity in your life today than meets the eye, for your fantasy life is richer than it seems. But your dreams aren't just about finding true love and winning the lottery. Darker issues can lure you into the shadows, even on a bright sunshiny day. Don't complain about how much there is to be done; just be thankful for the potential rewards that will follow."
scorpio,2010-09-15,"Carefully consider what you want to say before you start a conversation today, for the cautious Capricorn Moon in your 3rd House of Communication can bring you happiness if you're willing to be patient. If you don't understand everything that's being said, ask questions first and speak later. Keep in mind that running off at the mouth won't likely convert others to your point of view anyway."
sagittarius,2010-09-15,"You may be frustrated today because an opportunity to have fun seems to pass too quickly for you to take advantage of it. Furthermore, you really don't want to be working when you could be out enjoying yourself. Too many immediate responsibilities may have you dreaming about a vacation getaway instead of taking one. Once you have fulfilled your current obligations, then you'll be able to really kick back and take it easy."
capricorn,2010-09-15,"You're usually not that interested in appearing vulnerable, but the emotional Moon's return to your sign can surely soften you up. Although you don't necessarily exude warmth today, you still want to talk about your needs without overstepping anyone's boundaries. But even if you're feeling more connected to others now, following simple rules of etiquette helps everyone to feel more comfortable."
aquarius,2010-09-15,"Your privacy can become more important today when the Moon shifts into your 12th House of Secrets. Unfortunately, being obsessive isn't useful, so it's a good idea to redirect your energy away from your desire for solitude. Keeping to yourself is one thing; but withdrawing from the world because you're hiding your truth is entirely something else."
pisces,2010-09-15,"Don't be pulled off track by someone's dramatic show of emotions now, for this type of grand gesturing is not enduring. However, you know better than to judge anyone based on surface appearances. Fortunately you have friends that you can rely on, and with the Moon in your 11th House of Community, today's a day when they will come through for you. Although you won't necessarily receive any fancy gifts, you have plenty of support in your corner."
aries,2010-09-16,"No matter how hard you try, there isn't sufficient time in the day for you to accomplish everything that's on your agenda. You may be ambitious enough to tackle a lot now, but it's hard to ignore that your responsibilities seem to be increasing faster than you can cross tasks off your list. A social engagement can get in the way unless you set personal boundaries and eliminate another unnecessary activity."
taurus,2010-09-16,"You may be lured into intense emotional waters as your ruling planet Venus moves through powerful Scorpio and your 7th House of Partners. You might prefer a more easygoing approach to relationships, but you cannot avoid the very real feelings that are flowing between you and a friend or associate. Fortunately, being practical enables you to take control of the situation and turn an awkward moment into a memorable one."
gemini,2010-09-16,"You are now able to tap into a flow of exactly the right words to clearly convey your feelings, thanks to Mercury moving direct again. Still, your aversion to overly intense emotional displays could tempt you to shut down and remain quiet. Pushing past your own resistance is a smart idea because you have enough common sense now to prevent you from getting caught up in someone else's drama."
cancer,2010-09-16,"A partner or associate may share a difficult situation with you today, and you want to be nurturing but you might feel judgmental instead. It's possible that strong feelings associated with a memory are coloring your initial reaction, challenging you to reconcile an irrational preference with the current situation. Fortunately, observation and analysis will enable you to move beyond your limitations so you can support your friend."
leo,2010-09-16,"You may feel as if you understand your loved ones and are acting in their best interests today. Nevertheless, they don't seem to appreciate all that you do. On one hand, you really aren't seeking anything in return for the love that you express through your actions. On the other hand, a little acknowledgment would go a long way these days. Although your frustration could reach a boiling point, it's smarter to continue your altruistic efforts for now, with the hope that recognition will come later."
virgo,2010-09-16,"It's difficult for you to separate the various strands of reality today, for everyone's stories have been woven into a complicated pattern. Instead of trying to untangle the interrelationships through analysis, set logic aside and just follow your intuition. Rational thinking will only take you so far; act on what you feel in your gut."
libra,2010-09-16,"You may be struggling now with money issues, but there are larger concerns about your own sense of self-worth to examine. You might have already allocated your available resources, yet need some extra cash to purchase something for your home, take a trip or meet a family obligation. Don't fret over what you cannot do; instead use the weeks ahead to strengthen your fiscal foundation by limiting unnecessary expenditures."
scorpio,2010-09-16,You may not be aware of how forceful you are with feisty Mars in your sign until October 28. Your intensity could provoke a formidable individual to resist your ambitions before you even realize that you've overstepped someone's boundaries. It's not a good strategy to attempt to overpower the resistance. Retreat and consider what you can learn from this experience before pushing ahead again.
sagittarius,2010-09-16,"Your motivation to be practical today is based on your desire to have a real impact on what's happening. However, it won't be easy to turn your plan into reality because you could be missing an important piece of the puzzle. Instead of fighting against an unknown enemy, take the time to uncover the facts that have been kept from you. Once you have all the data, then you'll be able to make an informed decision."
capricorn,2010-09-16,"Time is on your side today as the methodical Capricorn Moon helps you to make a sensible plan and then execute it like clockwork. Fortunately, the support you receive from your friends and teammates boosts your confidence and gives you an inspirational push. Still, it's wise to pare back your commitments to a bare minimum before you spread yourself too thin. No one ever said that self-discipline was fun, yet it surely can increase your chances for success."
aquarius,2010-09-16,"If someone tries to tell you what you should do today, you're probably not in the mood to listen. Unfortunately, your plans may be overly rigid and might inhibit you from responding to the changes that are now occurring. Remember, being flexible is a strength and not a weakness, so demonstrate your intelligence by being willing to negotiate and meet reality halfway."
pisces,2010-09-16,"You are pretty clear about knowing what you want and doing what you need to do as you strive toward achieving your goals. Although your friends may seem hesitant to support your efforts, they won't ultimately stand in your way. However, what sounds like criticism could actually be constructive advice. Once you listen to the feedback you receive, you can improve your plan and try again."
aries,2010-09-17,"Acting impulsively isn't a smart idea today, even if flying by the seat of your pants usually works well for you. Listen to the message of the conservative Capricorn Moon and be cautious rather than foolish. There isn't as much of a hurry as you think; carefully contemplate your next move before doing anything at all."
taurus,2010-09-17,"You are in the flow of things today and should be able to do whatever is necessary to enjoy yourself while still getting your work done. Thankfully, others will show up to help or to offer enough of a distraction for you to find pleasure, but not enough to sidetrack your day. Do not deviate from the rules, for an authority figure will likely react quickly if you succumb to the temptations of irresponsibility."
gemini,2010-09-17,"You have a distinct sense of right and wrong today and can be an excellent arbitrator because of your ability to understand both sides of an issue. But just because you want to see justice served, keep in mind that you won't necessarily have the final word in a matter, so share your opinions rather than your pronouncement. Then give others the time and space to form conclusions on their own."
cancer,2010-09-17,"You may be more hesitant than usual today, even if you are receiving help from others. Your friends or co-workers may encourage you to think big and might urge you to keep pushing ahead with your idea or project. Nevertheless, it's wiser to proceed at your own pace. It's not necessary to rush anything just because someone else thinks you should. You'll instinctively know when to make your move."
leo,2010-09-17,"Your domestic obligations may be calling you, and they can become troublesome if you don't make enough time to handle them. Nevertheless, it's not helpful to waste your energy feeling guilty about what you cannot do. You would be smarter to celebrate a small success than focusing on what you did wrong. Taking some time to relax enables you to change your perspective before turning your attention back to an unresolved problem at home."
virgo,2010-09-17,"You may be feeling relief from the Moon's visit to your 5th House of Fun, even if you aren't sure how long the good times will last. You can tell that something's different today because of the smile on your face that seems to come from nowhere. Your positive attitude could draw you out into the open where someone else is impacted by your optimistic approach to life."
libra,2010-09-17,"Your willingness to take enough time to reflect on a personal matter can clear a path to a magical and memorable experience. Unfortunately, your resistance to change grows when you focus on your goals instead of on the journey that leads to your destination. Part of your current lesson is about control; loosening your grip on the reins will also free you from your own restraints."
scorpio,2010-09-17,"Today, good feelings can flow easily between you and those who are a part of your everyday life, especially if you are collaborating on a project of mutual interest. There's no need to force any issues or push for resolution on any open-ended conversations. Just do your best to turn each interaction into an opportunity to learn while still remembering to be methodical in your work."
sagittarius,2010-09-17,"You may be feeling more optimistic about your prospects at work now. Your current positive attitude might come, in part, from just getting sufficient sleep. However, you could have a feeling that something very special is going to happen to you today. The longer you can hold onto this fantasy, the better your chances are to make it real."
capricorn,2010-09-17,"No matter how hard you work now, your attitude could get in the way of success. Changing your perspective today can be very helpful, for you might be clinging to negativity from the past. But just shaking it off isn't a good idea; it's healthier to feel old hurts and then process them quickly instead of going into denial to avoid your emotions altogether. Thankfully, your current irrationality should settle down when the Moon leaves your sign early tomorrow morning."
aquarius,2010-09-17,"It's not easy to receive compliments today because you aren't completely convinced that you really deserve them. Unfortunately, you might confront memories that feed your low self-esteem now, no matter how much appreciation comes your way. Stop resisting the inevitable; open your heart and let the love in without hiding behind layers of doubt."
pisces,2010-09-17,"Naturally, you would prefer approval, but receiving criticism today is easier than usual because it's likely offered in a supportive manner. When others give you feedback now, they aren't just telling you what you did wrong, they are trying to share what you need to know in order to succeed. If you open your mind and listen carefully to what a loved one says, you might just hear a truth that can improve your life."
aries,2010-09-18,"Waves of emotion can sweep you off your feet today as strong currents carry you far and wide. Although you might attempt to resist the intensity, fighting your feelings could prove to be an exhausting and futile exercise. Holding onto the status quo is a hopeless battle, so don't waste your energy on avoidance or denial. Save your strength for when it is more useful."
taurus,2010-09-18,"You typically complete what you start, yet today your intentions are so strong that nothing will get in your way. Fortunately, you are drawing on a deep reserve of physical energy that gives you the stamina to be persistent, even if you face difficult obstacles. Nevertheless, it's crucial that you choose your goals carefully; otherwise you could expend a lot of effort on something that is ultimately unimportant."
gemini,2010-09-18,"You might have an extraordinary amount of work to do today with Mars in your 6th House of Daily Routine. You are ready to initiate action, but want to make sure that your plan is going to be effective. Once you've reviewed your strategy, concentrate on the task at hand as if there was nothing else that mattered. Keeping yourself on track will ultimately lead to the greatest possible growth down the road."
cancer,2010-09-18,"Your unwavering commitment to cultivating a positive attitude today enables you to accomplish more than hard work could alone, yet others may not even be aware of your inner process. It's not as if you're purposefully withholding anything; you just don't feel motivated now to give everyone a minute-by-minute commentary of your day. Maintaining your focus is a smart idea and will allow you to attain a sense of accomplishment."
leo,2010-09-18,"You are blessed with the gift of gab today as the Moon enters your 7th House of Others, yet you won't want to waste words on frivolous chatter. Take sufficient time to review your current situation and reevaluate your priorities before doing anything. If you have to finish a job that isn't important to you, just redirect your actions to something that is more consequential as soon as it's okay to move on."
virgo,2010-09-18,"You could feel as if you're at the top of your game today because you have been able to create a healthy balance between your desire to do something specific and your ability to actually get it done. Unfortunately, friends and co-workers may entice you with exciting ideas that can end up taking you on a wild goose chase. Instead of wasting energy on pie-in-the-sky schemes, pick the best opportunity that comes your way and then run with it."
libra,2010-09-18,"It may seem as if you have been given another chance to finish a project that should already be completed. Thankfully, you may have a lot of energy now and it would be wise to push extra hard on a variety of tasks. Don't put all your eggs in one basket; you'll have a better chance for success if you keep making small amounts of progress on several different fronts rather than just working on one thing while ignoring the rest."
scorpio,2010-09-18,"Your creativity is extra strong now with your two ruling planets, enthusiastic Mars and passionate Pluto connected in a useful sextile. Additionally the exciting Jupiter-Uranus conjunction in your 5th House of Self-Expression keeps your innovative ideas flowing. So much is running through your head now that there is no way you can remember everything. Writing down your thoughts is one way to ensure that you don't lose the best of them."
sagittarius,2010-09-18,"Although your close friends and family show up to give you the support you want, your primary power now comes from your own internal reserves. You can grow too intense for others today if you don't consciously withhold some of your energy. Instead of attempting to put everything out into the open, start the process slowly. Saving parts of your personal story for later should make your case even more convincing in the long run."
capricorn,2010-09-18,"You could almost get away with declaring yourself the final arbiter today in a longstanding dispute. Misunderstandings won't survive your fair-minded approach, which can elevate you into a position of increased authority. But don't abuse the trust of others by siding with an ally or making a judgment based on subjective preferences. Maintaining a cool objectivity adds power to whatever you do or say."
aquarius,2010-09-18,"You may be less worried about what's occurring in your life right now than where you are heading. Paradoxically, what's currently happening is more important than you think and can either help or hinder your progress. Although you may be looking off to the future, applying yourself in the present moment is the only way to impact your tomorrow."
pisces,2010-09-18,"You may affect others now more than you realize. You might even downplay your influence as you avoid exercising the authority that has been given to you. But there's no logical reason to resist your current role, especially if your contribution helps to move things along more efficiently. Instead of doubting your abilities, take your place on stage and give the best performance possible."
aries,2010-09-19,"You might try to get through your day remaining focused on your chores, but whatever you do, trouble seems to find you. You may need to set your carefully constructed plans aside and just figure things out as you go along. Thankfully, your enthusiastic nature could turn a temporary setback into an opportunity to bring more excitement into your life."
taurus,2010-09-19,"Your creative abilities can impress others today, but you could also get so carried away with an unrealistic idea that you reveal the inner workings of an incoherent mind instead. Both extremes can be shocking, but the paradox now is that there might not be a lot of difference between appearing competent or sounding crazy. Make sure that your radical approach will be accepted before you say too much about your plans."
gemini,2010-09-19,"Your friends or family might not be able to support your ideas today, even if you thought they would. Perhaps your allies are not even available, or maybe someone is actually opposing your current plan. Either way, you will have to work extra hard now just to prevent losing ground. Although you may not make as much progress as you wish, remember that solid communication can ultimately make the difference between success and failure."
cancer,2010-09-19,"Being busy is one thing, but over-scheduling yourself today is not a smart idea, because one mistake can create a domino effect as everything falls apart. Luckily, you can stack the cards in your favor by saying no before it's too late. Once you have opened up some free time on your calendar, you'll be more prepared to react to changes as necessary."
leo,2010-09-19,"You might not expect a money issue to hijack your day, but if a financial concern arises, don't wait for someone else to fix the problem. Fortunately, your mind is sharp now, but you may be so logical in your approach to the solution that you forget about the emotional component of your actions. You could react so abruptly that you inadvertently hurt a partner or co-worker. Stay focused on what's yours and don't get sidetracked by someone else's business."
virgo,2010-09-19,"You are compelled to demonstrate your ability to complete your chores now, thanks to the Moon in your 6th House of Daily Routines, but working extra hard could backfire on you. Others may find you intolerable because you are so overbearing, but you might not even be aware of how persistent you are now. Although your goal is simply to finish your tasks, you would be smarter to temper your desire for efficiency with being less judgmental of those who have different priorities."
libra,2010-09-19,"It's not easy to maintain your clarity today about your feelings. If someone pushes you to express something you weren't ready to reveal, your reaction might be surprisingly volatile as it releases other feelings that you didn't even know you had. Although losing your temper can turn your life upside down for a while, anything that comes out into the open now could help to clear the air of lingering tensions."
scorpio,2010-09-19,"You may want more independence now, yet you aren't exactly sure how to get it. Clearly defining interpersonal boundaries isn't easy, but expressing your uncertainty can be a first step to establishing new limits. Acknowledging the change that is on the horizon is a good start, but don't think that you have to do everything all at once. Be patient; your perspective is gradually shifting and it may take a while for your new view to come into focus."
sagittarius,2010-09-19,"Someone at home may be flexing his or her muscles of freedom, reminding you of your own restlessness. You are agitated today, like an insect before a storm. Don't try to figure out how to respond to the current situation by yourself. Instead, ask for advice from someone close to you. The wise counsel you receive now, especially from a friend or a sibling, can help you solve your domestic dilemma."
capricorn,2010-09-19,"Even if you are fairly certain about where you're heading in life, you can learn something today that causes you to wonder if you're actually on the right track. Upon closer analysis, you may realize that your concern is more about an existential self-doubt than needing to redirect your life. Being somewhat flexible is usually a smart strategy, but don't change your course now just because your self-esteem is in a temporary slump. Wait a few days before doing anything you might regret."
aquarius,2010-09-19,"Your need to be different is reinforced today with the Moon in your eclectic sign aspecting irrepressible Uranus. But it's not easy to integrate your rebellious instincts now, so you need to do something to release the building frustration. Instead of creating conflict with someone you love, find a way to express your excess energy that reduces the pressure within an intimate relationship."
pisces,2010-09-19,"You are not likely to act cautiously today, especially if someone confronts you about how you express your independence. Although you might instinctively bristle at criticism, try not to resist the good advice you receive. Responding impulsively isn't a wise strategy; a bit of self-restraint, however, will ultimately enable you to increase your sense of freedom in the near future."
aries,2010-09-20,"You aren't ready to trust your feelings, for you believe that a rational approach to life makes the most sense. You might even try to fight against what you already know in your heart. It's not that you don't want a more emotionally charged life, it's just that you aren't looking forward to giving up on your dream of stability. Nevertheless, you won't be able to deny what you want, so stop trying to justify inaction because you're afraid of losing control."
taurus,2010-09-20,"You may be more confident today as you restart a project that was recently set aside. Perhaps a dreamy moment has you thinking about making your life more pleasant. But if you take a deep breath and pay careful attention to what you're feeling in your gut, you might catch a glimpse of where your life is heading. However, caution is advised, for you could push hard only to find that you're reaching for the wrong goal."
gemini,2010-09-20,"Something shifts for you today and suddenly you know what you need to do. Unfortunately, your moment of awareness doesn't necessarily translate into direct action. Although you may be back at work or school now, you aren't feeling very motivated. Try to avoid becoming too indifferent about what you want, for it is your enthusiasm that will ultimately bring you closer to your dreams."
cancer,2010-09-20,"You have been anticipating an energetic shift and although you might think that you're ready for a new adventure, you could also push it away out of fear. It seems as if your life is moving too fast now, and that the pace is just beyond your control. You won't be able to keep up with everything if you continue to hold onto the past instead of embracing the future."
leo,2010-09-20,"Your feelings intensify throughout the day and there appears to be no way to escape the looming storm. Fortunately, you aren't likely to be scared off by a little relationship drama if it can help you to recall something very important from your forgotten past. Remembering an old story can jumpstart your current motivation to make an overdue change."
virgo,2010-09-20,"You are rejuvenated by a fresh surge of energy that washes through your life today. Unfortunately, it can be quite a challenge to figure out which way to turn. Seeking counsel from your friends or associates may not help much because your agenda is so different from theirs. Nevertheless, someone else's perspective can still give you a different way to look at the same old thing."
libra,2010-09-20,"You don't want everyone to notice you today, yet, paradoxically, you may be thinking about what you want to share with others. Unexpressed fear isn't the only thing holding you back now. You also need to establish a daily routine so that doing your chores or homework won't stand between you and even bigger goals. Even if you are unsure of your destination, practice trusting your inner intuition."
scorpio,2010-09-20,"You may not be your same old reliable self today as your daydreams stand between you and what you must do. It's not that you are incapable of doing hard work; it's just that might have lost your motivating edge as your excitement dwindled. Push yourself by getting others involved in your cause. Setting up a few appointments or meetings makes it harder to procrastinate. After you finish your tasks, give yourself permission to take some time for your dreams."
sagittarius,2010-09-20,"You might want to hightail it out of the office today and take some time at home. Even if you have a lot on your plate now, you could talk yourself into believing that your co-workers can, somehow, get the job done without you. Unfortunately, nothing much will be accomplished without your effort and expertise, so find a healthy balance between productivity and relaxation to make everyone happy."
capricorn,2010-09-20,You really don't want to sit still today because you're jumping with an excitement that just won't settle down. You might be tempted to hide your restlessness because you're not interested in destabilizing your life. But your aversion to taking risks that show your vulnerability now can block your intent to get closer to someone you admire. Take advantage of your energetic buzz and let yourself go.
aquarius,2010-09-20,"You may attempt to settle back into an old relationship dynamic today, but it's still wiser to try to push through the resistance and make the necessary changes in your plans for the future. You can easily justify your safe approach to life right now, but tense aspects won't likely let you get away with taking the easy way out. Make up your mind to move forward and then get to work."
pisces,2010-09-20,"Your emotions are drawn to the surface where you can't help but wear them on your sleeve today, all thanks to the Moon's visit to your sign. You want everyone to know how you are feeling because you think that will make you less lonely, yet you also are scared of saying too much about yourself. You could make someone else unhappy with your sad song or you could make it better by changing your tune. It's all up to you."
aries,2010-09-21,"You are eager to take the next step in your life, but still have old business to finish up before moving forward. Luckily, you can see the opportunities stretching out before you, but might not be sure how or when to start. However, your biggest problem is not how to get to where you're going. There are so many possibilities that first you must commit to eliminating the distractions. Once you have your choices narrowed down, the rest will fall into place."
taurus,2010-09-21,"Your friends may be encouraging you to push past your regular boundaries, evoking mixed feelings on your part. On one hand, you know your limits and don't appreciate it when someone tries to change your mind. Your impulse is to stubbornly dig in your heels and say no. But on the other hand, you don't want to miss out on such an exciting opportunity. Listen carefully to what's being offered and make your choice based on your own intuition and not anyone else's."
gemini,2010-09-21,"You excel at holding two positions at once, but today's tug-of-war taxes your ability to remain flexible. You can see opportunities opening up at work, even if they aren't quite what you expected. But it's hard to get excited when you have so much to do in the present moment that you barely have time to think about tomorrow. Be patient and avoid making a final decision until things settle down a bit."
cancer,2010-09-21,You could surprise your friends and co-workers today with risky behavior that is uncharacteristic of your normally cautious approach to change. But they don't understand that your current restlessness did not just happen overnight; you have been thinking about doing something big to stir things up for a while and this is your chance.
leo,2010-09-21,"Having control over your finances continues to be a struggle, especially when an unexpected expense catches you off guard. But even if everything is running smoothly, you may be tempted to purchase something you really don't need. There's nothing wrong with a little extravagance if you can afford it. However, reaching beyond your means now will only make the days ahead more difficult."
virgo,2010-09-21,"It hasn't been easy accepting the limitations that have been placed on you. Now, as you finally acknowledge your role in a relationship or on the job, something happens that opens the door of possibilities to what you once wanted but have since let go. Naturally, this can be exciting, confusing and upsetting all at once. Take a few deep breaths while you consider your choices. Keep in mind that you have more time than you think to make up your mind."
libra,2010-09-21,"The dynamics at work have been rather weird lately and you haven't yet determined your best strategy to navigate through the uncertainty. Now, however, push comes to shove, leaving you no more time to put off your decision. The time for ambivalence is quickly passing. Whatever you choose will ultimately be more advantageous than continuing to sit on the fence."
scorpio,2010-09-21,"You have spent a fair amount of time analyzing the possibilities and thinking about where you want your life to go. And although your grand scheme may remain unchanged, your plan to create your ideal future continues to undergo radical change because of unexpected opportunities that have not yet come to fruition. It's difficult to know whether or not they are real, which, in turn, makes it harder to fix on one strategy. Be patient; the truth is out there and answers will come to you just in time."
sagittarius,2010-09-21,"You may have very specific objectives at work now, but they seem less important when compared to your creative aspirations. Fortunately, you understand the difference between the two. Your job is what pays the rent and puts food on your table. But your dreams feed your soul and without them your life loses meaning. Don't favor one over the other; the key to your happiness is balance."
capricorn,2010-09-21,"You may not be able to figure out how your life got so hectic, but things may be running amok and you're motivated to do something about it. Unfortunately, drastic action taken immediately won't be of much help, for it can have consequences that make your daily routine even crazier. Although you want results right away, it's much smarter to be methodical and implement change in small and manageable increments."
aquarius,2010-09-21,"You may be bothered with a money matter today that cannot be resolved because you don't have all the information. Finding the answer might be as easy as locating a missing bill, calling the bank or balancing your checkbook. It's not a smart idea to cut corners by taking action until you know all of the facts. Someone else may be able to supply you with the information you need, so don't be afraid to ask for help."
pisces,2010-09-21,"A close friend, partner or co-worker could seem to have all the answers today, even if you don't have any questions. It's nice to receive help when you want it, but it can be quite annoying when others tell you what to do because they seem to know more about your life than you do. Losing your temper won't help. Graciously acknowledge other people's good intentions while informing them that you'll request assistance if you need it."
aries,2010-09-22,"It's easy for you to be in touch with your feelings today, enabling you to reminisce about recent experiences. But you might feel reserved about expressing your innermost thoughts until you have had a chance to sit with them yourself. This isn't about avoiding the judgment of co-workers or friends; it's simply that your ideas haven't yet developed enough to put them into words. Don't push it; you'll know when it's time to tell your story."
taurus,2010-09-22,"Pleasant social situations come up today with the Moon's visit to your 11th House of Friends and Wishes. Colleagues may even inspire you as they share their hopes for the future. It's not that you don't have your own goals, but listening to someone else's ambitions can help you move through your self-imposed limitations. Whatever pushes you through your resistance to success is likely to be helpful to your process now."
gemini,2010-09-22,"You've probably been more self-critical than usual, yet you are able to ease up and practice self-acceptance today. It may have been necessary to put in extra effort to get a colleague's approval, but now it could be time for a bit of relaxation. Although you might have things to do, the pressure mostly comes from your desire to succeed. However, a little downtime will allow you to return to your job with renewed vigor."
cancer,2010-09-22,"Giving yourself enough time to daydream today can open windows of possibilities for growth you didn't realize was possible. You might even think about enrolling in a new course of study with the imaginative Pisces Moon traveling through your 9th House of Big Ideas. If you have been longing to go on a trip, this is the right time to entertain your wanderlust. Push back your horizons and follow your inclination for something new."
leo,2010-09-22,"It could hurt your feelings if others judge you and your lifestyle, especially if you were comfortable enough to show your vulnerability. Taking this kind of risk can be a big step for you and it may bring up an unpleasant memory of some time when you weren't acknowledged or understood. Instead of jumping into a conversation and saying too much, take it slowly until you are certain that it's going to be safe."
virgo,2010-09-22,"Others may seem elusive today with the slippery Pisces Moon in your 7th House of Companions. And even if you do find the person you are seeking to reach, it's still difficult to know what is really being said during your conversation. It may feel as if something's wrong with you if you're unable to make a solid connection with someone special. Don't get too hung up on a communication snafu now, for the misunderstanding will probably resolve itself quickly without any extra effort."
libra,2010-09-22,"You're not in the mood to go over a conversation word by word today. You aren't very interested in details because attending to them will slow you down too much. But rushing ahead isn't the best strategy either. Instead of measuring your success by how much you finish, focus on the quality of your experience. Even if your current task feels menial, remember that you can always learn something from what you are doing in the present moment."
scorpio,2010-09-22,"It feels like you're doing a balancing act today with common sense on one side and unrealistic imagination on the other. This could be a tricky dance, but you can walk in both realms if you consciously stay aware of what's happening. Thankfully, your analytical abilities are very effective now and they can help you figure out the best course of action. But don't ignore your intuition because your dreams and emotions can be significant catalysts for positive change."
sagittarius,2010-09-22,"The Moon in your 4th House of Security encourages you to stay at home instead of going out into the real world in search of adventure. You aren't as assertive when expressing yourself today, but don't assume that this means something is wrong. Perhaps you are just being rewarded with time to relax and assimilate what's around you rather than having to be the life of the party."
capricorn,2010-09-22,"You might be feeling the pressure to talk about a difficult topic today but still manage to sidestep the subject. Although it doesn't sound like fun, your anxiety can eventually motivate you to start the discussion that you have been avoiding. Once the conversation begins, don't try to control the content or the direction because you'll get more out of your interaction if you're not overly rigid. Your smartest strategy is to open the door and then just go with the flow."
aquarius,2010-09-22,"You may be staring down an old childhood phobia today as something reminds you of an emotional hurt or a difficult situation. As unnerving as this might feel, remember that healing the past through awareness enables you to also heal the current situation. But what's happening now isn't quite the same as what happened a long time ago, so make sure you clarify and acknowledge the differences before letting go of your fears and moving on."
pisces,2010-09-22,"Your emotions are reawakening now that the Moon is back in your sign, helping you face a current complicated relationship issue. Unfortunately, residual negativity about something from the past could come back to haunt you, even if this is all-too-familiar territory. Consider what beliefs you are willing to eliminate in order to make room for what's next."
aries,2010-09-23,"There's not much of a chance that you'll hold back your feelings today because the impulsive Aries Full Moon urges you to say whatever is on your mind. Nevertheless, you can demonstrate your wisdom and lead by example now. Instead of telling others to act with common sense, do it yourself and count to ten before flying off the handle about something that won't ultimately matter."
taurus,2010-09-23,"Although responsibilities at work can weigh you down today, they cannot prevent you from escaping from them in your fantasies. You are free to go anywhere within your mind as long as you keep up appearances on the job and continue to meet your obligations. But if you show signs of slacking off, you'll lose your freedom to daydream as your boss starts to watch you more closely."
gemini,2010-09-23,"It's tough to keep your mind on work today, even if you usually enjoy your job. You are distracted by what you want to do in the future and may be bored with what you need to do right now. Nevertheless, following your impulses will probably get you into trouble. It's a much better strategy for you to concentrate on a current deadline than to escape into Tomorrowland."
cancer,2010-09-23,"The spontaneous Aries Full Moon illuminates your 10th House of Public Recognition and you want to be acknowledged for what you bring to your job. You could have an idea that just won't wait and your normally patient demeanor won't likely get you through the day. It's healthy for you to express yourself, but just make sure that you have your thoughts together before you start sharing your plan."
leo,2010-09-23,"Your vision of where you want to go and what you want to do is clearer now with the fiery Aries Full Moon in your 9th House of Big Ideas. It all looks good until you start to put your plan into action. It's easy to find some satisfaction in your daydreams, but you'll need to attend to the details if you actually want to make them real."
virgo,2010-09-23,"You might find yourself involved in an emotionally charged melodrama today, even if you normally try to evade such things. And although the intensity may be somewhat distressing, there is also a definite adrenaline rush when you forget about remaining cool and detached. Instead of attempting to avoid this unfamiliar territory, enjoy it while you can because your passion will settle back down naturally in the days ahead."
libra,2010-09-23,"A pushy person might get on your nerves today as the bold Aries Full Moon illuminates your 7th House of Others. But your annoyance with someone else could actually be a projection of your resistance to your own forceful urges. However, your distaste toward being aggressive turns into your perception of this same trait in others where it's easier to criticize. Instead of being hard on anyone else now, find ways to accept yourself."
scorpio,2010-09-23,"You are still on a creative run, but may wonder how long you'll be able to keep it up. You may get an extra boost from the Full Moon today, but other people's demands seem to suck up whatever additional energy you have. Ultimately, managing your time wisely is more important than anything else now; concentrating with great intensity on a task for a little while is more productive than casually meandering through your work without focus."
sagittarius,2010-09-23,"The Full Moon in your 5th House of Fun and Frivolity is usually cause for celebration, but it may be more challenging today because of someone resisting your party plans or your optimism. It's one thing to be confident, but a cavalier approach to a relationship now could anger your partner rather than endearing him or her to you. Instead of only thinking about your needs, expand your vision to include those you love."
capricorn,2010-09-23,"Although professional responsibilities may take up more of your attention than you prefer, the enthusiastic Aries Full Moon in your 4th House of Home and Family indicates that you'll try to find ways to balance work with personal time. But your boss or co-workers may not be very supportive now of your desire to spend more time with your family. Additionally, loved ones won't likely understand why you are so obsessed with your job. It's not easy, but finding equilibrium should be your goal, even if you don't reach it for a while."
aquarius,2010-09-23,"You may as well set aside your schedule and just take the hectic energy of the day as it comes. Your agenda may be an intelligent one, but changes in circumstances can make your plans obsolete and stubbornly sticking to them isn't helpful at all. The more flexible you can be now, the easier it is for you to make it through the day without having a meltdown."
pisces,2010-09-23,"You could come up with new ideas for making money as today's enterprising Aries Full Moon illuminates your 2nd House of Self-Worth. But just because you come up with a strategy on the fly, it doesn't mean that it's going to work. You may feel frustrated at first if others oppose your unrealistic ideas. However, this gives you a chance to modify your plan to make it more sensible."
aries,2010-09-24,"You may be exhausting yourself by telling everyone what you're going to do today because talking takes nearly as much energy as just doing it. At some point -- maybe when you realize that you haven't done much yet -- you'll probably change your strategy, stop running off at the mouth and just get to work. Thankfully, you will be able to accomplish a lot once you actually start."
taurus,2010-09-24,"You may believe that you're the serious one of the group now and that others aren't behaving in a responsible manner. But keeping your critical feelings to yourself isn't a smart idea because they will only fester if you don't get them out into the open. Remember, you don't need to place blame on anyone else. A more productive tactic would be to express your concerns in a kind and loving manner that invites improvement rather than resistance."
gemini,2010-09-24,Your progressive thinking can be an inspiration to your peers today as long as you don't push the limits too hard. You might not even realize that you're being aggressive as your excitement overtakes your logic. Just remember that others may take a while to warm up to your ideas. They could even become enthusiastic if you let them do it at their own pace.
cancer,2010-09-24,"You may be required to put out a lot of energy today yet you aren't quite sure if it's really worth it. Unfortunately, you might not have the freedom to say no. Ultimately; it's probably easier to just go ahead and hold up your end of a job if you're asked to help. If you give it all you got, you could even finish early enough to still get some time for yourself."
leo,2010-09-24,"It's a challenge for you to slow down now because everything seems to be going so smoothly. But your current enthusiasm may not last as a fun project turns into hard work. Nevertheless, being methodical will bring you more success than spontaneously making it up as you go along. Setting a one-week goal could give you a reachable target, but you'll still need to make a plan and follow it carefully."
virgo,2010-09-24,"Associating with the right folks now can open doors that were previously closed to you. But there is a price to pay when you're dealing with powerful people because they will expect something from you in return for their assistance. Nevertheless, don't be afraid to work with someone who will push you farther than usual even if it means facing your own insecurities."
libra,2010-09-24,"You may be caught between other people's expectations of you and the serious work that you need to do in order to honor your soul. There's no question about which is more important to you, but obligations to others can complicate your life now. Do what's required, even if your heart is somewhere else, for the payoff for your sacrifice could come as early as next week."
scorpio,2010-09-24,"It's hard to stay focused on work when Venus and Mars in your sexy sign have you thinking about something else. But it's not wise to run out on your responsibilities, even if love -- or something that looks like it -- is calling. Be smart and take care of both aspects of your life. You'll feel more balanced and gain happiness in the long run."
sagittarius,2010-09-24,"You'll feel better today if you set your work obligations aside and do something that makes you feel good. Thankfully, you won't likely face any negative repercussions from your apparently irresponsible actions. In fact, you'll probably receive more support than you expect as others experience vicarious thrills watching your antics. Go ahead and add a bit of excitement into your life; you'll regret it if you don't."
capricorn,2010-09-24,"You can see the handwriting on the wall and know how busy you're going to be over the next week or so, making you more inclined now to take some time for yourself. It's as if you've reached a breaking point and simply need to relax so you can prepare for what's coming. Don't waste energy doubting the wisdom of this strategy if it feels right to you to rest up for tomorrow."
aquarius,2010-09-24,"You're more excited about what you're doing now because you're learning something new as you go along. Although your current actions fit into your master plan to move you closer to your goals, there may be an undercurrent of intensity coming from someone who is jealous of your accomplishments. Don't buy into anyone's negativity, especially if they are bringing their fears or insecurities into your life."
pisces,2010-09-24,"It's more important that you feel good about yourself today than it is for others to acknowledge your work. Don't worry about public acceptance; it's fine if you aren't in the spotlight. Your job now is to find ways to live in harmony with your core beliefs. If you can move your actions closer to your life purpose, you'll be pushed back out onto center stage soon."
aries,2010-09-25,"There may be dissension in a personal or business relationship if your goals differ from someone else's. Unfortunately, this conflict may raise significant questions that have no easy answers. Instead of attempting to find a resolution now, strive to find some common ground. If you understand each other's point of view, your divergent perspectives can provide the fuel for what you need to do."
taurus,2010-09-25,"You may feel as if you're waiting for something to happen today, but you don't want others to know what you're thinking. Perhaps you feel more secure if you believe that you have an advantage by knowing what's ahead. But your anticipation may fade when the Moon enters your sign this afternoon, reminding you that your personal comfort is more important now than whatever you were waiting for."
gemini,2010-09-25,"It's wise for you to give one last push prior to the Moon's exit from initiating Aries this afternoon. If you have been working on a project, set a deadline and then throw yourself into it. Or, if you've been developing a strategy, try to bring your thinking to fruition and then start putting your plan into action. Either way, don't wait; the time is now."
cancer,2010-09-25,"You don't think it's very fair if you come to a situation with an open mind while someone else has such a rigid perspective that it leaves little room for discussion or compromise. However, it's not yet time to address the specifics of your ideas. First you must discuss the larger issue of negotiation to make sure that winning an argument is less important than cooperating for the good of all."
leo,2010-09-25,"Just because you can see the danger signal flashing doesn't mean that you'll heed its warning. If you have been feeling optimistic about your current circumstances because of the opportunities that lay ahead, your long-term thinking now runs into more immediate concerns at work. Clarifying everyone's perspectives will help because unspoken differences in goals can carry you down very different paths."
virgo,2010-09-25,"You may start the day with too many ideas to put into action, but as the day progresses you are able to hone in on one or two of the best ones. Your focus is strong now, with intelligent Mercury in analytical Virgo and the Moon in fellow practical earth sign Taurus. Just remember that your plan isn't the only one that will work. Discuss the alternatives with your co-workers, but avoid an outright conflict about whose strategy is best."
libra,2010-09-25,"If you have been struggling to find your place in a relationship, things may not get easier today because the Sun in your sign squares domineering Pluto. No matter what you do now, someone might make the case that it's not enough. Whatever you decide could go against the grain. It's not that you are trying to be difficult or rebellious; you simply want to do what's right. Don't let anyone talk you out of following your instincts."
scorpio,2010-09-25,"Your key planet Pluto is square the Sun today in a classic struggle between the dark and the light. As Lord of the Underworld, Pluto's domain is unconscious and hides in the shadows. It may not be easy to bring up certain topics for discussion. However, with awareness, the illuminating rays of the Sun can draw important issues into the light, where something positive can happen."
sagittarius,2010-09-25,"You may be frustrated by the turn of events and shift of energy today because you were enjoying the creativity and excitement of the Aries Moon. But now there are more serious issues that need to be addressed and yet you're reluctant to tackle them. Nevertheless, you may have to reassert your boundaries if someone is leaning on you too hard. Taking their feelings into consideration is the right thing to do, but don't forget that you have your own feelings that must be acknowledged, too."
capricorn,2010-09-25,"You may be driven to succeed now, but this isn't just about today's transit. Powerful Pluto is a long-term visitor to your sign, yet a square from the illuminating Sun can stir up fears about possibly failing. Instead of falling victim to self-doubt and worry, apply your energy toward being successful while remembering that this isn't an isolated event, but part of a much greater transition."
aquarius,2010-09-25,"You could finally get a chance to take a breath and slow down, but first you'll need to deal with a complicated matter that involves unspoken feelings. It's tricky business trying to address something that's still beneath the surface, but some headway may be gained today as long as you don't force the issue. Bring up the subject and then step back, allowing someone else to take the next step. If that doesn't work, try again, but be gentle in your approach or the door of opportunity will close."
pisces,2010-09-25,"You may bolt ahead with an idea early in the day only to realize that a more cautious approach will work better for you. Your eagerness could stir up resistance from others, even if you're not exactly sure why anyone would want to stand in your way. The problem is that they aren't necessarily being straightforward, which makes you try even harder. Don't give up, but don't push the panic button either. A steady and methodical approach will work best."
aries,2010-09-26,"You are all too aware of the difference between what you want and what you need. Your strong desires can lead you into a complicated interpersonal entanglement, which is surely not what you want or need. It can be exciting to succumb to your attractions without knowing the outcome, but it's wiser now to exercise caution so nobody's feelings are hurt."
taurus,2010-09-26,"You are drawn toward someone who isn't afraid of expressing his or her feelings today. It's as if you long for a deeper emotional connection and it's easier to move beyond your fears if you are pushed by your partner. Naturally, you might try to resist by talking yourself into playing it safe one more time. Nevertheless, once you let go, you'll be glad you did because of the profound experience that awaits you."
gemini,2010-09-26,"If you're not keeping a secret, then someone else is probably hiding the truth from you today. In either case, there may be an important topic that is not being addressed. Nevertheless, it might be better to just let things slide for now and focus on what you do know for sure. Everything else will be brought out into the open when the time is right."
cancer,2010-09-26,"Your friends may seem quite inflexible as they make demands on you today that you're just not willing to acknowledge. But don't just give them the silent treatment. Instead, be clear and let others know that they are asking too much. Once they stop pressuring you, then you'll be more inclined to offer them the very same thing they previously wanted. Generosity is best when it comes from the heart."
leo,2010-09-26,"You might not be such a happy camper as you wrestle with an old ghost that comes back to haunt you today. Just when you thought that you were done with complicated feelings of envy and jealousy, someone's cavalier actions stir everything up again. Don't be overly hard on yourself or you'll get hooked into the negative pattern. Instead, just observe your reactions and then let them go."
virgo,2010-09-26,"You should be able to enjoy yourself because your heart feels integrated with your head today. It's reassuring when your feelings and thoughts are on the same page and this gives you an extra boost of confidence. Nevertheless, you could have a run-in with a stubborn friend who doesn't see things your way. Don't press the issue; by tomorrow it won't even matter."
libra,2010-09-26,"Usually, you can find common ground or are willing to acquiesce in a disagreement. But today you could lock horns with a friend or lover and you might not opt for the easy way out. Standing up for your beliefs is healthy as long as you make sure to pick your battles carefully. If you decide to hold on to your position, keep in mind that it may take longer to resolve the issue than you expect."
scorpio,2010-09-26,"You might get so angry at someone who is being obstinate today that you could lose your temper. However, it's more likely that you won't say anything about your annoyance at another person's stupidity because you don't want to be a pain in the neck. Unfortunately, anger can turn to resentment if you don't attend to the issue directly. If you do manage to get things out into the open, a difficult situation can turn into a lovely and memorable one."
sagittarius,2010-09-26,"You have chores that need to be done today and you're convinced that you know the best way to do them. It's easy for you to inadvertently offend someone if you offhandedly dismiss a suggestion that was given with good intent. Just remember that you can still accomplish what's on your plate, even if you take the time to seriously consider a different approach to your day."
capricorn,2010-09-26,"No matter what kind of serious responsibilities you have in your life now, it's still a smart idea to set them aside and take some time for yourself. Do something that makes you smile, for this can be exactly what the doctor ordered to increase your vitality and enthusiasm for your busy week ahead. Remember, all work and no play is not what you need today."
aquarius,2010-09-26,"There are things you want to do now, but promises that you previously made probably require you to limit your fun activities. Even if you aren't ready to give up on your social life today, it would still be wise to keep your intentions a secret until you are ready to make your escape. Just make sure you remain flexible enough so that if satisfaction remains elusive, you'll still be able to make the most of your day."
pisces,2010-09-26,"You won't adapt easily if circumstances require you to modify your plans today. You are less flexible than usual now that the stubborn Taurus Moon is visiting your 3rd House of Immediate Environment. Nevertheless, you still have the power to adjust your schedule if you consciously choose to cooperate with others. Changing your attitude is key to positively altering the flow of energy."
aries,2010-09-27,"It may seem as if everything that's being told to you is in line with what you perceive, but upon more careful analysis, something appears to be out of kilter. Unfortunately, you may not be able to put your concerns into words -- and maybe that's just fine. If you do put voice to your feelings, you'll only make them stronger. It's better to hold steady and let the weirdness pass before you say anything you regret."
taurus,2010-09-27,"People are strange today and if you try to understand them by asking questions, you may be unpleasantly surprised by their responses. Even if you mean no offense, others might feel as if you are being overly critical or even attacking them. Don't stir up unnecessary conflict now; remember, one of your greatest strengths is being able to maintain the status quo while chaos ensues for everyone else."
gemini,2010-09-27,"You might inadvertently unleash someone's fears today if you overstep your bounds. A close friend or workmate may be more worried about loss of control than you realize, and your actions could tread on their territory. Since you're not trying to take over, you probably won't even realize the impact of your actions until it's too late. If a confrontation erupts, quickly retreat since nothing will be gained by turning this into a prolonged discussion. Your best strategy is just to sincerely apologize and move on."
cancer,2010-09-27,"You can't help but fear the worst about a storm that you see brewing on the home front. However, your concern over the problem could actually add to the stress, unless you actively try to defuse the tension by bringing the topic up in a conversation. Doing something is very different than just worrying about it, which will surely just make matters worse."
leo,2010-09-27,"Someone in your family might not be fully honest now, but they believe that their failure to tell you the complete truth is for your own good. You, on the other hand, know better. You understand that there are deep differences of opinion on a matter that won't come to an easy resolution from a quick conversation. Although the lack of disclosure could bother you, remember that it's not your place to bring up the subject. Take a deep breath and give it time."
virgo,2010-09-27,"It feels like one of those days when aliens could land in your front yard and it would just be another thing to handle. Events that might otherwise be extraordinary seem as if they are as plain and ordinary as could be now. Of course, this is because unusual is the new normal. Taking it all in stride is a good idea, but don't minimize something special if it happens."
libra,2010-09-27,"You are more singularly focused these days, as if you have a final exam coming up soon and you need to be fully prepared. But taking your responsibilities too seriously can lead you to miss an important experience today as a subtle feeling washes over you to remind you of how wonderful life can be in the present moment. Doing your best is important, but performance isn't everything."
scorpio,2010-09-27,"If you are psychically sensitive enough, you could pick up on messages from other dimensions today. However, even if you don't hear anything, you'll still know that something different is happening now. Either way, rest assured that you are in tune with a transformative cosmic song that's being played for you, whether or not you can make out the words. Giving yourself time and space to listen can increase the positive impact of this experience."
sagittarius,2010-09-27,"You may try to do whatever is required in order to stay focused on your work today. However, it becomes increasingly more difficult as unexpressed feelings color your attitude and get in your way. Keep in mind that you don't have to be on task every minute of the day. Taking a scheduled time-out can change your attitude and ultimately make you more productive in the long run."
capricorn,2010-09-27,"Although the steadfast Taurus Moon helps you to keep your feet on the ground, your head may be visiting a parallel universe as mental Mercury forms a supernatural septile with mysterious Pluto. Just because you are able to justify your current goals, though, doesn't make them sensible. Acknowledging that you aren't a good judge of practicality today gives you a good reason to put off a major decision until your thoughts return to earth."
aquarius,2010-09-27,"You may believe that family commitments are holding you back, but being held accountable for your obligations now can help you stay on track. Although you are attracted to some rather eccentric ideas, today's Taurus Moon is a steady reminder that there is beauty in simplicity. Fulfilling your promises isn't all there is to life, but at least it's a good start to feeling a sense of personal satisfaction."
pisces,2010-09-27,"Today's events have an ethereal overtone to them as several otherworldly septiles lure you down the rabbit hole. But with clever Mercury in your 7th House of Others, you should be able to convey the complexity of your visions quite effectively. But don't lean too much on words; you'll get the most benefit out of your current relationships if you use your sixth sense to connect, instead."
aries,2010-09-28,"Although something may still be amiss today, you can talk yourself into believing that everything is just fine. Try not to lose track of your priorities if details begin to unravel your plans. Staying focused on what you need to do is smarter than having to handle an unnecessary emergency because you were off playing when you should have been working. Don't feel sorry for yourself; you'll have your chance to relax later."
taurus,2010-09-28,"You could get pulled into a complicated entanglement today since your key planet Venus is in your 7th House of Partners and connects with mysterious Pluto. You might think that you're simply pursuing love, but you could get more than you bargain for. Don't let your fear of the unknown trick you into making a bad decision. Instead of following a hunch now, stick to the facts when deciding what to do next."
gemini,2010-09-28,"The Moon's return to your sign can make satisfaction more elusive now because all the other pastures might look greener than yours. Nevertheless, you are committed to meeting your obligations today so it's not likely that you'll act on a whim and attempt to escape. Be aware of the present moment and try to appreciate what you have. A mature approach to the current situation could be enough to put your day back on track."
cancer,2010-09-28,"If a close friend or sweetheart pushes back against your ideas today, you may be tempted to retreat emotionally. Even if you've been comfortable with how things are going, your fear of rejection could motivate you to avoid the situation entirely. You might believe that it's easier to ignore your gut than express what's in your heart, but it's not. It's surely healthier to share your concerns openly and allow the other person a chance to respond."
leo,2010-09-28,"You might feel a bit insecure today, especially if you believe that one of your friends or associates has been less than honest with you. In fact, others could be trying to make something appear better than it really is. Normally you would be too clever for anyone to get away with misleading you, but now it's also possible for your fears -- rather than someone else's actions -- to amplify your anxiety. Double check the facts before jumping to a false conclusion."
virgo,2010-09-28,"You don't know how to make sense out of your feelings today, for you've temporarily lost your ability to remain logical while analyzing what's happening. Although you try to separate fact from fiction, you're more likely to believe whatever you are told now, setting you up for later disappointment. Keep in mind that decisions colored by your subjective preferences will probably lead you astray."
libra,2010-09-28,"Your imagination is working overtime today, enabling you to be attracted to a fantasy rather than what's actually going on. You are being pulled in two different directions now, so you must be careful about choosing dreams over reality. Confusion about your own needs can lead to an unwise choice, so put off important decisions for a day or two until your clarity returns."
scorpio,2010-09-28,"It's perplexing when you recall something about your childhood, yet cannot remember enough of the facts to know if it actually happened or not. Either way, you know that there was probably another side to the story that you haven't thought about. The more you attempt to fill in what's missing now, the more frustrated you become. Your desire for the truth can turn into an obsession, so it may be healthier to bring your thoughts back to the present and stop trying to rewrite your past."
sagittarius,2010-09-28,"You are able to take charge at home or in the community today, but your assumption of authority can also create a difficult situation. Although you are sure that you know what's best for everyone else, they might disagree with your strategy. Unfortunately, your sound logic won't help to convince anyone that you are right. You may have to just let your friends and associates go off on their own to discover what's true by themselves."
capricorn,2010-09-28,"Even if you are usually astute when dealing with financial matters, you may be distracted now from your typical practical approach. If you see something that you immediately want to buy, it's best to wait a few days before actually finalizing the purchase. Although you might believe that you deserve it, impulsive spending isn't a smart idea at this time."
aquarius,2010-09-28,"You may be convinced that you're being absolutely clear about your romantic intentions today, yet someone can totally misunderstand what you're saying. Problems may arise if your repressed feelings are strong enough to color how you deliver your message. It's wise to keep asking for feedback along the way to assure that your words convey exactly what you mean."
pisces,2010-09-28,"Your eagerness can lead you to anticipate what someone wants from you now, but this isn't a very good idea. Unfortunately, you're likely to jump to the wrong conclusion without checking out your assumptions. But don't worry if you can't meet other people's expectations today, for they probably have unrealistic hopes, anyway. Instead of worrying about your insecurities, just do the best you can and then let it go."
aries,2010-09-29,"You have many things to do now, yet it seems that the faster you spin your wheels, the less you actually finish. However, awareness is the key to change. Slowing down your response to emotional news is a good idea, even if you have an immediate reaction. Just don't overcommit by putting too much on your calendar today; keep some time squirreled away for yourself."
taurus,2010-09-29,"Your anxiety rears its head today as worrisome waves wash over you, especially if you are trying to untangle financial issues. Fortunately, your fear is unwarranted if you take the time to plan ahead. Seeking a practical solution should alleviate pressures about love or money before your little problem turns into something worse."
gemini,2010-09-29,"Being aware of the Moon traveling through your sign today can help you keep in touch with your feelings. But peace of mind is not dependent on expressing every whim and changing emotion. Still, exercising caution is useful to counteract the likelihood of reacting too quickly to a situation as it unfolds. Setting your mind on one goal enables you to accomplish more than running off in several directions."
cancer,2010-09-29,"Your friends may see you as cool and calm today, but your fantasies are still running strong. In fact, your inner life could be so intense now that you need to withdraw a bit from your interactions with others. Paradoxically, this is why everyone thinks you are more serene than you really feel. Practice maintaining your outer connections while simultaneously enjoying your rich world of dreams."
leo,2010-09-29,"You can get into trouble today because your friends or co-workers might not be as reliable as you think. But it's not that they are purposefully misleading you; it's just that they may overextend their goodwill by promising more than they can deliver. If someone comes to your rescue now, accept an offer of support with graciousness. However, don't put all your eggs in one basket or you might end up being disappointed. Developing a back-up plan could be just the thing that saves the day."
virgo,2010-09-29,"There are too many intriguing possibilities pulling on you at work and you could worry yourself silly trying to respond to all of them. You might decide to give up and just acquiesce to everyone else's whims. Nevertheless, it's a better idea now to rethink what you are able to do as you respond to the changing circumstances. Since laughter is the best medicine, maintaining your sense of humor helps more than you think."
libra,2010-09-29,"Making too many plans today can end up being a problem because everything will probably change more than once. Don't bother setting your schedule in stone by trying to follow a rigid agenda. Instead, give yourself permission to respond to each and every situation as it develops. Luckily, this spontaneous approach can stabilize your day and increase your overall productivity."
scorpio,2010-09-29,"Strange winds are blowing into your life from mysterious dimensions. Your day becomes a magnet for odd occurrences that elude rational comprehension. Nevertheless, a little dab of trust can go a long way now and you may be pleasantly surprised if you let down some of your boundaries. Don't be too concerned about the current instability; you don't have to do anything except practice flexibility."
sagittarius,2010-09-29,"Everyone around you seems to be moving faster and faster and all the chaos just makes you feel like going back to bed. The truth is that you may be moving slower today, making everybody else appear impatient. Working with others is fine -- if you can catch up with them. Unfortunately, the speed of your external world could be a reflection of your boredom. Instead of avoiding the noise of the day, embrace it as an aspect of yourself."
capricorn,2010-09-29,"You're under a lot of pressure now as you reach a deadline or the end of a project. It's time to establish stability as a buffer against your desire for change. Unfortunately, you should not try to force a resolution to a conflict or you'll only make yourself more frustrated. Although you might want to experience something new today, step back and take a deep breath so you can appreciate what you already have in your life."
aquarius,2010-09-29,"You are ready for fun and frivolities now that the Moon is visiting your 5th House of Play, but you still have some work to do first. Naturally, you can't force the weekend to arrive any sooner than it will. However, you don't need to postpone your enjoyment. Instead of reasoning that someone else will bring you more pleasure, focus on your current activities with a renewed sense of acceptance. Being present in the here and now is a conscious choice towards happiness."
pisces,2010-09-29,"You are pulled in a variety of directions today, and might entertain the notion that you can simultaneously follow more than one path. But the truth is that all roads will eventually lead you to the same destination now. Entertain as many possibilities as you can and then choose the course of least resistance."
aries,2010-09-30,"If you aren't willing to take responsibility for yourself today, someone else might do it for you. But if others do come down heavily on you now, your first impulse may be to blame them for complicating your life. Even if they just want to help, it could be difficult to respond positively to their criticism. Nevertheless, you still might not be able to avoid the fact that you need to change your ways."
taurus,2010-09-30,"The plot thickens at work as your responsibilities take precedence over fun and games. There are many aspects of your life now that are dependent on others and you must take the lead from them. You may be ready to kick back and enjoy yourself, but someone else might have a different idea about what you should be doing. At least for now, it's best to do as you're told."
gemini,2010-09-30,"Just because you have obligations that need to be fulfilled today doesn't mean that you should forgo all pleasure. In fact, taking time out for structured play -- like going out to recess when you were a child at school -- can be exactly what you need to be more productive. Don't just go off when you feel like it; instead, make a schedule and stick to it."
cancer,2010-09-30,"You might want to make an important decision today that will impact others in your family. Perhaps you need to have discussions about the care of an elderly relative or the schooling of a youngster. Or maybe someone is overstepping your boundaries in a way that constricts your sense of independence. Either way, allow enough time to follow through with your domestic responsibilities so you can have more freedom later on."
leo,2010-09-30,"This is an ideal time to begin a new course of study, as today's Sun-Saturn conjunction occurs in your 3rd House of Learning. But this is not about frivolous desires to distract yourself from what's important with trivial information. Pick a subject that is practical enough to improve your everyday life in a positive and lasting manner."
virgo,2010-09-30,"You may be overly self-critical today as the Sun illuminates your shortcomings when it joins judgmental Saturn in your 2nd House of Self-Esteem. Concentrate your energy on accomplishing something that will make you feel good about your work. If you start to think about what you did wrong in the past, just quickly switch your attention to what you can do right in the present moment."
libra,2010-09-30,"Sometimes you have trouble making a final decision because you can see the pros and cons to each possibility. Today, however, you are able to narrow your field of vision so you can focus your intentions on whatever you consider most important. Don't worry about losing sight of the big picture as you balance your desire to be fair with your strong desire to get a lot done."
scorpio,2010-09-30,"Vacillating between accurate analysis of the facts and optimistic thinking can be a bit exhausting today, especially if you can't tell which is which. However, if you do get confused, don't be afraid to ask for help. Usually, you are the one assisting others, but now it's your turn to lean on someone else for a change."
sagittarius,2010-09-30,"You can be more realistic than ever while making plans for your future, as the Sun-Saturn conjunction crystallizes the energy in your 11th House of Long-Term Goals today. But be aware that Saturn can also bend your thoughts toward negative thinking. Don't be overly concerned because your pessimism should begin to fade by tomorrow."
capricorn,2010-09-30,"If you experience a problem at work today, don't just assume that you have done something wrong. Instead, look at the resistance you face as a lesson from the universe. Even if your original attempt was not met with much enthusiasm, you have an opportunity now to improve on what you did and then try again. Don't give up on your goal; instead, work even harder to prove that you really want it."
aquarius,2010-09-30,"A commitment can mean serious business today, for once you make a decision you won't be able to change your mind very easily. Whether you are considering moving to a new place, changing jobs, or switching schools, it is crucial to take your time and think through all your options before choosing what to do next."
pisces,2010-09-30,"You may have to manage some money matters today, and it could be a hassle taking care of all the details. The Sun-Saturn conjunction falls in your 8th House of Shared Resources, possibly requiring you to have a heart-to-heart talk with a business partner. Or, perhaps, you have to deal with tax or insurance issues. Whatever serious matters come to light now, don't put off handling them or they could become even more complicated in the future."
aries,2010-10-01,"You may believe that you're being sensitive to the needs of everyone else, but you might not be looking much further than your own ambitions. Instead of just assuming that others have identical goals, ask them what they want. And then, you need to listen to what they say without trying to convince them to change their minds."
taurus,2010-10-01,"It can be unsettling if others try to persuade you to participate in their starry-eyed schemes. You have your limits and really don't want to end up wasting your valuable time and resources on someone else's idea that distracts you from your own work. But today is different because the opportunity seems too good to be true. Nevertheless, be smart and wait a few days before actually saying yes."
gemini,2010-10-01,"Hold on to your wallet today because you could easily get in over your head by buying something that's beyond your means. If an investment opportunity comes your way, it may not be as lucrative as it appears. You may think that you are in control, but that's because you cannot see how the facts are being exaggerated. Double check everything you are told now before taking a risk."
cancer,2010-10-01,"Be careful because you may be vulnerable today and managing your emotions can be tricky, especially with the Moon in moody Cancer. To make matters even more complicated, someone may even believe the story that they are telling you, which makes it harder for you to know if something is awry. But constant suspicion on your part could create its own problems, so just be certain and check your facts before making any long-term commitments."
leo,2010-10-01,"Things are looking good, but don't cash in your stocks and bonds yet because your view may be a little too optimistic today. Be careful, for your current positive thinking can pump up your confidence and get you into trouble. Scale back your expectations just a bit so you won't have to face unnecessary disappointment."
virgo,2010-10-01,"You may have high hopes about a relationship today. Or, you might become frustrated and try overly hard to please your friends. It's tempting for you to expect more from your partner than he or she can deliver. Instead of fixating on the outcome, bring your attention back to the present so you can enjoy the process as it unfolds."
libra,2010-10-01,"Although you may be hesitant to share your feelings today, keep in mind that your words will convey more than you actually say. It's hard for others to tell whether you are exaggerating or if they are reading more into your words because of their inflated expectations. Ultimately, it doesn't really matter where the problem begins. Either way, you can avoid misunderstandings by toning down your message. Less volume works wonders now."
scorpio,2010-10-01,"You need to remember that there are limited productive hours in the day because some of them must be reserved for sleeping and eating. Although you can pack a lot of activity into a short amount of time, your tendency is to take on more than you should. You might even believe that you're being practical, or even cautious, but you can convince yourself of nearly anything now. Make your life easier by lessening your commitments before things get out of hand."
sagittarius,2010-10-01,Your interest in learning new ideas today might open up an unexpected avenue of exploration as you seek to understand the mysteries of the universe. You could be drawn toward a spiritual tradition or philosophy as you attempt to delve beneath the surface. But don't just accept the truth in everything that comes your way. A bit of healthy skepticism now can save you a big headache down the road.
capricorn,2010-10-01,"You could be the person everyone goes to now because you see opportunities through a very wise and practical lens. Additionally, you are able to communicate your ideas with great clarity. While others may gloss over the potential problems with your plan, you can quickly spot the flaws, too. But this isn't about negativity; it's about keeping it real. Fantasy can be your great escape on another day when no one is relying on you."
aquarius,2010-10-01,"You may believe that you have to share every detail in order to get your point across clearly, but spending too much time on the little things can actually get in the way of what you have to say. After a certain point, the more you talk, the less others will listen. Give your audience the basics in as few words as possible. They can ask questions if they need to know more."
pisces,2010-10-01,"Talking about your feelings may be just what you need today, but you'll only alienate others if you share too much. Your friends might encourage you to say more because they think it's their duty to listen. Luckily, there's no need to shut out those who truly care about you, but rambling on about the minuscule details of your life won't make anyone feel any better now."
aries,2010-10-02,"It may be easier to speak your mind than to keep your feelings quiet today. You might even convince yourself that you have thought about what you're going to say before you open your mouth. But the truth is that you really have no idea what will come out until you hear it along with everyone else. Making your point is one thing, but putting on a show to get someone's attention won't likely bring the results you want."
taurus,2010-10-02,"Although many of your friends may already be in party mode, you're looking ahead to the rest of the weekend and realizing that you don't want to expend too much energy. You can see how much work is in front of you and, fortunately, have enough common sense to reserve your strength for when you will need it. But keep in mind that enjoying some time in the company of others can also be rejuvenating in a different kind of way."
gemini,2010-10-02,"Don't worry about the rest of the weekend, just enjoy yourself in the moment, since the lively Leo Moon drops by for a visit in your 3rd House of Immediate Environment this afternoon to spice up your day, anyhow. But don't get too wild and crazy or you'll regret your actions pretty quickly. Keep in mind that cleaning up an emotional mess won't be as much fun as making it."
cancer,2010-10-02,"You could spend more money today than you expect, especially if you're responsible for hosting a gathering. Naturally, you want to make a good impression on everyone with delicious food and drink, but others may be much less concerned about the details than you are now. Extravagance can bring its own punishment if it makes you short on cash or causes you too much stress. Keep in mind that it's the company that matters most."
leo,2010-10-02,"You might attempt to build a strategy for success around the idea of only stating the absolute truth when it is necessary for you to give it voice. However, the Moon's shift into your expressive sign encourages you to share your feelings even if they don't move you closer toward your goals. It's great if you feel upbeat and want to inspire others to be happy, but keep in mind that your idea of Nirvana is not the same for everyone else."
virgo,2010-10-02,"Your keen organizational skills are needed to bail someone out and today you are happy to come riding to the rescue. You don't usually mind working behind the scenes, and now with the Moon in your 12th House of Secrets you're even less interested in receiving personal recognition for what you do. Primarily, you want the satisfaction of knowing that your hard work helped to save the day for your friend or colleague. Think of this as a reminder from the universe that you can accomplish nearly anything you set your mind to now."
libra,2010-10-02,"You are eager to show off to the world today, and social gatherings can become your temporary stage. Although you want to be seen and acknowledged, it's still a smart idea to hold something in reserve. Others may not know the whole story and you might prefer to keep it that way for a while longer. Avoid the temptation to bring everything out into the open now, for there's no hurry to set the record straight."
scorpio,2010-10-02,"It's easier to do what is expected of you when the rules and the limits are well defined. But today, there are so many fuzzy boundaries that things could get sloppy pretty quickly. Don't wait until you have fallen over the edge to figure out where it is. Pay attention to social protocols, for they can prevent you from getting yourself into trouble. It's a great day to meditate or embark on a spiritual quest of some sort, but do yourself a favor and don't make any major moves until your clarity returns."
sagittarius,2010-10-02,"You can't seem to hear the voice of your own reason today or you just may choose to ignore it. It's a rather straightforward choice: have yourself a good time or work hard while delaying the fun for another day. Naturally, no one is surprised if you are the first one at a party and the last one to leave. Self-indulgence most likely will win out, so you might as well enjoy yourself while you can. The work will still be there tomorrow."
capricorn,2010-10-02,"It's usually difficult for you to leave your responsibilities unfinished because you prefer to do the work first and then relax later. But today, you might impulsively decide to leave your tasks behind and take time off for something fun. Just make sure that you don't forget to return in time to finish your chores so that you also have the satisfaction of a job well done."
aquarius,2010-10-02,"You may feel lucky to have such a loyal partner or playmate, yet for some reason today it's tricky for you to hold up your end of the deal. Instead of being attached to someone at the hip, you want more freedom so you can move creatively on your own. However, if you can show a little self-restraint now, you might be able to find a way to balance your opposing needs and make everyone happy, including yourself."
pisces,2010-10-02,"Your relationship houses are being stretched today as interactive Mercury opposes independent Uranus. You might try to remain serious at first, but you realize that your ability to display your creative side also requires you to have fun. Don't be afraid to brush someone off who tries to hold you back as you seek ways to stir up a bit of excitement. Remember, you'll have time tomorrow to work hard so you can still fulfill your commitments."
aries,2010-10-03,"You may be less inclined to hide your feelings today, even if you think that what you say could make someone rather uncomfortable. You aren't interested in stirring up any conflict now, yet you probably won't let the possibility of it get in your way. Say what you must, but remember to think twice before you just blurt out something that you wish you didn't."
taurus,2010-10-03,"You're inclined to demonstrate your feelings rather than just talking about them as your key planet Venus forms an exact conjunction with fiery Mars today. But your actions might be misunderstood unless you also let others know what you are thinking. Unfortunately, assuming that someone else will accurately interpret your behavior could land you in trouble. It doesn't take much effort to avert an unnecessary conflict by explaining your motives first."
gemini,2010-10-03,"You could easily be swept up in an emotional current today that weaves together separate threads of your life. Fortunately, there isn't much that you need to do to prepare since the integration should come rather naturally now. Nevertheless, you can still facilitate positive change by keeping your awareness in the present moment and paying more attention to your feelings than to what others might think of your actions."
cancer,2010-10-03,"You might have a lot more going on than you let on today, even though you appear quite expressive. If you don't let others know what you need, you cannot blame anyone if you don't get what you want. You can increase your dissatisfaction now by keeping your feelings to yourself or you can use the outgoing Leo Moon as an opportunity to share your heart's desire."
leo,2010-10-03,"You could be busier today than you prefer, but it's important to stay as focused as you can, given all the distractions you face. Although you may be pulled one way and then another, it's best to handle each situation as it comes up rather than letting them accumulate. You might be tempted to let everyone know how you feel throughout the day because the Moon is in your sign, but it's smarter now to say less and let your actions speak for you instead."
virgo,2010-10-03,"If you have been waiting for your moment to say what's on your mind, weigh the alternatives and then speak your piece today. Although the idea of roaring like a lion isn't necessarily your style, making others aware of your accomplishments now might be a smart thing to do. Keep in mind that others won't think any less of you if you just stand up and accept the recognition that you deserve."
libra,2010-10-03,"You are shifting out of your comfort zone as you think about new ways to express your creativity, with Mental Mercury moving into your sign today. You might not be very clear about where you are going, but you're still eagerly anticipating what's next. Nevertheless, don't begin your new venture quietly. Give yourself permission to talk about what you want to do without being shy or holding back."
scorpio,2010-10-03,"Your feelings are quite clear today, but they could make you feel awkward if you cannot easily express them. The emotional heat of a Venus-Mars conjunction in your sign may be difficult to explain. Although you were built to withstand intense pressure, others might be uncomfortable with your disclosure. Nevertheless, it's not your job to try to fix the situation. Just act kindly while remaining true to yourself."
sagittarius,2010-10-03,"You cannot hold back the tide of desire that has been welling up inside you, but you still may not feel comfortable telling others what you want. You might try to suppress your feelings because the thought of discussing them makes you anxious. But pretending that everything is okay won't bring happiness, either. Even if you think that your emotions will only get in the way of an otherwise uncomplicated day, rest assured that saying what's on your mind is better than remaining silent."
capricorn,2010-10-03,"Although you need to complete your chores today, you might also want some downtime. Fortunately, you could get away with doing a little less than usual now, but your desire to impress others with your competence won't leave a lot of room for relaxation. There's no need to be so hard on yourself for you probably have much higher expectations than anyone else."
aquarius,2010-10-03,"It is up to you to make something special happen, even though the Venus-Mars conjunction suggests that love is in the air. Even if you're not buzzing with romantic energy today, you still can be highly creative. You may be serious but you would like to work with a playful partner now. Keep your eyes peeled for someone who is funny yet can still add meaning to what you are already trying to express."
pisces,2010-10-03,"Finalizing your plans for an upcoming trip might make sense now, but you could waste an opportunity unless you learn how to concentrate on what truly matters. It isn't that you lack stamina; it's just that it's easy to become distracted by something you prefer doing to avoid a less pleasant commitment. Don't be overly judgmental of yourself or others. Just stay aware of your true long-term goals and eventually you'll get back to what's important."
aries,2010-10-04,"It's not that you are digging up hidden information because you want to today; you may feel as if you don't really have a choice. Something isn't quite right and you won't be comfortable until you get to the bottom of what's going on; even a dead end won't stop your investigation now. Fortunately, it's very likely your gentle and steady persistence will eventually pay off."
taurus,2010-10-04,"You aren't in a negotiating mood today and will probably remain unmoved by everyone's attempts to change your mind. You are tired of hiding your motives but you still don't want others to know why you are fearful. If you are resistant to participate in intense emotional interactions now, you are not obliged to tell anyone why. Do what you can to feel comfortable while trying to avoid an outright argument."
gemini,2010-10-04,"You won't be coerced into doing anything that is outside of your comfort zone today. You are very capable of holding your ground, even if pressure is applied by a powerful adversary. Making your position clear is a good start, but don't waste words in endless discussions. You can always explain yourself more fully later on once the intensity settles down."
cancer,2010-10-04,"Your reaction to someone else may be strong and fast as quicksilver Mercury squares passionate Pluto in your 7th House of Partners. Even a casual interaction might stir these feelings and bring a dormant resentment back into awareness. Be extra careful today or you might inadvertently hurt someone as you express your heartfelt anger effectively, but at the wrong target."
leo,2010-10-04,"You may roar like a lion if you feel that someone is threatening your financial stability today. Although you may be driven to confront a powerful person, make certain it's necessary before you start something that could become quite intense. It's helpful to remember that winning an argument isn't as important as getting your point across."
virgo,2010-10-04,"Your words might be sharper than you realize today and could cut like a razor, even if that's not your intention. You can be quite sarcastic as communicative Mercury intensifies its intellectual edge in the forge of Pluto's passions. Unfortunately, your heightened emotionality diminishes your objectivity, so it's important to be as clear as possible in all that you say. However, balancing your message with a bit of compassion can also be helpful all the way around."
libra,2010-10-04,"You may think that you are being very objective now that logical Mercury is in your fair-minded sign. However, someone else's imbalanced reactions might be spilling into your life. An uncontrolled emotional outbreak won't solve anything, and it could even leave you feeling unsatisfied and depleted. Fortunately, you can soften the hard energy of the day with kindness combined with a healthy dose of patience."
scorpio,2010-10-04,"You want to express your position in no uncertain terms as communicator Mercury squares your key planet Pluto. But Mercury is in your 12th House of Secrets, raising your anxiety about how much to say and what to keep to yourself. You can become obsessive as you try to sort out how much to reveal. But the truth is that there are many ways to set your boundaries now and no one way is clearly right or wrong."
sagittarius,2010-10-04,"You may be quite certain about your decisions now, yet your confidence can turn into rigid self-righteousness if you don't pay attention to the feelings of others. Unfortunately, this could be a problem professionally if you provoke a conflict with your boss. It's a waste of time and energy to think that you will change the dynamics of the situation by rationalizing your actions. Go ahead and build your case, but don't stir up any unnecessary trouble until the intensity passes."
capricorn,2010-10-04,"It's difficult to get to the source of your uneasiness today, but an unspoken truth could resurface again and again in a series of disagreements. However, you might be arguing about something that's completely irrelevant while the real issue remains just outside of your awareness. Be smart and save your harsh words for another day after you've had time to calm down."
aquarius,2010-10-04,"Something has been bothering you and it won't go away until you tackle the problem directly. Unfortunately, you might not realize where your emotional discomfort is coming from now, making it harder to resolve the situation. Don't blame anyone else for your intensity. Instead, take full responsibility for your point of view and communicate it the best you can before moving on."
pisces,2010-10-04,"Your friends may not be very supportive today as they take you to task on an issue that you thought was fairly straightforward. The disagreement creates additional anxiety because you aren't sure that you can trust your logical analysis, even if others are demanding that you do what makes the most sense. If your heart continues to tell you something, follow its message instead of the words inside your head."
aries,2010-10-05,"You may be blowing around in the winds of fate, yet this can be a memorable day if you relinquish control gracefully. There aren't any reasons to pretend that you are in charge if you're not, and there are really no advantages to trying too hard to have things go your way. Although events may not unfold as expected, accepting what happens can make your journey easier to enjoy."
taurus,2010-10-05,"You might feel as if you are at a creative standstill today, unable to take an active project to the next step. But there's no need to let your frustration sour your day. You can simply find something else to do for a while. After your attention is sufficiently hijacked, your inspiration could return. Push yourself if it does, so you can get the most out of this unexpected burst of energy."
gemini,2010-10-05,"Your ability to work with someone else cooperatively may be tested today because your patience is rather short. However, losing your temper isn't helpful if you want to make things better. Remember, it's smarter to control your emotions now, but be ready to express your feelings later in the day after the urgency passes."
cancer,2010-10-05,"If you are holding your feelings behind a wall of restraint, it may be time to consider what you'll do if the emotional dam breaks. Although this can be exhilarating if you are able to go with the flow, it also can be very scary if your resistance is strong. Keep in mind that your rational justifications for staying put probably won't be able to prevent necessary movement from taking place, so you might as well stop fighting it and find a way to enjoy the process."
leo,2010-10-05,"You could work your way through a financial difficulty today as a money problem loosens up a bit. It's not that your cash flow shortage is over; it's just that you are able to gain a temporary advantage over a situation that has plagued you for a while. Work hard to stabilize your current position, but don't expect miracles right away."
virgo,2010-10-05,"You might have recently judged someone too harshly and now you feel guilty enough to let others know that you're more forgiving than you seem. Remember, it's hard to be nice if you are still harboring any resentment. Admitting your own shortcomings will increase your vulnerability and should help you to be more compassionate when communicating your concerns to everyone else."
libra,2010-10-05,"Take care of unfinished business today, for you could get extremely busy with the Moon in hardworking Virgo. But this lunar transit of your 12th House of Secrets might tempt you to lay low and hide your true motives. Your extra effort now may not have the immediate impact you desire, but if you slack off, you might not see any results. Be patient; it's better to have a delayed payoff than none at all."
scorpio,2010-10-05,"If you are involved with a group of people at work today, it may be helpful to withdraw and do something by yourself. It's not that you are necessarily a loner; it's just that everyone else may want to do things that don't interest you as much. Don't be afraid to set your boundaries and clearly let others know exactly what you want to do."
sagittarius,2010-10-05,"You may not feel overly imaginative today, but that doesn't have to prevent you from being productive. Make a list of some things you want to accomplish, but don't get hung up on what you don't finish. Instead of focusing on what is not completed, give yourself enough credit for what you actually do."
capricorn,2010-10-05,"You have many reasons why someone's big plan won't work, but don't let this prevent you from jumping on the bandwagon today and trying to make it happen. Being realistic is only one side of the equation; being negative is something else. Just because you can see how much effort will be required to fulfill a promise, don't turn your healthy common sense into unnecessary pessimism."
aquarius,2010-10-05,"Allow yourself to feel secure in your individuality today, even if you have reached a new level of expressing yourself. However, if someone moves in too close, you may need to create a boundary so you can maintain your sense of autonomy. Don't confuse a desire for independence with a fear of intimacy. Nevertheless, it's still a smart idea to say yes to love if it comes your way."
pisces,2010-10-05,"If your friends or co-workers have been riding you hard and pushing you past your limits, it may be time to let them know that you have had enough. There aren't sufficient reasons for you to give up your power by trying to please everyone at the cost of your own happiness. Let others know what you feeling today, even if the consequences of your words may be temporarily challenging."
aries,2010-10-06,"It's tempting to take your job-related stress home with you today, but those you love could become bothered by your bad mood if you do. You may feel like you're on a collision course with reality now, yet you can avoid a crisis by being more compassionate. Remember, your attitude affects others more than you realize, so don't spread your negativity by only focusing on your problems."
taurus,2010-10-06,"You want to have an easygoing attitude about everything you're supposed to do, but there aren't enough hours in the day to allow you to relax. You would like to finish your work today, but you won't get away with doing the same old thing. Try not to fall into a rut. If something unexpected doesn't happen to you, then it might be wise for you to step outside of the box yourself."
gemini,2010-10-06,"You might regret bringing up a subject today that has already been discussed one too many times. Even though you are uncharacteristically holding on to a past memory, others are ready to move on. Thankfully, if you just stop and think about how your recollection could cause hurt feelings now, you may prevent an uncomfortable situation from developing."
cancer,2010-10-06,"Although you want to be objective today, it's easy to go overboard and miss what's happening. You may perceive others as more optimistic now than they actually are, tricking you into thinking that everything is all right. But the real meaning of what's going on may be connected to an intent that's so subtle you miss the point. Do your best to listen to what's being said in between the spoken words so you can tune into the underlying truth."
leo,2010-10-06,An old issue could resurface today when a close friend or family member says something hurtful that on any other day would have been harmless. But insensitive words may stimulate a difficult memory. The key to regaining your composure is distinguishing between what happened in the past and what's occurring in the present. Keep in mind that you are not in the same place as you were before.
virgo,2010-10-06,"Sticking to the truth is crucial today, for your tendency now may be to turn an event into something bigger than it actually is. If you aren't happy, be clear and direct when communicating your dissatisfaction, but stop once you've stated the facts or your message will be diluted. Above all, aim to keep everything as real as possible."
libra,2010-10-06,"You may feel more vulnerable as the Moon returns to your sign today. You could even try to overcompensate and keep your interactions as detached and unemotional as possible. But this isn't a wise strategy because the Moon tends to amplify your mood swings. Focusing on work now, rather than more personal issues, can help alleviate the emotional turmoil."
scorpio,2010-10-06,"Keeping your emotions to yourself is nothing new to you, yet you may be able to rationalize your secrecy today as the Moon shifts into your 12th House of Privacy. You might encourage others to share their vulnerabilities as a smokescreen so you don't have to disclose your own. It's surely easier to listen than to talk now, unless you are with a trusted friend. However, even if you are willing to say something, be careful about revealing too much."
sagittarius,2010-10-06,"Your restlessness increases, tempting you to challenge yourself by taking on more than you can handle today. You might be able to talk your way through a difficult situation that you create, but it could leave you dissatisfied and feeling on edge. Doing more won't solve your dilemma now; instead graciously accept what's in front of you without looking for something else."
capricorn,2010-10-06,"You aren't happy if your current responsibilities are overwhelming, but you cannot just walk away from them. Promising that you'll do more tomorrow can buy you a bit of time today, but this strategy isn't wise because you probably won't be able to fulfill your obligations then, either. Instead, start early and work hard to get as much out of the way as you can before additional tasks are put on your shoulders."
aquarius,2010-10-06,"You may be quite determined to reach your goals now but a series of distractions can pull you off course. Unfortunately, your desire to be different can make it harder to work with others today. You could get so busy demonstrating your non-conformity that you lose touch with what can be gained through compromise. Worry less about rebelling against the status quo and more about reaching your desired destination."
pisces,2010-10-06,"Although you might want to escape into a daydream today, you won't likely have that luxury. Your penchant for fantasy could be overwhelmed by a series of twists and turns that puts you on an unexpected course. It's not easy to avoid your real world obligations now, but it also may be tough to maintain productivity. Your smartest strategy is to set your personal agenda aside and simply do what you must to meet your current responsibilities."
aries,2010-10-07,"The lovely Libra New Moon falls in your 7th House of Partnerships, inviting pleasant people to drop into your life today. You may strive to make everything work out, but your current lack of flexibility could set you up for a major disappointment. You might even experience a minor meltdown if you cannot live up to your own expectations. Naturally, it's wiser to reconsider your assumptions about the future, if necessary."
taurus,2010-10-07,"Productivity in your daily routine is on the rise, as the social Libra New Moon activates your 6th House of Employment. Luckily, you still can rely on your personal charm to get along with others, although you may feel a bit more restrained than usual. Nevertheless, it would be advantageous to keep up with everything that's happening at work, rather than letting your responsibilities slip. Extra effort today may not be rewarded until next week."
gemini,2010-10-07,"Today's New Moon in your 5th House of Love and Creativity is an auspicious sign and it's best to get as much accomplished as you can now. Although you can enjoy yourself while being productive, you will want more free time later on for pleasurable pursuits. Remember, the weeks ahead could bring new romance or rekindle an ongoing relationship, but the intimacy won't likely come without being accompanied by increased responsibility."
cancer,2010-10-07,"Looking into your own personal history isn't a new and different behavior for you, but today's New Moon in your 4th House of Roots raises issues that you may not have previously considered. Luckily, you're able to keep your moods in check so you can more easily manage your day. But don't get lost in your nostalgia. It's much more productive to stay present in the here and now, instead of escaping back in time."
leo,2010-10-07,"Even if you think that you know what's best for you now, today's accommodating Libra New Moon encourages you to take time to consider what others need, too. Although you may not normally be the codependent type, it's hard to fill in your schedule now before talking to those who work closely with you. Being extra attentive to your friends allows you to coast more easily through the day."
virgo,2010-10-07,"You may be required to make a significant decision about money now. Unfortunately, it's more challenging to reach a definitive conclusion as today's ambivalent Libra New Moon emphasizes your 2nd House of Finances. You could waste precious energy wavering back and forth, without being able to finalize your choice. It's not productive to be overly self-critical. Wait a couple of days to see where the new energy carries you before committing one way or the other."
libra,2010-10-07,"Today's Libra New Moon can signal a helpful break from your recent past. You are ready to put new intentions into action, but first you should be sure that you have expressed your desires clearly enough to have the impact you want. Although focusing your thoughts on a goal can set you into motion, enthusiasm isn't enough to assure success. You still must follow through with perseverance to reach your goals."
scorpio,2010-10-07,"You are usually able to keep a secret, but now something you are hiding could be the source of trouble. You may want to tell someone what you know, especially if the information can be of help. Nevertheless, you are not likely to go against your promise by spilling the beans. This predicament can be stressful, for you might feel damned if you do and damned if you don't. Put off your final choice until the Moon enters your sign late tomorrow."
sagittarius,2010-10-07,"No matter how busy your social calendar has been recently, today the energy shifts to a higher level as the New Moon emphasizes your 11th House of Community. Being with like-minded people encourages you to think about your future. Don't miss this opportunity to connect with others because you can benefit from sharing your dreams and long-term goals with your friends."
capricorn,2010-10-07,"You might take your responsibilities even more seriously than usual as today's New Moon occurs in your 10th House of Career. Your professional objectives are emphasized now, but don't just take on more busy work. Look at every new job as a trade-off that offers rewards but extracts a price. Accept additional tasks only after you weigh and balance the pros and cons of having to fulfill another promise."
aquarius,2010-10-07,You may want to learn new ways to expand your world view. Gathering additional research about possible schools and educational programs could help you make a decision if you're considering a new course of study. But don't restrict yourself to technical skills and work-related subjects; it's time for you to break out of self-imposed limits by exploring something totally different.
pisces,2010-10-07,"Your emotional sensitivity to someone else's feelings is the key that can open the door to intimacy now that the New Moon is activating your 8th House of Deep Sharing. There's no need to worry, for you won't lose yourself into the unknown. Thankfully, you should be able to maintain clear boundaries today, even when exploring the uncharted shadows of an evolving relationship."
aries,2010-10-08,"Just when everything starts to look good today, another obstacle stops you in your tracks. Maybe you underestimated the amount of work you have in front of you or, perhaps, you missed an important piece of information. Either way, there aren't any sensible reasons for you to complain. You could have seen it coming if you were paying attention. Instead of wasting energy talking about it, just take care of what you need to do as quickly as possible."
taurus,2010-10-08,"You really don't want anyone to assume that you're being frivolous and would rather hide your actions than be misjudged. You may even feel as if you just don't have anything left to say, but chances are you just need some time to consider how to best express yourself. Don't worry so much about what others think. Simply communicate the truth exactly as you see it and you won't likely be faulted for speaking from your heart."
gemini,2010-10-08,You can't escape from your own seriousness today as family issues sneak back into awareness to haunt you. You may experience an odd combination of realism and nostalgia as past memories are stimulated by someone in the present. Attempts to sidestep a difficult discussion won't likely be successful now. Engage in a discussion about what's important instead of wasting time trying to avoid the truth.
cancer,2010-10-08,"Others might think that you're being overly negative today, yet you may not see it this way at all. Your harsh perspective comes from the fact that the weak links in someone's story are all too apparent and you're not willing to support sloppy thinking. Don't try to change what you are feeling; instead, just alter the tenor of your words. It's okay to be very serious as long as you don't blame anyone else in the process."
leo,2010-10-08,"If you have been facing issues of self-esteem, today could be a turning point as you obsess about your shortcomings. Unfortunately, everyone has regrets; there are always things you could have done differently or, perhaps, shouldn't have done at all. But, instead of aspiring toward perfection, it might be smarter now to accept your imperfections, along with the simple fact that you are human."
virgo,2010-10-08,"Your logical abilities are even more finely tuned today as an exacting Mercury-Saturn conjunction in your sign focuses your mind like a laser beam. Nevertheless, don't undermine anyone else with your negativity; there's nothing to be gained by harshly criticizing their work. Instead, use this self-disciplined alignment to constructively describe what can be done next."
libra,2010-10-08,"In spite of your current intensity, you may feel as if you are in a rut. You might even feel stuck and rather disillusioned about the prospects for change. A recent disappointment adds to your malaise, but don't make despondency a habit because many things in your life are about to change. You have something to be hopeful about now instead of being sad about something in the past."
scorpio,2010-10-08,"It's challenging to see where your life is taking you these days, but you think that you might be happier if you knew for sure. Your attitude could be somber now if you feel weighted down by responsibilities that may not even be your own. Unfortunately, you may not be able to imagine a solution to your current blues. However, accepting the truth just as it is can help to transform your moodiness into hope."
sagittarius,2010-10-08,"Your colleagues may tell you exactly what is wrong with your current plan, whether or not you want the feedback. Unfortunately, they might not be very tactful now as they criticize you. To compound matters, you are probably more sensitive than usual and won't take their comments well. But don't dwell on the negative; you have much to do and there's no time to entertain unproductive thoughts."
capricorn,2010-10-08,"You are putting time and effort into your work or, perhaps, toward a community project. Either way, your optimism might be flagging now, leaving you with an uncomfortable uncertainty about your future. You are tempted to withdraw as you wonder if your work will actually pay off. Don't abandon your plans; instead, be more realistic about them so you will be able to reach your goals."
aquarius,2010-10-08,"You may walk away from previous plans for an upcoming vacation or weekend getaway because it's hard for you to think about having fun when things at work are so serious. You would rather focus your energy now on something more practical that contributes to your stability, rather than a good time. Sticking close to home makes sense; don't push out beyond safe limits until you feel as if you're back on more stable ground."
pisces,2010-10-08,"A friend may deliver a harsh message today, but you really don't have to blindly accept anyone else's point of view. Nevertheless, if you trust someone, you're more likely to be vulnerable to what you hear. Listen carefully to what others say now, but don't take it personally. If you assimilate the facts without an emotional charge, you can more easily put what you learn into motion to improve your game."
aries,2010-10-09,"Sometimes you find it difficult to be patient under normal circumstances, yet it's even more challenging on a day like today if others don't deliver on what was promised. Be careful, for you could lose your temper if you forget to pay extra close attention to other people's feelings. Fortunately, once you understand someone else's motives, your empathy will return. Avoiding harsh judgment on your part goes a long way to making your day less stressful."
taurus,2010-10-09,"If someone gets angry at you now, take the time to listen closely to what's being said instead of just reacting to the tone of his or her voice. Thankfully, your attitude makes a huge difference in how you respond. Instead of getting so caught up in a show of emotions that you miss the point entirely, keep in mind that there could be an important message coming your way."
gemini,2010-10-09,"Applying yourself more isn't always the best answer to being behind on what you've promised, but today an extra little push could make quite a difference. Even if you have trouble accepting more responsibilities now, it may be wiser to say yes than to resist what must be done. Flip the energy around by turning your negative thinking into positive action."
cancer,2010-10-09,"You are somewhat playful with the Moon joining Venus and Mars in your 5th House of Romance today. You may seem out of character to others, but this is not the time to worry about anyone else's judgments. No one has to approve of your feelings. Your need to express a more joyful side of yourself shouldn't be suppressed. Even if there are stresses pulling at you now, seek a healthy creative outlet instead of letting the energy turn dark."
leo,2010-10-09,"The Moon's visit to your 4th House of Security indicates that something troublesome could be going on at home or within your family. Unfortunately, it's difficult to put your finger on the source of the problem. Someone may be harboring resentment against you and the unexpressed negativity can turn an easygoing day into an awkward one. Fortunately, honest communication can bring everything out into the open, where the discomfort will quickly disperse."
virgo,2010-10-09,"Your current intensity may be upsetting to others because they don't understand that you just want to figure out what's happening. You cannot help it if you become overly insistent, or even pushy, as you get close to the truth. A smarter strategy might be to explain that you need to make choices about your future and then ask for help. When those around you are invested in your process, it may be easier on everyone involved."
libra,2010-10-09,"You must calculate how much energy you have to give to others now because you don't want to overstep your limits. However, getting excited about something that resonates with you can change everything, and all of a sudden you could volunteer to do more than you should. Be careful about being too impulsive. Take your time when making any decisions about your future."
scorpio,2010-10-09,"You may appear highly passionate now that the Moon's back in your sign. Everyone appears to give you space in your interactions with them because they don't know how to handle you. Paradoxically, it's easier for you to express your vulnerability today, but you still might not be able to see the source of their discomfort. Nevertheless, it's a good strategy to tone down your intensity if you notice anyone withdrawing from you as you speak."
sagittarius,2010-10-09,"Even if most people see you as quite charming now, there are issues you're not sharing as the Moon hides away in your 12th House of Secrets. You aren't being dishonest because withholding your feelings isn't quite the same thing as telling the whole truth. Naturally, it's up to you to decide how much to disclose, but keeping too much to yourself could sour a sweet situation."
capricorn,2010-10-09,"You may be a formidable opponent because you know what you have to do today and are willing to get it done at any cost. Luckily, you can communicate your vision clearly now, enabling you to gather allies around you that can assist you in your cause. Keep in mind that you still may need to negotiate; just because you're right doesn't mean that yours is the only path to success."
aquarius,2010-10-09,"Too much physical energy can be difficult to handle today, but it also may be exactly what you need to get the job done. You have natural reserves of willpower that you can draw on when you need them. However, you could be too aggressive in a situation that doesn't actually require much force. Knowing when to lighten up can be your greatest strength now."
pisces,2010-10-09,"You are ready for a big adventure today and you might just get what you want. You could be presented with an unexpected opportunity to demonstrate your power, but you must stand up and take control. Even if you aren't usually a forceful person, you are better able to assert yourself now. Decide what you want and then go for it while the chance is still yours."
aries,2010-10-10,"It's not easy for you to remain quiet today, even if you know that your point of view won't necessarily be appreciated by anyone else. You are motivated to get your thoughts out into the open now, but keep in mind that you can go overboard in your presentation which could detract from your overall message. Make your point and then close your mouth so you can listen."
taurus,2010-10-10,Today you want to dig into an intense topic of discussion that you were previously avoiding. Your apprehension quickly disappears now because you are eager to have your words heard since you know that they can have a powerful impact. Don't forget to give everyone plenty of time to adjust to what you say before moving on to the next topic.
gemini,2010-10-10,"You can find a balance now between your easygoing style and a more direct approach to emotional disclosure. It's important for you to know that others can see past your clever wit and into your soul today, so resist telling the next joke or funny story to lighten the conversation. Sink into the depths of your heart and just feel what's going on for a change."
cancer,2010-10-10,"There's no getting around the fact that your feelings are especially strong today. You want to discover the mysterious unknown, but you are prevented from becoming overly esoteric now. It helps if you voluntarily come back to the more mundane side of things. A straightforward approach can produce amazing results."
leo,2010-10-10,"You might think that you would be happier if there were no shadows at all, but the darker places of mystery are crucial to understanding the full spectrum of living. You may even take it upon yourself now to bring something out into the open, where its power could be diminished. Keep in mind that it's not nice to betray someone else's trust. Treat their secrets as if they were your own."
virgo,2010-10-10,"You sometimes have a hard time trusting the do-gooders and the new-agers who want to talk about psycho-spiritual issues that you consider to be private matters. Your philosophy may lean toward the idea of disclosing the basic principles and nothing more, yet now you are tempted to come clean about something you've kept to yourself. Start slowly or you may reveal much more than you intend."
libra,2010-10-10,"You may be at the height of your social power now as you take the initiation to launch a conversation about something you've been avoiding. Fortunately, there isn't much you won't discuss today, as long as you're sharing your story with someone you already trust. But be cautious of your tendency to slip into Pollyanna mode. You really don't need to make anything sound better than it is. The truth is good enough on its own."
scorpio,2010-10-10,"It's easier to make an important choice now than it was yesterday. But it's crucial to decide today because it will begin to get crazy in a day or two, once again. Physical Mars is being pushed around by the power of Pluto, allowing you to benefit from conversations that slip beneath the obvious and apparent surface distractions. Dig deep to uncover the information you need to make up your mind."
sagittarius,2010-10-10,"Rituals and ceremonies may be intriguing now as you remember a religious tradition from your past or learn about a new ceremony based upon a different spiritual path. You might want to get others to join you in your spiritual exploration, but you have some explaining to do first. The problem is that your intensity can be too much for everyone to handle. Instead of waiting for someone to ask you to stop talking, take it upon yourself today to limit your words to only those necessary to make your point."
capricorn,2010-10-10,"Your intentions are strong, but excessive talking will scatter your thoughts all over the map now. Don't just go with the flow today; make a schedule and then follow it as best you can. This little strategy enables you to stay on point while preventing you from meandering around the outer limits of your mind and revealing more about yourself than you should."
aquarius,2010-10-10,"There may have been a recent misunderstanding or a mistake, which adds pressure to your relationships. If others have something to say to you, find the time to listen and then you can share your feelings, too. It could become more complicated, but remember, it will get harder still over the next few days. Keep your life in a healthy balance because your mind is looking at the world through a special lens now that blurs much of the details."
pisces,2010-10-10,"You may feel anxious today if you lose your train of thought in the middle of a conversation. Don't waste too much time practicing what you want to say, for excessive preparation can actually work against you now. There's no need for using a teleprompter or memorizing a speech about a particular topic. Let your passion lead your words; you'll be much more convincing if you do."
aries,2010-10-11,"You may not be feeling very innocent today. Although your positive approach to life helps you get through the stress, you know there's a big shift in the works, making it nearly impossible to discern what's coming next. Nevertheless, don't be afraid to share what's in your heart, even if you scare yourself. Stick to the truth and your fears will dissipate soon enough."
taurus,2010-10-11,"You are at a rather significant turning point in your life, yet you still want to believe that you can keep things going just as they are. The fact is that something needs to change. Even if you've been able to manage the tension up to this point, now your emotions are becoming too volatile to contain. Embracing the unknown instead of resisting it should help to make things easier for all involved."
gemini,2010-10-11,"You are coming to the end of a challenging time, but you won't be able to shift the energy back to normal all at once. Accept that there could be a lot at stake in a relationship these days, but don't try to force your will on anyone else. Unfortunately, the more you attempt to control the outcome, the more distant you grow from your goals. Express your passions and remain open to the possibilities ahead."
cancer,2010-10-11,"Your heart is fully engaged, making it tough to be casual about your feelings. Complications arise from your insistent concentration on the big picture today while you keep getting dragged back into the details. It's challenging to maintain a positive attitude if loose ends unravel. Do the best you can for now; the intensity will begin to subside in just a day or two."
leo,2010-10-11,"It's difficult to let go of your unexpressed feelings that still linger beneath the surface. Personal drama arises over and over again, like the legendary Phoenix flying out of the fire. Just when you are ready to move on, a reminder dredges up a wave of powerful emotions. Don't waste your energy on fighting against the prevailing currents; instead navigate with your heart to work with, not against, the natural tides."
virgo,2010-10-11,"Your changing moods swing from focusing on the tiniest details of the day to pondering universal concepts that seem to take you beyond the pragmatic workings of your life. Unfortunately, either extreme is tricky territory. Thankfully, as you move back and forth between practice and theory, between the specific and the general, you learn something about yourself that you can apply to your everyday life later on."
libra,2010-10-11,"Your life may be quite noisy today and there's little you can do to create the relaxing atmosphere you prefer. But it's not that you are having such a tough time; it's just that everything seems overly intense these days. Give yourself permission to feel the rising tide of emotions, even if you aren't as easygoing as others expect. You don't always have to be the one who makes everything alright."
scorpio,2010-10-11,"You are being pulled in two directions today. You can see the more positive aspects of your life. Everything is fine and yet you still want to understand your role in the big picture, rather than feeling the need to make your own movie. Nevertheless, you are dissatisfied with some aspects of your life that you cannot easily change. Your current happiness depends on your ability to acknowledge what is beyond your control. Don't waste time trying to chase unrealistic goals; concentrate on the joy within reach."
sagittarius,2010-10-11,"You may feel as if your heart is being bounced about by random circumstances today. You truly love the idea of adventure, yet you also dream of quieter times that allow you to relax and enjoy the beauty of your journey. Don't waste time on nostalgia or restless fantasies. You have something to do right now while your emotions are intense. Keep breathing; calmer weather is on the way."
capricorn,2010-10-11,"Your inner turmoil may not be very obvious today, but that doesn't mean it's nonexistent. You may believe that you are heading into unknown territory because you don't know what others are feeling. The more you attempt to fill in the missing pieces of the puzzle, the more anxious you become now. Take a few deep breaths and then let go of your need to solve everything in one day."
aquarius,2010-10-11,"You want to be accepted by those in your community, but you might think that they don't even know the real you. Acknowledging your role in this situation is crucial, because you may be hesitant to share your inner world if you worry too much about not being liked. Your fear of rejection may be more problematic than what you won't share. Taking a risk by showing your vulnerability may not be an easy path, but it's a start toward emotional fulfillment."
pisces,2010-10-11,"You want to be needed and appreciated at work now, but you might not be willing to put in the extra time necessary to do an outstanding job. You are torn between your inner and outer worlds today, and yet you want to take care of people's expectations. Pleasing others sounds so easy at first, but it becomes more complicated once you actually begin the work. Don't make any commitments you cannot keep; only say yes if you truly mean it."
aries,2010-10-12,"You have big plans and the more you think about them, the bigger they become. You're excited about the prospects of an upcoming event, but you do need to be careful. It's possible that you have put so much thought into what might happen that you cannot live up to your own expectations, even if all goes well. Dream large, but don't be disappointed if reality falls short of perfection."
taurus,2010-10-12,"Deep feelings continue to stir from the hidden depths of your subconscious, and you see no reason now to hold them back. Your key planet Venus is pushed to reach further than normal as she aspects unorthodox Uranus. Your restlessness with your current life encourages you to say yes, even if you're not sure that you really understand the question."
gemini,2010-10-12,"Someone may encourage you to try something totally different today, but you shouldn't agree to anything that isn't consistent with your desires. Instead of attempting to please anyone else now, it's smarter for you to pull back your energy until you know what you want. Otherwise, you'll just end up chasing your tail with no hope of real satisfaction."
cancer,2010-10-12,It's challenging for you to think small today because every good idea that finds its way to you is grist for your magnifying mill. The Moon's square to inflationary Jupiter from your 6th House of Work could have you turning every little task into a major production. Keep in mind that your eagerness for excitement can make your life more complicated unless you consciously pare back your plans throughout the day.
leo,2010-10-12,"If romance is in the air now, it's partly because you're in such a playful mood. You should be able to get a lot of mileage out of the dynamic aspect from beautiful Venus to electric Uranus. Creativity can take you into magical territory today as long as you don't resist the impulse to try something entirely new."
virgo,2010-10-12,"You may experience anxiety over having to move too quickly on your feelings today. You would rather slow down and analyze all your options, but it seems as if there's no time for rational thinking now. Instead, shoot from the hip without taking careful aim. Don't worry about hitting your target the first time; just make sure you're facing in the right direction. It may take several attempts to reach your goal."
libra,2010-10-12,"You are quite capable now of coming up with an idea and then getting others to cooperate with you in its execution. However, there is a possible pitfall to your success. If you take on a project that's too big or gloss over important details, you'll run into trouble soon enough. Remember, scaling back your promises before you make them is better than disappointing others when you cannot meet the expectations you set."
scorpio,2010-10-12,"You have high hopes built up around money these days, but there are significant details that must be handled before you can have what you want. There's nothing insurmountable that's preventing you from realizing your highest potential; your only real obstacle left is you. When you realize that you can do anything, you'll be able to make the smartest choices about what's truly worthwhile."
sagittarius,2010-10-12,"Your positive attitude at work continues to earn you more freedom. But you could take your upbeat demeanor too far today, inadvertently making yourself unbelievable if you consistently overstate your case. Let others know how you feel, but don't try to convince them that you are right. Let your bold actions speak for themselves."
capricorn,2010-10-12,"You may think that you have something to hide now that the Moon is visiting your 12th House of Secrets. But chances are that everyone knows more than you think they do. You can make matters worse if you believe that others want the same things as you. The truth is that your desires are stretched out of whack, so don't make any long-term decisions today. You'll be back to your sensible self by tomorrow."
aquarius,2010-10-12,"You would rather be socializing with your friends today than working hard. Meeting your responsibilities may not be negotiable, but once you are finished with your daily tasks, you'll have plenty of time to connect with others via phone, in person or online. How the contact is made is less important than staying in touch with those you love."
pisces,2010-10-12,"The Moon traveling through your 10th House of Career indicates how much of your attention is directed at work now. But you still should reserve some of your time and energy to think about what you want in the future. Taking care of business is more about the here and now, even if the consequences of your actions could take some time yet to bear fruit. You may be impatient today, but trying to rush success won't be helpful in the long run."
aries,2010-10-13,"You are pulled between two different approaches today. On one hand, you have work that must be completed because others are depending on you to follow through on your promises. On the other hand, you have your own desires that cannot be easily suppressed. Instead of trying to ignore your needs, try a balancing act between the two extremes. Don't blow off your responsibilities, but be sure to schedule some time to explore your dreams, too."
taurus,2010-10-13,"You want a deep and meaningful connection now that the Moon is traveling through your 9th House of Higher Truth. It might help to find someone who can lift your spirits today. However, it's not easy to let go of your relationship concerns, which could place unnecessary boundaries between you and your special friend. Instead of allowing your fears to get in the way, talk about your feelings. Once the ice is broken, take the path the opens up."
gemini,2010-10-13,"It's difficult if you are attracted to someone today because unchangeable circumstances prevent you from sharing everything that's in your heart. Unfortunately, you have to pay extra careful attention to what you say or you could create an uncomfortable situation. Keep in mind that there's more time than you think. If you sense any awkward energy, just let it rest for a day or two before reactivating any romantic pursuit."
cancer,2010-10-13,"You are challenged to figure out what to do today because your natural rhythm is disrupted by something that is completely out of your control. Naturally, your positive attitude can help, but you must settle for less comfort than you normally prefer. Keep in mind that whatever occurs now is a small part of the larger shift that will take months to process."
leo,2010-10-13,"Even if you're certain about what you want, it's not easy to determine the most reliable way to get it. Your thoughts may become stuck on sweet pleasures that are hard to come by at this time. You might think that everything will ultimately be okay, but you're still challenged by your own insecurities and doubts about how to proceed in your pursuit of happiness. Don't be distracted by external circumstances now; seek joy from within instead."
virgo,2010-10-13,"You may feel safe and secure in your unflappable self-discipline today. Your current commitments actually give you a solid framework of safety creating the limits that are already being placed upon your time. Even if you want more than you have now, it's easy for you to settle back into the security of your predetermined schedule. Remember not to rush the changes until you are really ready."
libra,2010-10-13,"Your key planet Venus is retrograde now, making it temporarily challenging for you to find peace. You may feel like you've been on an emotional see-saw long enough and are growing weary of the tension that exists in your life. But jumping off a ride when it's moving is significantly harder than getting on it when it's still. Keep your hopes and dreams alive, but proceed slowly so you don't upset the current balance."
scorpio,2010-10-13,"You have big ideas about what you can achieve now, but there seems to be many hurdles to jump over. You could get what you want if you are prepared to stay focused on your long-term goals rather than a quick fix to an unstable situation. Remember, grandiose thinking is not a problem as long as you make certain that it's supported by sufficient facts."
sagittarius,2010-10-13,"The truth could turn into a storm today, and if it does, it's probably not as bad as you think. This could be your big chance to see things as they are, rather than as you wish them to be. When your dreams diverge from reality, it's crucial to know the details so you can make intelligent decisions. Pay attention to the little signs as you look for clues about what to do next."
capricorn,2010-10-13,"Change is in the air, especially with the Moon back in productive Capricorn, but circumstances beyond your control make you nervous. You want to stabilize things, but there's too many unrelated events happening simultaneously. Instead of frustrating yourself by trying to do the impossible, concentrate on how you react to what's happening. Your life will surely get easier once you give up the idea of being in charge of everything."
aquarius,2010-10-13,You may want to relax or meditate today but you could experience disappointment when you realize that you're unable to stop your mind from spinning around and around in circles. There is too much going on now that you aren't willing to completely let go. Don't be so hard on yourself. Practicing self-acceptance is your best path to inner peace.
pisces,2010-10-13,"You want to put your best foot forward today, but you keep falling short because you get caught up in the middle of everyone else's dramas. If you attempt to retreat, others grow concerned about your well-being -- which, in turn, adds to the intensity you are ultimately trying to avoid. Keep in mind that out at the edge of your noisy life, a deeper stability is beginning to emerge if you simply let it happen."
aries,2010-10-14,"Even if you are tempted to take a risk at work today, it's probably not a good idea. It's a smarter strategy now to stick with the tried and true plan, rather than following a whim. Socializing may be more fun, but your productivity will suffer if you wander away from your chores. Set a steady pace early in the day and be as methodical as you can. If you get a lot done, you can always be spontaneous tomorrow."
taurus,2010-10-14,"You may be very serious when you tell someone that you're going to take an extended vacation to a secluded tropical island or some other luxurious location. Even if your idea seems preposterous to others, your fierce determination might just find a way to make it work. If anyone gives you a hard time about your dream, be selective enough to keep some of your plans to yourself. Save the details for a trusted friend or the person you wish to be your travel companion."
gemini,2010-10-14,"Your unrelenting approach today could turn the most pleasing person in your life into an ornery antagonist. Just when you think that you have everything figured out, the emotional dynamics could shift, proving your assumptions wrong. Unfortunately, you cannot just hold on to the status quo. Your relationships are in flux now, as are your feelings. Prevent regret by giving yourself some time for reflection before making any big decisions that can't be changed."
cancer,2010-10-14,"You may not be prepared to make so many changes so quickly today, but you will have to do whatever it takes to hold it together until help arrives. Your feelings of insecurity could rise to the surface, only to be buried again as you are distracted by external events. If you have previously chosen to suppress your emotions, you now have an opportunity to shift gears and do things differently."
leo,2010-10-14,"The Sun's quintile with potent Pluto reminds you that nearly anything is possible with good planning and smart execution. Unfortunately, you can still run into problems today because of the inherent instability in your relationships. Instead of claiming that you can accept the outcome whatever it may be, give yourself permission to state what you want, so at least you know that you tried."
virgo,2010-10-14,"You are more serious about love today, but, fortunately, your cautious attitude won't get in the way of romance. Actually, your calm demeanor may make you very appealing to someone you like. The more responsibly you act now, the easier it will be for others to find reasons to love you. As always, just being yourself is your best strategy."
libra,2010-10-14,"It's a struggle for you to keep quiet today because you may have more to say than those around you. It's not like you have any perfect answers, but at least you can see where the lines of tension have been drawn. Don't shy away from the stressful points. Go through them one by one and work things out the best you can."
scorpio,2010-10-14,"You are ready to try something different if you think it may bring you happiness today. You don't want to sit by and wait for life to happen; instead use these days to push through your resistance to change. Don't worry, even if you aren't sure about your destination; for now, any forward movement is better than returning to the past. It's not time to be overly cautious. Take a few deep breaths and then boldly follow your intuition."
sagittarius,2010-10-14,"You are able to make everything look easy today, but you're probably stressing a lot more than anyone realizes. These aren't easy times because you can see divergent paths, yet neither option is perfect. Eventually, you will have to stop the analysis process and just make a choice. Remember, it's usually best to choose love over fear."
capricorn,2010-10-14,"The Moon in your sign is stressed by a square to the Sun today, but this cosmic crisis probably won't slow you down. However, you still might not be completely ready to move to the next level. You may be inadvertently clinging onto an old and worn out habit that becomes more trouble than it's worth. Don't focus on your immediate happiness. Instead, concentrate on your future goals because they can hold your attention for a much longer period of time."
aquarius,2010-10-14,"You may think you have a trick or two up your sleeve today, but you may actually be missing a few cards. Although you are at the top of your game when it comes to negotiation, you might settle for less than you deserve. Don't be afraid to ask for what you want. If you believe that someone is covertly exerting pressure on you, don't sweep it under the rug. Bringing feelings out into the open now is the only logical way to go."
pisces,2010-10-14,"You might attempt to hold on to your long-term goals so tightly that you don't leave room for new opportunities to enter your life. You are able to feel the stress between the potential payoff of taking a chance and the loss of security that comes from leaving stability behind. Fortunately, if you trust your hunches, your kindness will shine through, which in turn encourages others to support you."
aries,2010-10-15,"Discussions with others might take you places you weren't expecting today, but you should be ready to step into new emotional territory. Usually, exploring uncharted realms is easy because you like the idea of going somewhere new. Still, you may grow anxious now when you realize you're really on unfamiliar ground. Be courageous and face your fears; the results will be well worth your effort."
taurus,2010-10-15,"You want to be practical today but your attempts may be futile as you are lured into an uncertain adventure. Logic cannot explain the intensity of your passion, yet all is just as it should be now. Intellectualizing what's happening will only take you so far. Your current lesson is about honoring your feelings, whether they are rational or not."
gemini,2010-10-15,"There are lots of ways to express your creativity today and you would be wise to explore as many of them as you can. Your need for variety enables you to shine as you experiment with different modes of communication. But you could run into trouble if someone thinks that one of them is the best approach, for he or she might want you to use that method alone. Thankfully, you are now dancing to the unique beat of your own drum, so don't compromise your lifestyle for anyone else."
cancer,2010-10-15,"You may realize that your sensitivity is a mixed blessing today, for you cannot avoid feeling someone else's discomfort with your emotional expression. When you understand that this is not about personal rejection, you may be able to grant him or her the necessary freedom for a new kind of love to blossom. Learning how to give others space can actually bring them closer to you in the long run."
leo,2010-10-15,"It's your chance to step beyond your old limits today which means it may be easier for you to entertain a relationship with less of a commitment because you are feeling more emotionally secure. Exploring your passions could lead you in an unexpected direction if you have the courage to remain open to change. Communication is a key to the locked door to love, but you'll have to let go of what you once thought was true."
virgo,2010-10-15,"The details of your daily life are now being emphasized, which, needless to say, isn't that unusual for you. But your regular routine isn't necessarily the same old thing these days as you seek ways to reinvent yourself to prevent boredom from settling in. Don't be afraid to shake things up, for the invigoration you can feel should outweigh any fear of change."
libra,2010-10-15,"You are usually graceful as you sidestep complex issues, even if they stretch your feelings into disquieting places. However, you may be more eager today to experience the emotional edge. Acknowledging your inner rebel goes a long way toward feeling confident while pushing the envelope. Remember, it's not about being safe now; it's about taking a risk in order to have a memorable experience."
scorpio,2010-10-15,"Your key planet Pluto quintiles quicksilver Mercury today to stimulate a hidden feeling or to put you in touch with a part of yourself that you buried long ago. Even if you aren't able to talk about this profound experience with anyone else, it will still impact your life. What's more significant is your willingness to go on an intense transformational journey that is yours alone."
sagittarius,2010-10-15,"Your path toward your goals takes an unexpected detour today when you realize that something is just too important to ignore. You might not take any noticeable action yet, but it's still an excellent idea to consider changing your priorities to honor your need for spiritual meaning. More conventional measures of success are not of interest to you now. Don't waste your energy telling anyone about your change of heart until you are more comfortable with explaining what you want."
capricorn,2010-10-15,"You could get a taste of the intense times that still lay ahead for you. Today's little ""fast forward"" may be instrumental as you try to figure out what you want to do next. But don't make any crucial decisions yet, for you haven't had sufficient time to explore the different paths that have just opened. Instead, remain open to where you are going; you should have plenty of time later to make a more informed choice."
aquarius,2010-10-15,"You don't like it when your moods change so drastically because you can't settle into enjoying the pleasures that, otherwise, seem so close. Although your current restlessness may get in the way of being happy, there's little you can do to change your dissatisfaction today. It's better to mischievously stir things up instead of suppressing movement. Ultimately, this can reestablish balance faster and assure a newfound stability."
pisces,2010-10-15,It may appear as if you are focusing your attention on the outer world as you take care of the inner work that's even more important now. It's like you're putting up a smokescreen to throw others off course. Enjoy your metaphysical excursion; when you return to the real world you can choose what you wish to share with others.
aries,2010-10-16,"You may get tired of all the noise today, for it seems that everyone has something to say to you. However, the sheer volume of communication isn't the problem since conversations won't take you where you want to go. It could become exhausting to get things back on track. You might think you don't have time for this level of powerful intensity. But once you get over your own resistance, a surprisingly wonderful experience could await you."
taurus,2010-10-16,"It's unsettling when you aren't in control of your feelings, especially when so many people seem to infringe on your solitude. But don't be overly worried if you aren't satisfied with what you have today. Even if you're seeking something more, you may not know what it is. Give it time; things will make more sense in the next few days."
gemini,2010-10-16,"Although you might truly enjoy your work, you could be stressed if your job doesn't offer you the security you need. Thankfully, the positive benefits outweigh your concerns of instability or uncertainty. It's likely that your responsibilities are changing and you'll feel better once you clearly know your new direction. In the meantime, holding on to the past can prevent the next step of your future from unfolding. Practice staying in the present moment to cultivate a peaceful attitude."
cancer,2010-10-16,"You don't know which way to turn because you can't resolve your natural desire for emotional connection with your newly found taste for independence. This is unfamiliar ground, for you usually feel more secure when you are in a fully committed relationship. Don't push away your feelings, even if they raise unresolved issues. There's no time like the present to face your fears."
leo,2010-10-16,"You wish you had more time to spend at home with your family now, but you aren't so keen on doing the same old things with them. You want to try new activities or, maybe you are thinking about starting a major project. Don't rush into anything too quickly for an impulsive decision can lead you astray; just enjoy being with those you love without any extra expectations."
virgo,2010-10-16,"Your frustration may increase if something or someone holds you back from taking a chance. Nevertheless, it should turn out well in the long run if you can master patience. In the meantime, it may be quite annoying if you can't modify your schedule, but you will want to try anyhow. Let go of your agenda, because you won't likely be able to have it your way. Fortunately, flexibility is one of your current keys to happiness."
libra,2010-10-16,"It may be next to impossible to maintain control over your spending today, because you are attached to having a good time or buying something that will bring you much pleasure. Thinking of a variety of ways to enjoy yourself is one thing, but chasing material dreams won't bring satisfaction now. You'll probably be happier if you favor simplicity over anything else."
scorpio,2010-10-16,"Although your close friends or family members already know how intense you can get, they still may not be prepared for the abruptness at which your attitude shifts today. You might even surprise yourself as your mood wavers and you reverse your direction for no apparent reason. Luckily, there's no need for detailed explanations; your feelings are simply what they are and won't change just because you think you should be rational."
sagittarius,2010-10-16,"Your friends look to you for inspiration because you make being independent look so easy. On the surface it appears as if your decisions are guided by lofty concepts and philosophical truths. But you aren't consistent between your head and your heart these days. Don't grow quiet about your observations; instead, sharing your personal struggles can make you more human and more lovable than you already are."
capricorn,2010-10-16,"There isn't much that can hold you back today because you have more reasons to say yes than to say no. But some of your rationalizations stem from your desire to find balance. Be careful, for this isn't the same as choosing based upon a personal preference. Instead of trying to be so objective now, ask yourself what you really want. And then, once you have a clear answer, act on it."
aquarius,2010-10-16,"You may have already started to make the changes you once dreamed about, but today you could have serious doubts that you are actually moving toward your goals. This uncertainty is natural and will dissipate on its own over the days ahead. In the meantime, visualize what you want instead of focusing on what you don't want. The power of positive thinking is surely stronger than just saying no because you're afraid of what might happen if you say yes."
pisces,2010-10-16,"There are many things that require your attention today, yet you must remain ready to respond to an unexpected event that could unravel your day. If you try to ignore what's happening and continue to push forward with your agenda, the situation could become unmanageable. However, if you are flexible, dealing with a sudden twist of fate won't be much of a problem at all."
aries,2010-10-17,"You may be restless with the current relationships in your life, but won't likely do anything about it today because there's nothing driving you to make a change at this time. You're probably busier dreaming about your perfect partner than actually doing anything concrete about it. Don't worry about how you will reach your goals. For now, just enjoy the mental exercise; when you're finished daydreaming, come back to the present moment and do something that can make a real difference."
taurus,2010-10-17,"You are more than ready for change yet you only want it on your terms. Your current need to be in control might make others anxious because they don't understand how you can keep it all together. No matter what, you would be wise to have a goal and should take any opportunity to give it your best shot. You won't ever know what is possible unless you try."
gemini,2010-10-17,"Being a little less than practical now isn't going to stop you from planning your next little adventure. You are thinking big and would quickly choose a journey to the other side of the world before settling on a trip to the local mall. While others may be laughing at you because they think your ideas are too far out, you just might get the final laugh when you send them postcards from Timbuktu."
cancer,2010-10-17,"Usually you're the one that needs additional closeness in a relationship and expressing your feelings is a great way to move toward a deeper level of intimacy. But letting down your guard doesn't just happen overnight, especially if you've recently been hurt. Push back against your fears, for your heart is much stronger than you realize."
leo,2010-10-17,"The Moon's visit to your 7th House of Relationships can bring a partner who is more of a spiritual collaborator than just a friend. There could be a large gulf between you and the other person who now decides that increased freedom is more important than dependence. Needless to say, this is not a typical path to intimacy. Keep in mind that you can have your breathing room and still deepen the connection between you and your companion."
virgo,2010-10-17,"You may be feeling a bit out of sorts today, like you don't want to do your daily chores -- at home or at work -- the same old way. You are seeking a new approach and are apt to be an eager student if it appears that someone knows something you do not. Although, education is not the only necessary ingredient, it is an important part of the process."
libra,2010-10-17,"You are ready to take a risk today, but you'll need to be in a spiritual flow before you start something new. You must be convinced that it can add more pleasure to your life. This is a very creative time for you and it's important that you enjoy yourself while expressing your inner artist. You must balance work and play, for now these two are intricately entangled."
scorpio,2010-10-17,"Even if aspects of your personal history are quite unusual, you still may be ready to take center stage today and share your story. However, you might want to keep certain parts of your private life totally to yourself. As much as this is your choice, think carefully about what to leave out, for it can change someone's perspective of you in ways that you don't realize. Instead, you could take a radical approach and tell the whole truth."
sagittarius,2010-10-17,"You may try extra hard to stay focused today because a variety of things are intriguing to you now. Unfortunately, once your curiosity has been aroused, it may be impossible to shut it off. Still, it's better to be interested in learning about new subjects than to be so set in your ways that you don't push yourself beyond your limits. Don't be afraid to feed your hunger for knowledge, but you still need to fulfill your commitments."
capricorn,2010-10-17,"You may feel as if you are on the edge of something new today, yet you would prefer to hold on to the status quo. Unfortunately, trying to live in the past isn't a useful strategy when the future is already here. Your life is changing in profound ways and accepting this can be the first step to reclaiming your confidence and reestablishing your security."
aquarius,2010-10-17,"The Moon's current visit to your fixed sign brings strong mood swings to your normally logical world. You might like to put emotional distance between your thoughts and your feelings, but the two now seem to be interwoven in a complex fabric. Don't bother trying to untangle the threads. Observe how these two modalities can work together so seamlessly that they support one another."
pisces,2010-10-17,"The Moon's current transit of your 12th House of Imagination can jump-start a sweet fantasy today, but you must suspend belief for your dreams to take hold. Don't waste any energy by attempting to clarify what is true and what is not. Just try to assimilate the entire story for the creative masterpiece it is. You can always analyze it more deeply on another day."
aries,2010-10-18,"You should be able to talk yourself into believing that everything is fine in the realm of relationships today. Even if you realize that you are working on complex issues that need resolution, you might try to avoid the facts. There's nothing wrong with seeing unrealized potential in others, but don't substitute it for the truth that's right in front of you."
taurus,2010-10-18,"Your feelings bubble into awareness today, yet you might not be able to put them into words. You wish your life was simpler now, yet your current desires can turn everything upside down. Although you may think you're being clear, others can still misinterpret your message. Don't assume that anyone knows what you're saying. Take time to confirm what you think you already know."
gemini,2010-10-18,"Today is perfect for daydreaming but it may not be so great for delivering a detailed message as your key planet Mercury fuzzes your thinking. Your imagination is working overtime now, which can be delightful if you don't try to apply your current thoughts to practical reality. If you have something really important to say, wait a few days until the transits to ethereal Neptune pass."
cancer,2010-10-18,"You might want to take the day off because you're thinking about all the things you want to do that have nothing to do with work. Although you are able to imagine a perfect day, one thing or another prevents you from actually having it. Instead of worrying about what you are unable to do, be grateful for what you can accomplish. Making the most of what you have is all about changing your attitude."
leo,2010-10-18,"You may feel as if you're in a dream where everything is just as it should be today. Unfortunately, your actual life can be far from ideal once you open your eyes. Naturally, you're tempted to indulge your pleasant fantasies, but avoiding reality isn't a luxury you can afford now. Instead of mind-tripping to a faraway place, concentrate on your home base where you can actually make a positive difference."
virgo,2010-10-18,"You aren't easily able to let go of your preconceived notions of what's in store for you next. Reality is a bit elusive now as your key planet Mercury is communing with spacey Neptune. It's probably better to let a few decisions slide, knowing you can return to them and clean things up later in the week."
libra,2010-10-18,"On one hand you desperately want to complete old business today. On the other hand, this can be a great play day, making it hard to accomplish much at all. This conflict could be emotionally agitating, so do whatever makes sense to gain a calmer frame of mind. Nevertheless, the Moon's visit to your 6th House of Self-Improvement indicates that you might be wise to focus on fine-tuning your efforts instead of frivolously wasting a potentially productive day."
scorpio,2010-10-18,"You might feel stuck and are ready to take a calculated risk today, if only to stir things up a bit. But attempting to make changes without a solid strategy can be more confusing than exciting. Imagine the best possible outcome and then create a plan to achieve your desired goal. If you can fill in the details in your mind, then you should also be able to make your dreams come true."
sagittarius,2010-10-18,"You may have too many obligations to fulfill today, but as the day wears on you become more likely to rebel against your current responsibilities. Unfortunately, your strategic skills might not be functioning well now, which means it won't be as easy to change the rules as you think. Don't become discouraged; if your plan doesn't work as expected, give it a few days and then try again."
capricorn,2010-10-18,"It can be quite unnerving if you feel disoriented today because you Goats naturally like to have your feet on the ground. You could waste a lot of time and energy trying to regain your footing, but uncertainty can also lead to a healthy experience. You have much to gain by questioning your assumptions about your life and your path ahead. Don't worry about making any final decisions now; rest assured that it's not yet necessary to know exactly what you'll do next."
aquarius,2010-10-18,"Your dreams seem so close that you believe you can touch them today as if they're real. It's helpful if you can trust your intuition now because you're more in tune with the symbolic realm that informs your thoughts than you are with the basic facts. Don't bother to seek rational explanations, just act on your hunches. If necessary, you can make additional adjustments in a few days when your thinking is more practical."
pisces,2010-10-18,"Although you may attempt to be rational today, your common sense continues to grow more elusive. But this can be used to your advantage, as long as you don't try to make any significant life-changing decisions. Declare this day as your own personal spiritual holiday and give yourself permission to contact the mysteries within."
aries,2010-10-19,"Once someone else discovers what you're planning, you could be influenced by whatever feedback you might hear. You may try to hide from the spotlight today because you have more freedom if you are not in plain view. It's not that you are afraid of being seen; it's just that you aren't as sure about your direction now and you want enough time to contemplate your actions before others become involved in the process."
taurus,2010-10-19,"You may experience a sudden change of heart today and want to tell others exactly how you feel. However, your words can actually hide your true intentions rather than express them. You must pay extra attention to how someone might misinterpret your disclosure, since the meaning could get lost in your current idealism. Keep in mind that not everyone wants to get bogged down in your internal process."
gemini,2010-10-19,"You aren't easily pulled off course today because you know what others need and are willing to adapt without losing sight of your own goals. Unfortunately, your desire to make everything work smoothly might be misunderstood. Don't waste time explaining yourself if anyone suggests that you are weak because you are so flexible. Just bend in the breeze while holding on to your position with confidence."
cancer,2010-10-19,"It's not easy to tell others what you want even if you are in touch with your feelings. You aren't interested now in showing your vulnerability because of how much energy it would then take to protect yourself. You probably have less to defend than you realize, especially if you are among friends. Although there's no need to say too much in public, don't put up unnecessary walls with those you trust."
leo,2010-10-19,"Although you may be overly attached to your fantasies today, you still are seeking a more balanced approach to your life. The surreal Pisces Moon can lure you into the magic of your dreams, but then the reverie ends and you snap back into the present moment. Keep in mind that nothing prevents you from holding on to your illusions, even if you must be present in the here and now."
virgo,2010-10-19,"On one hand, you know that you must be responsible and do what is sensible. But on the other hand, you are itching for excitement today and could do something uncharacteristically risky. Although there's no immediate danger, it still makes sense to pay attention to the details before doing anything you will soon regret."
libra,2010-10-19,"It's a great day to lose yourself in a romantic fantasy or to tap into your creative powers that are inspired by your relationship with someone special. Although you might have a lovely time in the imaginative realms, your thoughts could also manifest in the real world. Nevertheless, don't be hard on yourself if reality doesn't meet your idyllic expectations. Find small ways to incorporate your dreams into your daily life."
scorpio,2010-10-19,"You may be very excited about the prospects of getting a lot done today. The problem is that you could also be quite unrealistic in your assessment of how much time and energy your tasks might consume. Instead of taking on too much, cut back your expectations and do the best job possible on what you start. You can always tie up the loose ends tomorrow."
sagittarius,2010-10-19,"The emotional Pisces Moon activates your soulful l2th House today, inspiring you to be more introspective than usual. Although you might be able to squeeze in some relaxing play time, don't overdo it or there could be a high price to pay later. Instead of unhappily retreating into your family obligations, change your attitude so you can enjoy yourself, even if you don't get to have as much fun with others as you want."
capricorn,2010-10-19,"It might not be an easy day for you, even if you are able to accomplish a lot around the house. But anxiety could follow you around today, making you feel like you should be doing something else. Paradoxically, this is not dependent on anything you are currently doing. Don't seek security in the outer world; seek it within. If you can be satisfied with yourself, then you can be happy no matter what circumstances you face."
aquarius,2010-10-19,"If you can put together your day without having to handle too many issues, this can be a wonderful time to reconnect with your life purpose. But you may wonder if you really deserve everything you receive as the spiritual Pisces Moon activates your 2nd House of Self-Esteem. Although some of your ideas may seem to be a bit disconnected with reality, your friends will still encourage you to follow your dreams."
pisces,2010-10-19,"You may discover a new way of seeing who you are as the Moon illuminates your 1st House of Self. But it's not easy to change your attitude now, especially if you recently had doubts about your role in the world. You don't have to hang out in the dark shadows today; cultivate magic by crossing over to the sunny side of the street."
aries,2010-10-20,"Your eagerness could spell trouble today as the Moon returns to your sign, making you ready to take on the world. You are capable of doing extraordinary things now, so don't set yourself up for failure simply because you aren't willing to take a risk. Fortunately, you can increase your chances of being happy by scaling back your intentions just a little bit and then taking a giant leap of faith."
taurus,2010-10-20,"You may not be able to get to the source of your irritation today as the Moon in your 12th House of Secrets hides something from view. It's important to find out what you're missing, but the most significant information could be elusive to your watchful eye. Instead of seeking the truth, try accepting what you already know while you wait for the rest to surface."
gemini,2010-10-20,"You may be offered a professional opportunity today that's too good to turn down. But it's challenging to stay focused at work now with the Moon visiting your 11th House of Friends. There could be an element of surprise when unpredictable Uranus flips things upside down, making it hard to know how best to respond. Don't let your responsibilities fall to the wayside because of your social proclivities. Instead, turn your chores into a game and then play for keeps."
cancer,2010-10-20,"Don't wait for instructions from your boss today; take a chance and intuit what he or she wants from you. Nevertheless, you still must be careful or you can jump to a conclusion that isn't justifiable. An incorrect assumption can cause you to waste precious time, so don't make your move too quickly. A contemplative attitude is likely to better your chances for success."
leo,2010-10-20,"You might not do very well at controlling your enthusiasm today. This is an exciting time for you, but it's possible that you take a plan so far that others may tire of your unrealistic ideas. Talking less and doing more is the smartest way to show your possible detractors that you are more than just hype. Delivering the goods is more important now than just having a cosmic attitude."
virgo,2010-10-20,"A co-worker or friend might shock you today by doing something that's totally outrageous. You may be caught off guard by the intensity of the emotions being expressed, but it's smart not to show your surprise or offer any negative judgment now. Instead of being overly reactive, stick to your current position and don't lose your balance in the chaos around you."
libra,2010-10-20,"You may be attracted to someone or something at work today, yet this isn't your typical romance, for you want your freedom now as much as you want love. You might not be clear about what you're willing to give up in order to obtain what you desire. Don't struggle too hard as you try to find a comfortable middle ground. It's possible to remain curiously excited without actually overdoing it."
scorpio,2010-10-20,"You have lots of new ideas about how to get things done faster at work, but doubt may also be gnawing at the back of your mind as you wonder about the intricate relationship between inventiveness and routine. Although you may like the idea of relaxing by yourself, work must come first now. Maintaining healthy priorities helps you to be more successful in all areas of your life."
sagittarius,2010-10-20,"You are on the edge of writing yourself a permission slip today and then sneaking off to play. Unfortunately, this is a great idea for some other day, but now you should try to maintain an enthusiastic appearance while fulfilling your obligations. Work hard early in the day so you can have fun later on."
capricorn,2010-10-20,"You have too much on your mind today, especially if you are needed by a close friend or family member. However, it's time to give your work the proper attention it deserves. You might be tempted to escape your domestic responsibilities if you are busy at work, but this isn't a wise strategy. Instead, make your personal commitments top priority and let your professional obligations slip for a day or two. It will be easier to concentrate on your job once you take care of those you love."
aquarius,2010-10-20,"You might want to shake things up today, but change isn't always the best idea, especially if everything is already working well. It's one thing to try doing a task in a new way because you are seeking more effective and efficient methods. But doing it differently just because you are bored may not be the best strategy for the day. Don't try to fix what isn't broken; channel your energy in a more productive manner."
pisces,2010-10-20,"Your uncharacteristic desire to be seen as different from everyone else today might make your interactions with others more awkward than usual. You could become frustrated because you are attracted to someone who seems as if he or she would make a close friend or intimate partner. However, you may not want to change in order to make the interpersonal dynamics work. Be willing to walk away from a relationship if you cannot be yourself in it."
aries,2010-10-21,You may feel unstoppable with the Moon traveling through your fiery sign today. It's so easy for you to see the positive side of what's happening that you could miss something important in a relationship. Proactively addressing a touchy issue may be enough to defuse the tension. But conflict could erupt if you plow ahead unconsciously with your own agenda without checking in with others first.
taurus,2010-10-21,"Your senses are being fed in a way that can transform you with delight as your key planet Venus aspects opulent Jupiter. Whatever pleasures you may experience today, all is not fun and games. There is a serious side to what's happening and the sooner you acknowledge it, the easier it will be for you to learn the lessons at hand."
gemini,2010-10-21,"Your fear of losing a wonderful opportunity could drive you to take an unnecessary risk today; however, your sense of urgency is not necessarily based upon reality. You may be racing ahead so fast that you don't see the looming signs of trouble. Fortunately, an uncomfortable situation can easily be avoided if you simply take the time to think before you act."
cancer,2010-10-21,"You might believe that it's up to you to make something special happen at work today, but letting things take their own course has its own wisdom. Unfortunately, if you do nothing at all, you may be blamed later on for failing to take action. Your best strategy is somewhere in between. Don't take everything on yourself; instead discuss your plan with others and get their support before you go out on a limb."
leo,2010-10-21,"The solution to a current problem is obvious to you today, but others may not see things in a similar light. You want to take a proactive approach, but may be afraid that nothing will happen unless you take the lead and make it so. Be careful; your assumptions can backfire on you now unless you verify them before executing your plan."
virgo,2010-10-21,"Your analytical brain could be working overtime now as you seek the most sensible solution to a complicated set of circumstances. Someone may be claiming to have everything under control, but you don't see it that way at all. Unfortunately, heavy-handed tactics won't work because they will create an unnecessary backlash. Asking the right questions is a smarter strategy than showing up with all the answers."
libra,2010-10-21,"You may need to spend extra time managing your finances today as your key planet Venus retrogrades in your 2nd House of Resources. However, her current connection with confident Jupiter could encourage you to go ahead with a purchase or a project, ignoring a lack of cash or time. Instead of listening to others who claim that everything will be okay, pay attention to your inner voice that's telling you to be more cautious."
scorpio,2010-10-21,"You are tired of approaching a job in the same old manner and are ready for something new. But your penchant for the adrenaline rush that surges through your system when you're in unknown territory won't necessarily steer you in the best direction. Instead of believing that a break from the past is automatically an improvement, reconsider your long-term goals before changing your current behavior."
sagittarius,2010-10-21,"Your creative juices continue to flow strongly today, but you could run into a wall if you don't believe in yourself. On the other hand, an expansive Venus-Jupiter connection can be all the encouragement you need to bite off a project that becomes more than you bargained for. Ultimately, your friends can offer you the guidance that you seek. Ask for help if you need it, but don't surrender your artistic control."
capricorn,2010-10-21,"Staying home may be out of the question now, but the feelings associated with the pioneering Aries Moon are best expressed within an emotionally secure environment. Unfortunately, your drive could be so strong today that it's difficult to contain it in any one place. Tackling a serious project at work or in the community is one way to burn off excess energy, but don't expect help from others at this time. You need to take this next step on your own."
aquarius,2010-10-21,"You might try shaking up your everyday routine today because you are bored, but change for change's sake isn't really helpful. However, a more deliberate approach can have lasting positive impact. Instead of rushing ahead and making up your day as you go along, lay out your goals for the future and think through your strategies before you start anything at all."
pisces,2010-10-21,"Today you don't have much patience and you're ready to make a financial decision before you have all the facts. Unfortunately, this won't likely work in your favor. Even if you think that rushing forward will give you a certain advantage, take the time to gather the facts and muster support for your idea before you find yourself in over your head with no one around to help."
aries,2010-10-22,"Today's Full Moon in your sign can be overwhelming if you try to express your feelings with every changing mood. However, if you understand that you are on a rollercoaster now and let your emotions carry you this way and that way, then the ride can be a memorable one. Focus on keeping your wits about you because you might not be able to get your bearings until tomorrow after the energy settles down."
taurus,2010-10-22,"You may be receiving mixed messages from a friend or associate today. Others seem quite pushy as they tell you what they want from you. But their directions might contain contradictory instructions, making it impossible for you to do as you're told. There's no need to struggle for clarity; everything will make more sense by tomorrow."
gemini,2010-10-22,"You are eager to share your hopes for the future with those you trust. You want others to acknowledge your plans and to support your dreams. But you may get more than you bargained for today because everyone else seems to have different ideas about what you should be doing. Keep in mind that these are your wishes and ultimately, the only person who needs to approve of them is you."
cancer,2010-10-22,"The Aries Full Moon activates your 10th House of Public Responsibility, encouraging you to look beyond your individual concerns and think about what others need, too. But you aren't quite ready to abandon your personal interests in favor of more social issues, even if that is what's required. Don't let self-doubt turn into a loss of confidence. Even if you're not absolutely certain, make the best decision you can and then move on."
leo,2010-10-22,"You may be feeling wanderlust, even if you are rooted to your current situation. The fiery Aries Full Moon lights up your 9th House of Adventure, reminding you that there are still many journeys ahead. Whether or not you are able to pack your bags and jump on a plane, nothing can prevent you from going somewhere far away in your mind. Remember, there is plenty of time to turn your fantasies into reality."
virgo,2010-10-22,"The Aries Full Moon in your 8th House of Deep Sharing might set you on edge today because showing your feelings can place you in a vulnerable position. You would rather stay in the safe and familiar realms of rational thought, but the security gained won't be worth it. Facing your fears and taking a step into the illogical world of emotions can dissipate your frustration while bringing a new level of intimacy into your life."
libra,2010-10-22,"Your interactions with others increase in significance today, as the feisty Aries Full Moon brightens your 7th House of Relationships. But something special is on your mind and you may be less willing than usual to acquiesce to someone else's needs. Compromise is often your most reliable tactic, but now it's more important to stand up for what you want."
scorpio,2010-10-22,"It's not easy for you to balance a job that you think you must do with what others expect of you now. You know that it's up to you to follow through on promises made at work, but the courageous Aries Full Moon in your 6th House of Employment may not be enough to overcome your uncertainty. Don't push yourself too hard today; it will be easier to make progress in a day or two."
sagittarius,2010-10-22,"Fun and games are on your mind today as the Aries Full Moon activates your 5th House of Love and Creativity. However, you may have a difficult time getting others to share your point of view. It's not that your friends won't be supportive of your ideas; it's just that they don't know what you really want because you are sending mixed messages. Instead of frustrating yourself by trying to be more specific now, wait a bit longer; the clouds of illusion should clear by tomorrow."
capricorn,2010-10-22,"Issues of independence versus dependence can arise now, as the freedom-loving Aries Full Moon falls in your 4th House of Home and Family. Although you might need more autonomy so you can pursue your career aspirations, you also want the security that comes from having a stable personal life. Finding the right balance may be elusive, but don't give up; your persistence should pay off soon enough."
aquarius,2010-10-22,"You may be so busy today that you don't have time to get much done. The Aries Full Moon stirs your 3rd House of Everyday Activities, filling your life with an abundance of distractions that pull you from one thing to another. Even if you have specific goals now, you may be better off waiting until the weekend when you should have more time to make noticeable progress."
pisces,2010-10-22,"Today financial issues may surface, especially if you didn't pay sufficient attention to a problem earlier in the week. You might be tempted to handle the situation casually, or not at all. Unfortunately, denial isn't a sensible strategy because your monetary problems will only continue to get messier until you address them. A little concentrated effort now can be enough to set things right."
aries,2010-10-23,"You may feel as if you've been running around in circles, but now it's time to settle down and make your life more stable. However, you cannot change your natural tendencies, and you'll quickly grow bored if you eliminate too much activity all at once. Keep in mind that it's better to do one thing well than starting many projects without finishing anything."
taurus,2010-10-23,"The Moon's return to Taurus is a sign that all is well in your world. However, the Sun's entry into your 7th House of Relationships brings complex interpersonal dynamics out into the open. You don't mind if others are emotionally intense as long as you don't get pulled into a drama that isn't yours. Unfortunately, it's hard to tell where the dividing line is between you and someone else, so go out of your way to be clear about your boundaries from the start."
gemini,2010-10-23,"If you've been putting off a whole list of chores, this could be a great day to play catch-up. But don't bother making a big deal out of your diligence; just jump in and tackle what needs to be done without seeking any personal recognition. Others will notice your hard work even if they don't say anything at this time. The feeling you get from a job well-done will be a sufficient reward."
cancer,2010-10-23,"You need to feel as if you're part of a team effort today, yet you may not be so inclined to hang out with your family. You could become involved in a disagreement, but it won't likely last long if you decide not to feed it your energy. It's smarter for you to channel your emotions into being creative than into arguing needlessly. Connect with your inner artist; being spontaneous can open the door to something special."
leo,2010-10-23,"Once you make up your mind, it's tough to talk you out of your plans. You finally have a solid idea of where you are going, with a fixed Scorpio Sun in your 4th House of Roots and the stubborn Taurus Moon in your 10th House of Responsibility. But you must be careful because you could put way too much energy into resolving someone else's problems, instead of your own. There's nothing wrong with offering a helping hand as long as you pay attention to what you need as well."
virgo,2010-10-23,"Making plans is right up your alley, especially when you can get all the miscellaneous details under control. Although this is one of those magical times when your strategies seem to work better than you might have expected, more and more issues keep coming to light. Handle each problem as it surfaces, even if you tire of all the work. Your dogged persistence will bring you closer than ever to your goals."
libra,2010-10-23,"You may become very concerned about a money matter now. Perhaps you need to cut back on a project, or at least get your personal expenses in order. Although this little cash crunch may be quite easy for you to manage today, it raises much larger issues about your financial fears that lurk behind the scenes. Reevaluating your budget will prevent more problems down the road."
scorpio,2010-10-23,"The stabilizing Taurus Moon activates your 7th House of Others. Although passions have been aroused, generating your excitement, it's still best not to rush into anything too quickly. You have more time than you realize, so find a pace and start moving steadily toward your relationship goals. As long as you're making progress, don't worry about going any faster."
sagittarius,2010-10-23,"You may feel as if you want to go into hiding today, yet might not be able to pull away from your commitments. Fortunately, you could productively work on some of your chores without being seen because behind-the-scenes activities suit you fine now. Don't bite off more than you can chew. Setting an agenda and sticking to it throughout the day will work to your advantage."
capricorn,2010-10-23,"You are interested in having fun today as the Moon travels through your 5th House of Play. You may have complicated reasons for how you go about getting what you want now, but your plan makes total sense once you give the full explanation. Paradoxically, you're less interested in talking than you are in letting your actions speak for themselves. Keep in mind that you are not obliged to justify your behavior, but it's still nice to give everyone advance notice."
aquarius,2010-10-23,"The Sun's visit to your 10th House of Status shines its light on what you do in the outer world. You want to make big changes in your life to reflect your new interests and goals, but the Moon in your 4th House of Roots has you feeling anchored to your past. Fortunately, your current frustration will pass, freeing you to alter your plans to match your current ambitions."
pisces,2010-10-23,"You have a number of things that you want to accomplish today and it's not likely that you'll be led off course. The Sun is newly arrived in your 9th House of Higher Truth and since you have already done your basic research, others won't be able to convince you that they know any better. Even if you have your day already all mapped out, be flexible enough to adapt to unforeseen situations. Being determined is very useful as long as it doesn't get in your way."
aries,2010-10-24,"Red-hot Mars combines forces with electrifying Uranus today, zapping you with lightning bolts of awareness and shocking you awake. You could have trouble containing yourself because you're primed for action. Luckily, you are connected to your inner spirituality in a profound way now, so your impulsive and passionate nature can be very inspiring to others."
taurus,2010-10-24,"Although the sensible Taurus Moon helps to stabilize your emotions today, seeking the edge should still work out for the best. A friend or a co-worker may encourage you to break a rule, or if you are a part of a group project, others might push you to take an even greater risk. Obviously you respect their opinions, but it's wiser to accept the challenge of being independent in your thoughts and actions now."
gemini,2010-10-24,"Your current interests are part of your grand scheme; however, you could run into a tough situation if you are fiercely controlling. Instead of wasting time and energy trying to convince someone to work with you, concentrate all your mind's power on the most immediate goals and don't stop until you've made serious progress."
cancer,2010-10-24,"You may be overly anxious, especially if you are thinking about doing something outrageous today that scares you. You'll be able to get away with more unorthodox behavior than usual with assistance from the expressive Mars-Uranus trine. Remember that you must tell others what you want. If you don't, your chance for fulfillment is much less likely."
leo,2010-10-24,"You are feeling like you need to be acknowledged at work today and may take an additional risk to be noticed. Paradoxically, you might feel safer than usual, even if you are already living on the edge. Although you're confident, remember that it's not necessary to push your ideas onto others or it could backfire. Express your personal desires and then wait to see how everyone reacts."
virgo,2010-10-24,"You don't feel like keeping your inner fears quiet now, even if you're afraid that expressing them will make you more vulnerable. Thankfully, there is nothing wrong with admitting to feeling scared. After a while, your apprehension will begin to disperse without encountering the problem that you previously thought was inevitable. Sharing your concerns with a trustworthy friend should help more than you think."
libra,2010-10-24,"You prefer being busy, yet you might also grow weary of jumping through so many hoops. Don't burn up all of your energy in the morning so that you can still have some creative juice left over for later in the day. Instead of panicking because you think that time is running out, slow down, engage reality and take control of your day."
scorpio,2010-10-24,"Your key planet Mars pushes you to do something you've never done before. You feel a thrill by being so near to the edge and want to experience how close you can flirt with it, whether it is by bungee jumping or moving to a new location. However, once you go beyond the point of no return, you may not be able to change your mind. Think about ways to shake things up without necessarily turning your life upside down."
sagittarius,2010-10-24,"It's easy to rationalize what you're doing as long as it's part of a familiar pattern, since the Moon is in your 6th House of Daily Routine. But you do have choices to make today that can be based totally on intuition and inner guidance. Don't engage in endless analysis and conversations that go nowhere. Pay attention to the sensations in your gut and do what feels best."
capricorn,2010-10-24,Your friends may insist that you step back from your responsibilities today and do something that is quite out of character. But the point isn't to evade your obligations; it's to be flexible enough to pursue some unscheduled fun along the way. You can always complete your chores later in the evening or even first thing tomorrow morning.
aquarius,2010-10-24,"Although the weekend is nearly over, you still have things you want to do before you return to work. But your day will not end up being the same as the one that you planned in your mind. There are too many unknown variables still up in the air and you must be able to go along with the uncertainty or you'll have a difficult time. Remaining open to last minute changes can turn your frustrating day into one filled with excitement."
pisces,2010-10-24,"You may think you already know what others want before they even ask for it. But still, it's smarter to wait until they express their needs, instead of jumping to conclusions. It's disheartening if someone says no to your great ideas, even if it's apparent to you that he or she lacks vision. Nevertheless, the situation is not worth fighting about at this time. Let the energy sit and see how everyone feels next week."
aries,2010-10-25,"You may have a tough time concentrating today, especially if you're doing the same old thing. But even if you are involved in something new and different, you'll still probably want to shake things up instead of just being productive. Pay extra attention to what you're doing or you could scatter your energy before you even realize what you've done."
taurus,2010-10-25,"You might be feeling the effects of a financial crunch today, yet it's not likely worrisome enough to prevent you from purchasing something you really want. But spending your money impulsively now isn't the smartest thing to do. Consider what else you could do with your resources. Keep in mind that happiness isn't only attainable by the acquisition of things."
gemini,2010-10-25,"Your friends might perceive you as being scattered, even if you are able to justify your behavior. You are doing many things at once today and it's not likely that anyone but you can see how they are all connected. Still, you are in danger of working too hard while accomplishing less than expected unless you can focus your intentions and eliminate extraneous activities."
cancer,2010-10-25,"You are usually great at keeping secrets, but today you are wise to remain quiet and only talk when it's necessary. There is so much that you want to say and once you open the door, it will be hard to shut it prior to telling everything. Remember, you can take the high road now by practicing discretion, for some things are better left unsaid."
leo,2010-10-25,"You are quite gregarious, yet your outgoing style today can be a smokescreen to hide feelings that you would prefer to keep to yourself. However, there's no need to pretend. You don't have to share anything about yourself that doesn't feel right. It's okay to state your limits and then stick with the boundaries that you set."
virgo,2010-10-25,"You are eager to help others, but you might not be prepared for the amount of personal interaction that is actually required of you today. You may reach a point where it all seems like noise and you wish that you were able to escape. But once you make yourself available, it's not that easy to withdraw. Go ahead and hold up your end of the deal; it won't last as long as you think and you'll feel good about yourself afterward."
libra,2010-10-25,"You are anticipating a special getaway for a few days, but it's hard to actually make it happen. You may be disappointed with yourself because you cannot make a decision today, but it's likely not your fault. Wait and see how your commitments play out for a few more days and then return to the idea of scheduling some time off. Even if you must delay your trip, your current choices will prove to be sound ones nonetheless."
scorpio,2010-10-25,"It feels perfectly natural to talk about your feelings today, even if you previously decided to keep them to yourself. Unfortunately, your current comfort may not last long, especially if you accidentally stir up an issue that is even more difficult for someone else. Although the discussion that ensues isn't necessarily an easy one, any attempt to gain clarity about a relationship is healthy as long as it's part of an ongoing developmental process."
sagittarius,2010-10-25,"You might be anxious today because a close friend or partner won't be pinned down on an issue that is very important to you now. It's even more complicated than it first seems, for you may also be relieved that he or she is somewhat elusive. Ironically, it's easier for you to commit when the other person isn't as willing. Luckily, you can avoid a confrontation if you can see both sides of this dilemma as dual aspects of yourself."
capricorn,2010-10-25,"You have plenty of things to do at work today and you may not know where to start. Nearly anything you do too quickly could be problematic now if there is something else that you should also be doing. Even if you feel guilty, you really can't accomplish any more than you promised. Relaxing your expectations can make a world of difference in your day."
aquarius,2010-10-25,"Although you may be excited by the prospects of enjoying yourself today, it could be difficult to find a willing playmate who meets your expectations. You might be able to locate someone available to go along with your idea of a good time, but this doesn't mean he or she will be open to developing a meaningful friendship with you. Don't waste your time on someone who isn't interested in getting to know the real you. Sometimes your best company is yourself."
pisces,2010-10-25,"You are so tired of dreaming about a vacation that never happens that you don't even want to talk about it anymore. You're ready to take your trip right now, but unfortunately it's not likely you will be able to go anywhere. You have family obligations to fulfill and they should take precedence over any ideas of travel. Forget about fleeing the nest; instead, stay focused on the present moment and see where it leads you."
aries,2010-10-26,"Exploring new ways to express yourself may seem totally natural to you now, but your sense of independent creativity may not be okay with your co-workers. Although you could be tempted to disregard everyone else's perspectives, it's not a smart strategy to needlessly stir up resentment. A minimal amount of self-restraint goes a long way to making life easier for all involved."
taurus,2010-10-26,"You are usually the one everyone depends on, but today your emotions may run all over the place, causing concern about your reliability. Perhaps you are dealing with someone who is pressuring you to commit to something and you have an urge to bolt, instead. However, running away from the intensity won't solve the problem. You could be caught in a vicious cycle until you face your fears once and for all."
gemini,2010-10-26,"Having faith in your co-workers can be tricky business now because they might not be willing to talk about real issues. Even if you are usually the lighthearted one, today you're concerned about everyone else's casual attitudes. Rely on your own judgment instead of depending on others. And, if anyone gets too rebellious, use your charming wit to cleverly pull him or her back into place."
cancer,2010-10-26,"Although you might have already thrown your hands up in frustration and discarded your previous agenda, it's still entirely possible that the current situation will turn out okay. However, it's going to take extra effort on your part, and you may have to work overtime to come up with a contingency plan in case things become more bent out of whack. But, even if you plan and scheme, there may be another crazy surprise to throw you off track again. Adjust your expectations, let go and move on."
leo,2010-10-26,"Your social calendar is overflowing now and you may no longer have the time for work. It feels as if everyone is tempting you to skip out on your commitments today and join in the fun. But you are too aware of the consequences to just say yes without considering your responsibilities first. Thankfully, you might not have to say no if you can clearly establish your limits before you jump in."
virgo,2010-10-26,"You may be thinking so fast now that it appears as if you are simultaneously in two places at once. But the hectic pace might actually prevent you from landing anywhere at all. Ultimately, it's up to you. Recognizing that you won't be able to maintain this intensity is the first step. Prepare to slow down, even if that won't really happen for a few more days."
libra,2010-10-26,Good ideas roll in so quickly now that it may be challenging to turn any one of them into a concrete plan before you run off to the next one. You'll need to slow down your thinking if you want to accomplish something enduring and give your current thoughts enough time to reach fruition. It's really not about how many amazing inspirations you have today; it's about following through on the right one.
scorpio,2010-10-26,"It appears as if you are engaged in a lighthearted discussion today, but something else is happening beneath the surface. You are in the process of gathering the information that you need so you can make an important decision about a possible financial investment with a friend. Still, it's a good idea to postpone making up your mind for a few days. In fact, it's best to wait until retrograde Venus turns direct on November 18 to consummate the deal."
sagittarius,2010-10-26,"Be careful of slick salespeople today, for they can talk you into believing almost anything, even if their words contradict themselves. Don't trust anyone now who can speak faster than you can think. Their pitch may be sincere and everything might seem copacetic, but remember that you aren't receiving the whole picture just yet."
capricorn,2010-10-26,"Today's curious Gemini Moon complicates your day by distracting you with one thing after another as you attempt to stay on task. Making plans for an upcoming event won't be much fun unless you can allow yourself to be a little bit impractical. However, your day won't be very productive if you get hung up in the volumes of incoming data. Forget about the details for now; focus on the big picture instead."
aquarius,2010-10-26,"Although the pace of events is still increasing, you're able to process them fast enough in your mind that you can respond adequately. Your reactions are like lightning and it's as if you know the answer before a question is asked. However, instead of showing off your intuitive intelligence, take a step back to give others an opportunity to catch up with you. You will benefit more from being part of a team effort."
pisces,2010-10-26,"Surprising developments at home can lure your attention away from work and onto personal issues today. Although you may be heading for a conflict, it's too soon to let a minor disagreement turn into a major problem. Even if you are being pressured to take sides now, it's wiser to remain non-committal. Keep your options open as long as possible."
aries,2010-10-27,"You hit the ground running, but you may run out of steam before you reach your destination today. Don't get caught up in pushing yourself so hard all morning that a few hours of work end up draining you. Your best strategy now is to pace yourself. Thankfully, you receive a second wave of energy later in the evening when the Moon opposes powerful Pluto."
taurus,2010-10-27,"Although you may feel more comfortable now if there is less forward movement in your life, you cannot stop the wheels of progress. Your attempts to maintain the status quo or to keep those around you in the same place won't work, either. Ultimately, everyone else wants to get going, so don't hold them back just because you don't want to change. Even if you are resistant at first, you will still enjoy the benefits of the unfolding improvements."
gemini,2010-10-27,"You may feel as if you have run out of time because there are still so many things you haven't done yet. But even though the Moon is leaving your sign today, this isn't about endings. Rather, it's about initiating whatever comes next in your life. Stop looking back to the past; you cannot change it now. Instead, turn around and observe what is ahead of you, for this is where your attention will do the most good."
cancer,2010-10-27,"Your imagination is running wild this morning and even if you try to capture it artfully, you're still likely to be left feeling less than satisfied. Your creative tendencies probably won't last through the afternoon when the Moon enters your sign, bringing a sudden change of mood. Still, if you don't finish your project now, you should still have another chance tomorrow."
leo,2010-10-27,"Your timing may feel off today because you seem to become less interested in finding pleasure as the day wears on. If you are overly active at first, it might be a smart strategy to retreat just a bit earlier in the day. Conserve some of your energy for playful activities throughout the week. In the meantime, pay attention to your emotions because they are key to understanding your needs."
virgo,2010-10-27,"You are often the one who stays behind and takes care of the final chores while everyone else is out avoiding responsibility. But today it's different, so don't let anyone ride roughshod over your feelings. Make the most of what's currently available without turning your dreams into unrealizable fantasies. It's better to scale back your hopes and reach your goals than to overextend yourself and be left unsatisfied."
libra,2010-10-27,"It's difficult for you to forget about the more serious things that are happening around you today. Others will take note of your no-nonsense attitude and place you in a leadership role, even if you wish they wouldn't. But don't try to avoid the new responsibilities, even if you don't know exactly what to do. You should gain enough clarity just in time to impress your peers with your competence."
scorpio,2010-10-27,"Today is the last day of Mars' visit to your sign and you could feel a sudden rush of adrenaline before you become more subdued in your approach to work. So much has already happened, and you truly don't want to waste any energy now. Stay as focused as possible; there will be time for relaxing and idle daydreaming later on."
sagittarius,2010-10-27,"You are able to see right through other people's smokescreens today. The more they deny the truth of your observations, the more transparent they appear. Nevertheless, you would be wise to exercise caution around your assumptions, for you could jump to an incorrect conclusion. It's best to develop your logic slowly and carefully now. One small step at a time is a lot smarter than leaping ahead too soon."
capricorn,2010-10-27,"You might feel a free-floating anxiety today because change is in the air and you can't yet grasp what it has in store for you. Your current insecurity rears its ugly head if someone withdraws support or even love. Although you intellectually understand what's going on, this can bring up abandonment issues. Instead of attempting to hold on to the status quo, let go of your previous expectations so you are free to explore where this energetic shift carries you."
aquarius,2010-10-27,"Instead of spending the day in service to others, you can't help but be tempted by the idea of unrestrained self-indulgence. Unfortunately, this selfish attitude cannot take you far because there is too much happening in your life to avoid the issues that currently demand your attention. Enjoy some spontaneous downtime and then get back to helping those who matter the most to you."
pisces,2010-10-27,"Your feelings are being pulled all over the place today. At first you are concerned about everything that you must do at home. But then your thoughts become more emotionally charged and you want some time to process them. Before you can navigate through an intense situation, you may change your mind several times, making you eager to move on to whatever is next. Nevertheless, do what you must to slow yourself down, for this will help you get the most meaning out of these days."
aries,2010-10-28,"You may want to lay low as the passive Cancer Moon moves through your 4th House of Home and Family. However, your key planet Mars enters extroverted Sagittarius today, increasing your wanderlust. Ultimately, your frustration level will be intolerable if you cannot get out and do something exciting. But you may be so eager for some action that you take off before you even know where you're going. It's a lot smarter to make a sensible game plan before you dash out the door."
taurus,2010-10-28,"You may be feeling cautious, but today it's time to let your impulses take you into the next phase of your life. It's not easy for you to trust your instincts over your common sense, but you are receiving useful information from your subconscious mind now. Learning to listen to your hunches requires practice, but it's a wise strategy these days."
gemini,2010-10-28,"You are buzzing around now that your key planet Mercury is aspecting ingenious Uranus. This intellectual amplifier, combined with the sensitive Cancer Moon, gives you an uncanny knack today for seeing what's just beyond the horizon. But receiving a glimpse of the truth isn't enough; you also have to take direct action. Don't just go back for another round of analysis; announce your intention and then do something productive about it."
cancer,2010-10-28,"Don't assume that you'll be able to get anyone else to help you with your work today. Even if you'd like to get others involved in your project, you're better off taking it on by yourself. Working on your own may not be your notion of an ideal situation, but it is much better than partnering with the wrong person at this time. Get the ball rolling and find people to support your efforts later on when you have more time."
leo,2010-10-28,"You may need some time to retreat and there's no reason to deny your wish, even if you have things to do in the world. Following your desires isn't always the most intelligent thing to do, but it could certainly have a positive impact now. Keep your attention focused on the present moment, even if you are tempted to look ahead to what's next. Additionally, eliminating attachments to the past adds to the power of now."
virgo,2010-10-28,"Mixed messages from the cosmos encourage you to concentrate more energy at home now while also being drawn toward faraway places. Thankfully, your key planet Mercury is picking up a whole lot of buzz today, activating your mind without detaching you from emotionally significant issues that can ultimately bring you the additional freedom that you want. It may take extra effort to juggle your conflicting thoughts with your feelings, but the results could be worthwhile."
libra,2010-10-28,"You may want to take care of everyone you know today, but the simple truth is that you're actually just taking care of yourself. At first it may feel uncomfortable when you realize that you can be so selfish; however, it's necessary if you want to have anything left over to give others. There's no need to be too hard on yourself; you're just striving to find the right balance."
scorpio,2010-10-28,"You may be feeling quite self-sufficient today, yet your desire to detach from others can bring some pitfalls. One problem is that a trusted friend may see you as unable to ask for help or unwilling to receive it. Keep in mind that you don't have to give up your independence to gain support. You'll be better off if you can let someone else slip through your defensive boundaries and into your life."
sagittarius,2010-10-28,"You might feel as if you took an extra dose of caffeine today because your energy level is buzzing from energetic Mars as it returns to your sign. Your enthusiasm can soar even higher if you are able to let go of your past. Mars remains in your sign until December 7, recharging your batteries and supplying you with extra get-up-and-go. Don't wait for another sign; this is it. It's your time to start something fabulous."
capricorn,2010-10-28,"You are able to strike a balance between reasonable caution and radical thought today, making you a natural negotiator. However, it's not easy to keep your final goal in sight if unnecessary discouragement sets in. Even if someone tells you that your plans are too unrealistic, don't give up now. Stay in the game by sharing your ideas as they come to you. One of them will hit the proverbial nail on the head."
aquarius,2010-10-28,"You want to explore intuitive realms today, but you still must be practical about what you are doing. Thankfully, you won't have to endlessly analyze the details of your day, for everything is more on track than you realize. Nevertheless, it's wise to work out the timing scenario of your schedule in advance. This way, you'll be more prepared for what happens along the way."
pisces,2010-10-28,"Your creativity abounds today with the Moon's visit to your 5th House of Self-Expression, but you could be so eager to get your personal projects up and running that your performance at work slips. Luckily, supportive lunar aspects can help you smooth over the rough spots, but you can inadvertently make matters worse by taking on too much. Limit your promises in advance to avoid unnecessary problems later on."
aries,2010-10-29,"You may be disappointed by the way things are turning out today, but you're probably in better shape than you realize if you can let go of your previous expectations. You will have more opportunities to make changes to bring your day-to-day obligations into alignment with your high ideals. But now you must exercise self-restraint and deliver on what you've already promised, rather than just moving on to what's next."
taurus,2010-10-29,"You might take on way too much today because everything appears simpler than it actually is. Part of the problem is that you cannot let go of a project until it feels right, so you may spend time going back over what you already did. Although others won't likely notice the difference, it's important that you honor your own need for quality. Instead of hurrying through your tasks to get them done, postpone some chores for another day."
gemini,2010-10-29,"Although slowing the pace of your upcoming weekend may not sound like fun, it's still the wisest thing to do. You have a lot of hard work ahead of you next week, so it's smart to rest when you have the chance. Unfortunately, you cannot declare today a personal holiday, so focus your energy on what you have to accomplish before treating yourself to a bit of quality time off."
cancer,2010-10-29,"There's no need to fret over your changing moods today just because the Moon is visiting your 1st House of Self and is running you through a gamut of feelings. Remain unattached to every thought as it comes and goes. Don't push away anger and don't pull in the desires. Just let your emotions run their own course without trying to control them. This doesn't mean, however, that you must share your inner process with those around you. Save the intimate discussions until you reach smoother waters and your energy settles down."
leo,2010-10-29,"You don't like the idea of keeping your thoughts to yourself, but it's probably the most intelligent strategy for now. But once you let one little feeling escape, the windows to your soul are thrown open and all your emotions could come pouring out. Even if you think you know where your boundaries are, it may be hard to stop midstream. Err on the side of caution and keep your secrets to yourself for now."
virgo,2010-10-29,"You may be overly concerned about what your friends are thinking of you now. The reflective Cancer Moon in your social 11th House indicates that you may feel as if someone already rejected you. But it's your heightened sensitivity and not anyone else's negative judgment that actually motivates your self-protective actions. Even if you feel vulnerable today, try to remain open to others."
libra,2010-10-29,"Your objective thoughts might need to be hidden from view today because analysis leads you to one conclusion while your heart says something else. You can almost convince yourself that you don't have to get involved in someone else's business. However, consider all the rational reasons to pull back, then toss them aside and do what feels right."
scorpio,2010-10-29,"Your dreams of love can be expressed today through a balance of cool detachment and bursts of tender affection. It's not that you want to avoid an intimate connection with someone special, it's just that you also need your independence. Be careful; you could get caught in the middle as you try to work out this internal conflict. Make it easier on yourself by avoiding extreme reactions either way."
sagittarius,2010-10-29,"You may seek the simplest way out of a difficult situation today by practicing the fine art of procrastination. Although this isn't usually considered to be a sensible strategy, avoiding conflict and delaying an important decision could be your smartest course of action now. Adding a bit of patience lessens the intensity, allowing the resistance to naturally dissipate on its own. Give things a day or two and then try again."
capricorn,2010-10-29,"You can easily see how much work you have in front of you, but your inclination is to remain quiet, rather than expressing any negativity. You may be guardedly optimistic because you realize that accomplishing your goals won't be easy even though you have confidence in your skills. Take your personal time early in the day and then start clearing the obstacles that are still in your path."
aquarius,2010-10-29,"It's not easy to find your groove today because whatever you do, it feels like something's still wrong. Fortunately, this subtle discomfort motivates you to take care of many little tasks that remain unfinished. Instead of complaining about all the loose ends, you can transform your annoyance into action with a little help from your friends."
pisces,2010-10-29,"It's not that anything in particular is wrong today; it's just that you don't have the luxury of saying what's on your mind. Sharing your concerns might send someone else into an emotional crisis, which would only make your day more challenging. However, helping others to feel comfortable with what's happening now is easier than telling them exactly what you think."
aries,2010-10-30,"You're enjoying the intensity of your personal relationships now because superficial interactions have become quite unsatisfying. You are more willing to hold on to the status quo, both emotionally and physically, as you explore the power of deeper feelings, rather than running off to explore a new situation. Temporary simplicity can be achieved by avoiding your emotions, but it's definitely not a sensible long-term strategy."
taurus,2010-10-30,"You don't want to spend too much time planning today, and luckily, your friends will probably help you at the last moment with the necessary details. But you have something important to learn about relationships now, and expecting others to bail you out can interfere with the process. Figure out your own course of action so you don't waste your precious time discussing logistics that you could handle on your own."
gemini,2010-10-30,"Your creative playtime may be over today; it's time to roll up your sleeves and get down to work. You have many things to do and the longer you procrastinate, the more difficult it will be to finish your tasks. Nevertheless, it's not helpful to attempt to do everything at once. Be serious, take your time and complete your chores with care so you won't have to do them over again later on."
cancer,2010-10-30,"There are an increasing number of opportunities for pleasure available, but it is up to you to make something happen. Your current willingness to take a chance might mean all the difference between enjoying yourself or not. However, you may have to demonstrate that you can set your personal feelings aside to focus on what you are about to share. You'll get the most out of the present moment if you stop worrying about what you should have done in the past or what you must do in the future."
leo,2010-10-30,"There is a big difference between what you are doing today and how you feel. It is as if you realize what you want yet you're still responding to everything that happens on a gut level. Your head has a different agenda from your heart now, and ultimately you'll be happier if your heart wins out. Practice being flexible by meeting others halfway, even if it isn't that simple to accomplish."
virgo,2010-10-30,"You may struggle to be upfront about what you want now, yet you still expect others to be straightforward and share their needs with you. This double standard will land you in trouble, especially if you aren't willing to compromise. Save your hard bargaining and poker face for another time; today you'll be better off by simply placing your cards face up on the table."
libra,2010-10-30,"Even if you're thinking about your long-term goals, the collection of planets in your 2nd House of Basic Values can shift your focus back to the present moment. Luckily, you should be feeling better about yourself, making it easier to share your thoughts with others. Be patient, if you can maintain a positive attitude now, life will continue to get easier in the weeks ahead."
scorpio,2010-10-30,"The Moon's square to the Sun in your 1st House of Self may fuel difficult dynamics in your personal life. If you don't feel as if others appreciate your efforts, anything they say or do now could provoke you to start a conflict, even when there's really nothing to fight about. Taking several deep breaths will go a long way to calm your nerves, but the passage of time will help even more. In the meantime, put your excess energy into something positive."
sagittarius,2010-10-30,"The outgoing Leo Moon encourages you to advise others about your plans for the future, but her square to the Sun in your 12th House of Imagination may over-stimulate your fantasies today. Manifesting your dreams poses a high level of difficulty now because focusing too much on making anything happen can actually delay it. Seek the right amount of force to apply to any situation, but remember that making many adjustments along the way can help you achieve success."
capricorn,2010-10-30,"You may feel transparent now, even if you don't want to reveal too much at this time. However, you are moving through a phase when you can inadvertently withhold more than is prudent. Although you might lose momentum by disclosing too much too fast, you may miss an important opportunity for growth if you don't take a chance and open up."
aquarius,2010-10-30,"Although relationships can take on increased importance now that the Moon is traveling through your 7th House of Partners, you may be hesitant to share your feelings because you're not completely sure about what you want. Telling someone what's on your mind today can be confusing at best. If possible, wait a few days until your clarity returns before initiating any serious discussions about your desires."
pisces,2010-10-30,"You may be very concerned with how your regular habits could be preventing you from reaching your goals. The Leo Moon in your 6th House of Self-Improvement can work against your long-term plans by distracting you with more details than you need to address at this time. Having enough information is critical, but being buried by needless facts and figures today won't help you get your chores done."
aries,2010-10-31,"You are eager to play now that the Moon is moving through your 5th House of Spontaneity. But, paradoxically, sometimes acting in the moment is easier when you have also planned ahead. Feeling confident about your creative talents will help you be more successful when it comes to achieving your current goals."
taurus,2010-10-31,"The expressive Leo Moon is visiting your private 4th House of Home and Family today, sending you mixed messages about how much to share with others. This can be challenging because you would like everyone to know what you're feeling, yet you also want to avoid unnecessarily placing yourself in a vulnerable position. There's no need to feel overly anxious about whatever you decide to do now, for the confusion will likely pass by tomorrow."
gemini,2010-10-31,"Your restlessness is soothed by images of distant lands and the ideals of philosophical inquiry. But answers won't likely come as easily as questions now, so you could be feeling somewhat unsatisfied. Nevertheless, you are still ready for something special to happen today, and if you look forward to it with anticipation, you'll probably be happily surprised."
cancer,2010-10-31,"Although you may have some time to yourself today, you would prefer to spend it with close family or friends. But unfortunately you may end up having a short argument with someone you love. This doesn't have to be a big deal; just don't issue any ultimatums about your current relationship. Thankfully, your differences of opinion can be a catalyst for an emotional reconnection."
leo,2010-10-31,"You may be ready to disclose more about your personal feelings than usual, now that the Moon is moving through your sign. But this doesn't necessarily mean that everyone else wants to hear as much as you want to say. It's healthy for you to consider why you are sharing anything at all; if it's to develop a deeper friendship with someone special, then don't wait for a better time than today."
virgo,2010-10-31,"Your plan is not to reveal more than is absolutely necessary today. In fact, you may be like Cinderella at the ball, carrying around a few secrets of your own. Don't make a big deal about your personal business now. Treat others with loving kindness and remember that it's okay to remain silent until you feel ready to say more."
libra,2010-10-31,"Your friends may want to help you have a good time today, but there's really not much for them to do. After all, you are standing on firm ground now while the Moon is moving through your 11th House of Social Networking. Just don't place all your hopes on a new relationship; it's best to give it time to develop on its own."
scorpio,2010-10-31,The Moon's visit to your 10th House of Status may indicate a new role for you to play within your community. But it's hard to tell in advance what you should do because others are being unclear about their expectations. Don't draw any conclusions prematurely. It would be much better to take a wait-and-see approach now because your current situation is still unfolding.
sagittarius,2010-10-31,"You may have an idea now that keeps growing in scope, but it's hard for you to cut it back to a manageable size. You are not likely to listen to the advice of a close friend or parent now because you are sure that you can see things very clearly on your own. However, your current view is warped by your subjectivity, so keep reminding yourself that small really is beautiful."
capricorn,2010-10-31,"You are attracted now to the idea of getting to know someone on a much deeper level, but you might not know how to go about putting your plan into action. Before you start filling in the details of your strategy, it would be smart to reconsider your goals because it's easy to mislead yourself when the Moon opposes confusing Neptune. This won't require too much effort; just make sure you really want what you are currently pursuing."
aquarius,2010-10-31,"It's difficult to tell where the source of misunderstanding is today, but it's important to get to the bottom of the mystery. At first, it might appear as if others are purposely steering you wrong, but upon closer scrutiny you can see how they may be working off of your mixed messages. Instead of trying to obtain additional clarity from anyone else, start with clearing up your own muddled thoughts."
pisces,2010-10-31,"You are being given extra time today to finish up your incomplete chores. However, difficulties arise from the Moon's opposition to your key planet Neptune, challenging you to stick to the facts. You would prefer avoiding the straight and narrow path now, but letting your mind wander isn't going to help your productivity rate. Don't make a big deal out of what you're doing; just focus on the specifics the best you can."
aries,2010-11-01,"Anyone who impedes your progress today may be in for a surprise when you arrive fully ready to do battle. You aren't in the mood to deal with someone else's arbitrary judgments. Although your feelings are very strong now, there is no need to worry about the resistance you currently face. Instead of looking for a fight, keep pushing your big ideas ahead, one step at a time."
taurus,2010-11-01,"Your ruling planet Venus connects with dark Pluto today, turning gentle love into an intense meltdown as she focuses your desires. Thankfully, you are able to avoid trouble, even as you set your common sense aside to attain the pleasure you want. Nevertheless, it's wise to be ethical while trying to achieve the greatest success you can."
gemini,2010-11-01,"You might make several attempts to tell someone your story now, but it can be frustrating when others don't seem to care about the same things that are significant to you. Nevertheless, don't waste your time and energy worrying about the possibility of being hurt by rejection. You're better off if you focus on the journey ahead. There's really no place in your life today for negative thinking."
cancer,2010-11-01,"Making choices about your personal life can be difficult today because there's an array of appealing possibilities until you examine them more closely. However, it's not smart to put off stabilizing your potential. Remember that you have powerful friends who are eager to help you reach your goals now, so don't be afraid to ask for their help."
leo,2010-11-01,"You don't want to let go of your weekend just yet, and you may try every trick in the book to extend this playful feeling into your workweek. But if you have things to do today, don't worry about missing out on a little fun. Instead, think about the positive impact you might have on others if you jump in now and show them the way. Your can-do attitude is contagious to everyone around you."
virgo,2010-11-01,"You may not be prepared to give an inch today, especially if someone questions your ability to handle a situation while offering an alternative plan. Be careful, for this needn't be about right versus wrong; in fact, everyone involved can be correct, for there are many ways to reach the same goal. Remember, progressing according to your strategy keeps your heart in the game while enabling you to remain passionately committed to the greater cause."
libra,2010-11-01,"Dark Pluto gives your planet, Venus, something mysterious to consider today, transforming your light and easy thoughts of love into a more complex web of ideas. You might prefer to remain detached from your feelings by having fun with someone else. Unfortunately, you cannot outrun the work you must do to sort your relationship out. It's no use focusing on things that are just out of reach because you'll just stop appreciating what's right in front of you."
scorpio,2010-11-01,"You must tread very carefully and watch your step now because you are more impulsive than usual. It's tough to filter out anger if your emotions surface suddenly because you still haven't had time to process them. Blocking the expressions of your feelings, however, isn't going to help the day, either. Share what's on your mind, but try not to inflame an already sensitive situation."
sagittarius,2010-11-01,"Make time for physical activity today because keeping your body in motion is a crucial key in preventing you from becoming a real live couch potato. However, you'll want to do everything just right now that the Moon is visiting perfectionist Virgo. Nevertheless, there can be a problem if you get so hung up in the details that you cannot move forward with confidence."
capricorn,2010-11-01,"Persuasive Pluto in serious Capricorn harmonizes with magnetic Venus in your 11th House of Goals, so don't hold back the power of your words today. You have a lot to share now and you shouldn't let anything stand in the way of expressing your truth. But it's not about what you say; it's more how you say it. Keep in mind that you can be both ambitious and kind in your approach."
aquarius,2010-11-01,"Your situation is looking better and better, but there are still a few loose ends that have to be tied up before you can move on to the next phase of your life. However, the rate of change could continue to increase for you over the next few weeks, so make a commitment to concentrate on the present moment and not on the future. It's good to be spontaneous, but don't let any unfinished tasks slip by unattended."
pisces,2010-11-01,"Beautiful Venus adds sweetness and grace to your life but a supportive sextile from shadowy Pluto can offer up sensual delights from the hidden recesses of your subconscious mind. Love isn't always simple and today you have an opportunity to experience a more complicated kind of pleasure. However, don't let fear stand in your way of a meaningful experience."
aries,2010-11-02,"You might consider deepening a partnership with someone who is very passionate now, with three planets activating your 8th House of Intimacy and Transformation. Even though your first impulse is to share your feelings, the timid Virgo Moon encourages you to keep them to yourself until you are fully aware of all the emotional dynamics of the situation. If you don't push ahead too fast, your patience will be rewarded in a surprising way."
taurus,2010-11-02,"You may feel intimidated today by someone who appears to have an emotional agenda that is very different than yours. Thankfully, you have the ability to create boundaries, if necessary. It's crucial for you to stand up for your beliefs, but this strategy can backfire if you become overly stubborn. If you cannot get the support you need, let go of your idea, even if you think it's a good one. It's not in your best interest now to set off on your own."
gemini,2010-11-02,"You may instinctively rebel against an authority figure today because you don't want to follow someone else's instructions. You feel like you know a better way to do nearly everything, and all you want is acknowledgment and respect. This can be your chance to demonstrate your cleverness by deciding what you want and then going for it. Don't let anyone talk you out of your intended plan, but be smart and listen to an expert's opinion."
cancer,2010-11-02,"There's no need to overextend your resources today, for everyone is on equal terms and the cost for any social activities can be graciously split evenly. You still may want to pay for some aspect of the day to express your generosity to someone you really like. But others won't likely be easily impressed now by your display of magnanimity unless you truly feel it in your heart."
leo,2010-11-02,"You might decide to keep your feelings to yourself today, but your emotions could just spill out if you don't pay extra careful attention to your words. It's easy to express what's on your mind now, but others might not be interested in hearing about your inner process. Don't say too much, for a small amount of truth will go a long way to inspire others."
virgo,2010-11-02,"Your sleep may have been a bit restless these past couple of nights with the Moon visiting your sign, amplifying the intensity of your dreams. However, the power of your fantasies begins to wane today. You are in the closing phase of an emotional cycle, so focus on finishing up old business before getting wrapped up in something new."
libra,2010-11-02,"You should be able to maintain your gracious manner and personable way of interacting with others today, even if you lack your normal patience. You really don't need the distraction of an intense argument, especially if it doesn't matter who wins in the long run. Instead of attempting to prove you are right to anyone else, concentrate on improving yourself."
scorpio,2010-11-02,"You are feeling your oats with three planets in magnetic Scorpio, yet it's not a good idea to tell everyone what you're thinking yet. It could appear as if your plans are working out perfectly, but one obstacle after another seems to sabotage your progress. Slowing down is one way to improve your chances for success, especially if you can find a way to enjoy the process along the way."
sagittarius,2010-11-02,"If things have been progressing slowly in your life, it's time to get ready for something big to happen. Don't spend the day lost in your futuristic dreams; instead take the initiative and strike while the iron is hot. However, if you haven't started by mid-afternoon, your motivation could temporarily slip away. There's nothing to be gained by being hard on yourself. Let your plans sit until you're ready to try again."
capricorn,2010-11-02,"You may not get to the bottom of what's happening today. At first, everyone's motives seem to be close to the surface, yet once you start digging you begin to realize how hidden the truth really is. Instead of wasting time trying to discover the source of someone's inspiration, just accept things at face value. You can always come back and do additional detective work later on if you're still interested."
aquarius,2010-11-02,"There's no need to hold on to any negative emotions today. They don't really belong to you, so just allow them to fade away on their own accord. Instead, you can benefit by focusing on your competency, rather than criticizing someone else or defending yourself needlessly. Ultimately, your current feelings have their own story. If you let others tell theirs, you could discover where you share common ground."
pisces,2010-11-02,"You may be greatly inspired, but it's difficult to hold on to the higher perspective today. It's easy to get confused now, especially if you think that there's a lot at stake. Focusing on the details is fine, but getting lost in them could spell your defeat. Balance the energy by steering yourself toward bigger ideas and the possibility of amazing adventures."
aries,2010-11-03,"Today marks a shift in relationship dynamics as someone finally understands your point of view. But don't assume that your friends will automatically encourage your independent behavior just because they listen to your story. Instead of pushing your luck, be thankful that they are trying to accept you as you are. You won't gain any further advantage if you try to convince others to step outside of their current comfort zone."
taurus,2010-11-03,"You might feel conflicted today as your high ideals pull you one way while the practicalities of your current obligations pull you another. If you let your responsibilities slide, you may not be able to take time off to enjoy yourself. Keep in mind that complaining won't help. Don't put off your work; stay focused and accomplish as much as you can."
gemini,2010-11-03,"You are set on having a good time, but you might not be willing to jump into the flow of fun until after you finish tying up some loose ends. Taking care of them today can free you up to enjoy yourself, but ignoring previous obligations could invite unnecessary problems toward the end of the week. Work now and play later."
cancer,2010-11-03,"It's all too easy for you to acknowledge your inner Crab today by establishing a hard protective shell around you. A more positive way to accomplish this is to surround yourself with the love of special friends who nurture you and help to make you feel secure. Staying at home for a while can be rejuvenating, even if you must head out into the world at some point to take care of business. This is a great day to settle into your cozy nest if you can."
leo,2010-11-03,"Although you may want to be involved in many activities today, this doesn't mean squeezing everything into one day. You will do best if you can find time to work first and then play later by planning your schedule with the idea of creating a healthy balance. Don't go overboard when you finally decide to have some fun; moderation is the key."
virgo,2010-11-03,"You may normally be so logical in your approach to spending money that you're willing to pass up a bargain item if you don't really need it. However, today you could become so obsessed with something that you might not be able to talk yourself out of buying it. Even if you feel very strongly about it, wait a few days before making a final decision."
libra,2010-11-03,"The Moon's return to your sign today may not help you make up your mind any faster, but you'll likely reach a point when your path becomes clear enough for you to decide. You could experience a bit of anxiety along the way, yet the stress actually pushes you closer to choosing. Fortunately, your life should get noticeably easier once you fix on a single direction."
scorpio,2010-11-03,"You may feel quite comfortable with your feelings today, even if you have to face a difficult decision. Perhaps you have already put yourself through enough anxiety and now it's time to let go. But even if you aren't completely ready to move on, it's still a good idea to keep your worries to yourself. Either way, the fact that others see a more relaxed version of you lifts your spirits even higher."
sagittarius,2010-11-03,"You have entered a period of renewal, making this a great time to begin reviewing the previous year and starting to envision what's next. However, this isn't a one-time event. Make this ritual of intentional visualization a regular part of your life until it becomes ingrained into your everyday routine. Remember, you can positively impact your future by changing how you see it."
capricorn,2010-11-03,"You may be more concerned today about professional issues and your role in the community. It seems as if others look to you for guidance now, yet they don't necessarily want you to take over. They only need you to listen and then reflect upon what they've said. You can be an amazingly effective leader now by being part of the team instead of assuming authority and telling others what to do."
aquarius,2010-11-03,"This can be a great time of year for you with fiery Mars moving through your 11th House of Goals. You are eager about what is around the next corner, but don't live so far into the future that you detach from what is happening right now. Spending quality time with your friends, associates and family can help you to refocus your attention on the present moment."
pisces,2010-11-03,"You don't have to succumb to self-doubt today, even if something reminds you of the limitations you are now facing. Old fears aren't necessarily relevant to your current situation anyhow. Don't keep your anxiety buried or it will continue to grow. Find a trusted friend or colleague and share your worries, but don't fall into the trap of placing blame on anyone else. Simply discussing your concerns helps dissipate negativity before it causes any further trouble."
aries,2010-11-04,"You can go out of your way to communicate your feelings today, but your good intentions won't be enough to smooth over the ruffled feathers. Someone may be annoyed with you now because you aren't trying to meet his or her expectations. But others won't be able to be angry if you tell the truth with kindness. Don't negotiate away your need for independence. You can be considerate while still honoring your integrity."
taurus,2010-11-04,"Being able to trust your friends means a lot to you today. Even if you disagree about something important, it will be okay if everyone expresses their feelings openly and honestly. However, your tendency to gloss over a difficult emotion can create a problem down the road. Take extra time to check in with yourself now to make sure that you really know what's in your heart, even if it's inconvenient."
gemini,2010-11-04,"You may not be able to say no to a good idea today, even if you don't have time to add another thing to your list of tasks. Your key planet Mercury forms an easygoing trine with expansive Jupiter, removing obstacles from your path and increasing your optimism. Unfortunately, your resources are limited and you could exhaust yourself trying to deliver on what you promised. Limiting your activities will increase your efficiency and improve your chances for success."
cancer,2010-11-04,"It's easier for you to talk about what you're capable of doing today than to actually follow through and get concrete results. Accordingly, it may be smarter to spend the day engaging in meetings, phone calls and emails, rather than pushing your agenda forward by executing your plans. Figure out the best way to reach your goals and prepare to make your move."
leo,2010-11-04,"You may be feeling on edge today because you know that something's brewing but you cannot yet tell what is going to happen. Although you are more upbeat than anything else, you are also worried that you aren't in complete control. Fortunately, you have more stability than you currently realize, so don't be afraid to let events flow without trying to direct every outcome."
virgo,2010-11-04,"Your key planet Mercury receives an encouraging boost of energy from giant Jupiter today, making you believe that anything you can imagine is possible. However, you're not invincible now, so don't fill up your life with plans based on unrealistic dreams. There's nothing wrong with setting ambitious goals as long as you also keep your feet on the ground. Reach for the stars, but don't lose sight of your valuable common sense."
libra,2010-11-04,"The Moon remains in your peaceful sign today, tempting you to try to get by with less hard work. You could end up wasting time and energy if you think that an ingenious shortcut will get you to where you're going faster than taking the tried and true path. But your most reliable approach comes from setting a pace early in the day and then sticking with it as best as you can."
scorpio,2010-11-04,"You are in your element as thoughtful Mercury in your sign harmonizes with joyful Jupiter in your 5th House of Fun and Games today. You might not be able to just forget about all the serious issues in your life, but at least you'll be able to put them into a healthy perspective that allows you to have a good time no matter what's going on. Ultimately the choice is yours: you can focus on all the uncertainty or you can take a quick vacation and concentrate on the power of now."
sagittarius,2010-11-04,"You have secrets to keep, yet it's a struggle to remain quiet today. Nevertheless, it's more important to honor your commitments, even if the smooth trine from chatty Mercury to your key planet Jupiter encourages you to spill the beans. You may be able to see the positive side of sharing what you know, but it's not your decision to make now. Take the high road and don't stir up any unnecessary trouble."
capricorn,2010-11-04,"You don't want to waste time engaging in small talk today; you prefer to get right to the core of the matter. You're not interested in being overly diplomatic now, even if you know that it can help you get what you want. Thankfully, your friends and associates will appreciate your direct and honest approach, so follow your instincts and get down to business without beating around the bush."
aquarius,2010-11-04,"Your key planet Uranus will keep you excited all day today, even if you have unexciting responsibilities to handle. The most mundane tasks can become fun if you change your perspective. Being focused helps you to get your work out of the way quickly so you have time to expand your horizons pursuing other interests that bring you even more satisfaction."
pisces,2010-11-04,"You appear very positive, even if you have some doubts today about the plans you've made for the future. However, others probably won't be able to sense your uncertainty, especially if you think it's in your interest to hide your lack of confidence. Ultimately, it would be best if you can find enough courage to share your fears, for they will most likely dissipate once you've given them voice."
aries,2010-11-05,"It's difficult to follow through with your big ideas now because it seems like people say one thing but mean something else. Allowing the space for others to change their minds should make it easier on everyone, but trying to hold someone else to one point of view can be rather frustrating. Wait until after tonight's Scorpio New Moon to seriously consider any long-term commitments."
taurus,2010-11-05,"Tonight's Scorpio New Moon in your 7th House of Others may complicate your relationship life, especially if you are struggling with boundary issues. It's hard to maintain clarity when you are up against the place where a friendship could turn into a more intimate relationship. Tread carefully; an error in judgment can sour a sweet situation. Wait until your common sense returns to properly assess the situation. Once you cross a line, it's not easy going back."
gemini,2010-11-05,"Work can be very demanding with the Scorpio New Moon highlighting your 6th House of Employment today, but the rewards will follow if you maintain unwavering determination. The key is to continue showing up no matter what happens. But being overly insistent could cause your plans to backfire if your approach overwhelms others. Using gentle persistence is much more effective now than dramatically pushing with one big burst of energy."
cancer,2010-11-05,"Tonight's Scorpio New Moon activates your 5th House of Spontaneity, inspiring you to express your passion in a creative way. But this isn't about trying to squeeze one more day of productivity out of a boring job situation. It's about creating something special that truly matters. Give whatever you are doing your best shot because you can impact others now in a profound and lasting manner."
leo,2010-11-05,"Tonight's Scorpio New Moon can be challenging because it could put your heart and your head in direct conflict. No matter which side wins, something is lost in the process. Thankfully you can change the rules of the game; instead of choosing emotions or logic, seek a position that honors both realms, allowing you to maintain your connection with your feelings while still remaining rational in your approach."
virgo,2010-11-05,"The potent Scorpio New Moon falls in your 3rd House of Communication, heightening your interactions with others and focusing your intentions. Nevertheless, it may be nearly impossible to remember what someone said earlier as your key planet Mercury moves to square confusing Neptune, adding a surreal quality to your day. Ride the waves of intensity with a healthy sense of humor, for the uncomfortable energy won't last too long."
libra,2010-11-05,"You could feel less confident and more stressed about the money issues that you must handle, since tonight's Scorpio New Moon falls in your 2nd House of Personal Resources. Don't let your uncertainty raise your fears. It won't be too difficult if you simply take things one step at a time. Pushing through your resistance is not about denying real concerns; it's about facing them head-on. Thankfully, your natural grace and positive attitude make the process much easier to manage for everyone involved."
scorpio,2010-11-05,"You're empowered to believe that you can do whatever you want, with tonight's New Moon in your emotionally intense sign. However, this line of thinking could land you in big trouble if you lose touch with reality. There isn't anything wrong with being optimistic, but acknowledging your limits today can save you from disappointment tomorrow."
sagittarius,2010-11-05,"In your desire to demonstrate your competence to the world, you might miss an opportunity to make a meaningful connection with someone close to you. Tonight's Scorpio New Moon falling in your 12th House of Secrets encourages you to hide your insecurities, but this doesn't necessarily make them go away. Instead, gently push your feelings up to the surface where they become easier to share. You don't have to be a super-hero; you only have to be real."
capricorn,2010-11-05,"Your friends and associates have very specific ideas about what you should be doing now and they won't likely cut you any slack if you ramble on about unimportant trivia. But with the Scorpio New Moon occurring tonight in your 11th House of Hopes and Wishes your plans may be more fixed than others realize and you really don't want to change your mind or find a different approach. Nevertheless, you can still listen carefully to whatever advice is offered; then go ahead and do what makes the most sense to you."
aquarius,2010-11-05,"Conflict at work could become complicated today with tonight's Scorpio New Moon activating your 10th House of Career, but there is opportunity to be found in the current state of imbalance. Once hidden feelings are out in the open there will be enough room for something very special to happen, even if you don't expect positive results. Be as rational as you can; the honest interchange of emotions may be enough to break through the resistance and clear the road ahead."
pisces,2010-11-05,"You probably know exactly what you want with tonight's fixed Scorpio New Moon occurring in your 9th House of Journeys. Although you may have a tough time putting your vision into words, no one is going to talk you out of it. Don't lose hope; you'll reach your destination if you stay on track. Keep in mind that you might have more immediate tasks that could require your attention first. The sooner your work is done, the quicker you will be able to return to your important personal pursuits."
aries,2010-11-06,"You might say that you want passion in your life now, but the idea of being overwhelmed by your feelings is safer than actually experiencing this kind of raw energy. Nevertheless, you have the ability to overcome your fear by facing it without unrealistic expectations. There's no need to perform for anyone else today. Don't hide your softer side; being vulnerable could be the key to a significant emotional breakthrough."
taurus,2010-11-06,"You may be very clear about what you want from a relationship now, but still could run into resistance on your way to satisfaction. Taking the tried and true path seems more reliable, but it won't produce the best results today. A calculated risk could reveal a surprising shortcut that really works."
gemini,2010-11-06,"Your key planet Mercury pulls you all over the place today, yet you may try to resist its clever calling. Nevertheless, you still could become very excited by the thought of doing something healthy for yourself. All forms of self-improvement, including meditation, diet, and exercise, seem to catch your attention now, but you must follow through and put your ideas into motion for them to have a positive impact."
cancer,2010-11-06,"You may be deep in contemplation today, yet you want to do something useful with the profound realizations that you are having. Fortunately, you realize that your happiness requires you to push past your sense of isolation and express your feelings. Don't worry about what others think now. Your fear of criticism need not stop you from sharing what's important to you."
leo,2010-11-06,"It's exciting when your feelings fall into place and lift your spirits. But it's even better when you can put your emotions into words and communicate them to someone close to you. However, you might be disappointed if you don't receive the support you are seeking. Don't expect too much from others now because it may take them a while to fully understand what you need."
virgo,2010-11-06,"You may be rather fixed about your schedule today and have little tolerance for what anyone else wants. However, you expect those around you to be able to accommodate your needs, even if you're asking for a lot. Don't be surprised if you push others past their limits now, prompting them to withdraw or to just simply say no. A little flexibility on your part might be enough to encourage your friends to bend a bit, too."
libra,2010-11-06,"You are able to take a new approach to your chores today, allowing you to feel better about your current circumstances. If you've been feeling bored, you might have a sudden breakthrough and realize that you don't need to change as much as you thought you did. Making small modifications to your routine could be more effective now than turning everything upside down just to add a little excitement back into your life."
scorpio,2010-11-06,"Your friends and family may be used to you endlessly asking questions that unwrap their emotions. You are able to reveal what is hidden in others like a chef that skillfully removes the outer layers of an onion. But instead of requiring a sharp knife, you'll need your total concentration and an open mind. Paying attention to what's most significant could add happiness to your life and increase your chances for success."
sagittarius,2010-11-06,"Someone may say something shocking to you today that catches you off guard. However, anything that gives you more freedom is a wonderful opportunity now, even if it doesn't feel good at first. Don't resist your newly found independence, for it's difficult to get back once you give it up. Instead, be upfront about your personal preferences, but then accept the inevitable and move on from there."
capricorn,2010-11-06,"You want to talk about the future in rather unrealistic terms today, but you could be so convincing that you don't really need to be any more specific. It appears that you are in a manifestation mode, so it's easier than usual to get what you want now. Nevertheless, if you hit a wall, don't waste your energy trying to break it down. Instead, retreat, regroup and try again when you're more ready."
aquarius,2010-11-06,"Communicator Mercury harmoniously trines progressive Uranus today, increasing the chances for you to do some long-term planning for your future. But, as much as you try to feel confident, your ideas might not carry much weight now. Instead of attempting to demonstrate your power by being authoritarian, pull back and give everyone enough elbow room to enable them to show what they can do."
pisces,2010-11-06,"You are sold on the idea of spreading your wings by traveling to an exotic destination or beginning a new course of study. And although you may feel quite free and unencumbered as you visualize your way into the next phase of your life, your current fantasies could also lead you astray if you don't distinguish between them and your real hopes. It's healthy to dream about your meditations and to meditate on your dreams."
aries,2010-11-07,"You have passed through a doorway that has led to an unfamiliar realm where logic doesn't always give you the concrete answers you seek. However, now it's time to push forward with your agenda, even if you aren't clear about the deeper meaning of current events. Apply whatever lessons you learn by exploring your feelings to accomplish something real today. Don't worry if it takes time to integrate your emotions with your thoughts."
taurus,2010-11-07,"You may be required to work closely with your friends or family members today, even if you prefer to be on your own. You cannot simply withdraw because everyone wants you involved with what they are doing. Even if it's not easy, relationships have a lot to teach you. Commit to expressing your feelings and then stick with the process. If it becomes uncomfortable, rest assured that the situation is temporary and the energy will shift."
gemini,2010-11-07,"An optimistic person could bring good news today, yet you know that there's more to it than first meets the eye. The discussion can grow more complex if you have the courage to engage in a serious conversation. Avoiding the interaction may be tempting, but it's better to know what's happening beneath the surface before you become more involved. Narrowing your focus is a smart strategy and offers more benefits than just accepting whatever comes your way."
cancer,2010-11-07,"Memories wash over your mind and put you in touch with previously forgotten feelings that now can rush back into awareness. It may be challenging to concentrate on fulfilling your responsibilities, for old desires are reawakening and you are attracted to them. Don't worry if you let your chores slip today; take advantage of the potential opportunity for personal growth while the positive energy is present."
leo,2010-11-07,"You may be at the top of your game, eager to say yes to anything that sounds like fun. However, even if you think you're ready to jump in, you'll probably hesitate because you don't want to waste your energy on something that ultimately won't be significant. Don't hide behind your smile and charm today; express your concerns and don't worry if you are not acting as others might wish."
virgo,2010-11-07,"Spending time at home sounds like a good idea, but you may have too many things to do today that require you to head out into the world. Keep in mind that your words can make all the difference between success and failure, so don't complain about what you have to do. Instead, be as positive as you can when talking about your plans and then try to manifest what's most important to you."
libra,2010-11-07,"Grandiose ideas about your goals today can set you up for frustration when things don't turn out quite as good as you imagined. Nevertheless, you can still accomplish a lot and your current productivity helps to improve your self-esteem. Don't waste time comparing yourself to your ideal; rather than thinking about what you didn't do, focus on what you can make happen in the present moment."
scorpio,2010-11-07,"You may be overly optimistic about your financial situation now that the Moon is visiting your 2nd House of Money. Luckily, the Sun in your sign blesses you with vitality, enabling you to take on more projects than ever. But this high level of intensity can also bring anger to the surface, so find ways to burn off your unexpressed feelings or you might attract needless conflicts about things that ultimately don't matter."
sagittarius,2010-11-07,"Although you may feel quite energetic as the Moon joins feisty Mars in your sign, you might also sense an incoming wave of uncertainty as signals from your subconscious mind flow into awareness. You could try to ignore your current feelings, but they are too distracting. Even if you don't know where these currents are taking you, it's futile to fight against them. Save your energy for the specific issues that could arise instead of simply shadow boxing with your own fears."
capricorn,2010-11-07,"Negativity may leak to the surface today, yet you may not understand why until you realize that there are serious questions that still need answers. It's not that you are pessimistic, but you see problems that others easily overlook. Remember, you can be very successful, even if a few details are left hanging, so let go of your concerns and allow your confidence to build."
aquarius,2010-11-07,"You are quite likely to succeed now, in part because you won't take no for an answer. You are able to hold firm to your goal, no matter what kind of resistance you encounter. Others may be surprised by your tenacity these days, but don't let their reactions sway you from your objectives. Fix your attention on your destination and push steadily in that direction."
pisces,2010-11-07,"You have a wide-angle lens in your scope of understanding now that three planets are energizing your 9th House of Big Ideas. Because you are able to see farther into the distance, others will naturally come to you for advice. Be careful; there may be two possible paths and as soon as you favor one, you'll encounter resistance from those who are leaning the other way. Stay in the middle as long as you can and avoid making a choice until the last possible moment."
aries,2010-11-08,"Think it through before you say anything today, because chatty Mercury encourages you to share what's on your mind before you consider the consequences. It doesn't matter that your intentions are good; you still might hurt someone's feelings before you even realize what you said. Just because it's okay with you doesn't mean that others will feel that way, too."
taurus,2010-11-08,"You might choose to let someone know exactly what you want today. Unfortunately, this could be a classic case of too much information as your ability to acknowledge social norms could be impaired by boisterous Jupiter's imaginative biquintile to your ruling planet Venus. You may be playing outside the box now, but this doesn't necessarily mean that everyone else wants to join you."
gemini,2010-11-08,"Others might see you as stubborn and even argumentative today, but you are just having a good time. You cannot help it if someone else is so sensitive that he or she takes offense with something you say in a casual manner. Your intent is to be clever and you won't think twice about crossing the line of good taste in order to get the laugh or make your point. Nevertheless, respecting everyone else's feelings is still a wise idea."
cancer,2010-11-08,"Your friends appear to be enjoying the events of the day, yet you seem to be challenged with a tricky dilemma. Your current situation probably has subtle complexities; while the signs are pointing toward a more progressive solution, it's hard for you to let go of the status quo. Keep in mind that you don't need to turn your life upside down today. You can move into the future with one small step after another."
leo,2010-11-08,"Your lack of moderation can create a problem today because you can't see the value of curtailing your fun. You know what makes you happy and so you may convince yourself that more is even better. The truth may be accessible now, but will only take you so far. Try to figure out where your sensible limit is before you go way beyond it."
virgo,2010-11-08,"Sharing your feelings may not be the most diplomatic thing to do now because your words might come across more combative than you intend. You could try greeting others with a smile on your face, yet the genuine warmth you feel still could be misinterpreted as an attack. Perhaps your no-nonsense manner makes others feel uncomfortable. Whatever the reason, it's helpful if you soften your voice and temper your approach."
libra,2010-11-08,"Your key planet Venus enters your friendly sign today, infusing the most unstable parts of your personal life with beautiful possibilities. Perhaps someone at work will tempt you with an unexpected offer. Saying yes may be the course of least resistance, but keep in mind that your actions could take you in a difficult direction. Give yourself permission to play, but don't ignore your common sense."
scorpio,2010-11-08,"You are not willing to take no for an answer today as smart Mercury enters uplifting Sagittarius, inspiring you to speak with the power of your convictions. Although you may be more persuasive than usual, your insightful awareness helps by reminding you when it's time to back off or be quiet. If you push too hard, you could ruin your connections faster than you can make them."
sagittarius,2010-11-08,"Today the needy Moon in your sign squares your key planet Jupiter, making it possible for you to exaggerate anything so much that you can no longer judge its relative importance. You may become so excited by new ideas that you lose your objectivity, along with your common sense. If something or someone looks exceptionally good today, wait until you see how you feel about it tomorrow before making any final decisions."
capricorn,2010-11-08,"Try to keep your imagination in perspective now because you know how serious life will get in the weeks ahead. It's challenging to give up control when you know there must be something you could be doing that will improve the situation. Still, it's an excellent idea to enjoy yourself and take advantage of the opportunity to play. No doubt, it will be easier to return to work if you give yourself time to relax."
aquarius,2010-11-08,"An unexpected event could spark your day and send you off on a different direction than you planned. How you react to what happens, however, is your choice and will set some actions into motion. You may have trouble finding balance now, even though a bit of moderation can prevent your house of cards from tumbling down."
pisces,2010-11-08,"Your traditional planetary ruler is jovial Jupiter and today he can convince you to speed right past the stop signs without even slowing down. Things are looking good, but keep in mind that everything could change in the blink of an eye if you aren't aware of your current circumstances. You can avoid accidents and unpleasant surprises by concentrating fully on what you are doing throughout the entire day."
aries,2010-11-09,"You feel like working harder now because you think that your ambitions have a better chance of being realized. But it's not just because you are willing to put in the extra effort to get what you want. It's as if you are tapping into something mysterious that adds power to whatever you do. Keep in mind that fulfillment of your dreams may take longer than you wish, but believing in yourself is the first step to success."
taurus,2010-11-09,"You have extra patience, but it's not because you are so saintly today. Rather, you know what you want and will do whatever you must to reach your goals. If it's advantageous for you to push extra hard, you will. But if playing the waiting game will bring satisfaction in the long run, then that's exactly what you'll do. Just be certain that your dreams are worth the wait."
gemini,2010-11-09,"You will take your own plans quite seriously today and expect everyone else to do the same. But you may not be so quick with your snappy comebacks now because you realize that you have a chance to experience something you might normally miss. Instead of throwing out a clever line, sink into a meaningful emotional dialogue as you would a luxurious fantasy. But remember, this one is real."
cancer,2010-11-09,"Although you might not be feeling the weight of the world on your shoulders today, someone else may successfully push you in that direction. Self-examination is usually a good idea, but don't get sucked into doubt that's not yours if a close friend lays a guilt trip on you. Remember, no one has the right to take your current state of self-acceptance away from you. Listening to your instincts now is smarter than relying on others for guidance."
leo,2010-11-09,"You may feel awkward as the party spirit begins to wane. You weren't looking for additional responsibilities and it could seem like too much, too soon. But don't waste energy worrying because you have some extra pleasant times ahead, even if you have to tackle some less enjoyable tasks first. Take your mind off your current situation by concentrating on reaping the rewards later on."
virgo,2010-11-09,"If you've been overly anxious because something seems out of whack recently, rest assured that a shift toward stability is now in the works. But your newly found center of gravity is not without its own intensity, so don't expect all your problems to just disappear. However, you should be able to enjoy yourself today, no matter what stress you face. There is a peaceful place within that can change your attitude for the better."
libra,2010-11-09,"Your key planet Venus has retrograded back into your sign, requiring you to express your desires in a low-key manner. It's going to take a while for you to get what you want, so don't be overly demanding now. Nevertheless, others will know in no uncertain terms exactly what you want. Keep in mind that true satisfaction is worth the wait."
scorpio,2010-11-09,"You are in a healthier place now with respect to harvesting the fruits of your labors. But this isn't just about your career; it has more to do with the overall satisfaction you feel about your current life, even if it is still far from your idea of perfection. Don't focus on what you don't have; instead, express your gratitude for everything that makes you happy in the present moment."
sagittarius,2010-11-09,"You might want the fun times to last forever, but of course they cannot. However, this doesn't mean that you are headed for troubled waters; it's just that your exuberant energy needs to mellow out. If you consider what you have, though, you'll realize that there are many good things in your life, even if fireworks aren't lighting up the sky. There's no need to wait for something better to happen; share your love with those in your life who deserve it right now."
capricorn,2010-11-09,"An intense emotional interaction can wake you up today and remind you of something that you have been trying to avoid. But there isn't any need to fix everything all at once. Simply being aware is a sufficient start. Let your feelings play through as naturally as possible, without trying to push your agenda on others. It's better to be an observer now than to force an issue in a way that won't bring you any closer to happiness."
aquarius,2010-11-09,"You might want to go into hiding today as the Moon visits your reclusive 12th House, but your need for seclusion won't likely last long. Treat this urge with respect, especially if you have been socially active recently. But don't confuse your current desire for contemplation with moodiness. Creating healthy boundaries is a great way to replenish your spirit."
pisces,2010-11-09,"You may not be very concerned with what you're supposed to do in the real world today because your dreams are too special to push away. It's important to realize that your happiness isn't dependent upon acquiring more material wealth. Instead of focusing on your professional ambitions now, surround yourself with friends who encourage your spiritual growth."
aries,2010-11-10,You could get yourself into trouble today if you think that you deserve power without necessarily earning it. It's not that you are consciously trying to pull a fast one; it's just that you often don't take enough time to consider what you are doing before you set the wheels in motion on an idea that's built on passion rather than logic. Making an important decision now will turn out better if you back it up with facts and not your feelings.
taurus,2010-11-10,"It's easier for you now to see the consequences of the choices you make because you aren't encumbered by other people's expectations. Your friends and workmates may have their own agendas, but their unspoken needs are invisible to you today unless they specifically ask you to do something. Nevertheless, taking the time to check out your plan with someone you trust before putting it into action still could be a wise move."
gemini,2010-11-10,"You may not have the patience to stick with a conversation once your mind starts to wander. Luckily, today you have the ability to override your tendency to become bored when the topic isn't interesting to you. Keep in mind that you cannot always have the lighthearted version; sometimes you have to sink beneath the surface to get to what's truly important."
cancer,2010-11-10,It's not easy for you when someone you really like won't even take the time to listen to what you have to say today. You don't want to be cut off while you're expressing your feelings and you don't want anyone to fix anything. All you need is to be fully acknowledged so you can rest assured that you have been understood. Don't take a rejection too personally now. Wait until others are more receptive before sharing what's on your mind.
leo,2010-11-10,"You have a set list of tasks to accomplish today and you're not interested in having anyone talk you out of your current agenda. You're not likely to change your mind just because someone else thinks that you're trying to do too much or wants you to do something else. However, make sure that you're not being so stubborn that you miss an exciting opportunity. It doesn't hurt to keep an open mind and a more flexible attitude."
virgo,2010-11-10,You know what you want today and may try to get others involved in ways that will be beneficial to you. There's nothing wrong with this tactic as long as you don't purposefully mislead anyone because of selfish motives. Keep in mind that you will be more likely to receive the support that you seek if your goals benefit more people than just you.
libra,2010-11-10,"You're rather serious about your feelings today, possibly making others withdraw because they don't want to be around your uncharacteristic intensity now. But there's no need to arbitrarily alter your path just to get someone to like you. It's sufficient to stay true to your values. Nevertheless, it doesn't hurt to be kind."
scorpio,2010-11-10,"Your motives may not be clear to others today, but this could actually work in your favor. It's not that you are unable to explain why you are doing something; it's just that any discussion of your ideas now is only a distraction. Additionally, you can even gain energy when you know that no one else is in on your secret plan. Don't succumb to anyone's pressure to talk about your strategy. You'll know when the time is right."
sagittarius,2010-11-10,"You may have some money issues to handle today, but you might not want others to know what's going on. Although it's nothing to be ashamed about, you want to keep this to yourself because you believe that everyone will offer different advice and you prefer to manage your affairs on your own now. However, confiding in the right person could be helpful because you could learn something that will be very useful at this time."
capricorn,2010-11-10,"You may seem moodier than you actually feel now that the Moon is in your 1st House of Personality. But this could become a problem today if you insist on setting your friends right. Paradoxically, protesting your heightened emotional intensity turns you into exactly what you're denying. Let others think what they will; their opinions don't have to impact you in a negative manner."
aquarius,2010-11-10,You are a walking contradiction because you want to keep your feelings to yourself but flying beneath the radar isn't possible now. The problem is that you have an important role to play today and your actions are quite visible. Keep in mind that you don't have to reveal your private emotions just because you are in a public position at this time. A mysterious smile will be enough to keep everyone guessing.
pisces,2010-11-10,"If you are involved as part of a team on a project now, you should be careful about going against the grain of the group. Naturally, you would be selling yourself short if you didn't stand up for your beliefs. However, there's no need to take things to an extreme measure. Once you make your position known, be willing to let go of it for the common good."
aries,2010-11-11,"You are ready to catch the wind to points unknown today, but at least you have an idea of which way the breezes are blowing. Unfortunately, once you're soaring, you realize that the currents aren't as stable as you first thought. But getting down isn't as easy as getting airborne. Relax and enjoy the ride, even if you no longer know where you are going."
taurus,2010-11-11,"You have high hopes for reaching your goals today, but the determination for which you are famous may not be enough to guarantee your success. Instead of relentlessly driving toward your singular destination, remain open to what's being revealed by the changing circumstances. It's more important to be light on your feet and willing to switch direction than it is to doggedly push toward an objective that no longer makes sense."
gemini,2010-11-11,"Someone's high ideals can open your mind today to a whole new way of looking at things. Thankfully, you're attentive to what's being said and what you learn now can have a lasting impact on your life. It's as if you have been supplied with a missing piece of information that helps everything fit into place. Although you are learning about the truth, keep in mind that a few days of gaining perspective will prevent you from jumping into something that you don't yet fully understand."
cancer,2010-11-11,"The day begins with the authoritative Capricorn Moon in your 7th House of Partners, reinforcing the hold that someone has over you. But events can take some interesting twists and turns today, shifting the center of power from others to you. Be careful, for being in control isn't all that it's cracked up to be. It's a smart strategy to find a supportive copilot so you don't have to do all the work."
leo,2010-11-11,"You are full of good ideas today, but they may not be very practical. Your high ideals are the driving force behind your current creativity now, but they could also lead you astray if you let them. Nevertheless, this is not the time for idle dreaming. You must take direct action, even if you're not yet sure of your goals. They will grow clearer in time."
virgo,2010-11-11,"Setting goals in your personal life now is just as important as establishing them within your career. If you don't have any specific objectives, you'll just flounder around aimlessly. Don't become a casualty of your potential professional success; your life will be more meaningful if you can find a healthy balance between your job and your family."
libra,2010-11-11,"The Moon's late afternoon entry into conceptual Aquarius seems like a breath of fresh air, but you cannot help but feel that something strange is going on. The overall buzz is kind of cool, but it can be tiring to keep your mind on the more ethereal side of life. Don't succumb to self-doubt when wondering if your perceptions of the dream world are actually valid. Just live your life knowing that they are as real as you allow them to be."
scorpio,2010-11-11,"You have big plans involving your finances today. Maybe you are deciding how to spend a portion of your savings for the acquisition of something that can make your life easier. But there are subtle influences now that can make your choice more complicated, especially if you don't fully understand how all the pieces fit together. Take your time; the need to hurry is more arbitrary than you realize."
sagittarius,2010-11-11,"You appear to be straightforward in your actions and your words today, yet there is more going on than what is happening on the surface. Your friends can jump to incorrect conclusions, but their false assumptions are easy to correct once they make them known. However, problems can arise if something is left unsaid. A bit of investigation on your part can ferret out where their logic has gone wrong."
capricorn,2010-11-11,"If you have a big secret now you might make a whole lot of fuss about something unimportant just to distract everyone's attention from lingering on the real deal. But you can keep up the shell game for only so long, because it drains too much of your psychic energy. Consider what emotions -- yours or someone else's -- might be stirred by sharing your vulnerability. Don't just blurt out your truth without having a sensible strategy that leads to a healthy closure."
aquarius,2010-11-11,"You are feeling quite social now, yet your interactions with friends and workmates could take you in a totally unexpected direction. Ironically, the more it appears that you are in control, the greater the gap between your expectations and reality. Trusting in the process is a smart idea, but it will require focus and follow-through to make your dreams come true."
pisces,2010-11-11,Your actions at work have been pretty transparent recently because your objections are clear and you're determined to get what you want. But the Moon's entry into your 12th House of Secrets today increases the level of complexity to what you're doing. Be careful; sending mixed signals can become a hazard if there's something that you're trying to hide.
aries,2010-11-12,"You are ready to accept your responsibilities today, even if you would rather be doing something else. Fortunately, you can handle a few days of hard work by tenaciously holding onto a memory of a recent experience that made you feel good. Although you aren't likely to live in the past, replaying recollections of your past pleasures can ease your current frustrations."
taurus,2010-11-12,"It's one thing to raise issues from the past when they are germane to a current situation, but it's quite different to obsess about something that just doesn't resonate in the present moment. If you can't get a painful memory out of your head, avoidance and suppression will only strengthen it. However, it's not wise to arbitrarily share your story with just anyone; choose someone you trust before you open up."
gemini,2010-11-12,"You may feel as if someone is trying to sell you a piece of imaginary blue sky today as he or she puts an optimistic spin on a difficult situation. You can accept what you are told at face value without necessarily committing to further involvement on your part. Recognizing your limitations is crucial, but acting on what you feel is even more important."
cancer,2010-11-12,"You may have a big idea about a project at work now, but self-doubt prevents you from telling anyone what you are thinking. Perhaps you recall another time when you took on more than you could handle. Nevertheless, your current anxiety might be unfounded. Sharing your thoughts will be easier if you are honest about your strengths and limitations. Ask for help up front instead of promising more than you can possibly deliver."
leo,2010-11-12,"Someone you trust may inadvertently hurt your feelings today by bringing up an issue that you thought was history. Don't take it personally even if it involves you, because this is probably more about the other person's residual feelings than your reaction. Taking the emotional high road is crucial or you could become mired in the past instead of happily moving into the future."
virgo,2010-11-12,"Since you are usually conscientious with your commitments, it may surprise others today if you agree to something and then turn around and rescind your promise. Your agreement initially stems from your eagerness to please those you like. But once you think about it, you'll want to repair your error in judgment. Remember, we all make mistakes; the quicker you can set it right, the better it will be for all involved."
libra,2010-11-12,"You are usually the one who graciously hides your feelings to make everyone else feel good about what's happening. Now, however, your patience may run thin as you react impulsively, without giving yourself enough time to monitor the impact of your behavior. Don't be hard on yourself if you upset someone. Taking care of your own needs is more important today than keeping the peace."
scorpio,2010-11-12,"You are tempted to avoid handling a financial issue today, but it's wiser to deal with the situation before it gets worse. It may be as simple as paying a bill that is overdue or untangling an accounting problem. Whatever it is, don't allow your resistance to unpleasant money matters stand in the way of taking care of business while it's still easily manageable."
sagittarius,2010-11-12,"Your perceptions are quite accurate today and your vision is strong enough for you to believe that what you see is the truth. You can feel the emotions of others, and this heightened empathy encourages you to share your revelations with them. This can be quite helpful, but don't assume that you know what is best. Your way of handling adversity may work well for you, but it's not necessarily the path to happiness for anyone else."
capricorn,2010-11-12,"Your imagination can take over today by showing you multiple solutions to a current problem. Unfortunately, you might not be able to discern which one is the best course of action. Although you may want to go with the very first idea that comes to mind, this isn't your smartest move. Take your time and methodically follow each option through to its logical conclusion before making your final decision."
aquarius,2010-11-12,"Your chances for success increase today as the smart Aquarius Moon harmonizes with action-oriented Mars and proficient Saturn. But even if you know how to handle a difficult situation now, moving slowly will still be advantageous. A hurried plan reveals your weaknesses while a cool and calm approach will demonstrate your maturity and help you gain the authority you need to make it all happen. Additionally, this strategy allows others to connect with you in deeper and more meaningful ways."
pisces,2010-11-12,"It's easy for you to show others how self-assured you are today, even if you actually feel insecure. But your veneer of confidence could get in the way, because expressing your self-doubt now shows more strength of character than hiding it. Don't shy away from speaking the truth. Ultimately, your position will be stronger if you are completely honest about your feelings."
aries,2010-11-13,"You don't want to wait much longer because you think that you've been patient long enough. You aren't quite ready to initiate your plan today, but in your mind you have already escaped from the starting gate and are running the race. It's crucial now to pay attention to the differences between what you want and what you already have, but it's not yet time to bridge the gap. Taking action too soon can lessen your chances of success."
taurus,2010-11-13,"Approaching your chores pragmatically is usually easy for you, but you may be too idealistic now for your own good. You can maintain a positive attitude even if nothing appears quite as wonderful as you wish. Still, there might be exciting developments that give you reason to raise your hopes. Nevertheless, don't allow your expectations to grow out of hand; believing in unrealistic dreams can set you up for a major disappointment."
gemini,2010-11-13,"You've been feeling somber recently, wondering about the complexity of your relationships and how you can reach satisfaction without upsetting your routine. It's no fun being stuck, unable to figure out how to reach your next destination. Thankfully, your spirits lift today because you feel a bit of movement within your imagination -- and this allows you to clarify your plans for the future."
cancer,2010-11-13,"You may feel anxious today because you can sense that someone isn't being totally open and honest with you. You think you know everything there is to know about a close friend, but then you start to notice things that don't make sense. You might not know if you should disbelieve your recent perceptions or your previous assumptions. Don't force an answer; the rest of the story will be revealed in time."
leo,2010-11-13,"The partnership dance increases in intensity now that the Moon is traveling through your 7th House of Partners. It's challenging to be close to someone if it feels like he or she is pulling away from you. The truth is that your current insecurity can widen the apparent gulf between you and others. Give them the space they need to define who they are without falling into the trap of interpreting their desire for independence as a personal rejection. Ultimately, the time apart can strengthen the bond you already share."
virgo,2010-11-13,"It's time to get busy, but running errands may not unfold today as you imagined. Projects that you began over the past few days can take a surprising turn, so it's critical to stay as flexible as you can now. You may need to come up with a fresh approach if your current strategy doesn't work. You could be tempted to lean heavily on your analytical skills, but don't be afraid to do what feels right, without trying to justify your actions."
libra,2010-11-13,"You are running on a creative high today, but you still must give yourself permission to leave your regular chores undone for now. Thankfully, you are able to get away with spending more time on self-expression, but you may not have enough money to get the things that you want. Remember, this isn't an all-or-nothing proposition. Small, determined steps are better than uncommitted giant steps."
scorpio,2010-11-13,"You probably have your work cut out for you as you try to fulfill all the promises you made. Nevertheless, you also need to take some downtime for yourself. This is not about self-indulgent withdrawal; rather, you need to reclaim your center and plant yourself back on the ground or you won't be able to feel good about where things stand. Once you pull in your energy and define your boundaries, you should be ready for another round of worldly engagement."
sagittarius,2010-11-13,"It's easier for you to follow your own schedule today than to conform to someone else's. However, you're not free of commitments; it's just that you'll be able to take a bit more responsibility for what happens, without feeling like your style is being cramped. Take advantage of your additional elbowroom, but don't abuse your freedom or it will vanish quicker than it appeared."
capricorn,2010-11-13,"Express your creativity with confidence today, or whatever you start might not achieve full potential. You can increase your chances for success by putting your personal stamp on everything you do, so it doesn't appear the same as everyone else's. On the other side of the coin, it's also important that you don't overdo your originality because doing things too differently makes others feel uncomfortable."
aquarius,2010-11-13,"You may not be able to decide how you feel today, because your emotions shift from one extreme to the other now that the Moon is back in your sign. Your anticipation of what's next gives way to fear of change. Those close to you may not be able to keep up with your fluctuating moods, so it's a smart strategy to turn down the volume on your intensity for a while. It will be easier to share your perspective once things settle down."
pisces,2010-11-13,"You may be performing a balancing act as you try to live up to other people's expectations while still remaining true to yourself. Unfortunately, it's more difficult to do what you're supposed to do if it isn't what you feel. Listen to your inner voice, but don't make any long lasting commitments. You still have time before you must make a final decision."
aries,2010-11-14,"You are being pulled in opposite directions today as you simultaneously seek both comfort and excitement. Waves of anxiety may come and go during the day as you grow too attached to one extreme or the other. But the stress can be stimulating, even enjoyable, if you don't try to resolve the tension. Thankfully, stability should return if you are able to accept the paradox of your opposing desires."
taurus,2010-11-14,"Your friends can be the source of confusion today. They might offer the invitation for fun, but you have to be willing to step outside of your comfort zone. Leaving obligations unfulfilled can make you feel anxious. Obviously, it makes more sense to meet your responsibilities first, but logistically this might not be possible. If you do decide to escape with your buddies for a while, don't complain if you need to work later in the evening."
gemini,2010-11-14,"You feel like an unreliable leader today, yet others still want you to make important decisions. Fortunately, you will be able to do what you must, even if it requires you to focus your attention on the matter at hand until the situation is resolved. Don't be afraid to take a stand. However, keep in mind that circumstances could change, so you may reevaluate your position tomorrow."
cancer,2010-11-14,"You could feel quite courageous today yet you won't likely make a foolish decision. Your intuition should steer you in the right direction as long as you don't purposefully avoid any facts. In fact, your hunches have an excellent chance of being right on target, so if your idea also sounds good to others, don't hesitate any longer. Listen to their advice and boldly act on it."
leo,2010-11-14,"You might believe that you know what's going on, but you could be misreading the signals today. Be careful about jumping to conclusions; verify your assumptions by asking others to confirm what you think you know. Thankfully, good communication can overcome your uncertainty. And even if you discover a problem with your plan, it should be easy enough to make a quick fix and get things back on track."
virgo,2010-11-14,"You might have a difficult encounter with an overly emotional person today that raises your fears about trusting feelings over facts. Fortunately, you should be fine if you're flexible enough to change your expectations because you could be a bit unrealistic now in your thinking. Avoid disappointment by remaining open to what happens instead of trying to force your agenda onto others."
libra,2010-11-14,"Even a carefully thought out plan might fall apart today for no apparent reason. Trying to maintain your schedule could increase your anxiety level, so it's crucial now to know when to let go of control. Clinging to your preconceived ideas of what should happen will only increase your frustration. Luckily, you have a real opportunity to gain something special, but you must be responsive to the changing circumstances."
scorpio,2010-11-14,"A memorable day awaits you if you are willing to compromise. Unfortunately, you may be tempted to hold out for what you want, but this tactic could engender unnecessary conflict. Luckily, the Moon's entry into your 5th House of Play suggests that your feelings can lead you to pleasure if you don't try to over-analyze them. Spontaneity can help you find enjoyment in the moment; don't get lost in your plans or you could miss out on the excitement."
sagittarius,2010-11-14,"You are in touch with an underlying tension, yet it doesn't have to negatively impact your day. Hiding your emotions will only increase your anxiety, so the smartest strategy is to openly talk about your feelings without being too attached to the outcome. Fortunately, your honest approach and flexible attitude enable you to deepen a friendship now without creating awkward expectations."
capricorn,2010-11-14,"Your life may be a bit hectic today, yet you are positioned to accomplish a lot. Your most serious problems might be self-created, especially if you try to exert total control over events that are beyond your reach. Instead of imagining that you are in charge, let someone else drive so you can sit back and enjoy the scenery for a while."
aquarius,2010-11-14,"Worrying about what others think about you isn't usually your main concern, but today someone could rain on your parade, making you question your current priorities. Thankfully, with a little extra effort, you should be able to turn your anxiety into positive action. But don't over-intellectualize your emotional reaction. Instead, get out of your head and trust your instincts."
pisces,2010-11-14,"The Moon's return to your sign suggests that your emotions are closer to the surface today, which might lead others into believing that they know what you're feeling. However, their assumptions could get in the way. Keep in mind that it's not your job to live up to anyone else's expectations. Your changing moods may not follow your initial plan, but it's wise to listen to your heart, even if it means that you will have some explaining to do later on."
aries,2010-11-15,"The results of your recent work can bring rewards now, but not necessarily in obvious ways. You are able to enjoy life more today as you bask in the awareness of a job well done. But don't let your optimism lead to laziness, for you could falsely believe that you deserve extra time off. This is a mistake; just because you're feeling good, you shouldn't let your regular responsibilities slip."
taurus,2010-11-15,"You are able to understand new ideas quite easily today because you are eager to broaden your horizons. Sometimes you are satisfied with maintaining the status quo, but now you are confident enough to step beyond your normal routine so that you can get more out of life. However, this isn't about contradicting your basic philosophical approach to living; rather, this is an opportunity to build on the foundation of what you already know."
gemini,2010-11-15,"Sometimes steady growth is restraining because you want to go at your own pace, which can be faster than everyone else's. However, the Sun's trine to jovial Jupiter in your 10th House of Career allows you to obtain much-needed support from your boss and your workmates as you bolt ahead of the pack. There's no need to slow down now; go ahead and explore new territory without worrying about the usual resistance."
cancer,2010-11-15,"New ideas are flowing into your life now, but you must be ready to receive them. You may already be in touch with a philosophical perspective as beneficial Jupiter continues to inspire your 9th House of Higher Truth, but the Sun-Jupiter trine today can blast the doors of awareness open. Luckily, this shouldn't feel like hard work. Opportunities to expand your thinking and widen your horizons are more fun than you might expect."
leo,2010-11-15,"An emotional breakthrough is quite possible today, but you must learn to see things from a broader perspective before the coming changes can impact your relationships. Letting go of fixed ideas isn't easy, but today's Sun-Jupiter trine may be like a ""Get Out of Jail Free"" card. Still, it's up to you to use it. You'll need to take a risk or you could stay stuck in your current situation, wishing that you didn't let the opportunity pass you by. Think big and then follow through with confidence and persistence."
virgo,2010-11-15,"Your relationships can feed your creativity now, especially if you are willing to listen to the ideas of others. However, inspiration won't just happen all on its own. You must put on your thinking cap and be persistent about maximizing your current cleverness potential. Once you start something, stick with it, even if your certainty lags. You are closer to success than you realize."
libra,2010-11-15,"You may be surprised by the support you receive at work today, because you didn't see it coming. Help arrives in funny ways now, yet you could miss it if you are looking too hard in one direction. Nevertheless, if you can get past your own resistance to change, you have an opportunity to improve the quality of your everyday life. The choice is yours; be courageous and let your friends and associates nurture you in practical ways that matter."
scorpio,2010-11-15,"The importance of having fun cannot be overstated, because you can be highly creative today as long as you're enjoying yourself. There's no reason to impose arbitrary limits on what you can do. Even if you don't reach an unrealistic goal, you'll get farther along on your path if you extend yourself as much as possible now."
sagittarius,2010-11-15,"Your fantasies can be a major source of inspiration today, but you need to exercise a bit of caution. Not only is it easy to get lost in your inner worlds, but your key planet Jupiter is so energized now that you won't even realize that something isn't right. Luckily, you have the power to redirect your thoughts away from unrealistic daydreams and toward profound creative visualizations that can change your life for the better."
capricorn,2010-11-15,"You would be wise to lean on your friends and associates today by discussing your hopes and dreams with them. But don't worry about reaching your goals now, for beneficial Jupiter's trine to the Sun in your 11th House of Future suggests that immediate success is not what's most important. Instead, this is a time to explore your heartfelt vision with supportive people without necessarily having to justify every thought you share."
aquarius,2010-11-15,"You can benefit today from the cooperative relationship between your 10th House of Profession and your 2nd House of Money. Your hard work is rewarded by an increased paycheck or, at least, the promise of a raise. However, it's not a good idea to push your luck too far; instead, just show up with your best possible attitude and see what happens. You might be pleasantly surprised."
pisces,2010-11-15,"You are able to balance optimism and realism today with the Sun's harmonious trine to auspicious Jupiter in your sign. This supportive aspect encourages you to choose what you want to do next. Don't be afraid to reach a little farther now because the planets are working in your favor. Although they portend a positive outcome, you still must be willing to push past whatever usually prevents you from achieving your goals."
aries,2010-11-16,"You have the ability to pull rabbits out of hats today, but your secret magical powers won't be able to get you out of a difficult situation unless you pay close attention to what's actually happening. Your imagination won't require a lot of facts in order to make up a believable story. And although you can make nearly anything seem real for a while, it's much wiser to base your perspective on the truth than on unfulfilled wishes."
taurus,2010-11-16,"It's easy for you to become attached to an unrealistic goal at work today. Although your hopes can motivate you to reach for the stars, discouragement could quickly overtake your optimism as you see the implausibility of your plan. But this isn't a sufficient reason to give up. Scale back your expectations a bit, give yourself more time and try again. Determination can be your secret weapon."
gemini,2010-11-16,"Politics on the job could get so weird today that you really don't know what to make of it all. You cannot tell if things are actually as strange as they seem or if your fantasies have leaked out of your dream world and into reality. Either way, it's difficult to take a position because of your uncertainty. Wait it out; the truth will be revealed sooner than you think."
cancer,2010-11-16,"You might feel as if things are beyond your control today. You haven't given up, but you may be worried that your strategy isn't working. Thankfully, the landscape is about to shift and you must to be ready for what's going to happen. Don't entertain self-doubt; it will only slow your progress when you need all your wits about you. Instead of fretting about what's gone wrong, concentrate on what you can do to improve your current situation."
leo,2010-11-16,"Your emotional stability can be an anchor in a storm today. Although others may not be able to see that your feet are actually on the ground, you continue to maintain a clear sense of reality while floating through the turbulence. Luckily, your work doesn't require a lot of rational analysis now, so trust your intuition and sort out everything tomorrow when it all makes more sense."
virgo,2010-11-16,"You could turn a trivial matter into a national crisis today because you know that there's more going on than meets the eye. Your suspicions might lead you to create elaborate conspiracy theories in order to fill in the missing information. But it may turn out that your beliefs are more important than what's actually happening. If you experience a simple twist of fate now, it probably originates within your imagination."
libra,2010-11-16,"Someone might be overly clever at work today and inadvertently upset the status quo for everyone else. Although you would prefer taking a conservative and reliable approach, you may be forced into more extreme measures as you attempt to regain control of a situation that's grown out of hand. Don't be too self-critical if your strategy doesn't work right away. It may take a few more days before you see any results for your efforts."
scorpio,2010-11-16,"Your ruling planet Mars is stirring up trouble today, making it difficult for you to withhold your anger if someone acts in a careless manner. You know that losing your temper isn't the smartest way to handle the situation, but you are quickly running out of patience. Nevertheless, the choice is yours. Fortunately, you can come up with an original last-minute solution that sidesteps open conflict if you are willing to take a calculated risk."
sagittarius,2010-11-16,"You may think that you're being very clever today as you share your radical strategy with your workmates. Unfortunately, it may not be so easy for them to follow your ideas now because you aren't thinking in a logical manner. Your conclusions could be correct, but it won't matter if you cannot muster the support you need to make your plan work. It's wiser to take a more centrist position that involves others than to set up a situation where you must proceed on your own."
capricorn,2010-11-16,"You know that your professional goals are very sensible now, but you may need to wait a few more days before you can put your plan into motion. It could look like you are desperate if you initiate action too soon, causing your strategy to backfire. Although you might feel a great sense of urgency today, you have time to feed your current creativity by letting your ideas continue to develop until they have matured."
aquarius,2010-11-16,"Although you may have recently experienced some financial relief, things could get weird today as unexpected events affect your net worth. But don't assume that the outcome will be negative, even if something goes awry. You might not have as much control as you want now, but your positive attitude will go a long way toward protecting you from incurring any losses, and could even lead to a windfall."
pisces,2010-11-16,"You might feel as if you are in a fog today and it's difficult to clear your head. Instead of adding to your stress by trying to force an elusive solution, give yourself permission to float in the magic of the mists until the clouds of illusion dissipate on their own. Exploring the wonders of your imagination will give you the inspiration you need now. Once the blue skies return you can quickly reestablish your trajectory."
aries,2010-11-17,"Your emotions are close to the surface now that the Moon is back in your sign, but it may not be wise to share what's on your mind. You might not mean to offend anyone, but your words can carry more negativity than you realize. Instead of releasing your stress verbally, find something constructive to do with all your excess energy."
taurus,2010-11-17,Don't bother trying to hide behind your carefully chosen words because your true intentions will probably be obvious anyhow. Futile attempts to be secretive today could have a detrimental impact on close relationships. Denying your feelings might also suppress the honest reactions of those close to you. It won't hurt to be truthful if you remember to be kind in the process.
gemini,2010-11-17,"Social activities can be quite demanding now because you may have to be around people for much of the day. Although you usually thrive on being busy, you might wish for some solitude today, but it's difficult to avoid interacting with others. You might not be able to escape the barrage of noise, but you can make things manageable by consciously saying less and actively listening more."
cancer,2010-11-17,"You are eager to get busy at work today, especially if you enjoy the company of your co-workers. Nevertheless, there is still a part of you that prefers to stick close to home; but balancing your family activities with your profession sounds simpler than it actually is. Fortunately, the level of difficulty isn't high enough to make you miserable. Just remember to stay engaged in all aspects of your life."
leo,2010-11-17,"You are quite upbeat today, even if you cannot completely rein in your own intensity. You can't just shut off the spigot to your feelings, so don't even try. Observing your reactions to the rapidly changing circumstances teaches you something about yourself that you didn't previously know. Investigating the whole spectrum of emotions could ultimately lead to positive results."
virgo,2010-11-17,"The alluring quality of your feelings can be quite intoxicating now, whether or not you are in a new relationship. You could even fall in love anew with someone familiar, or discover an exciting attraction to a total stranger. Either way, your enthusiasm is contagious as long as you don't allow fear to stand between you and love."
libra,2010-11-17,"You may seem more argumentative now than usual, yet it appears to you that someone else is stirring up the aggression. Your key planet Venus is crossing purposes with talkative Mercury today. Unfortunately, the love planet is at the end of her retrograde cycle, suggesting that your needs won't be satisfied just yet. Don't push for resolution now; it's best to just observe your feelings until after Venus turns direct tomorrow."
scorpio,2010-11-17,"A workmate may have it in for you today, yet you might not understand what you have done wrong. Actually, it's likely that your behavior is exemplary, while others may be resentful of your accomplishments. Although you are tempted to escalate the situation, it makes a lot more sense to smile, bite your tongue and just let the potential conflict pass for now. You can pick up your cause more successfully after the tension has passed."
sagittarius,2010-11-17,"Although you could easily put your foot in your mouth, your good intentions will cover for your social clumsiness today. Part of the problem is that your patience has grown so thin that it's nearly impossible to take the necessary time to listen to others. In fact, even if you are paying attention, you will probably be on your next thought so quickly that it doesn't really matter. You'll get more out of the day if you do yourself a favor and slow down."
capricorn,2010-11-17,"Personal drama takes center stage for a while today, yet it can make you rather unhappy if you allow it to now. Thankfully, your positive attitude can change the big picture right away. You will feel much better if you look at an emotional confrontation as an opportunity to get closer to someone special or to bring healing to a wound in a difficult relationship."
aquarius,2010-11-17,"This can be an enjoyable day where a bit of intellectual banter adds to the fun, even if there is a disagreement over the basic facts. Luckily, you are light enough on your feet today so you won't become too attached to the outcome of any discussion. Instead of just stirring up conflict because it's an interesting distraction from your regular routine, try to learn something new in the process."
pisces,2010-11-17,"A money problem might suddenly be revealed today, but it could be as simple as forgetting to get cash from the bank or leaving your wallet at home. But it also can be more complicated if you haven't been paying close enough attention to your finances. Avoid further difficulties by carefully thinking about your expenditures prior to making an impulsive purchase."
aries,2010-11-18,"You may be sure of what you want one moment, yet doubt yourself just a few minutes later. This pull between certainty and uncertainty can lead you in circles today, unless you are smart enough to disengage from the cycle. When you understand that you do not have to make any final choices now, you will be able to relax and wait until a better resolution is found."
taurus,2010-11-18,"Your inner world is a source of solace today, even if your outer world seems to be full of contradictions and chaos. You might be tempted to find a solution and then stubbornly fix on it so firmly that it's hard to react positively to the changing external events. Fortunately, you can consciously choose to practice being more flexible now that your key planet Venus is moving forward again."
gemini,2010-11-18,"Although anonymity isn't particularly appealing to you now, you might prefer being lost in a crowd than left to your own devices as the Moon visits your 11th House of Groups. Nevertheless, you can accomplish more if you retreat from the social noise and go about your business by yourself. It may take a few days for you to see any real progress, but keeping focused on your goals will bring rewards if you are patient."
cancer,2010-11-18,"Your imagination can lure you into strange waters today, but the Moon in your 10th House of Career will keep pulling you back into what's happening at work. Involving your feelings on the job can complicate your professional life because it's harder to deal with your uncertainty when you're in the public eye. However, suppressing your emotions will only make you angry. Seek healthy ways to let off steam without alienating your workmates."
leo,2010-11-18,"You are often the one with the game plan, but your ideas may fall flat today. The problem is that you might sound so brilliant that others endorse your solution, even if it isn't the most practical one. Instead of declaring your strategy the winner, show your vulnerability and admit that you really don't know what will work best. If everyone realizes that you don't have all the answers, it will give the group the chance to develop a really good idea together."
virgo,2010-11-18,"You may be your own worst enemy today, especially if you believe that you are channeling the ultimate truth. Normally, you can be quite logical, but now your fantasies are mixed up with your thoughts, tempting you to leave your common sense behind. Don't assume that your perspective is better than everyone else's; there may be other options that you haven't yet considered."
libra,2010-11-18,You aren't willing to accept the advice of someone else today just because he or she claims to know the answer. Trust your instincts if you think that your associates don't have enough information to form a clear opinion. Others seem to be willing to oversimplify the situation for the sake of expediency while you can't decide what to do. Be patient; a viable solution will surface over the days ahead.
scorpio,2010-11-18,"You want to believe that there is one single path amongst the many, but as the day progresses, it appears that there are even more possibilities than you realized. You are intrigued with all the different scenarios, yet picking one over the others becomes a daunting task. Don't get tricked into thinking that you must do something definitive today. It's better now to wait for the most sensible course of action to be revealed."
sagittarius,2010-11-18,"You are feeling very creative with the impulsive Aries Moon lighting up your 5th House of Self-Expression. However, this is not a cosmic license to do whatever you want, for you are being driven by desires that aren't necessarily conscious now. A sensible, down-to-earth approach seems difficult to manage, yet it's your smartest move. Don't talk yourself into believing fairy tales about treasures at the rainbow's end. Aim at a realistic target and try not to lose focus as you continue on your course."
capricorn,2010-11-18,"You are in a unique position to share your vision of the future and there's little reason to hold back. Don't worry about being practical today; this can be your chance to dream aloud. Keep in mind that you aren't proposing an action plan, so your thoughts need not be strictly grounded in reality. Making up a fantastic story can be more inspiring now than sticking to a step-by-step strategy for success."
aquarius,2010-11-18,"Your head is filled with many contradictory thoughts today, making it difficult for you to share them with others. Your friends and co-workers may grow increasingly resistant to your ideas because you appear to know everything, even if you are obviously confused with your facts. Keep in mind that the two-way street of communication begins with listening."
pisces,2010-11-18,"The Moon's visit to your 2nd House of Income can trick you into believing that your finances are in better shape than they actually are. Thankfully, you could be riding a productive wave at work, which increases your chances of receiving an unexpected raise. Nevertheless, things are not as they seem today; don't make any commitments to spend money until you can clearly see which way the fiscal winds are blowing."
aries,2010-11-19,"Now that Venus is moving forward in your 7th House of Partners, lingering misunderstandings should begin to clear up, even if it doesn't happen overnight. It's up to you to make the commitment to turn your relationships around by clearly communicating what you want. However, sharing your desires isn't enough; you also must be willing to hear what the other person wants and then negotiate until you create common ground."
taurus,2010-11-19,"If you have been dealing with physical symptoms over the past weeks, you might finally begin to make progress toward feeling better as your key planet Venus moves forward in your 6th House of Health. You might have tried to fix things by gathering information, but now you need to put what you've learned to work. Remember, today's healthy routine will create tomorrow's well-being."
gemini,2010-11-19,"Your world is spinning rapidly today, even if it seems that you're getting nowhere fast. Although your position in an ongoing negotiation could change suddenly, you cannot tell if you are any closer to your goals. Don't push for resolution now or you'll only increase your frustration. What works best at this time is to try to understand both sides of the issue and avoid getting hung up on your desired outcome."
cancer,2010-11-19,"You could appear to be very easygoing today, but you may be cleverly withholding strong feelings that you don't yet want out into the open. You think that you can manage the current situation if you suppress your emotions, but your closest friends will still be able to see right through your smokescreen. Don't waste your energy attempting to protect others from the truth. A kind delivery will enable you to be honest without causing unnecessary hurt."
leo,2010-11-19,"You may want everyone to think that you know what is best today. Fortunately, you can be a rock as you steady someone who is going through a difficult time. However, your determination to be strong is a mixed blessing, for it also offers others an easy way out of their problems as they lean on you for support. You can be of highest service if you don't try to fix what's wrong with your idea of what's right."
virgo,2010-11-19,"Your schedule could get a bit crazy today as the Sun in your 3rd House of Immediate Environment harmonizes with erratic Uranus. You don't have the authority that you thought you did, yet you're unwilling to relinquish control. It might appear that drastic measures are needed to put your life back in order, but an even-keeled approach will bring better results. Reconsider your goals and put a plan into action over the next few days."
libra,2010-11-19,"You don't want to precipitate any sort of emotional drama, but your key planet Venus has just turned direct in your 8th House of Deep Sharing. Your feelings may have grown unexpectedly strong and there isn't anything you can do to change them. Instead of resisting, honor your internal process by engaging it. If your sharing provokes someone to react aggressively, the choice of whether or not to take it to the next level is entirely yours."
scorpio,2010-11-19,"You may be unwilling to seek common ground with a friend or partner today, even if it has the potential to make your life simpler. However, you aren't interested in compromising away your integrity. And although it appears that the other person is being difficult, it may be you who is being more stubborn at this time. Keep in mind that the outcome of a disagreement now is not as important as it seems. The health of a relationship is what ultimately matters most."
sagittarius,2010-11-19,"The Moon's visit to your 6th House of Health and Habits increases your desire to have more stability in your daily routines, including diet, exercise and sleep. Unfortunately, there can be so many distractions today that self-discipline is even more difficult than usual. Don't be hard on yourself if you cannot tighten your grip on reality now. It may be healthier to avoid frustration by letting go of control. Remember, tomorrow is another day."
capricorn,2010-11-19,"You may be revisiting an idea at work that you previously set aside. Now, however, you might change your mind about what the most sensible strategy may be as you discover new information. But don't jump to the conclusion that you have arrived at a final answer. Venus turning direct in your 10th House of Career could be a catalyst for one more round of flip-flopping. Rather than assuming that you know what is best, tell everyone that your plans are still developing."
aquarius,2010-11-19,"Enrolling in a new course of study or making the final arrangements for a major trip should soon get easier as Venus turns direct in your 9th House of Big Ideas. However, you might realize that your previous plans won't work now. Maybe you have family obligations to fulfill before you can go off on an adventure. There's no need to rush your decision because you will continue to gain clarity over the next several days."
pisces,2010-11-19,"If you began to trust someone too quickly, you may need to temporarily retreat so you can establish healthier boundaries now. Your current emotional uncertainty could be prompted by new information about a close relationship coming to light. Your wisest course of action is to talk about your feelings. Take additional time to determine what you really want prior to making your next move."
aries,2010-11-20,"You've had enough fun for a while; you have important issues to handle now and time is running out. Thankfully, you are able to do whatever is required, even if you've been procrastinating up to this point. Don't worry if you must miss an exciting social gathering today because you'll still have plenty of time to get together with your friends in the weeks ahead."
taurus,2010-11-20,"If you've been keeping busy by doing favors for everyone else, now it's your turn to take care of yourself.

Don't waste your energy today pursuing grandiose ideas; instead, concentrate on practical business."

Don't worry if people tease you about missing out on the fun. There is no reason to waste your energy defending your behavior. Even with your explanation, they won't likely understand why you must recharge your emotional batteries before heading out and engaging in another round of activity. You have to do what's best for you."
cancer,2010-11-20,"The nurturing Moon's visit to sensual Taurus probably feels like an improvement to you emotional Crabs, but you don't want others to think that your caring is a sign of weakness. You want to experience pleasure and are now willing to face any fears that get in your way of finding it. Although you might prefer to stay at home, don't hesitate to engage socially if it appears that the goodies will follow."
leo,2010-11-20,You are busier than normal with the Moon traveling through your 10th House of Social Responsibility. You know what you must do and you can be quite determined in the execution of your duties. But caution is advised because you could become so stubborn that your rigid agenda gets in the way of your own progress. Modify your strategy as circumstances change; being more flexible enables you to keep moving in the direction of success.
virgo,2010-11-20,"The Moon's passage through earthy Taurus is a pleasant reminder of your own attachments to the practical side of life. Your head may be filled with fantastic ideas, but some are not relevant. At least you can filter out the superfluous thoughts and concentrate on those that can have real impact. But don't get lazy today or you could miss a significant opportunity."
libra,2010-11-20,You want to make deep and lasting personal connections now that the Moon is back in Taurus and your 8th House of Intimacy. But magic like this doesn't happen overnight; you must aim high and do the psychological and spiritual work that is required first. Avoid being distracted by superficial interactions. You'll benefit the most by holding out for real love.
scorpio,2010-11-20,"Others are likely to make you feel a bit crazy now, especially if they aren't moving as fast as you want. Unfortunately, nothing you try seems to speed them along. Meanwhile, you aren't interested in wasting time and dislike the idea of having to wait for anyone else. Take a deep breath and practice being patient. What seems like a good idea today should be easier to manifest tomorrow."
sagittarius,2010-11-20,"Your strategy of temporarily avoiding a deep discussion about your feelings might actually help you make it through the day. You realize that if you say what's on your mind today, your disclosures could stir up powerful emotions that only lead to an unsolvable disagreement. For now, it's wiser to steer clear of abstract philosophical debates. Keep conversations focused on the most practical subjects possible."
capricorn,2010-11-20,"The Moon is in sensible Taurus, a fellow Earth sign, and her visit to your 5th House of Creativity can bring you just the energetic boost that you need. Getting back to basics is a sound strategy because you are building a foundation for the next several weeks. The more you are able to simplify your life, the easier it will be when the pressure for change returns over the days ahead."
aquarius,2010-11-20,"The Moon moves through your soulful 4th House today, strengthening your inner resolve. However, this transit can also provoke anxiety, since you aren't necessarily comfortable with intense emotional encounters. Remember that you don't need to initiate any particular action yet. The key is to courageously dig into your past to recover memories that can teach you something useful about the present."
pisces,2010-11-20,"Today's steadfast Taurus Moon in your 3rd House of Immediate Environment is good news because it slows the pace of your life. Unfortunately, a complicated situation may have intensified over the past week and maybe even grew out of control. Fortunately, everything appears more manageable now and if you find yourself engaged in a petty conflict, remember that this, too, will soon pass."
aries,2010-11-21,"Your desire to travel is so strong now that you might avoid thinking about the financial aspects of your dreams, as today's Full Moon activates your 2nd House of Money. But even if you stop to consider the costs, you may decide to move ahead with your plans anyway, whether you can afford them or not. Remember, there are other ways to satisfy your current wanderlust; you could use this energy to learn about the history and people of places that you want to see."
taurus,2010-11-21,"The Full Moon in your sign challenges you to stay connected to your feelings, even if they complicate your life. However, your intensity today can overpower others, but luckily you have the sense to realize that your unrestrained communication could be intimidating. Even if your emotions are uncharacteristically strong, don't try to suppress them just because it might be more comfortable. Still, it's wise to soften your approach when you ask for what you want."
gemini,2010-11-21,"Your discomfort might be running high today because the Full Moon is highlighting your 12th House of Secrets, making it difficult for you to understand your feelings. However, you may not be able to escape the non-rational dimensions of your emotions. Even if you are more secure in the logical realm of words, you should still try to overcome your uneasiness. Sharing your emotions with a good friend won't be as difficult as you think, and could quickly help transform your resistance into acceptance."

Staying flexible increases your chances of success."
leo,2010-11-21,"You might think you'll be able to reach your goal if you are persistent, because the determined Taurus Full Moon brightens your 10th House of Status.

Even if you feel awkward, just be yourself and don't make such a big deal about getting your way."
virgo,2010-11-21,"Your confidence is increased today with the earthy Taurus Full Moon in your 9th House of Big Ideas. You are very certain that your solution is a good one, yet your feelings can still distract you from what you need to do. Allowing your mind to wander could turn your accurate observations and increased stamina into irrationality and laziness. It's not wise to take on too much; instead, be smart and work small changes into your daily routine."
libra,2010-11-21,"The Taurus Full Moon activates powerful emotions because it falls in your 8th House of Intimacy, but you may not be able to easily express what you're feeling. Your fear of not being able to control the direction of a conversation could stop you from saying anything at all. Nevertheless, it still may be more sensible to take a risk and open your heart. Even if you don't get everything you want, you'll be able to rest assured that others know exactly where you stand."
scorpio,2010-11-21,"Today's Full Moon in dependable Taurus lights up your 7th House of Partners, tempting you to rely on someone else's support more than you should.

Even if the situation changes quickly, what you do now sets the tone for what follows in the days to come."
aquarius,2010-11-21,"Emotional satisfaction can be yours now if you don't get too distracted by your long-term goals. Having ambitions is admirable, but not if they stand in the way of your home and family life. Today's Taurus Full Moon emphasizes your 4th House of Roots; instead of worrying about what's coming up at work, focus your energy on your personal life. There will be plenty of time later on to set new goals and work toward achieving them."
pisces,2010-11-21,"Your attention is turning from being concerned with the present to thinking more about your future. Nevertheless, you cannot shift gears until you've met your current responsibilities. The down-to-earth Taurus Full Moon still requires you to be practical, even if you want to fantasize about what's next. Don't try to avoid your obligations. Demonstrating your dependability should give you a strong sense of satisfaction before you focus on nurturing your dreams."

taurus,2010-11-22,"Partnerships become more complicated as the Sun begins to move through your 8th House of Deep Sharing. You may not be as willing to remain with someone just because it's safe.

It's certainly more pleasurable to be with someone you like than spending your time alone wishing for company."
virgo,2010-11-22,"You are not interested in overdoing anything, for self-restraint usually comes easily to you. Today, however, you may need to manage a new set of issues around your current responsibilities and your desire to spend time with your family. Even if you want to let your work slide, you still must follow through on what you started prior to any relaxation or recreation."
libra,2010-11-22,"You don't mind being so busy now, but it isn't a smart idea to equate activity with happiness. It's challenging to know what is enough or what's too much, and you could exhaust yourself before realizing that you can't keep up with all that you started. Even if your week ahead seems to be in order, don't be afraid to cut back on your schedule. It's better to have free time than not have enough time to do what you planned."
scorpio,2010-11-22,"You have had some intense experiences recently and, thankfully, are at the threshold of a more relaxing phase now. Instead of digging deeper into your feelings, today is a good day to stabilize a current situation. Fortunately, this can also be a relief to people close to you.

It's a smart idea to consciously make use of your birthday month by increasing your involvement in social activities and giving yourself permission to do those things you have set aside because responsibilities called you elsewhere. But even if you are distracted from your regular routine now, don't be hard on yourself if you escape work to have a little fun."
capricorn,2010-11-22,"It's difficult to concentrate on your job today because the scattered Gemini Moon is visiting your 6th House of Routine. Your mind is bouncing around all over the place and there doesn't seem to be much you can do to stop it. Additionally, the Sun's entry into your 12th House of Imagination encourages your fantasies and daydreams. Remember that making a wish is not a passive activity, so focus on your long-term ambitions and then work hard to make them come true."
aquarius,2010-11-22,"You may receive much-needed support now that the Sun is in outgoing Sagittarius and your 11th House of Friends. Nevertheless, the whimsical Gemini Moon reminds you of just how bored you become if you cannot break out of your everyday routine. You are more interested in pursuing creative activities now than showing up for your regular tasks. Be thankful that others are supporting you, but don't expect them to help you escape from whatever responsibilities may be holding you back."
pisces,2010-11-22,"You could get yourself into all kinds of trouble today, especially if you start more projects than you can possibly finish. Your smartest approach is to avoid overload and pare back your commitments as much as possible.

However, don't eliminate all of the pleasurable activities or you will likely have regrets later on."

Fortunately, paying extra attention to the potential impact of your words before you open your mouth could prevent an unnecessary headache later on. Stopping to consider other people's feelings should be enough to save the day."
taurus,2010-11-23,"You don't have to be in a hurry today to resolve the tension between you and a loved one, even if it feels as if you do. Stressful emotions will settle down on their own, enabling you to integrate the previously frazzled energy. Don't bother seeking quick solutions from anyone else. Your inner guide will show you the best path, but only if you have the wisdom now to slow down and wait for the inspiration."
gemini,2010-11-23,"Accomplish as much as possible today, for you could become less ambitious over the days ahead. By working harder you can burn off some excess energy and increase your ability to concentrate. But don't think that your mind will become inactive just because you choose to be less analytical now. Instead of competing with others for a more dominant role, find a place where you can lay back and chill out."
cancer,2010-11-23,"You may be worried about the final outcome of a situation or that you can't possibly finish the work that was assigned to you. But something unusual could happen today that snaps you out of your anxiety, even if no one wants to acknowledge how much has changed in just a few short hours. You should explain your perspective, even if others are working hard to hide the truth. Just reserve any blame for another day."
leo,2010-11-23,"You might wish that you could be reclusive this week, rather than thinking about how much work there is for you to do. Luckily, you can get out of a few unpleasant chores by just going into hiding. However, escape isn't a viable option because it doesn't offer a lasting solution. It's okay to withdraw a bit, but stay grounded and ready to interact if needed."
virgo,2010-11-23,You are able to maintain a cool demeanor in most social situations as the Moon enters your egalitarian 11th House of Friends this evening. It isn't usually easy to let go of your focus on work and you may feel lost if you do. Being able to broaden your horizons and expand your network gives you and others much needed hope. But don't allow the present situation to dictate what's real. Open your eyes to all of the possibilities.
libra,2010-11-23,"You may be very stressed by your current need to feel your own power today, especially if someone important seems to be blocking your personal expression. Fortunately, time is on your side now, so don't make up reasons to speed up the pace or you'll have to work harder than necessary. And don't be afraid to add your two cents while you still have something to say."
scorpio,2010-11-23,"A current wave of uncertainty could prevent you from attempting to manifest your dreams. However, this is not a great day to sit back and talk about unrealized potential. Get up and get going as early as possible, because you have a lot of work to do and the sooner you get started, the sooner you'll finish. You can make more progress now if you put away your doubts and believe in yourself."
sagittarius,2010-11-23,"You probably aren't in the mood to do a whole lot of relationship processing today, but complex circumstances appear to push you in the direction of self-analysis anyhow. Thankfully, you stand to gain an extraordinary amount of insight now, even if you were already sure that you knew what was happening. Remember, you can't just walk away from the hard work before you even try."
capricorn,2010-11-23,"Your tender spot is in the courting game, as revealed by the Moon's evening entry into your 7th House of Partners. Your natural reaction may be to prevent others from seeing your vulnerability by hiding the true you from sight. Nevertheless, you have a deep reservoir of courage; it's time now to dig it up and use it accordingly so you can stand up to your ghosts of relationships past."
aquarius,2010-11-23,"You might know exactly how to improve your diet now, yet you aren't telling anyone about your current realizations. Worse yet, you are tempted to do nothing, no matter how desperately the changes are needed. Fortunately, you are smart enough to remember the importance of taking care of yourself. Resist the waves of laziness and enlist the support of someone you trust."
pisces,2010-11-23,"You may attempt to protect your vulnerability and go to great lengths in order to hide your feelings from others. However, there's no need to be very dramatic today as you demonstrate your fondness of someone special. Nevertheless, expressing your desires isn't simply a way to clear the air; it's also helpful to better your shot at getting what you want."
aries,2010-11-24,"Even if your concentration is required at work today, you may still be distracted by a personal issue that continues to remain a problem. Thankfully, you can be so skilled at hiding what's really happening that your associates believe that you're doing an amazing job. Accept whatever praise you receive; you don't have to blow your cover, and you probably deserve the accolades anyway."
taurus,2010-11-24,"You don't mind working behind the scenes today as long as you can fine-tune your plan of attack a few times during the day. Usually, you're not a fan of change, but shifting gears is easy now as you respond to what's happening. This is not a smart time to act in a stubborn manner. Practicing flexibility will give you the best possible chance for success."
gemini,2010-11-24,"Bringing your accounts up to date may demand more time than you wish now as the Moon visits your 2nd House of Money. Fiscal change appears to be in the air, but the results of your current actions may not come quickly enough for you. However, impatience won't lead to success today. Do what's right and wait for the impact of your extra efforts to come back around."
cancer,2010-11-24,"You can be so intuitive that you often know what's happening even if no one tells you. Today's Moon in your sign extends your emotional antennae even farther. You may have to be extra careful or your feelings could muck up a lovely encounter with someone you like. Watch your moods as they swing back and forth throughout the day, and try not to make any significant decisions that could alter the course of your life."
leo,2010-11-24,"Your day can be mixed with contradictions because you may intuitively sense that you're on the edge of something big ... and although it's exciting to think that there are no limits to your far-reaching ideas now, you might have to face an unexpected obstacle. A seemingly insignificant social event can set you in a direction that is very advantageous to your career. Combining business with pleasure isn't always a wise idea, but today it may be just what the doctor ordered for your success."
virgo,2010-11-24,"You might choose to lose yourself at a social gathering today or become more involved in a team project. Either way, the Moon's current visit to your 11th House of Community allows you to move beyond individual needs and to share your expertise with others. Don't miss this opportunity to give something back to your peers."
libra,2010-11-24,"Although your friends might accuse you of playing the role of a mother hen at work today, your motives are probably pure. You want to share your love by taking care of others, and the current Cancer Moon encourages you to express your emotions and nurture those around you. Pay attention so you know when to back off or someone may get the idea that you're just trying to control things, when you're only trying to help."
scorpio,2010-11-24,"Instead of letting a personal issue overwhelm you now, you are able to blow off some excess energy by getting involved in a social cause. You can easily understand complex interpersonal dynamics so don't be afraid to tell others exactly how you feel. Your perceptions are clear and your perspective is balanced while the Moon is moving through fellow Water sign Cancer. There's no need to back down, even if you make someone uncomfortable. Honesty is the best policy today."
sagittarius,2010-11-24,"You are often drawn to philosophical ideas and can usually talk about them with a deep passion. Today, however, you are likely to be more interested in personal issues as the Moon moves through your 8th House Intimacy. There's no need to shy away from your emotions, even if they make you uncomfortable. Go right to the very edge because your feelings can teach you much about life now."
capricorn,2010-11-24,"If someone tells you his or her sad story today, don't try to take action and fix what's wrong. Just be receptive and listen with a sympathetic ear. Your mistaken belief that you have to take charge and demonstrate your competence will only bring dissatisfaction and frustration. It's not easy for you to just sit with other peoples' issues, but it's a good idea now to make it your practice."
aquarius,2010-11-24,"Instead of letting everyone know about your brilliant ideas today, it's smarter to work behind the scenes. You can emerge the hero if you are secure enough to allow others to take center stage so they can receive recognition for their accomplishments. Even if you played an important role in someone else's success, your quiet support will also likely bring you an opportunity from somewhere you did not expect."
pisces,2010-11-24,"You might not be very concerned about what others think today because you are acutely aware of what makes you happy. Your clear perspective gives you a new sense of emotional power. Nevertheless, you still might not be eager to put your feelings out into the open. Go ahead and trust in the process; there is a direct correlation between the risky behavior of showing your vulnerability and the amount of pleasure you later experience."
aries,2010-11-25,"You could feel very protective of a loved one today, but this still doesn't make it okay for you to make decisions that are not your business. Rather than trying to fix everyone else's problems, concentrate on your own. You may think that you know what's best for others, but it is healthier for them to learn for themselves instead of expecting you to always come to the rescue."
taurus,2010-11-25,"The easiest way for you to regain control of your schedule is to work with your friends and co-workers to positively influence their day. Once you make yourself indispensable to others, they will listen more closely to your advice. However, you can still get carried away with your own ideas if you aren't careful. Remember that even the tiniest adjustment can create the effect you desire."
gemini,2010-11-25,"You could discover that a strong ally has been quietly working on your behalf, even if you didn't realize it before today. Others can be very helpful by supporting you from behind the scenes. Don't waste time playing games or trying to figure out what to say to your earthly angel; just come right out and thank him or her for what they've done. Your openness could be a catalyst that reveals an opportunity. Be ready to make your move when good news arrives."
cancer,2010-11-25,"You might find it challenging now to let others know what you want because you're fearful that they won't understand you. It is natural to assume that someone should anticipate your needs if he or she truly loves you, but this is not the case today. Muster up your courage and express your feelings; you need to do your part if you expect others to do theirs."
leo,2010-11-25,"You are capable of being selfless in love but you might promise more now than you can deliver. Your intentions are good, but follow-through is difficult if you set your goals too high. Unfortunately, going overboard can lead you to feeling victimized, but ultimately you're the one who is in control. Talking about ideal love can raise the bar, but don't forget to pay attention to your basic needs, too."
virgo,2010-11-25,"Letting go of control doesn't come easily to you, unless it's on your list of things to do today. However, you may already think your plans are too loose and want to take responsibility to rein them in. Having some unstructured leisure time might be desirable, but you realize that it's not as simple as it sounds. Thankfully, anticipating an enjoyable activity later in the day is its own reward."
libra,2010-11-25,"You have a special role to play around the home today or at a family gathering. Although you might want to sidestep your obligations, you are the one that others look to now. Taking care of everyone's well-being might just as well be at the top of your list, since it's likely to be your job, whether you want it or not. Managing complex domestic logistics gives you something positive to do, and, thankfully, you do it well."
scorpio,2010-11-25,"Your uncharacteristic optimism turns more cautious throughout the day as the reality of your goals begins to sink in. You may start to stress about finishing a project on a deadline, which, in turn could cause more of a delay. Scaling back on your plans is one way of relieving the tension. Let everyone know how you're feeling so you can relax and enjoy yourself for a while. Afterward, you should be able to return to your regularly scheduled chores refreshed and raring to go."
sagittarius,2010-11-25,"Your feelings are intense and complicated today as a new distraction or attraction enters your life. Be careful, for you are able to transform anything into something better as mental Mercury aspects your key planet jovial Jupiter. Keep in mind that you are being driven by unconscious needs now, so progress slowly and don't overcommit. Being conservative in your approach will help you avoid landing in a heap of trouble."
capricorn,2010-11-25,"Although your focus may still be upon your family members and loved ones, don't forget to also put your own needs into the mix. The Moon in your 7th House of Relationships can lure you into a familiar codependent pattern with those closest to you. But philosophical Jupiter is aligned with logical Mercury, helping you to see what's best for you. Remember, loving yourself is crucial to loving others."
aquarius,2010-11-25,"Although pouring over the details of the day could bring impressive results as the Moons saunters through your 6th House of Self Improvement, the real rewards now come from your relationships with others. Visionary Jupiter pulls you beyond the minutiae as it's squared by rational Mercury in your 11th House of Friends. Don't fall victim to believing that you're in this world alone. The real juice comes from being part of a community."
pisces,2010-11-25,"You can't wait any longer to have some fun, but even if you know what you want to do, it still might be difficult to get other people to join you. You may be tempted to slip into an invisible mode and keep your desires to yourself because you are afraid of feeling rejected. Luckily, happy-go-lucky Jupiter in your sign is activated today, bringing opportunities for laughter and other pleasantries. Big steps aren't necessary now because baby steps will take you in the right direction."
aries,2010-11-26,"Excitement can come from the Moon's visit to your 5th House of Fun and Games, yet lingering uncertainty may have you wondering how you can best manage your fears. Unfortunately, your willpower won't help you overcome your anxiety today. Instead, acknowledge your limitations and try to learn how to work with them so you don't needlessly overextend yourself. Remember, good things can come in small packages."
taurus,2010-11-26,"You may feel as if you are waking up from a deep sleep today. It's easier to open your eyes and see the possibilities in front of you, even though you might not be doing anything differently from yesterday. However, it's not a good idea to expect too much change overnight; give yourself a few more days as the mists continue to lift and your clarity of vision improves."
gemini,2010-11-26,Your environment might seem a bit chaotic today and a variety of interruptions can easily distract you from your original plans. Everyone may seem busier than usual and you can get caught up in the excitement. Be careful or you will quickly have more on your plate than you can possibly handle. Avoid being overwhelmed by prioritizing your commitments early in the day.
cancer,2010-11-26,"You may have financial issues to deal with today as the Moon enters your 2nd House of Money. Unfortunately, it's challenging to cut back on a shopping spree when close friends are encouraging you to buy more. Keep in mind that others may not know about all your obligations, so they could advise you to spend more than you need. Even if you have expensive tastes these days, it's still important for you to have a fiscally conservative attitude."
leo,2010-11-26,"The Moon's return to your outgoing sign prompts you to wear your emotional story on your sleeve. But this can be exhausting because people want to know all the details. Usually you would be self-protective with the Moon in your 1st House of Personality, but today you are tempted toward being more forthright. Go ahead and ask for what you need, but remember that adding unnecessary drama isn't helpful to your cause."
virgo,2010-11-26,"You cannot easily explain yourself today because you aren't likely finished handling the challenges presented by close friends and family. You could be very hopeful about the future, even if the facts don't necessarily support such a positive picture. However, the good news is that your desire for change might be enough to get the ball rolling in the right direction."
libra,2010-11-26,"Paradoxically, taking the course of least resistance today can bring you out into the spotlight. It might happen so fast that you don't expect the attention that you receive. The Moon is now traveling through your 11th House of Future Goals, preparing you for what's around the next corner, even if you consciously don't know what's coming. Don't over-analyze everything; just keep your dreams alive so you have the potential of making them come true."
scorpio,2010-11-26,"The unflappable Leo Moon is activating your 10th House of Status, but you might not be ready for your new responsibilities. Still, you have the right stuff for shining like a bright star today. You may be optimistic about your future, but it still could take time before you are able to realize your dreams. Your smartest strategy now is to talk less and do more."
sagittarius,2010-11-26,"You may feel as if you can do anything now thanks to the Moon's visit to your 9th House of Grandiose Plans, but circumstances are more complicated than they seem. Several planets are currently in your sign, motivating you to reach for your goals, however unrealistic they appear to others. Nevertheless, if you pace yourself for the long haul, you could eventually reach your destination."
capricorn,2010-11-26,"You could be tempted to try a power play today in order to gain recognition for your work, especially if you believe that someone is receiving the acknowledgment that you deserve. Be very careful, for this kind of tactic can be a dangerous political move. Take a moment to reconsider your motives before doing anything you might later regret. Once you swing into action, you will need to follow through to the end, so think twice before taking a chance."
aquarius,2010-11-26,"Relationships are complex now with the Moon in your 7th House of Partners. It's particularly challenging if others seem overly intense about their feelings. You prefer to avoid melodramatic meltdowns, but your attempts to sidestep a conflict today could make matters worse. Overcome your resistance and willingly engage in an emotional discussion because this leads to a better outcome than hiding from the truth."
pisces,2010-11-26,"If you have been considering making changes to your daily regimen, the Moon's visit to your 6th House of Habits is a favorable time for self-improvement. Just make sure you are doing it for the right reasons. For example, if you go on a diet to impress someone with your weight loss, your plan won't likely succeed. Keep in mind that the best reason for starting something new is to do it for your own well-being."
aries,2010-11-27,"You are excited about all the possibilities today and are eager to get started, but you might not know how to prioritize all your ideas. You could be so quick-witted now that you inadvertently overwhelm someone while you're sharing your plans. Pay attention to what you're saying because you probably sound more outrageous than you realize. Instead of trying to impress anyone, relax and enjoy yourself while you can."
taurus,2010-11-27,"Stop spinning your wheels and channel your energy into creating a pleasant environment, instead. The showy Leo Moon visits your 4th House of Home and Family, motivating you to redecorate around the house to take your mind off more complicated issues. You won't be able to stop the flow of thoughts today, but you can shift your focus to more enjoyable pursuits."
gemini,2010-11-27,"It's nearly impossible to tell where the edge is between a brilliant thought and a crazy one today as your key planet Mercury squares wild Uranus. However, there's no need to waste time worrying about going too far, because clever Mercury's intelligent quintile with stable Saturn will keep you on solid ground. Remember that it's not necessary to share every amazing idea that you have now. Keeping some secrets could be your key to gaining more credibility and power."
cancer,2010-11-27,"Hiding your unrealistic thoughts won't make you happy today, but neither will indiscriminately sharing them with everyone. However, your crazy schemes could get the best of you for a while if you cannot figure out how to harness the power of your imagination instead of letting your dreams pass you by. Try discussing one good idea with someone you trust; letting a friend in on your process can help you integrate your vision into your life."
leo,2010-11-27,"Bold action may be necessary today with the Moon traveling through dramatic Leo, and fortunately, you are up for a great performance. Even if you believe that you can get away with keeping your feelings quiet, it's smarter to just relax and tell your story. Don't wait for a better moment, for your current optimism may wane over the next few days."
virgo,2010-11-27,"There may be many disparate pieces of your life coming together now, and you would be wise to carefully observe everything that's happening. If you don't remain focused, you could miss an important chance to do something special. Your key planet Mercury is quite active today, filling your head with one idea after another. Instead of trying to express every thought, just seek ways to weave the strands into a single tapestry."
libra,2010-11-27,"Your closest friends show up to cheer you on as you express yourself creatively today, for they truly support your work. They seem to appreciate and admire you even more when you are doing what you love. Thankfully, you enjoy shining for others, so this can be a fantastic win-win situation. Take a risk and use your colorful imagination to create a special memory for everyone."
scorpio,2010-11-27,"Circumstances could necessitate that you publicly show your emotions in ways that normally make you feel uncomfortable. Fortunately, today you are willing to stand up for your beliefs, and being vulnerable is just part of the package. Remember, it's healthier if you can connect your passion with a social cause beyond your individual needs. Nevertheless, wait until you are ready before making a serious commitment."
sagittarius,2010-11-27,"You may wish you could kick back and take it easy today, but you might need to catch up on previous obligations you've been avoiding, instead. However, it isn't as bad as it sounds, for handling unfinished business doesn't need to prevent you from also exploring your dreams. Even if you're not ready to embark on your next great adventure, tying up loose ends now allows you to fly sooner than you expect."
capricorn,2010-11-27,"You may be struggling with your current inability to balance your responsibilities with your desire for fun. Even if you're facing a difficult decision now, you don't have to play by the existing rules. Changing your attitude can change the game, enabling you to maintain your integrity while also enjoying yourself. Take a walk on the wild side today and let yourself go."
aquarius,2010-11-27,"It might seem as if others are having more fun than you are today, but this could be an illusion. Your current social situation is very different if you can look at it from another point of view. Instead of comparing yourself to anyone else, decide exactly what you want to do now based on what would make you happy. Then, take a few small yet determined steps to set you off in the right direction."
pisces,2010-11-27,"You might come across as more rebellious than you actually are today, for you don't realize how radical your words sound to others. You feel free to say whatever enters your mind without censoring your casual remarks. Unfortunately, someone may not take your message as lightly as you mean it. You can prevent discord by going out of your way to allow for differences of opinion."
aries,2010-11-28,"You may be aware of a gulf between your feelings and your thoughts today. You prefer to rely on the relevant information and your clear thinking, rather than letting your desires dictate a more subjective agenda. Although sticking to the facts sounds good on paper, the truth is that you're better off if you also listen to your intuition."
taurus,2010-11-28,"It's wise to think first and then speak after you know where your thoughts are taking you. Blurting out an impulsive idea will only complicate your life today. Usually you are able to slow down, but your impatience can get the best of you now. Your attempts to sidestep authority or bend the rules won't work. You might be pleasantly surprised if you simply acknowledge the limitations imposed on you by others."
gemini,2010-11-28,"You may not be clear about what's happening now, yet you can get to the bottom of it if you remain focused. Although others might think that you're just putting on a show, you don't need to let their assumptions distract you from your real goals. Remember, it's irrational to set aside your strategy if you believe that your plan will work. Just don't push too hard; taking small steps is wiser than overreaching and then having to retreat."
cancer,2010-11-28,"You wish that everything could happen on time today, but you could become so obsessed with your schedule that you miss a potentially memorable experience. Letting go of your control can be a very powerful antidote to inflexibility. When you flow with the currents now, magic follows you everywhere you go."
leo,2010-11-28,"You might want more recovery time from everything you've been doing, but you may not be able to find it today. You are being pulled in multiple directions now, yet the real message is to reconnect with the most practical routines. Even if you feel slightly out of step with what's happening, this is not a smart time to shift your course. Concentrate on your immediate needs while preparing to flow with the waves of change."
virgo,2010-11-28,"The Moon's return to your straightforward Earth sign is a reminder to be as simplistic as possible in your approach to life today. Making some changes on the home front may be helpful, but your time is at a premium now. Divide your day so you can take care of your chores first and then move on to more enjoyable activities later. Remember, frustration arises when you don't make time to take care of your own needs."
libra,2010-11-28,"You can feel the weight of your responsibilities growing heavier today, tempting you to withdraw from unnecessary social activities. Still, you are likely to partake in pointed discussions about the very real issues now facing you and your friends. Don't blindly follow the rules that others make for you; listen to your intuition, instead."
scorpio,2010-11-28,"Your energy is intense today, prompting you to concentrate on basic survival issues. But simultaneously, a wave of hope is washing onto your shore, making your goals appear closer than before. Don't quit now, for hitching yourself to your dreams can make a huge difference in the days ahead."
sagittarius,2010-11-28,"You have a knack for being able to keep your goals in focus now, even if an unexpected change in circumstances throws you a surprising curve ball. Your reaction time may be fast, but don't assume that making a quick decision is better than cautiously thinking through all of the possibilities. Others are eager to listen to you and will respect your thought process as long as you consider a variety of possibilities prior to committing to just one."
capricorn,2010-11-28,"You are in your own earthy element now because the practical Virgo Moon harmonizes with profound Pluto in your sign. Fortunately, there's no need to develop several different contingencies; one good strategy will be enough. Remember, you don't need multiple options today; you only need the chance to follow through with the right one."
aquarius,2010-11-28,"You might be forced to think about a current emotional issue that's still unfolding in your life. Unfortunately, even if you try to evade the problem today, you'll still be lured into the melodrama. Since you may not be very comfortable in emotionally charged situations, play through the possible conversations in your imagination prior to facing them in real time. Advanced mental preparation should make it easier to speak from your heart."
pisces,2010-11-28,"You may be feeling a little more independent these days, but you need to stand up to someone who tries to be authoritative in order to put you in your place. Thankfully, you aren't willing to do as you are told if you can envision more appealing alternatives. Don't take the easy way out, because the course of least resistance may not lead you to where you want to go."
aries,2010-11-29,"You should know better now, but you might go ahead with your plans even though they'll probably lead to trouble. Your common sense is working fine today; the problem is that you could fearlessly overrule logic with your desires. Keep in mind that you can minimize the negative impact of your carelessness by repeatedly reminding yourself to slow down and think about what you're doing."
taurus,2010-11-29,"Don't look to your friends for advice today, because they are likely to encourage your plans, no matter what you say. Naturally, receiving support from those you trust feels good, but no one will tell you now if your idea is ill conceived. If you really want to know if you should proceed, make an objective list of all the pros and cons and then follow the logical conclusion."
gemini,2010-11-29,"Your family and closest friends might come up with plenty of reasons for you to decline a current opportunity, but you'll probably say yes anyhow. It's hard for you to see the downside of the current situation today because your hopes are high and any forward movement appears to be better than none at all. Just remember that you could be setting yourself up for a major disappointment now if you continue to have unrealistic expectations."
cancer,2010-11-29,"Normally, your good sense leads you to set boundaries so you don't overcommit your time at work. Nevertheless, you are also usually driven to be as cooperative as possible. Today, these two motivations collide as your optimism tempts you to take on more than you should. Don't let things reach a breaking point before you ask others for help. It's a sign of strength to recognize your limits before it's too late."
leo,2010-11-29,"You have big ideas on your mind today, yet you don't want to lose sight of what's real. Normally, your outgoing nature works in your favor, but you might attract so much positive feedback now that you begin to think you're invincible. Unfortunately, you have not yet transformed into a superhero, so step back from the excitement and downsize your plans before they get the best of you."
virgo,2010-11-29,"Your mood swings are hard to manage today because the Moon in your sign puts you in closer touch with your emotions. But your innate sense of clarity may be tougher to find now because you can see amazing potential everywhere you look. Keep in mind that you might be better off waiting a day or two before handling any big business decisions. Once your rational perspective returns, you'll be able to make smart choices again."
libra,2010-11-29,"It's not easy to be your regular cheery self today because you cannot keep up false pretenses any longer. Instead of covering your concerns and fears with a quick smile, express your thoughts as objectively as you can. Just putting your perspective out on the table might be enough to get the ball rolling in the right direction."
scorpio,2010-11-29,"You are socially astute today and know exactly how much pressure to apply in order to get what you want. However, your wisdom could go flying out the window once you see some results from your actions and you decide to ask for more. There's nothing wrong with having high ambitions as long as you know when to stop pushing. Too much drama can cause your best supporters to retreat in haste."
sagittarius,2010-11-29,"Fiery Mars in adventurous Sagittarius is encouraged by its square to your key planet Jupiter. But optimistic Jupiter may not know how to take no for an answer now. Although this boost of confidence helps if you are suffering from low self-esteem, it could be too much if you are already bouncing off the walls with enthusiasm. However, it's good to keep in mind that you always have a choice. Try taking your foot off the gas pedal and gently coasting for a while; you might enjoy the ride even more."
capricorn,2010-11-29,"Your sensible approach to managing a rather large project can put you in the driver's seat as others give up on the task. Thankfully, you believe that you're well suited for the job and are ready to give it your absolute best. However, it's still wise to exercise caution today, because your perceptions are bent a bit out of shape by your desire to succeed. Instead of trying to do the impossible and failing, set realistic goals that you can reach."
aquarius,2010-11-29,"You might try to oversimplify a complicated relationship today because it makes it easier to figure out your game plan. But leaving out the complexity just to suit your fancy isn't a smart idea. It's better to work with all the facts and be unsure of your next move than to arbitrarily avoid the truth to feed your false sense of security. Remember, ignorance is not bliss; however, knowledge is power."
pisces,2010-11-29,"You are moving ahead with your career objectives and could even be making significant progress, but there may be danger in your current optimism. Obviously, positive thinking helps you succeed, but if taken to an extreme it might also prevent you from seeing an important truth. You can best keep the air in your sails if you remain open to the prevailing winds of change."
aries,2010-11-30,"You don't have to be pushy today because it won't help you reach your goals any faster. Additionally, you could have more meaningful experiences if you partake in give and take, instead of trying to control a current situation. Remember that this strategy doesn't require you to let go of your dreams. It just means that it's better if you take the time to enjoy yourself on your way to success."
taurus,2010-11-30,"If you have been keeping up with your current obligations, today should be an easy day. You can successfully focus your energy on your job and get a good head start on the coming workweek. But don't try to take the simple way out, for this kind of approach won't likely work now. It's smarter to push hard early in the day and, if you can, coast a bit later on."
gemini,2010-11-30,"The week starts with a flurry of activity, but there could be a problem if you don't live up to your promises. The stress between your need for enjoyment and other people's plans for you can clash, even though you may attempt to keep your feelings quiet. You might be able to stay objective for a while, but your true desires will still leak out, revealing what you truly want. Life should get easier if you are honest right from the beginning."
cancer,2010-11-30,"You keep coming back to the issue of intensity as you attempt to decide how direct to be when asking for what you need. You might decide to stay silent; after all, others should be able to intuit what you want now, without you telling them. Simultaneously, you are tempted to put it out there one way or another. However, acting out your emotional behavior indirectly today will only set you farther back from your goals."
leo,2010-11-30,"You may receive some much-needed support from others at work today. Thankfully, you might not even have to ask; they just show up ready to follow your lead. However, danger stems from trying to accomplish too much, but you can't expect everyone else to work at your pace. In the meantime, be thankful for whatever assistance comes your way."
virgo,2010-11-30,"Finding ways to move your projects ahead can be challenging today because your current ambitions could awaken envy or jealousy in someone else. Most of your friends are rooting for you, unless they think that success is going to your head. If you wish to keep the peace, moderate your approach; any goal worth reaching will still be there later on."
libra,2010-11-30,"The Moon returns to your sign of balance today, yet it can still be a difficult passage. The same obstacles that have been in your way for a while may temporarily seem insurmountable. Their presence might slow you down enough to add a sense of desperation to your plan. If life feels overwhelming, don't respond by just working more. Instead, quit trying so hard and watch the pieces magically fall into place."
scorpio,2010-11-30,"You wish you could retreat from the ever-maddening crowds, but your fantasies might not have the space to manifest now. You aren't afraid of dealing with people, but you have grown weary of their familiar antics. Your natural rhythms remind you that it's time for a break from excess distractions. Be patient or you could lose your temper as frustration builds in anticipation of a busy week."
sagittarius,2010-11-30,"Mercury has been journeying through your adventurous sign with powerful Mars as a traveling partner. Now, however, you can ease your worries; there's no reason to finalize your plans as the Moon steps into your 11th House of Long-Term Goals. Instead of making concrete decisions, take time off so you can enjoy your friends. You can always get back to business later in the week."
capricorn,2010-11-30,"You must process any residual tension you are feeling, because the ambivalent Libra Moon is stirring up issues that could get in your way of success. However, you are able to fulfill your needs with a graceful sense of balance today. Unfortunately, you could easily lose your equilibrium as quickly as it came. Whatever you discuss now can help to alleviate the stress over the days ahead."
aquarius,2010-11-30,"Although today can be intense, try to bring an open mind to any conversation that may arise. However, you're more interested in learning about something entirely new, rather than forming an opinion on a previously discussed matter. You'll need to pay extra careful attention to what you say, for you could inadvertently turn the energy in a negative direction. Stay aware of the complexity of an issue to reduce unnecessary conflict."
pisces,2010-11-30,"You could have an awkward moment today by realizing that a previous goal has become less important. It's not that your opinions have changed; it's just that your perspective is growing broader, enabling you to understand an opposing viewpoint. Nevertheless, don't be too accommodating. It's better to dig in your heels and hold your position, instead of wasting energy trying to regain control later on."
aries,2010-12-01,"You don't have to be fearful now, even if you become drawn toward the darker side of love. The most powerful transformations can occur in the shadows of your subconscious mind, making it attractive to succumb to your desires and dig deeper. If a resentment surfaces today, simply acknowledge it and move on; it will fade as quickly as it arrived."
taurus,2010-12-01,"You are lured into a sensual dance today by your ruling planet Venus in passionate Scorpio. Her supportive alignment with talkative Mercury encourages you to share your fantasies for pleasure with your friends, but your tastes may be too intense for them now. Instead of openly disclosing your extreme feelings, it's smarter to understate your proclivities until your common sense returns."
gemini,2010-12-01,"There's no need to withhold your feelings today, even if they are intense. Your passion may surprise those close to you, but they'll understand that you aren't actually acting out of character. Thankfully, your ability to be fair-minded now can make your current interest in digging into the mysteries of love and hate easier to manage. But don't get hooked by what you want; you'll place less pressure on everyone if you remain detached from the results of your actions."
cancer,2010-12-01,"You might want to take responsibility for everyone else's happiness today, but this may be trickier than it first appears. A friend or associate might not openly express his or her negative feelings, but you know that something isn't quite right anyway. Nevertheless, resist the temptation to bring any hidden emotions out into the open now. Instead, just concentrate on the most positive aspects of your plans and don't worry about anyone else."
leo,2010-12-01,"You don't want to appear possessive, so you try to avoid expressing petty jealousies now. Nevertheless, you aren't able to control your emotions today. Your fear of missing an opportunity in your search for love could motivate you to do something you'll later regret. Passionate behavior elicits extreme responses, but denying your desires won't work either. Your best strategy is to stay in the center of the road until the stress passes."
virgo,2010-12-01,"You are feeling the need to return to a project that you assumed was already complete, but you now realize that it still needs more work. Build on what you already started and do everything you can to make sure your efforts bring you closer to your goals. Instead of beginning a new assignment at work, spend your day stabilizing the situation by tying up as many loose ends as possible."
libra,2010-12-01,"You are even more attracted to the idea of love today, yet you're pretty sure that things are not quite as simple as you wish. Still, the relationship-savvy Libra Moon focuses your attention on your interpersonal interactions and enables you to appear very upbeat. Instead of trying to convince everyone that you're doing fine, look for ways to soften your boundaries and show your vulnerability. Being more open now can produce positive change in the very near future."
scorpio,2010-12-01,"Although the Moon is visiting peaceable Libra today, sexy Venus is in your intense sign, motivating you to seek the pleasures of love. However, keep in mind that there are many different ways to be satisfied; sensuality is only one of them. Set some time aside to unwind and allow your imagination the freedom to wander. Your fantasies might show you places you don't normally go, yet they can also lead you directly to your future."
sagittarius,2010-12-01,"You may try to ignore messages from your subconscious now, but the advice you receive from yourself is likely better than what you get from others. You might believe that you're open to listening to your intuition, but a part of you recognizes your emotional limits and you're afraid to stretch beyond them. Be careful; you could lose a wonderful opportunity for love if you become so inflexible that you miss what's right in front of your nose."
capricorn,2010-12-01,"Although you know what you should do today, managing your professional responsibilities might be less compelling than following your heart. A current relationship may deepen or a brand new one could be started now. But either way, it's in your best interest to balance your feelings with a bit of common sense. Fortunately, your connections with others will be more satisfying if you fulfill your obligations at work first."
aquarius,2010-12-01,"You are distracted today by random bursts of hope, but you keep pulling yourself back to a more sensible position. You don't want to blindly trust your optimism because you're afraid of the subsequent disappointment if things don't work out as you want. There's absolutely nothing wrong with wishing for the best possible outcome, but it's still wise to be realistic in your expectations."
pisces,2010-12-01,"Although you present a fairly objective view of relationships now, you might be leaning toward taking a more subjective approach. Fortunately, you can see your current situation from multiple points of view, which gives you more options. Still, you would be smart to choose one path and then make the necessary changes that allow you to proceed. It's the act of making a decision that propels you forward toward the manifestation of your dreams."
aries,2010-12-02,"You may not even try to control your impulses today because you can't see the consequences of your actions clearly. Fortunately, you can still fulfill your dreams now since your key planet Mars is supported by a sextile from visionary Neptune. However, others might see your behavior as immature if you don't stop to think first. Your ideas can have a positive impact on everyone around you if you just let your plans develop one step at a time."
taurus,2010-12-02,"Your friends and associates have a lot to tell you today, and you would be wise to listen up. You can benefit from the advice of others now as the Moon joins your key planet Venus in your 7th House of Partners. But you must pay careful attention to be certain that what you hear is actually what is being said. It's too easy for you to escape into your fantasies now, so validate your interpretation to make sure you really understand."
gemini,2010-12-02,"You can respond confidently to someone's inquiry today, even if you don't know what you're doing. Thankfully, you're able to learn so fast that it appears as if you are on familiar ground. However, you need to tread cautiously because this risky strategy can catch you in your own cleverness. Being able to think on your feet is a blessing as long as you don't try to fake your expertise."
cancer,2010-12-02,"Your fears are fading and your sense of certainty grows stronger today, but make sure that your newfound confidence doesn't come at the cost of avoiding the facts. Although everything might seem to be on the up and up, ignorance is only bliss for a little while. It's healthier to acknowledge the truth, even if it temporarily complicates your life."
leo,2010-12-02,"A colleague or friend might misinterpret something you say today, creating a tangled web of intrigue and misunderstanding. It becomes doubly difficult if you don't realize that there is a problem before it's too late. It's wise to handle the situation before others become involved, which would only add chaos to your day. But it's even more intelligent to consistently communicate carefully so there's no break from reality in the first place."
virgo,2010-12-02,"Your discriminating mind wants clean facts and clear communications. Unfortunately, nebulous Neptune is drifting through your world today, compromising the precision of your words and luring others into your fantasies. It becomes difficult to discern where reality ends and illusion begins, so don't jump to any quick conclusions and make certain that you don't lose anyone along the way."
libra,2010-12-02,"You may feel less emotional today about an important issue as the moody Moon leaves your sign, but you still have unresolved stress to handle. Fortunately, things should take a turn for the better and you'll be able to dream your way through the day. Just keep in mind that the beauty you see out there is a reflection of what you have within your own heart."
scorpio,2010-12-02,"The Moon joins charming Venus in your sign today, and you're probably relieved by the change of energy. Fortunately, whatever was preventing your progress now begins to fade away. But don't assume that you'll be able to reach your goals overnight. Deceptive Neptune could trick you into believing that your destination is much closer than it actually is in reality."
sagittarius,2010-12-02,"Your future continues to look better these days, yet it still may be difficult to turn an opportunity into something that can make a real difference in your life. A number of significant pieces are falling into place now, yet they don't quite fit together as easily as they should. Relax your approach and allow the events to unfold as they will, rather than forcing anything into your schedule."
capricorn,2010-12-02,"It may be challenging for you to see any real purpose to idle daydreams, yet you might not be able to turn off the flow to your fantasies now as easily as you wish. You may try to overcompensate for your active imagination by being overly practical. Don't struggle too much today, for allowing yourself to drift away from reality for a bit could lead you to some very worthwhile ideas."
aquarius,2010-12-02,"Accommodating everyone's needs can grow tiring now, so you might try to conserve your energy by establishing boundaries. However, your strategy becomes problematic when you realize that you still could change your mind. Arbitrary rules have the potential to limit your interactions. Don't attempt to blame your inconsistencies on others; simply accept your contradictions and get on with what's next."
pisces,2010-12-02,"It may feel as if you have reached a point of a healthy balance between your career objectives and your spiritual path. These two divergent roads have temporarily come together to create a magical moment when your hopes and dreams actually impact your outer world. Make the most of your current metaphysical connection, for your visions can really steer you in the right direction."
aries,2010-12-03,Your current anxiety may be the latest recurrence of a familiar story as you struggle to be happy without giving up what you've already gained. Your frustration agitates your natural tendency to act without thinking; however impulsive reactions won't bring you any closer to your goals now. Taking a risk might pay off if you consider all your options first and don't assume that everything will change immediately.
taurus,2010-12-03,"What seemed like a really good idea yesterday might not be so appealing today, especially if someone is pressuring you to say yes. Still, you're tempted to step outside of your normal comfort zone because you're bored with what you're currently doing. Nevertheless, self-discipline is your best strategy now. Make a rational choice instead of setting aside your common sense and then regretting it later."
gemini,2010-12-03,"You may be itching to do something to get your adrenaline pumping today, yet it's crucial not to lose sight of your responsibilities. It's not that you're ready to party; it's just that you could make a hasty decision that is overly disruptive. The temptations are all around you and you are capable of talking yourself into nearly anything now. Instead, be cautious and fulfill your obligations before heading out to look for excitement."
cancer,2010-12-03,"Your grandiose thinking about a job-related project can put you in the spotlight today, but be ready to scale back your big plans if you meet too much resistance. It isn't worth depleting your energy to fight against a battle that cannot be won. Nevertheless, this is not about surrendering your dreams. Your current task is to create a path based on compromise without negotiating away your ideals. A solid solution may seem elusive, but persistence will, at least, move you in the right direction."
leo,2010-12-03,"You don't want to be the serious person now, especially if you've been forced to play that role for too long. Luckily, today you could have a chance to demonstrate a different approach -- a version of you that's new and improved. If you're having trouble letting go of control and loosening up, try to increase the quantity of fun-loving people in your immediate environment. A little laughter will go a long way toward healing what ails you."
virgo,2010-12-03,"You've made some important choices recently, but now you may see new options that weren't available before. You could become increasingly frustrated if you believe that you made a bad decision. However, you have an opportunity today to make additional changes, even if that means temporarily complicating your life. Remember, your situation can change quickly again; don't fall into the trap of thinking that you're stuck with what you have when your attitude can actually create a positive impact."
libra,2010-12-03,"Sometimes you live up to your reputation of being indecisive, but today you're eager to make a choice. Instead of moderating the extreme options by bringing them toward the center, you cannot wait to jump one way or the other. You're worried that you don't have time to consider all the options before you make up your mind. An objective approach is usually a smart strategy, but now it's more important to make your judgment with what you currently know and then move on."
scorpio,2010-12-03,"Measuring your success against someone else is not a productive strategy, yet it may be difficult to avoid such comparisons now as you try to figure out what to do next. But assessing your own position is tricky business because you can overvalue what you bring to the picture. Changing your mind quickly could take its toll on others, but don't try to stop your decision-making process even if someone else isn't comfortable with your volatility."
sagittarius,2010-12-03,"Your beliefs are emotionally charged today and your thoughts quite focused, but your actions are not aligned with your words. You may be running wild without really knowing where to begin, but regaining control seems nearly impossible. Unfortunately, your usual supporters can make things worse now by distracting you from what's most important. Nevertheless, you have the skills to stay on track, and it's your choice to use them."
capricorn,2010-12-03,"You have the gift of concentration as rational Mercury edges toward a weekend conjunction with intense Pluto in your sign. Even if circumstances have grown out of control today, you don't need to be pulled into dramas that aren't yours. Instead of scattering your energy, make a list of the unfinished business you want to complete. Once you've prioritized your tasks, you have your work cut out for you."
aquarius,2010-12-03,"You are aware that little surface problems are tied to deeper issues, and you're prepared to delve into a sticky situation today in order to reach the bottom. But your strategy may not go as planned, especially if others have a different idea of what you should be doing. You can appear to be adaptable, but you're not likely to walk away from your search without a fight. But your sense of urgency isn't necessarily based on reality. Slow down; you can always come back to your investigation later."
pisces,2010-12-03,"Something needs to give as your professional and personal goals clash. You want to take care of relationship issues, but responsibilities at work could be stressing you out. Try not to push for an ultimate solution today. But, on the other hand, avoidance isn't a viable strategy, either. Even if you don't know the answers to your current questions, radical honesty could be the key that brings you peace of mind."
aries,2010-12-04,"You could get caught up in your own imaginary battle for control today. While you're playing out the starring role in your personal drama, there might also be a real power play going on. Although you may forget about what makes the most sense and jump into the fray, it would be wiser to keep your fears to yourself and enjoy a bit of lighthearted fun now, instead."
taurus,2010-12-04,"You may experience pleasure in spontaneous activities today, so don't be too rigid in your expectations. You might be tempted to reject a change in plans before you even know what's being suggested. Keep your reaction to yourself until you hear the whole story. Instead of focusing on what's wrong, look for a hidden treasure in what's been said and concentrate on that. Everyone will be happier if you explore the possibilities instead of being close-minded or critical."
gemini,2010-12-04,"Be prepared to change direction midday as an interaction with a friend or family member distracts you from your chores. You might set the bar too high today and make promises that are difficult to keep. If your day seems to be beyond your control, don't exhaust yourself trying to resist the flow of events. You could think that everything will be better your way, but you're more adaptable than you realize. Ultimately, you'll have more fun floating along with the prevailing currents."
cancer,2010-12-04,"You may be stressed out today if someone who is usually your ally now seems to be fighting against your progress. However, this isn't what's really happening, for you have partial responsibility in the developing conflict. Others can tell something isn't right if you're not expressing how you feel. What you don't say now can stir up as powerful an emotional response as what you actually share."
leo,2010-12-04,"Powerful feelings are swirling around your environment today, yet you may choose not to acknowledge anything that might get in the way of your positive mood. Although there could be a problem with this as a long-term strategy, it can get you through the tricky currents of the day. Putting your energy into a project that demands your full attention is a good idea. You will have time to deal with your emotional concerns later on."
virgo,2010-12-04,"Even if you work hard to make this a perfect day, something can still go awry and catch you off guard. Fortunately, you want to open up and engage life spontaneously now, instead of concentrating your laser beam mind on what might go wrong. Advanced planning is a smart idea because you'll feel more comfortable about anything that happens if you know that you did whatever you could to make it right."
libra,2010-12-04,"You are liable to take on more than you can realistically manage now, especially if you are trying to make someone else feel at ease. Just remember that you can be a wonderful host or hostess while still taking care of your own needs, too. You don't have to go overboard to prove that you care, so scale back a bit and be a little less extravagant when catering to others."
scorpio,2010-12-04,"You may feel as if there's plenty to go around today, but there's no need to turn your sense of optimism into an overt display of confidence. Grandiose gestures won't necessarily impress anyone, especially if your generosity is more about making you feel good. It's not about how much money you spend on someone you like or about how indulgent you can be. The best gift you can give is embracing integrity and sharing your truth."
sagittarius,2010-12-04,"Your irrepressible moods are all over the place now that the Moon returns to your sign; however, you'll only feel more out of control if you try to rein in your emotions. You can tell that profound energetic shifts are looming, yet you aren't ready to face them at this time. Postponing the inevitable until after tomorrow's New Moon is a smart idea. Just don't try to convince yourself that you can escape the upcoming change for much longer."
capricorn,2010-12-04,"Your fantasies can take you on a ride today as the Moon moves into your 12th House of Imagination. This can be quite a lot of fun as long as you don't confuse your dreams with reality. Be careful, for this merging of fact and fancy is a facet of your current daydreams. You have the power to bring yourself back to the real world so you can better enjoy things as they are, rather than how you want them to be."
aquarius,2010-12-04,"It's challenging to relax now if you think that everything is ready to change. Your fear of instability makes the situation more difficult than it is. If you hold on to the status quo too tightly, things are likely to become so brittle that they can crack under pressure. However, ebbing and flowing with the energy allows your foundation to bend and even become revitalized in the process."
pisces,2010-12-04,"You might be holding on to a career objective so tightly now that it brings frustration instead of success. Your fear of failure could be so overwhelming that you're afraid to take a risk that could bring you closer to your goals. Ultimately, you must find a way to overcome your concerns about what will happen if you temporarily let go. Rest assured that even if you lose touch with reality, your feet will quickly return to the safety of solid ground."
aries,2010-12-05,"Your fearless optimism can carry you so far today that you could stir up some unexpected resistance, especially if someone believes that you're not being realistic. Unfortunately, you might have glossed over an important fact, yet your current intentions are strong enough to overcome difficult odds. Acting on your ideas with conviction is healthy, but don't waste energy defending your position with hollow words."
taurus,2010-12-05,"Involving someone else in your plans could be the most advantageous strategy for you now, but that will require you to be open to what your partner wants, too. A positive attitude will help, but today it won't be enough unless you pay attention to the facts. Don't minimize what you're told, because slipping into a dreamy space of fantasies won't help you reach your goals. Keeping your feet firmly on the ground is as important as knowing your destination."
gemini,2010-12-05,"A familiar relationship may be infused with exciting energy today as you and your partner mutually recommit to improve your relationship. Or, someone could enter your life now and inspire you with possibilities of creating something quite special. Either way, it is your responsibility to transform your dreams into reality by releasing previous expectations and allowing the power of the moment to work its magic."
cancer,2010-12-05,"Although you may be eager to accomplish a lot around your home today, you could easily underestimate the amount of effort required to complete your chores. You may be up for the tasks, but you also might discover that you're in over your head. If you realize that you're overcommitted, taking it out on others isn't a useful strategy. Instead, be honest about your predicament and ask for help. You may be surprised at how quickly your real friends come to your aid."
leo,2010-12-05,"You may feel as if you want to party today with the Sagittarius New Moon in your 5th House of Fun and Games. You might be so eager to enjoy yourself that you temporarily forget about your previous commitments. But this need not be a concern now; you'll get everything done, even if you have to work harder later. Give yourself permission to bask in the glow of love while expressing your gratitude as often as possible."
virgo,2010-12-05,"Your wide-ranging vision, combined with a realistic attitude, can have a very positive effect on those around you today. But you would prefer to focus on the good news rather than the bad. Even if your actions portray the highest of ideals, your personal self-judgment is harsh and you'll probably fall short of your own expectations. Don't be too tough on yourself; just do what you can while still enjoying quality time with family and friends."
libra,2010-12-05,"You may be quite appreciative of your closest friends and family now, for their presence adds so much joy to your life. Now, they can energize you by initiating interesting discussions and exposing you to a variety of activities. Although you might want to narrow the focus, everyone will be happier if you are flexible and simply allow the day to carry you along for a ride."
scorpio,2010-12-05,"It's no easy job to distinguish your views about personal wealth from any judgments that you might have of yourself. You may appear certain of your current choices, but it's still wise to exercise a little caution. All the information hasn't surfaced yet, so don't draw any conclusions until you have the complete picture. Nevertheless, there's no reason to withhold your appreciation of those you enjoy having in your life."
sagittarius,2010-12-05,"The happy-go-lucky Sagittarius Moon may have you feeling like you're on a roll, especially if you believe that you have a lot to be thankful for today. But you could be so enthusiastic about what may come next in your life that you could get sloppy with the execution of your plans. Instead of building your entire future on a dream, make certain that your strategy is grounded in reality."
capricorn,2010-12-05,"It's not that you are a scrooge; it's just that your value for integrity is more urgent than your desire to project hope. However, you could minimize your high ideals today to encourage everyone else to create his or her own vision. Don't take the easy way out by glossing over the truth just to keep everything in its proper place. Hold onto your clear-headed approach, even if others think that you're wrong."
aquarius,2010-12-05,"You are probably quite upbeat today and it seems as if everyone's taking notice. You're very easy to be with now, for you don't need a lot of attention. You might even choose to have a memorable time with your friends offstage, instead of putting yourself through the performance anxiety you get while being on stage. Even if you shirk the spotlight, you'll still be recognized for what you do."
pisces,2010-12-05,"Although today may be your day off, you still retain a strong desire to know where you are heading in your chosen profession. Your general career path may be the topic of a hot discussion now. But don't try to reach any final decisions or make a detailed action plan for what comes next. Instead, just give yourself the physical and metaphysical space to dream as big as you can, because nearly anything is possible. The greatest limitations at this time will arise from within your own mind."
aries,2010-12-06,"You may become so caught up in your vision of the future that you lose track of what's most relevant. Making a decision may create real problems if you don't stop to think about the impact of your actions. Fortunately, if you can slow down enough to remember your original intent, you have an excellent chance to progress toward your destination. There's nothing wrong with dreaming as long as you maintain a healthy perspective."
taurus,2010-12-06,"You might be quite certain that others will support your plan at work today, even if you don't have all the details figured out yet. Unfortunately, they may not be so willing to jump on board without sufficient facts to justify your idea. Although you might try to make an emotional appeal, you could come across more aggressive now than you intend. Soften your approach because you'll seem overly desperate if you push too hard."
gemini,2010-12-06,"It's easy to misinterpret someone's actions today because you are more sensitive than you realize. You may believe that others are angry when they are simply expressing their convictions. Don't confuse disagreement with a personal attack. Instead, clarify the differences and try to establish common ground. Open conflict now won't lead to a satisfactory solution."
cancer,2010-12-06,"It's easier to see what's wrong with something at work today than to appreciate what's right. Unfortunately, your criticism can be more of a hindrance than a help, unless you also acknowledge the positive contributions of everyone involved. It really doesn't take much effort to find something nice to say, and your supportive words will go a long way toward soothing someone's wounded feelings."
leo,2010-12-06,"Being sure of yourself is one thing, but encouraging conflict to prove yourself right is totally different. Although you may be tempted to turn a bit of resistance into an open disagreement, this strategy won't give you the platform you want to demonstrate your wisdom. Instead, you could inadvertently send a wrong message, making others think that you are being petty by focusing on divisive tactics. It's not a competition; you're all in this together."
virgo,2010-12-06,"It's not easy to balance your innate need to have all the details in place with your current desire to dream big. You are more interested now in being creative without worrying about whether or not your ideas will actually work. Nevertheless, you cannot just throw the facts out the window. You will be most effective if you take enough time to acknowledge the truth before surrendering to your imagination."
libra,2010-12-06,"Helping your colleagues to feel at ease is one of your strengths, yet you might take this too far today without even realizing what you're doing. Focusing excessive attention on everyone else's needs now could impede your creative efforts. Giving others more freedom to succeed or fail on their own may ultimately empower them. It could also enable you to make an important breakthrough of your own."
scorpio,2010-12-06,"You may try to avoid a feeling that's growing stronger by the day, but the only way to resolve the tension is to stop struggling. Fortunately, you are attracted to finding a more spiritual solution to your dilemma, instead of involving others in your unfolding emotional drama. Losing your temper won't bring you any closer to happiness. However, monitoring your mood swings while concentrating on your long-term goals is a strategy that might work."
sagittarius,2010-12-06,"Although you might have to handle a few surprises along the way, you are able to stand back from the noisy distractions of the day and take a wider view of what's happening. This emotionally detached approach enables you to stay focused on your real purpose rather than getting caught up in a drama that isn't really yours. It's okay to live in your dreams today because you'll be pulled back into reality by tomorrow."
capricorn,2010-12-06,"You have more going on within the hidden realms of your imagination than anyone realizes today. Luckily, you should be able to keep your bases covered in the real world as your friends and co-workers make the mistake of judging you by what's on the surface. Meanwhile, your current inner journey is spiritually rejuvenating and can fuel your efforts over the next few days."
aquarius,2010-12-06,"You may be living in a dream world now where you believe that everything is harmonious between you and your friends or associates. But you might be in denial as you attempt to ignore a rift that has developed between you and others. Unfortunately, the increasing discomfort won't go away if you just stick your head in the sand. Allow your feelings to come to the surface without forcing anything. Remaining free of judgment permits the ill will to dissipate naturally."
pisces,2010-12-06,"Your co-workers may look to you for guidance today because your view of the future stands above differences of opinion and petty office politics. Maybe it's because you are just being too vague to commit to one position or another. However, it's more likely that your perspective is really quite cosmic and that you have chosen the moral high road. Don't be goaded into taking sides. Instead, play out your role as someone who has integrity even in the midst of emotional drama."
aries,2010-12-07,"Responsibilities at work or at home don't feel so tedious today. You could even enjoy the routine because it shifts your attention away from the complexities of your life. However, you might face a bit of disappointment if you don't have time for social activities because your job-related obligations are more pressing. Don't fret; there will be other days when you'll have more time to spend with your friends."
taurus,2010-12-07,"You may have recently overextended yourself, making this an opportune time to regroup as you consider what to do next. Thankfully, your common sense will lead you in the right direction as you pull your energy back to center. But don't try to avoid hard work today, even if you want to rest. Whatever you put off now will take even more effort when you have to do it later."
gemini,2010-12-07,"Even if you've been enjoying yourself lately, a serious encounter could pull you out of the clouds and bring you back down to earth. You might not be very happy when someone reminds you of your unattended responsibilities, but there's no one to blame but yourself. Escaping into Fantasyland can be quite blissful some days, but not today. The real power of now will be most evident if you focus on what is, rather than the possibility of what could be."
cancer,2010-12-07,"Your commitments may have you so stressed out that you cannot find time to pursue more relaxing pleasures today. Don't let resentment ruin an otherwise productive day, because negative emotions are just a waste of precious energy. Instead of seeking to fulfill your immediate desires, a more mature and reserved approach to life now will give way to a deeper satisfaction later on."
leo,2010-12-07,"Your optimism fades into a more realistic outlook today as you realize that your goals will take longer to achieve than you originally thought. However, there's no room for discouragement because that will only further impede your progress. Acknowledge that it's more important to stay on course than it is to cross a few tasks off your list. Don't rush through your work; slow down and make every little action count."
virgo,2010-12-07,"The intensity of your feelings begins to cool today, but this isn't a license to shift into a more analytical mode. Instead, use what time you can to assimilate your recent experience and prepare yourself for another round of engagement by getting your life in order. Although gathering useful data can be comforting, you already know enough. Instead, get out of your head by practicing spontaneous acts of joyful self-expression."
libra,2010-12-07,"Although you may have enjoyed the recent social activities, it's time to return to your responsibilities. Others may lean on you because they see how you are making your life more stable and they hope your practicality will rub off on them. However, it makes more sense for you to stay focused on your own issues for now; you won't be able to help anyone else until you help yourself."
scorpio,2010-12-07,"Managing the complexities of your calendar is crucial now to juggling all your obligations. Thankfully, you can figure out how to fit everything in, but you must take the time to consider all aspects of your schedule for the days and weeks ahead. You'll be able to accomplish all that you promise as long as you consider the timeline for each and every job. The way to success is by being pragmatic and putting everything in its proper place."
sagittarius,2010-12-07,"You might not be ready to cash in your party chips, even if the planets are stacking up in orderly Capricorn and your 2nd House of Self-Worth. Nevertheless, the good times cannot be sustained unless you also tend to more serious business. Instead of pushing your luck by chasing after another opportunity for fun, be wise and shift your attention toward stabilizing your finances, replenishing your body and getting back to basics."
capricorn,2010-12-07,"You have an opportunity to progress on your path to success today, and it would be a big mistake to get lazy. Now that energetic Mars is joining several other planets in ambitious Capricorn, it's time to establish a pace of work that you can sustain and settle in for the long haul. Although gravity may be pulling you toward your goals, it's in your best interest to help the process by working hard and staying focused on your destination."
aquarius,2010-12-07,"Keep your eyes wide open because important lessons are coming your way. Although you are often more preoccupied with the future than the present moment, your imagination and dreams are now focusing on practical issues of immediate concern. Keep in mind that what you do today will impact your life for many tomorrows."
pisces,2010-12-07,"Escapist behaviors can bring trouble today, so it's best to look at your life through a practical lens. Although you are often easily distracted by your fantasies, you are now able to look past the enticing dreams and ephemeral visions. The greatest benefit will come to you if you keep bringing your thoughts back to the hard cold facts. The most pragmatic approach to life is currently the most successful."
aries,2010-12-08,"Others are counting on you to follow through with your end of the deal, but it's not enough for you to simply cross off the tasks on your list. Your performance now isn't about doing something that you promised; it's about doing it with conviction. Don't be afraid of expressing your feelings through your work by raising the bar of excellence. Show up with all your heart and give it all you got."
taurus,2010-12-08,"You aren't willing to gloss over a difficult issue today because you know that digging beneath the surface will create the intimacy that you seek. But this isn't about receiving simple pleasure; the real magic won't be available unless you go deeper than usual. There's no need to be in a hurry. The longer you sustain a meaningful connection, the better it gets."
gemini,2010-12-08,"You cannot ignore the presence of others in your life now because they have something important to teach you. It may not seem like fun at first, but complicated political considerations will become less significant if you're able to show your more vulnerable side instead of posturing in a defensive manner. Don't let your ability to be clever get in the way of deepening a special relationship."
cancer,2010-12-08,"You don't want to deal with anyone else's negativity today, especially if it's directed toward you. Unfortunately, it may feel as if others are on your case now and you are tempted to shut them out without listening to what they have to say. However, you can push past a barrier that's come between you and a potential adversary if you are willing to reveal your true feelings. Being totally honest about what you want could ultimately heal a rift in a significant relationship."
leo,2010-12-08,"You could be overly secretive at work today because you aren't ready to let your feelings get in the way of your efficiency. You would rather hold your emotions quiet until a more appropriate time, such as when you're with a close friend or partner. Unfortunately, you'll appear more transparent than you realize and others will wonder why you're pretending that all is well. You don't have to tell your whole story, but it's helpful to, at least, acknowledge your dilemma."
virgo,2010-12-08,"Adopting a methodical approach to your life can help you manage the intense feelings that might be floating around today just below the threshold of expression. You don't need to tell everyone what's on your mind. Your feelings are yours, alone. Nevertheless, avoiding your emotional desires now is not a smart strategy, either. Give yourself permission to explore your unexpressed fears. Bringing them out into the open lessens the current hold they have on you."
libra,2010-12-08,You have the ability to make financial gains today as valuable Venus in your 2nd House of Money forms a cooperative aspect with powerful Pluto. But your success may not come from receiving a promotion or a raise. You can actually grow richer as your self-image changes and doubt transforms into certainty. Be patient; metamorphosis doesn't happen overnight.
scorpio,2010-12-08,"Today, loving Venus channels her sweet energy into your key planet, dark Pluto. Your needs are strong and may be complex enough that you don't want to open a can of worms around anyone who hasn't already proven his or her worth. There's nothing wrong with being selective; keep conversations simple until someone earns your trust by showing a willingness to enter dangerous territory."
sagittarius,2010-12-08,"Your secret desires can lead you on a wild goose chase of fantasies today as you seek an elusive resolution to a dilemma. You want to be honest with those you respect, but you also want to keep the mood light and easy. Unfortunately, you may need to jump into the currently confusing realm of your conflicted feelings. Magically, once you muster up the courage and begin to reveal your dreams, they don't seem as problematic. Shining the light of your awareness into the darkness of the unknown changes things for the better."
capricorn,2010-12-08,"Your previous work will pay off today as others assist you in ways you might not expect. Loving Venus in your 11th House of Friends supportively sextiles relentless Pluto in your sign. Those who know how serious you are will join you in your efforts and will vouch for your authenticity. Don't resist help, even if it's just a good word that someone puts in for you. Everyone benefits when others feel invested in your success."
aquarius,2010-12-08,"There's so much going on behind closed doors or within your own mind today that it's difficult for others to read your intentions. Your friends may mistakenly assume that they know what you're up to and might approve of your current direction, even if they don't have all the facts. Don't fall into the trap of trying to explain your purpose and rationalize your goals. Just keep progressing toward your destination. There will be time to talk about everything later."
pisces,2010-12-08,"You have regained some clarity about your plans for the future, yet it may be too soon to put your ideas into words. Anyway, your friends and associates aren't interested now in what you have to say; they want to see tangible results. However, it will probably take a few days for your actions to bear fruit, so keep your expectations to a minimum. Don't force resolution or you'll only slow down your progress."
aries,2010-12-09,"You've been working hard and don't want to wait any longer to be done. Unfortunately, you may need to dig a bit deeper now to find the patience you need. Even if you don't want to continue at the same hectic pace, there's too much at stake to drop the ball. Accept any delays with as much grace as possible and remember that your current efforts will be rewarded if you keep your eyes on the prize."
taurus,2010-12-09,"You may receive the go-ahead on a project that you've been considering for a while, but don't expect to make too much progress until after the holidays. Instead of trying to bolt ahead, use today to map out an intelligent schedule based upon what you know now. Remember, your current tendency is to underestimate your resource requirements, so allow yourself plenty of leeway when it comes to the time and money needed to finish your work."
gemini,2010-12-09,"You may be rather indecisive because you can justify nearly any course of action you choose. But you could spin your wheels trying to figure out which path is the right one. Remember, Mercury turns retrograde tomorrow, indicating that today's verdict won't likely be your final one. Therefore, it makes sense to state your preference with the understanding that you will likely change your mind in the weeks ahead."
cancer,2010-12-09,"Your partner or a close friend might encourage you to take responsibility for your life today instead of waiting for others to approve of your direction. Although this confident strategy sounds wise, it might be complicated to put it into motion because you don't know how far you should take your idea. Heed the good advice you are given and don't let self-doubt slow you down."
leo,2010-12-09,"If a relationship has been problematic lately, an unexpected light may now appear at the end of the tunnel. Although you have good cause to feel optimistic, don't get your hopes up too high or you could set yourself up for disappointment. Whether an old partnership is being reenergized or a different one is exploding onto the scene, you are moving into a new phase. But, ultimately, your future is in your own hands because you must decide how to remain open to the potential that's entering your life."
virgo,2010-12-09,"Anxiety could get the best of you today, especially if you're dealing with an ongoing health issue. You may need to reexamine your overall approach to your physical well-being, which could lead to a decision about changing your lifestyle. Remember, your key planet Mercury turns retrograde tomorrow, making it harder to stick with long-term plans. Setting goals is a smart idea as long as you don't invite failure by expecting too much of yourself."
libra,2010-12-09,"You could convince yourself to do something today that sounds good, but isn't very practical. Fortunately, an unrealistic decision won't mess things up too much. Don't worry if your productivity slips because the Moon's visit to your 5th House of Spontaneity is more about having fun than working hard. You won't be able to escape your chores forever, but give yourself permission to choose pleasure now without feeling guilty."
scorpio,2010-12-09,"Although you could have a very busy schedule today, you'll still find time to meander back through your past when the Moon enters your 4th House of Roots. But don't let yourself get hooked by the memory of an emotional hurt. Instead, play Pollyanna and find the positive slant to what happened. Reframing your personal history enables you to move beyond an old wound and move forward with your life."
sagittarius,2010-12-09,"Your easygoing attitude allows you to gracefully sail through the day without becoming too attached to anything that's happening. Nevertheless, you recognize the need for change now because you cannot continue to juggle all the balls at your current pace. No doubt, there is reason to worry if you don't try to proactively fix the situation. Rather than waiting for everything in the air to fall on your head, reduce the complexity of your daily routine while there's still time."
capricorn,2010-12-09,"Your mind is changing as you begin to see your life from a new and different perspective. This may be healthy for your self-esteem, but it won't last long unless you initiate action on your own volition. Fortunately, you don't have to turn your life upside down; just set a goal and promise yourself that you will do your very best to achieve it."
aquarius,2010-12-09,"You cannot clearly see what's coming up, but you know that this is a turning point in your life. The choices you make now can significantly impact your future. Acknowledging your need for self-expression and independence is important, but so is listening to your intuition, even if its message is more cautious and conservative than you wish. Success depends upon your ability to balance a risky plan with sensible actions."
pisces,2010-12-09,"You wish you could take the day off to relax and replenish your spirit. But you may need to wait a few days before you'll be able to soothe your frazzled nerves. Nevertheless, you still can set aside a bit of quiet time at home later in the evening to explore your fantasies. Remember, anything you make real must first be imagined in your mind."
aries,2010-12-10,"It may be back to the drawing board for you, especially if you were so eager to get started that you didn't lay a solid foundation for the work ahead. You might believe you can power your way through the resistance that you now face -- and maybe you can -- but you would be wiser to slow down and rethink your strategy first. It's smarter to go back to the beginning and get it right before you've gone too far."
taurus,2010-12-10,"You may have some regrets about a recent decision you made that could affect upcoming travel plans. Perhaps a holiday vacation will need to be rescheduled. However, a close friend or partner may come to your rescue by helping you figure out a new strategy to get you through this hectic time of year. Even if your schedule still seems predetermined, be flexible if you encounter pressure to change."
gemini,2010-12-10,"Be aware that shifting alliances among your associates could create some political difficulties for you over the next few weeks. There's more going on than meets the eye now, even if everything looks like it's copasetic. It may take days or even weeks for everything that's still hidden to work its way up to the surface. In the meantime, pay attention to your intuition while you're waiting for additional information."
cancer,2010-12-10,"An agreement that you made with a partner or a friend might unravel in the next few days, but don't fret because it's better to know where you stand sooner than later. Instead of waiting until your frustration has turned to anger, make a commitment to talk through the problem while it's still developing. Do it now; it will be harder next week to bring your concerns out into the open."
leo,2010-12-10,"You might attempt to make too many changes today because your confidence level is high and your stamina is strong. But if you set your goals too high, you may be disappointed or even embarrassed by your inability to accomplish your objectives. Remember, now that Mercury's retrograde, everything could take longer than you think, leaving you tired out before you reach your destination."
virgo,2010-12-10,"Although you may be very clear about your role now, it's easy to slip into an old pattern that no longer serves you very well. You might find yourself facing ghosts of your past that bubble into your awareness as if they are old friends -- but they are not. Whatever fantasies you've been nurturing recently must be set aside to make room for a more practical kind of creativity."
libra,2010-12-10,Holding on to an old grudge within a tight family community can create a variety of problems now. An emotionally charged issue that has been brewing for a long time may be re-stimulated by someone's thoughtless actions. Don't confuse the intensity of your current feelings -- which are tied to a hurtful memory -- with your present reality. Staying fully aware of what's happening throughout the day enables you to remain calm and maintain your integrity.
scorpio,2010-12-10,"You might have stretched to make everything work this week as you got busier and busier, but if the straw that broke the camel's back hasn't already arrived, it's likely on the way. Instead of attempting superhuman feats and somehow holding it all together, gently release your control, even if it means that some previously scheduled events will fall to the wayside. Be responsible, but don't take it to the extreme; there's plenty of time ahead to finish up your work."
sagittarius,2010-12-10,"Your heightened self-esteem could make you feel invincible today. This is fine, as long as you aren't so overconfident that you behave in a reckless manner. Even if it seems like you're running out of time, it's just Mercury the Trickster playing games with your head. Instead of trying to outsmart anyone -- including yourself -- slow down and concentrate on making things simpler instead of more complex."
capricorn,2010-12-10,"Mischievous Mercury begins to back up in your 1st House of Personality today, turning your thoughts inward as you reconsider what you were about to share. Although you can still enjoy your interactions with others, you may not be very open with your feelings. Trust your gut; don't let anyone talk you into saying more than you intend until you're good and ready."
aquarius,2010-12-10,"Although the Moon's visit to your sign can soften your personality and increase your vulnerability, your words may not give away your secret. Instead of sharing whatever comes into awareness today, you're more likely to consider everything you say before opening your mouth. Just make sure that your stoic approach doesn't backfire by closing you off to the love and support that you need."
pisces,2010-12-10,"An intense exchange of words with a friend can erupt from a little misunderstanding today. Fortunately, negative emotions won't be able to establish a real foothold in your day if you have the courage to bring them out into the open where they can be discussed. But if you choose to fake pleasantries for the sake of expediency, you'll find yourself in a heap of trouble pretty quickly with no easy way out. Save yourself from the headache and be honest about your feelings from the start."
aries,2010-12-11,"You may sense the front edge of a big wave of change that's heading your way, and your uncertainty about the future makes you anxious. Fortunately, you're not resistant to the lessons you're now learning, but you'd rather move through this phase with as little disruption as possible. Nevertheless, you could waste your energy if you attempt to maintain your current schedule. It's smarter to flow with the shifting currents instead of fighting against them."
taurus,2010-12-11,"You might look to your friends for advice, especially if you're having a difficult time cooperating with others instead of teaming up with them. It's challenging to avoid creating adversarial relationships now, yet a combative strategy won't be helpful to anyone. Think about what your colleagues can offer and what you are willing to surrender in the process. Successful negotiation requires compromise on both sides."
gemini,2010-12-11,"Your ruling planet Mercury may be stressing you out now as it retrogrades in your 8th House of Shared Resources. If you are getting mixed messages from an authority figure, don't try to force a resolution yet because there's probably more people's interests involved than you realize. Instead of pushing your agenda onto anyone else, let the situation develop on its own. Your ultimate choice will become clearer as others express their desires."
cancer,2010-12-11,"The current tension between your thoughts and your feelings can be confusing as the facts pull one way and your desires pull you in another direction. Unfortunately, the data that you're receiving now isn't very stable. Something that seems to be true today might turn out to be false tomorrow. Even if you want to believe your rational analysis, it's smarter to trust your instincts because they can cut through the uncertainty and lead you in the right direction."
leo,2010-12-11,"You may be intrigued by your intense feelings now, but you secretly long for stability in your life. Of course, you prefer pleasure to hard work, especially if you haven't had much fun recently, so you may jump at an interesting invitation from a casual friend. Don't try to talk yourself out of a good time. Even if you have a lot of chores to finish, you'll feel better after a break from the intensity."
virgo,2010-12-11,You may be overloaded by information today as your key planet Mercury retrogrades through methodical Capricorn. But it's extra challenging to stay focused because your dream world is so vivid now. Others may pressure you to make a choice but try not to make any final decisions yet. So much is happening that you'll probably want to change your mind in a day or two. Leave your options open as long as you can.
libra,2010-12-11,"You may have an important event today, but something unexpected could happen that requires you to postpone it. It's likely that you crammed too much into your day because you felt pressured to perform. Don't waste your time worrying if your plans fall apart and you have to reschedule other commitments. If you go along with the changing tides as best you can, others will probably recognize your position and support your efforts."
scorpio,2010-12-11,"Your work ethic may be tested today as practical concerns force you to change your approach. You could run into a conflict with a close friend, but don't assume that you have done anything wrong. There may be trouble if you make a decision that is based on your values, without considering how others might react. Nevertheless, you shouldn't need to compromise your beliefs; just change how you're executing your plans for the sake of expediency."
sagittarius,2010-12-11,"You have a clear sense of the future now and know what you need to do to be successful. However, things become complicated if you run into an unexpected obstacle. Managing the situation may not be an easy task, yet it's crucial not to ignore it. Don't go for the quick fix today; instead set your intentions on finding the best long-term solution."
capricorn,2010-12-11,"Your instincts could take you in the opposite direction of your logic today. To make matters more complex, your new idea might be contrary to everyone else's thoughts, too. This won't be an easy course to follow because of the intense resistance you will face. Still, it's smarter to go with your intuition now and leave the more rational approach for another day."
aquarius,2010-12-11,"Mischievous Mercury is scrambling messages now as it backs up in your 12th House of Imagination. Unfortunately, you can't trust your senses today and it is challenging to distinguish reality from the noise. Using your fantasies to complete the picture may be the best you can do, but the results might be misleading. You can convince yourself of nearly anything, so it's better to wait for clarity to return before making any critical decisions."
pisces,2010-12-11,"An important person may offer you information today that contradicts what you already know. You could be so confused that you don't know who to trust or which way to turn. Although you may be pressured to choose sides in a conflict that is unfolding around you, it's safer not to get involved in other people's issues now. Wait a few days and see how the situation is progressing before supporting either side."
aries,2010-12-12,"You may be ready for a change in direction in order to help conserve your energy. You might even be planning a retreat, especially if you have been on the go lately. Making time for solitude today can be challenging but it's more valuable than you realize. Paradoxically, the more complicated it is for you to schedule a bit of downtime, the more you need it. No excuses are valid; just make it happen."
taurus,2010-12-12,"Although you may be comfortable working alone, being part of a group could be exactly what you need now. You are able to strengthen your convictions in your own individual objectives if you share your vision with like-minded people. But it's easy to get caught up in a cause that's larger than your own. Remember, contributing to a community effort is admirable, but it could backfire if you sacrifice your personal goals in the process."
gemini,2010-12-12,"You might have some resistance to meeting your obligations today, but this need not stop you from having a positive attitude. You may be afraid that you'll lose your sense of identity if you become too involved with other people's feelings. But you are able to be more persistent now than you realize. If you can convince yourself that it's safe to relax, the obstacles to your success will begin to dissipate."
cancer,2010-12-12,"Today's watery Pisces Moon can be an antidote for your recent emotional detachment. Your parched soul now begins to reconnect with what's important. You are eager to immerse yourself into the refreshing deep sea, but others might not want to follow you in your underwater adventure. Nevertheless, rewards await you if you're willing to dig for buried treasure on your own."
leo,2010-12-12,"You want to be seen as someone who knows how to have fun, but the Moon's visit to your 8th House of Intimacy reveals a much deeper part of your personality. You are motivated now to raise complicated issues that are without fast and easy solutions. However, taking little steps to express your heartfelt desires can lead to profound discussions that intensify an important relationship."
virgo,2010-12-12,"All aspects of your partnerships are emphasized today with the Moon's visit to your 7th House of Others. But you might get annoyed if others aren't as diligent as you are. Unfortunately, your intervention might be perceived as unsolicited criticism. Don't try to solve other people's problems or change someone who falls short of your expectations. Instead, make adequate room for all the imperfections that you see around you, and allow those you love to be human."
libra,2010-12-12,"You may have a long list of things to do around the home today, but you're not exactly sure how to get started. You might think that making a list will help you focus, but even that could prove to be a daunting task. Although over-planning your day is tempting, it's much wiser to stay flexible and take everything one step at a time. Don't judge yourself harshly if you don't make a lot of progress; you'll catch up in time."
scorpio,2010-12-12,"Having fun is a high priority with the Moon traveling through your 5th House of Enjoyment, but you may be stressed out by a long-forgotten family memory. Thankfully, your private matters don't have to interfere with your life today if you effectively manage your emotions. Whereas you often cannot segregate your head from your heart, staying aware of your feelings now allows you to process them internally, without others having to know what's going on."
sagittarius,2010-12-12,"Your irrepressible optimism can hide tears and fears today, but you still might feel helpless because you can't seem to control your emotions. Your first inclination is to avoid conversations that could appear to be unacceptable, rather than trying to process your feelings. The truth is that you'll feel relieved as soon as you express what's in your heart. There may be no immediate resolution, but at least everyone will know where you stand."
capricorn,2010-12-12,"The more you try to regain control over your daily life now, the harder it is to keep everything together. If satisfaction is elusive today, all is not lost. There's no need to fret, for you're likely better off than you realize. However, it might take some time yet for you to see how much progress you have made, because retrograde Mercury is traveling through your sign for one more week."
aquarius,2010-12-12,"Financial issues may be confusing today, for there are many choices to make and you don't know which way to turn. Matters are complicated even further if your expert advisors offer conflicting strategies. Ultimately, you might be required to set aside the facts you gathered, stop your ongoing analysis and simply follow whatever you feel in your gut. Don't bother justifying your decisions now; just do what your instincts suggest."
pisces,2010-12-12,"The Moon's monthly return to your sign is often a bit overwhelming. Now, however, it's your relationships that weigh heavily on you. Still, it's not smart to make a decision that affects your partner while you're under a lot of pressure. Your best strategy is based on objectively observing your own personal paradox. Try to postpone the most significant choices for at least a few more days."
aries,2010-12-13,"It's difficult for you to hear the voice of reason today as your ruling planet Mars joins relentless Pluto and mental Mercury. Your confidence can be more combative than you realize, especially if you take action before considering anyone else's point of view. Thankfully, you can reduce the negative impact of your behavior by remembering to be respectful of other people's feelings. Acting for the good of all brings better results than just looking out for yourself."
taurus,2010-12-13,"You Bulls can be quite stubborn, especially on a day like today when you may be provoked to fight back to keep what you believe is rightfully yours. However, your opinions can surreptitiously turn into facts, and you begin to believe them so intensely that you cannot hear someone's differing point of view. Remaining open to new information increases your chances to be happy now."
gemini,2010-12-13,"Since you are often the first person to change your mind, others might be surprised because you are able to maintain a constant perspective and stick with a specific course of action today, even when easier choices become available. You are not attracted to simplicity now; you need to experience the deep emotions that have been slipping away. Luckily, excitement accompanies you on this profound journey, stimulating your innate curiosity so you can learn more about yourself."
cancer,2010-12-13,"You may need to stand up to a powerful person who refuses to give you what you want. You might even feel attacked by someone who accuses you of using your vulnerability to get your way. It can be challenging to let down your guard and reveal your sensitivity; it's safer to keep your desires hidden. However, if you demonstrate your integrity without surrendering your privacy, you'll earn respect and admiration."
leo,2010-12-13,"You are so eager to work hard today that your peers will either follow your lead or just step out of your way. Even if others try to talk you into taking an easier path, you know where you're going and how you're getting there. Luckily, you can accomplish more than you realize now if you remain methodical in your approach."
virgo,2010-12-13,"The planetary line-up in your 5th House of Enjoyment might have you so obsessed with wanting to have fun today that you'll do anything to keep your social plans from falling apart. Remember, issuing heavy-handed commands is not the most effective management style. Instead, you can lead by example in your work ethic while also scheduling some personal playtime. Relaxing your hold on control makes this a more pleasant day for everyone."
libra,2010-12-13,"You may feel explosive today as intense desires continue to build until the pressure becomes unbearable. Although something has to happen, it may not be an eruption or a meltdown if you stay aware of your feelings throughout the day. Positive change is possible if you are willing to leave your familiar routines behind and jump into unknown territory."
scorpio,2010-12-13,"You are motivated into action now as your two key planets, Mars and Pluto, combine forces. It's not wise to be passive today, letting circumstances develop until you've lost control. Express what you want without issuing any ultimatums or placing expectations on others. Say what you mean and then let the situation develop on its own, without being too attached to the final outcome."
sagittarius,2010-12-13,"Everything in your life seems up for grabs, yet you cannot yet put your finger on where the current changes are taking you. Simultaneously, it may appear that your options are narrowing. Even if you are still committed to making something happen, don't act desperately. The current sense of urgency will fade and you'll have time to make your dreams come true."
capricorn,2010-12-13,"You are running short of patience now and may want to reduce your frustration by taking direct action. You're tired of waiting for everyone else to get going as assertive Mars joins potent Pluto in your 1st House of Personality. Be prepared to forge ahead on your own, if necessary, while also remembering the wisdom of self-restraint. This isn't a black-or-white issue, so consider all your options before resuming your drive to success."
aquarius,2010-12-13,"Bring unfinished projects to a conclusion in order to make room for new opportunities as a powerful triple conjunction focuses energy in your 12th House of Endings. It will be difficult to begin your next phase if you are carrying the weight of old baggage. Don't waste time worrying about what's around the corner. Instead, lighten your load to prepare for the challenges of the future."
pisces,2010-12-13,"A complicated emotional issue that's been brewing within a group of your friends needs to be brought out into the open today. The expression of hidden emotions is a good first step in a necessary process, even if the revealed information isn't pretty. But rather than fearfully withdrawing, be open to the rainbow of possibilities that might be out there beyond your current trials and tribulations."
aries,2010-12-14,"You may claim that you're willing to go deep as you reveal your feelings to someone you trust, but it's challenging to remain open. The Moon's return to courageous Aries can take you to the edge, but you'll need to push past your own resistance if you want to make real change. Don't gloss over your fear of emotional conflict. Instead, step into the unknown because that's where the magic is hiding."
taurus,2010-12-14,"There's no need to avoid a passionate person who plays an important role in your day. Even if your first impulse is to retreat, running away from an apparently unsolvable difference of opinions won't solve anything. Although you typically enjoy simple pleasures, you have an opportunity to deepen a relationship that can broaden your perspective and teach you something you need to know. Your persistence can turn a difficult situation into a positive experience."
gemini,2010-12-14,"Your current restlessness isn't about being bored; it's about wanting to escape from an uncomfortable emotional drama that has hijacked your day. However, avoiding the truth will only increase your anxiety as you realize that your feelings don't disappear just because you choose to sidestep the issue. Although resolution won't likely be immediate, today's stressful situation will pass faster if you share what's on your mind."
cancer,2010-12-14,"Your need to spontaneously express your creativity today runs up against the judgment of others. Still, it's better now to take a risk and do what feels right instead of trying not to rock the boat by adopting a conservative approach. Although a light touch of self-restraint may be enough to grease your path with good intentions, don't sell yourself short. If you succumb to fear, it can prevent you from doing what matters most. Claim your power with confidence."
leo,2010-12-14,"Your co-workers might believe that they know you, but your no-nonsense attitude may be hiding the depth of your feelings today. It's not that you're trying to mislead anyone; it's just that you don't think it's wise to reveal anything that increases your vulnerability now. Remember, you are not obliged to say more than is comfortable; it's yours to decide how much of your inner process you wish to share."
virgo,2010-12-14,"A loved one may be eager to demonstrate his or her appreciation for your loyalty today, but you won't gain any points by logically calculating your actions based upon your desired outcome. Your shortest path to increased intimacy now is trusting someone enough to be spontaneous. Instead of analyzing all your options and considering all the possible reactions, simply follow your heart."
libra,2010-12-14,"Other people are filled with surprises today, and someone's unexpected actions could stimulate a shift in your thinking. A change of perspective enables you to see the current events in a whole new light and come up with original ideas. But it may not be wise to express every opinion you have now. Do the smart thing and think twice before saying something that you wish you could take back."
scorpio,2010-12-14,"The pioneering Aries Moon enters your 6th House of Work today, encouraging you to add something new to your daily routine. However, it's easy to become so obsessed with wanting change that you forget about the good things in your life. Instead of impulsively turning your life upside down to free yourself from a rut, consider putting your current efforts toward improving what you already have."
sagittarius,2010-12-14,"Although you have inescapable responsibilities today, you are still willing to consider setting them aside in the name of fun or creativity. However, your reputation will suffer if you don't follow through on your promises. Fortunately, meeting your obligations doesn't mean that you need to shut off your inner world. You can keep up outward appearances while still fantasizing about more enjoyable activities."
capricorn,2010-12-14,"You can amaze others by your ability to stay on task today, even if your job does not live up to your ambitious expectations. However, your determination doesn't come from your current activities; it's based on your long-term goals. As long as you can hold on to your dreams, you'll be able to put up with nearly anything, especially if you are able to visualize how your current course will ultimately lead you to success."
aquarius,2010-12-14,"It's easy to give the impression that all is well because you are so busy that others only catch fleeting glimpses of you flitting from one thing to another. However, if you stand still long enough in any one place, your mask of satisfaction could quickly turn transparent, revealing a deeper malaise. Your inner peace isn't dependent on the happy face that you wear for everyone else's benefit. You'll feel better in the long run when you stop hiding your true feelings."
pisces,2010-12-14,"Your self-esteem is boosted and you are more able to believe that you have something special to offer others, as the Moon returns to your 2nd House of Assets. Unfortunately, your confidence can run into a wall if someone openly voices doubt about what you are doing. Instead of allowing yourself to get discouraged by harsh words, put valid criticism to use by applying it constructively in your life."
aries,2010-12-15,"Sometimes you can run into a wall, get up, brush yourself off, and continue in the same direction as if the obstacle had vanished. And sometimes a much-needed reality check stops you in your tracks. Your drive is strong, but you'll be healthier and happier if you slow down and enjoy yourself where you are, rather than being in a rush to get somewhere else."
taurus,2010-12-15,"You may have big ideas about sharing your feelings and deepening a casual relationship today, but someone's cold shoulder causes you to change your mind at the last minute. Cooling your heels might be a good idea, at least for a while. Once you've considered the best way to say what's on your mind, proceed with more caution than you had at first."
gemini,2010-12-15,"Your social expectations may be rather inflated today, which could lead to being let down by your friends. The problem is that there's so much going on now that it's easy to get excited about all the possibilities. But you'll be happier in the long run if you can keep your fantasies to a minimum and appreciate your current circumstances instead. Changing your attitude enables you to make the most of what you already have."
cancer,2010-12-15,"You can work yourself up into a state of anxiety today because you have something important to say, yet fear being rejected. You'd rather keep your feelings to yourself than suffer the embarrassment of overstepping someone's boundaries. Unfortunately, developing a relationship, even with a co-worker, may require you to take a risk. Acknowledging your vulnerability is a good first step to a meaningful conversation."
leo,2010-12-15,"Lots of big ideas are floating around in your mind today, yet it might be too soon to let others in on your thought process. There are options to be considered and plenty of work still to be done. Although you may feel a strong sense of urgency to push ahead now, it's wiser to continue the development of your plans and wait to take action until all the details are in place."
virgo,2010-12-15,"Your feelings today are complicated by someone else's assumptions or limitations. You may be willing to push ahead with a project or deepen a relationship, yet it takes two to tango. Be careful; don't fall into the trap of believing that your words or actions will persuade another person to move forward. It's one thing to express yourself honestly, but it's something entirely different if you're doing it to elicit a desired response."
libra,2010-12-15,"It's hard to know what to expect from people now because they don't appear to be playing by the rules. You may grow tired of trying to anticipate the reactions of friends or co-workers, which prompts you to retreat and limit your communication to the essentials. Unfortunately, your self-restraint can send the wrong message, making others feel as if you are rejecting them. This tension will dissipate naturally, so don't turn it into something bigger than it actually is."
scorpio,2010-12-15,"You could be your own biggest enemy today if you let self-doubt overtake your willingness to just jump in and do a job that you haven't done before. There isn't necessarily anything you can do to better prepare yourself for what's next. Don't waste energy trying to talk yourself out of giving it your best effort; instead, push ahead as methodically as you can without unrealistic expectations or preconceived limitations."
sagittarius,2010-12-15,"It doesn't really matter if you are running behind on a job; everything seems to be taking longer now than you originally planned. But don't let discouragement slow you down even more, because the next several days can be productive enough for you to make up some lost ground. Rather than worrying about what you didn't do or making empty promises about what's ahead, focusing on the present moment will increase your efficiency today."
capricorn,2010-12-15,"Your resistance to distractions may soften today as you grow increasingly bored with your current work. Although you have the ability to exert willpower, your self-discipline is waning, especially if your friends lure you with temptations of fun. There's nothing wrong with allowing yourself some time to play as long as you don't avoid your responsibilities in the process."
aquarius,2010-12-15,"Turning down an opportunity or saying no to an invitation may be a wise thing to do because it's all too easy to scatter your energy today. If you don't stay focused, you'll end up working too hard with little to show for your effort. Instead of making choices by evaluating all the options and imagining the best possible outcome at every turn, follow your intuition now. Your first hunch is probably your best bet."
pisces,2010-12-15,"Although your friends and workmates may be a great source of guidance now, the financial decisions you must make are yours alone. However, it's easy for you to get distracted by a temporary feel-good solution, rather than handling the underlying issue. Don't fall for the smoke and mirrors illusion; making a tough choice today can prevent a more serious headache down the road."
aries,2010-12-16,"You may be rudely disappointed if you believe that your positive attitude will be enough to get you through a difficult situation now. Obviously, self-confidence is better than self-doubt, but if you are overly sure of yourself, you might forego the very preparations that could make you successful today. Don't assume that everything will just turn out fine unless you are ready to do the heavy lifting that's required."
taurus,2010-12-16,"You may be stretched rather thin today, especially if you promised too much in order to please someone special. Although you don't want to let anyone down, you'll have to face the music sooner or later -- and it's wiser to do it right away. Luckily, the Moon's return to your sign midday works in your favor, facilitating smooth communication and enabling you to accomplish more than you expect. Don't be a quitter; your determination and persistence will pay off."
gemini,2010-12-16,"A friend or colleague may bring you good news, along with an exciting opportunity. Nevertheless, you should be extra cautious today, even if you feel as if your lucky star is shining down on you. Fortunately, the potential is very good for something you start now, but it's also easy for something to look better than it actually is. Remember, there isn't much to fear now, except your ability to gloss over important details."
cancer,2010-12-16,"Although you may not be able to stay focused today, you should be able to get by if you remember to be practical every time you need to make a choice. Your tendency now is to turn molehills into mountains and to believe that a mediocre idea is worth a million dollars. Don't get distracted by illusions of grandeur; instead of spending your time planning world domination, keep your feet on the ground and make sure to meet all of your obligations."
leo,2010-12-16,"There's no stopping you today, especially if things start to go your way early in the day. But you are courting trouble if you think that everything will just continue to get better on its own. It's wonderful for you to enjoy the company of others and to feel good about your life as long as you don't try to escape from your obligations. Maintaining your regular routine is more than an act of going through the motions; it's how you build the foundation of your day."
virgo,2010-12-16,"You may feel a bit uncomfortable today if everything appears to be flowing along easily, because you don't trust the current wave of optimism. You are worried that you're missing something important, and this is a likely possibility. A little self-restraint early in the day could bring a more solid boost later -- one you can truly rely on. Remember, controlled growth assures sustainable stability."
libra,2010-12-16,"You could mix up quantity and quality today, so be careful to remember that more of something isn't always better. You probably don't need that second helping of food, extra cookie or additional drink. Having one really good idea is more useful than having lots of mediocre ones. Being aware of what you really need can help you stay on track. On the other hand, overindulging can lead to non-productivity and even unpleasant physical symptoms."
scorpio,2010-12-16,"It may be time for you to go out and buy something for yourself that will bring you pleasure. Although you may be tempted to spend more than you should, the price of your purchase now is not as important as what you acquire. Remember, this isn't about making an astute investment or a smart deal. It's simply about honoring your inner child with a fun toy or a beautiful gift. Fortunately, a little self-indulgence doesn't have to break the bank."
sagittarius,2010-12-16,"The glorious Sun is shining in your inspirational sign, and its dynamic square to your ruling planet Jupiter turns both sides of the street into the sunny side. The good news is that everything seems better now; the bad news is that you can easily be misled by your own optimism. Making time to consider what could go wrong is not the same as being negative; it's being realistic. Acknowledging the truth can prevent problems down the road."
capricorn,2010-12-16,"It may be challenging for you to keep your feelings to yourself because you don't want to be the one to spoil the fun. However, other people just don't seem to see the whole picture today. They are lost in their bubbles of optimism and believe that everything will somehow solve itself. You, on the other hand, are practical enough to understand what's happening. Wait until the afternoon to share your perspective, for your words will have more power later in the day."
aquarius,2010-12-16,"You are likely to enjoy a busy day that is filled with fun distractions, chatty friends and new ideas. However, the good times could get out of hand and you might wish that there wasn't so much happening. Instead of trying to limit your activities, just go along with the flow as best you can, for the tide should shift this afternoon and your life will return to a more manageable pace."
pisces,2010-12-16,"You may be placing too many unrealistic expectations on your job today. Even if you are receiving some recognition for your accomplishments, it's not wise to think that this trend will continue unabated. Instead of trying to please everyone by taking on more work than you can deliver, setting boundaries will help you be more effective. It's better to demonstrate excellence at one or two things than mediocrity at many."
aries,2010-12-17,"Once you slow down today, you'll probably realize how tired you are from running around in circles. But if you're feeling depleted now, don't try to avoid the truth. Instead of continuing to push yourself harder when you feel like resting, listen to your body. Fortunately, you'll likely enjoy yourself even more once you acknowledge that productivity isn't the most important thing."
taurus,2010-12-17,"Although the Moon's return to your sign amplifies your desires to get your own way, you might not be as willing to fight for what you want now. You may realize that you've been applying yourself extra hard yet you don't necessarily have a lot to show for your work. It's counterintuitive, but giving up could make more sense than continuing a hopeless battle. But your anger or resentment still can stand in your way unless you're willing to forgive and move on."
gemini,2010-12-17,"You may owe someone an apology now or still have some unfulfilled promises to deliver. Your good intentions may have slid off the track due to uncontrollable circumstances. Fortunately, a hectic phase appears to be coming to an end, but the calmer energies may only be temporary. Retreat and spend whatever time is necessary to review your current direction and reassess your relationship goals before making any more plans."
cancer,2010-12-17,"You are a very sensitive person, but your empathy doesn't have to get in your way now as long as you're able to manage your emotions. Although you may pretend that you're not interested in sharing your feelings, it's almost too easy to wear them on your sleeve for all to see. However, you're able to be moody even if you're in denial. Hiding the truth from yourself is not a path to happiness. Stay aware of what's happening and keep communication channels open."
leo,2010-12-17,"Your daydreams are subtle today, yet they may seem more colorful and vibrant if you share them with someone else. Meanwhile, you may give up too easily now because your ideal scenarios seem just beyond your reach, leading to increased frustration. Keep in mind that you feed your own anxieties by creating unrealistic expectations. Stay focused on your vision, even when progress is slow."
virgo,2010-12-17,You may lose your motivation today if your work has become too routine. The problem is exacerbated by your overactive imagination that makes it nearly impossible to concentrate on the necessary details. Showing your vulnerability can help. If you pretend that you have everything all together then others won't be able to step in and offer assistance.
libra,2010-12-17,"You want others to lean on you today because you feel confident that you can offer the necessary support. However, it may be useful to establish clear boundaries so you don't lose yourself in the service of others when you should really be taking care of your own responsibilities. Your compassion is admirable, but leave yourself enough time to nurture yourself. Developing your independence will, in the long run, help those close to you, too."
scorpio,2010-12-17,"The Moon in your 7th House of Relationships today can create situations that quickly reflect your feelings back to you. Unfortunately, it's so easy to identify with others that you might forget that the emotions are ultimately yours, even if they seem as if they are external. Instead of seeing encounters as you-versus-them, remember that the current boundary between you and others is an illusion. Once you are able to see yourself on both sides of a discussion, it will be easier to find common ground."
sagittarius,2010-12-17,"It's time to reevaluate your priorities at work, for today's practical Taurus Moon is visiting your 6th House of Daily Routine. You may need to set aside big plans so you can take care of what's on your plate right now. Even if you are able to use your common sense efficiently, it's not wise to ignore your fantasies, too. It's your dreams that motivate you to aim beyond today's list of things to do."
capricorn,2010-12-17,"Your friends may appear needy today, but you won't likely lose your patience even if their dependency makes you feel uncomfortable. It may be wise to acknowledge your uneasiness with tender feelings in a more formal work environment so you don't seem overly aloof. You can be very effective at easing tensions if you are courageous enough to bring your natural resistance out into the open and let it go."
aquarius,2010-12-17,"You may become anxious with the Moon in your 4th House of Home and Family, for the presence of unresolved feelings clashes with your more intellectual style. Instead of approaching every interaction in a rational manner today, you're better off to set logic aside and let your intuition be your guide. Don't bother explaining or justifying your decisions; your current practice is to follow your dreams. You can always moderate your approach later on if you believe that you've gone too far."
pisces,2010-12-17,"You are able to express yourself in a very practical manner today without wasting a lot of words. Luckily, you can handle many activities at once without necessarily appearing overly busy or too stressed out. Nevertheless, caution is advised; don't try to sustain your current pace too long or it will begin to wear you down."
aries,2010-12-18,"It's challenging to keep everything running smoothly today, and it may be smart to consider what would happen if you let go of your control. Although you might have to sacrifice some comfort, your newfound freedom could help you recapture your lost enthusiasm. But this isn't about any one single event. Balancing your desire for independence with the practical necessity of fulfilling your obligations is an ongoing process that now reaches a crescendo."
taurus,2010-12-18,"A stream of disruptions makes it hard for you to stay on track today. While the sensual Taurus Moon reminds you how much you miss more peaceful times, you are also eager to enjoy the current excitement. It's healthy to express your feelings, even if they're in flux. Instead of trying to achieve stability, observe your ever-shifting moods. Your life may not be as secure as you want, but you're probably making more progress than you currently realize."
gemini,2010-12-18,You aren't eager to share your concerns with others today because your friends think that you're the one who always enjoys change. But you may feel so unsure of yourself now that you believe it's smarter to keep your insecurities hidden. It's not your responsibility to live up to anyone else's expectations. Be yourself and speak from your heart.
cancer,2010-12-18,"You may be anxious today because of the intense feelings in the air. You could become painfully aware that your plans will need to undergo a substantial revision to adapt to the unfolding circumstances. However, making minor modifications might be more difficult than throwing out your previous ideas and starting over from scratch. Paradoxically, a radical strategy is the most reliable way to reach your goals."
leo,2010-12-18,"Even if you were certain about your new direction, you might discover today that your heart is not leading you where you thought. It's a bit overwhelming if you're caught off guard by an emotional curve ball, especially if it reveals that you're not in charge of your feelings. Your desires can take you on a wild ride that may be very exhilarating if you don't attempt to make any sudden moves while everything is still moving."
virgo,2010-12-18,You long for a resting place to catch your breath as inevitable changes increasingly infringe on the status quo. You might try letting down your guard today only to be surprised when someone does something totally unexpected that prompts you to question your assumptions and your conclusions. Be smart and don't let yourself get attached to your expectations. Your best strategy is to roll with the waves of change until they settle back down.
libra,2010-12-18,"You may be particularly eager to help someone today because you have a special skill that could be of immediate assistance. Unfortunately, others might not be as excited with your potential involvement. Don't waste your energy trying to comprehend what makes anyone else tick now. Instead of taking rejection personally, get busy with your own agenda; you have a lot to do and it makes sense to start sooner than later."
scorpio,2010-12-18,"You may try to keep your heart and mind open to the tumultuous changes that are happening now, but they aren't necessarily following your previous expectations. Today might seem like a test, especially if you've lost control of something that you struggled to master. Try stepping back from the issue to get a new perspective. Lessening the pressure might be the key that helps everyone breathe easier while you strategize your next move."
sagittarius,2010-12-18,"Life is full of surprising turns and unexpected twists of fate now that the adventurous Sagittarius Sun squares wild and crazy Uranus. Sparks are flying as pent-up tension is released, yet you feel more excited than worried. Although you are known for your integrity, it's even more critical to keep all communication as honest as possible. You cannot get away with any deviation from the facts today, so commit to speaking the truth and walking your talk."
capricorn,2010-12-18,"It's tempting for you to exert more control today because it seems easier than usual to get your way. Unfortunately, exercising too much rigidity will attract disruption from external sources, to teach you the value of being flexible. The more you attempt to hold onto the status quo, the more shocking an unexpected event can be now. Fortunately, you can minimize your surprise by proactively shaking up your routine, instead of waiting for something big to happen."
aquarius,2010-12-18,"Your erratic planet ruler, Uranus, crosses paths with the will of the Sun and the love of Venus today, increasing the instability factor in your personal life. Your relationships with your friends are likely to be affected, especially if you don't want to go along with their current plans. But from their perspective, you are the one being disruptive, even if the opposite seems true to you. Whatever the differences of opinion may be now, it's best to bring them out in the open. Thankfully, there's more time than you think, so don't try to force a final decision yet."
pisces,2010-12-18,"Your role within the community or family may be shifting, even if you thought that everything was stable. There's no need to resist the current changes because they'll ultimately bring you closer to the freedom that you've been seeking. Trying to hold on to your current position will only make the process harder for all involved. Reclaiming your individuality is wise, even if it means letting go of old expectations."
aries,2010-12-19,"You may think that you will be able to hold back your emotions today if that will help you get what you want. Although this strategy might help you reach your goals, you'll still be tempted to speak your mind anyway. Unfortunately, trying to hide your feelings won't make them go away. Fortunately, you can express your negativity in a more positive manner with a little forethought and consideration."
taurus,2010-12-19,"You are more comfortable when your feelings are consistent because you want to build your actions on solid emotional ground. Unfortunately, your moods can go through wide swings today as you continue to gather more information about a complicated situation. Don't be stubborn and hold on to an unproductive position now. Keep in mind that your point of view will continue to shift, so try not to make any long-lasting decisions until you must."
gemini,2010-12-19,"The Moon's return to your airy sign blows your emotions first one way and then another. Although it can be fun to fly your thoughts as if they really had wings, you're not able to foresee a sudden shift that can cause a great idea to come crashing down to the ground. Enjoy thinking about all the possibilities but avoid tying your success to any one flight of fancy until you have had additional time to think."
cancer,2010-12-19,"You can tell that one cycle is ending, yet you still might want to sustain it longer than is necessary. Letting go of your attachment to a concrete plan or a passing desire isn't a sign of failure, but a chance to allow new energy to enter your life. You cannot change your own mind if you are stressed out by your struggle to maintain an old point of view that is no longer working for you. An attitude adjustment may be all that is needed to enable you to imagine the opportunities ahead."
leo,2010-12-19,"Try not to hold on to your discouragement if someone lets you down today. It's smart to face any disappointments and then move on. You may have to think quickly to cover for a colleague's mistake, but it's wiser to do whatever you can to make it right, instead of blaming anyone else. Don't let your attention wander now because your focused intensity enables you to react to what's happening in the present moment without selling yourself short."
virgo,2010-12-19,"A diverse range of facts can be a bit overwhelming today, especially if some of the data contradicts other information. You may be compelled to sort through the noise in your search for truth as you look at the current pile of new information. Just when you think you have a routine that works, something else happens to suggest you got it wrong. But don't give up, even if you are frustrated, for your persistence can make all the difference in the world."
libra,2010-12-19,"You may be quite accomplished with balancing yourself on a metaphorical tightrope, but the level of difficulty is about to increase. Be careful, for the intellectual tug-of-war may have you relying on too many details one minute and too much fantasy the next. You're leaning toward trusting your intuition, but finding a middle ground can be trickier than you think. Be patient; there could be a substantial breakthrough later tonight or tomorrow."
scorpio,2010-12-19,"Playing your role in complex group dynamics may not be so easy now because you could feel like an outsider. Perhaps you imagine that others aren't being receptive to your ideas, yet you might be playing a significant role in their resistance. Don't be hard on yourself if you are unable to complete a task in the manner you prefer; you're better today with words than with actions. Avoid playing defense by making clear points as soon as you can."
sagittarius,2010-12-19,"You may get stuck on an idea that isn't worth your extra effort today. If someone with authority claims that your assumptions or conclusions aren't clear, don't just slip away to play a more adversarial role. Instead, listen to what you are being told and use the new information to fortify your plan and improve your game. Showing that you're willing to be part of the team is more important than shining on your own."
capricorn,2010-12-19,"You must handle an unexpected change of plans, and your ability to respond compassionately to the situation makes the difference between failure and success. But if you think that someone is messing with your plans, keep in mind that it's not likely intentional. Just remember that a trivial issue is probably the reflection of the bigger dilemma that's still in front of you. Nevertheless, start with the small stuff and work your way up to the bigger problems."
aquarius,2010-12-19,"You want everyone to see that you have everything under control and that you're fully capable of handling nearly anything that comes at you now. But it's not wise to get overconfident, for your cockiness could attract a whole new set of different problems. It's best to look to the future with cautious optimism. Meanwhile, be ready to shift gears as the conditions of the road continue to change."
pisces,2010-12-19,"Inflated expectations can inspire you to greater heights today, but they can also create discouragement if you set the bar too high. Being more realistic will help because you cannot rely on others to be completely honest. Your friends and family are supportive and tell you what you want to hear, however, they may be more bark than bite. No one is purposefully trying to mislead you; however, your current lesson is about developing self-reliance."
aries,2010-12-20,"Sharing some of the details of your busy schedule may be necessary to keep things running smoothly, but you don't need to overexplain yourself today. Your ongoing analysis may be important to you, but it's just noise to everyone else. Strive for efficiency instead of launching into never-ending discussions about why you should do one thing or another."
taurus,2010-12-20,"You are ready for things to settle down, but you might not see much relief for a few days yet. It's easy to blame the hectic pace on the time of year, but it's really more about the breakneck speed at which your mind is operating. Unfortunately, it may be challenging to connect your thoughts to what's happening around you, making you feel a bit isolated. Don't try too hard to fit in; the energy will begin to shift by tomorrow."
gemini,2010-12-20,"Your key planet Mercury may be wreaking havoc on your life today, but it probably feels worse than it actually is. In fact, if you experience a breakdown in communication or if your plans fall apart, it's likely that something better will come of it. Don't hold on to your previous expectations. Open your mind and let the unfolding changes show you what's ahead."
cancer,2010-12-20,"You may attempt to keep your opinions to yourself today, but something might slip off your tongue that you wouldn't normally say. Although this could create a problem in the present moment if your words upset a friend or co-worker, it may be useful in the long run to clear the air of unspoken feelings. Chances are that everyone will feel better once the previously hidden issues are finally out in the open."
leo,2010-12-20,"You have your own way to do things today and you may feel the urge to tell everyone to back off and leave you alone. It's not that you want to be isolated from others; it's just that you don't like anyone bossing you around and trying to make you do something that's not on your agenda. Keep in mind that your strength of conviction is a double-edged sword; it's admirable, but too much rigidity can stand between you and success."
virgo,2010-12-20,"You are drawn in two different directions today and may struggle to find middle ground. On one hand, your ruling planet Mercury is making mental connections and filling your head with one brilliant thought after another. But, on the other hand, Mercury's alignment with irrepressible Uranus can be overwhelming, making it hard for you to focus. Instead of trying to follow through on any one idea, just let them flow naturally. You can always come back to the best ones in a day or two to review their merits."
libra,2010-12-20,"It takes all your concentration to see both sides of an issue today. You're tired of being chosen to play the mediator role solely because of your gracious nature. Your opinions may be stronger than usual now, but you don't have to express your thoughts unless they add something constructive to the conversation. However, you're still likely to change your mind as the day progresses, making a wait-and-see strategy more sensible."
scorpio,2010-12-20,"You could mistake a clever idea for a deep thought today, but the two are very different. Mercury the Trickster might have you believing that a new idea is good enough to save the world or, at least, save yourself. But radical solutions that sound amazing may not survive the test of time, so cool your heels and see how your recent strategy holds up for a few days before selling it as the best thing ever."
sagittarius,2010-12-20,You may be annoyed that everyone seems to be moving so quickly today. It feels like you start a conversation with someone and the topic changes before you're finished with the previous one. But your attempts to control the energetic flow will only bring you more frustration. It's best to take your cues from external sources now and swim where the tides carry you.
capricorn,2010-12-20,"You can feel the momentum building, but your impatience could get the best of you today. Naturally, you don't want to miss your opportunity, but it may not be fading as quickly as it seems. In fact, using this time to get all the details of your plans in order is smarter than trying to execute the strategy right now. One of your greatest strengths is your patience, so keep reminding yourself that you don't have to be in a hurry."
aquarius,2010-12-20,"You may be enjoying the buzz today, but don't fall into the trap of tying your happiness to accomplishing your goals. Rather than showing others what you can accomplish now, save the production for another day. Instead, enjoy the freedom that the unsettled energy brings and give yourself permission to be creative for no other reason than how good it makes you feel."
pisces,2010-12-20,"You may have too much to do at home today, but you'll need to set all that aside so you can meet your obligations in the outer world. However, you may find it difficult to concentrate at work because you're unable to take your mind off personal matters. You could work yourself into a frustrating state of mind unless you consciously decide to leave things unresolved until you have the time to attend to them with the full commitment that they deserve."
aries,2010-12-21,"The Full Moon Eclipse in your 3rd House of Communication indicates that you should be prepared to reconsider your assumptions. You normally like to swing into action before you think about the consequences. Now, however, those close to you may have a different way of seeing things, which could complicate matters. Be ready to change your schedule on a moment's notice today because resistance to others' demands is futile."
taurus,2010-12-21,"You may experience a wave of self-doubt as the Full Moon is eclipsed in your 2nd House of Self-Worth today, which could lead you to try retail therapy to overcome the blues. Unfortunately, spending money you don't really have on something you don't really need won't be helpful in the long run. Instead of distracting yourself from the truth, empower yourself by facing your fears directly."
gemini,2010-12-21,"The Full Moon Eclipse in your clever sign could be a catalyst that initiates a powerful emotional transformation. But don't worry if you cannot see far enough into the future to reassure yourself that all will turn out well. Currently, the outcome is less important than being fully present here and now. Practice being vulnerable without overanalyzing your experience."
cancer,2010-12-21,"You may be feeling a bit paranoid today, especially if you have been put in charge of an important project or task. Unfortunately, the Lunar Eclipse in your 12th House of Karma can awaken your negativity or even stir someone's suspicions about you. Don't assume that the cards are being stacked against you just because of your own fears. Laying low until the weirdness passes over is a smart strategy at this time."
leo,2010-12-21,"You cannot count on the support of your peers now as the Full Moon Eclipse rattles your 11th House of Friends. Fortunately, your expectations are changing quickly. Although you still may feel just as disconnected from your regular social or work group later in the day, you'll be more willing to take the next step on your own without blaming those who let you down. Ultimately, others will admire your independence and courage."
virgo,2010-12-21,"The Lunar Eclipse activates your 10th House of Status, emphasizing the important role that you're being called on to play at this time. Your life may feel fated now, as if something very significant is happening. Your fame and fortune could undergo a sudden change, but your ultimate success depends more on how you handle a tricky situation than what actually occurs."
libra,2010-12-21,"You could learn something today that challenges an assumption so basic that it's exhausting to rethink the solution. But the Full Moon Eclipse falls in your 9th House of Big Ideas, highlighting the fragility of your overambitious plans. Don't get lured into thinking that more is really better. Focus your mind and simplify your actions by choice, rather than waiting for reality to do it for you."
scorpio,2010-12-21,"A whimsical Gemini Lunar Eclipse highlights your 8th House of Deep Sharing today, encouraging you to lighten your attitude about a relationship issue. Even if you are clear about what you want, you may not have the patience to engage the emotional intensity required to reach your goals. You might choose to retreat a bit, but you don't need to spend time rationalizing your decision. Too many words, spoken or not, are unnecessary obstacles between you and your dreams."
sagittarius,2010-12-21,"Today's Lunar Eclipse shakes up your 7th House of Relationships, but this can just as likely rejuvenate an ailing partnership as create a new one. It may seem as if your friends or partners aren't very trustworthy now because they keep changing their minds. Thankfully, there's no reason to lean too heavily on anyone else. Seek stability and strength from within."
capricorn,2010-12-21,"If you have fallen into a rut, today's Lunar Eclipse can mix things up as it rattles your 6th House of Daily Routine. Nevertheless, it's important for you to maintain a consistent workflow, instead of trying to overcompensate for a task that should have already been finished. A last minute push won't help; instead, establish a pace that you can sustain. Your persistence and patience could be rewarded as early as tomorrow."
aquarius,2010-12-21,"Your resistance to making a significant commitment could disappoint someone who is expecting more from you than you can give now. You have your own agenda and you don't want to rush into anything else too quickly. Although today's Lunar Eclipse in your 5th House of Self-Expression reflects your need to share your ideas with others, they may not agree with your creative perspective. Don't try to convince anyone that you are right; just let them know what you're feeling without seeking approval."
pisces,2010-12-21,"Hiding your feelings is not a healthy long-term strategy, but today may unfold smoother if you can bite your tongue for now. Although you may need to keep your guard up to prevent from slipping and saying something you'll regret, remaining quiet still may be the best thing to do. One lesson you can learn from this Lunar Eclipse in your 4th House of Home and Family is that you don't need to disclose your personal business to others unless it directly concerns them."
aries,2010-12-22,"You might think that you're ready for action, but pushing forward may not be the best idea today. Rather than rushing into the next project or activity, give yourself some time to assimilate what's happened over the past couple of days. Even if you want others to see how responsible you are, charging ahead isn't wise. Paradoxically, you can make more progress now by slowing down and doing less."
taurus,2010-12-22,"You could be so sensitive to what others say now that a close friend might rub you the wrong way with a casual remark. Although the comments might actually be directed toward someone else, it still feels as if you're the one being criticized. Overpersonalizing what you hear leads to a misinterpretation of the facts. You can avoid problems by taking a more laid-back approach to interpersonal communication today."
gemini,2010-12-22,"Although yesterday's eclipse was in your sign, today's Cancer Moon sustains your state of heightened emotions. You may feel relieved as your extreme mood swings begin to settle down. Thankfully, you are now able to pull your concentration in toward your center, instead of scattering your energy. If someone needs a bit of special nurturing, step up to the plate and demonstrate your ability to be there for those you love."
cancer,2010-12-22,"The emotional Cancer Moon is at her height of power, so today's events may stir up memories from your childhood that evoke strong feelings. You could get nostalgic at first, but your longing transforms into much-needed clarity about a present issue. Nevertheless, it's dangerous to assume that your processing is finished, for your moods may continue shifting until tomorrow."
leo,2010-12-22,The tenacious Cancer Moon in your 12th House of Secrets indicates that your imagination is more active today than is apparent to others. Hiding your emotions gives you enough space and time to consider your reactions without feeling like you must meet someone's expectations. It's not necessary to share everything you're thinking until you are ready to deal with the consequences of what you say.
virgo,2010-12-22,"You may overanalyze everything you want to say today because you are very concerned about what your friends might think. You believe it's safer to be discreet than to agitate others with something they don't really need to know. Nevertheless, a conversation could lead you to disclose more than you intend. If so, remember that it's better to be honest than to cover your tracks with half-truths and innuendos."
libra,2010-12-22,"You may have mixed feelings about helping someone less fortunate than you are. You might resist at first, relying on logic to offer reasons why you cannot jump in as requested. Maintaining a sense of humor can be crucial to your delivering what is needed now, for a good laugh enables you to dissipate the tension while also doing the right thing. Thankfully, you're able to follow through with useful assistance in the nick of time."
scorpio,2010-12-22,"You may be feeling uncertain about an upcoming business trip or vacation as the tentative Cancer Moon visits your 9th House of Travel. You might try to gloss over important details because you don't want to cancel a fun adventure. It's challenging now to keep everything in a clear perspective so you don't end up somewhere lost and far from home. Go ahead and continue making your plans, but scale back your expectations to be on the safe side."
sagittarius,2010-12-22,"The needy Cancer Moon can be unsettling for you today as her visit to your 8th House of Deep Sharing stirs your passions. The problem is that you might not have a healthy outlet for expressing the intensity. Patience doesn't come easily now, making it tough to slow down enough to see where your feelings take you. However, if you try to ignore your emotions, they'll just resurface later and be even more difficult to handle the next time around."
capricorn,2010-12-22,"You may not be able to avoid a friend or acquaintance that asks you for help in solving an emotional problem today, even if you would prefer to sidestep this complex situation. But your assumption that you need to fix anything is not necessarily true. Instead of taking over, encourage him or her to talk and then show your support just by listening. You don't have to do anything except receive what's being said with an open mind and heart."
aquarius,2010-12-22,"This will be a busy day with the Moon moving through your 6th House of Work. Although you might wish you could take the day off or even lose yourself in a movie or a book, there's just too much to do. Unfortunately, your responsibilities may restrict your freedom and stand in the way of your happiness. Don't fight the unavoidable; show up and do what's required. Thankfully, you should be able to find some time later in the evening for a well-earned escape."
pisces,2010-12-22,You may be willing to wait patiently today for something you want because you believe that you'll have a better chance of being satisfied once you see the whole picture. But this isn't about denying your desire for pleasure; it's more to do with realizing your dream. Impulsively taking action will probably create more problems than good times. Being cautious is wise as long as you don't miss your opportunity in the process.
aries,2010-12-23,"Your confidence is on the rise today and could even create problems if you don't take the time to listen to what others are saying. It's tempting to ignore an important piece of information now, which can come back to haunt you later, costing you time and money. Unfortunately, someone may unintentionally give you incorrect data because Mercury is still retrograde. Keep in mind that it's wise to check everything you hear twice."
taurus,2010-12-23,"The pace of your life is speeding up, but it seems as if you are slowing down. It's difficult to keep up with all that you should be doing now and you can exhaust yourself by trying to finish everything that you start. Although you may want others to appreciate your reliability, it's still important to take your time and produce quality work. Focusing on excellence will impress others more than hurrying through your tasks just to get them done."
gemini,2010-12-23,"Your life may be deliciously complex today as the Moon visits your 3rd House of Communication, turning up the volume on your conversations and interactions with others. But your ruling planet Mercury is retrograde in your 7th House of Relationships, adding to the confusion of a possible misinterpretation. Don't worry if you need to readdress a delicate issue; it's worth clearing up a misunderstanding before it causes any trouble."
cancer,2010-12-23,"You may be unusually stubborn if a co-worker suggests that you change your plans today. You'll dig your heels in even further if you have already taken the time to carefully consider your options. You want to do what makes the most sense, but you don't think that you should revise your agenda just to make others happy. Compromising is a necessary part of negotiation, but you don't have to sacrifice your values to reach a successful agreement."
leo,2010-12-23,"The Moon's return to Leo the Lion may bring out the lazy cat in you, but your responsibilities can be unyielding. Relaxing and having fun might be tempting, but you have more important things to do now. You have been itching to make something happen and this is a smart time to push ahead, as long as you don't become impatient. Positive change must be grounded by a strong foundation, so impulsive action is unwise. Build on what you already have instead of betting your success on the unknown."
virgo,2010-12-23,"You are torn between making a stand by presenting your ideas to others or withdrawing and keeping your point of view to yourself. You are feeling quite creative now, but you aren't sure if it's appropriate to express yourself. Fortunately, your imagination won't steer you wrong today, so trust your instincts. Taking a chance by putting yourself out there for others to see isn't quite as risky as you think."
libra,2010-12-23,"Seeking pleasure with your friends may sound like a great idea, but you could end up far from your goals if you don't take things more seriously. It's tempting to assume that everything is on track and will turn out as you wish, but you'll need to deliver on your promises to keep the day from spinning out of control. Reevaluate your recent commitments and renegotiate a course of action that won't require as much hard work on your part."
scorpio,2010-12-23,"You intuitively know what others need today, which can help you get a head start at work. There's no reason for you to patiently wait for the boss to assign you a new task if you already know what to do. Beginning your job earlier and being methodical in your approach can turn a hectic day into a pleasant one, while enabling you to accomplish more than you thought possible."
sagittarius,2010-12-23,"You are quite grounded today, yet the Moon's visit to your 9th House of Adventure can fill you with a touch of wanderlust. You know what you should be doing, but your restlessness won't go away. You're eager to go on a big trip, but this may not be a convenient time to travel. There's no hurry; solid preparation will pave the way to your next journey."
capricorn,2010-12-23,"Although the intensity seems to be dying down a bit, there's still a lot going on in your personal life. Thankfully, you're not as distracted today, making it easier to follow a clear path toward your goals. Visualize your destination, make a plan to reach it and then set out toward your target. Keep in mind that shortcuts won't help you get there any faster now, so prepare to take the more traditional route that consists of hard work and determination."
aquarius,2010-12-23,"You may strive to take a center-of-the-road position today because you don't want to create any trouble. You prefer having a position that is easily defensible, but everything you say now seems to provoke conflict, even if you're just trying to make your opinions known. Remember that your plan is merely one way to approach a situation, so grace others with respect, even if their conclusions are different from yours."
pisces,2010-12-23,"Although you are quite competent in how you analyze a project by separating it into manageable components, it's not necessary to make a big deal of what you are doing today. Fulfilling your commitments is important, but don't waste energy telling everyone how you developed your strategy. It's not important for others to know your inner process now; just focus on getting the job done."
aries,2010-12-24,"You may have such high expectations today that nothing totally satisfies you. Fortunately, your fate is in your own hands now, for you can change your mind about what you want. You don't have to settle for less if you reframe your understanding of what makes you happy. Gracing others with your open heart is more important than making sure that everything goes exactly as planned. Giving the gift of love will be sufficient now in most situations."
taurus,2010-12-24,"Putting on a fantastic performance for your family or friends may seem like a great way to kick off a holiday weekend. But you could create unnecessary waves by taking control and doing everything your way. Listening to others and considering their wishes can help, but probably won't be enough now. This doesn't have to be a one-person show. Instead, involving everyone in the planning process can create a magic beyond the reach of any individual."
gemini,2010-12-24,"You may be running around in preparation for a special gathering of friends or family, but you're also seeking a more meaningful approach to the holidays this year. You are usually the life of the party because of your light and easy approach to festivities; however, now you are searching for something more than bright lights and transient smiles. You can make this time different by slowing down and focusing more on the heart connections between people instead of only the amusing stories and witty repartee."
cancer,2010-12-24,"Spending a lot of money isn't the only way to express that you care, but the bold Leo Moon in your 2nd House of Money today might tempt you to go for a show of extravagance. If you want to be taken seriously now, don't be overly dramatic and do something that's too far out of line. Even if the bright lights draw an extra round of applause, acting thoughtfully will earn you the appreciation you desire."
leo,2010-12-24,"Your follow-through can be your saving grace today because big ideas about entertaining co-workers or celebrating with your family aren't enough unless you deliver something special. Planning in advance is even more important than usual, for there are too many variables to keep in order right now. Making lists is a smart idea, but only if you're willing to refer to them as you move through your day."
virgo,2010-12-24,"Your ability to downplay the end-of-year excitement can make others think your behavior is Scrooge-like today. But, upon closer examination, it's apparent that you're simply saving the best celebration for last. Instead of talking about your holiday surprises this year, let your actions speak for themselves. Opening up your heart makes it easier to demonstrate your affection."
libra,2010-12-24,"There's nothing more fun for you today than being with those you love. However, it may be challenging to reconcile your desire to maintain a sense of tradition while still being open to what others want to do. Although you might not be able to do both, there's no single correct path to take now. Being flexible enough to go along with the flow will probably make everyone feel more in the holiday spirit."
scorpio,2010-12-24,"There's little room for error today because the fixed Leo Moon in your 10th House of Responsibility gives you a very clear sense of what you need to do. There is a schedule of events and everyone is depending on you to stick to the plan. Even if you suddenly have a better idea, it's wiser now to just let it pass. Save your unconventional thoughts for another day when others will be more open to a radical point of view."
sagittarius,2010-12-24,"There are many ways to make the holidays a memorable experience for all, yet you'll need to fine-tune your options quickly. Fortunately, you can be an inspiration to your friends and family because your joyful attitude is contagious. Although you may be tempted to show your love with traditional gifts and lavish entertainment, you can have a more positive impact by spending less money on things and focusing more on establishing lasting emotional connections."
capricorn,2010-12-24,"You are the one that others are relying on now because of your innate ability to remain surefooted as you strive toward an ambitious goal. However, they may not be able to see how much this external pressure weighs on you. Instead of just burying your feelings, talk to someone you trust. Your anxiety will be easier to manage if you can get your concerns off your chest. Surrounding yourself with those who love you is the best way to enjoy yourself today."
aquarius,2010-12-24,"You may be experiencing a perplexing juxtaposition of conflicting desires today. The extroverted Leo Moon visiting your 7th House of Others reflects your need to be actively involved in relationships now. But several hardworking planets in Capricorn are traveling through your 12th House of Secrets, tempting you to stay out of sight. Although wanting to be seen and being invisible are mutually exclusive, you can still find ways to honor both extremes."
pisces,2010-12-24,"You don't mind jumping in and helping your workgroup, friends or family if you feel like you're a valuable member of a team. But if you're on the periphery of what's happening, you might not be as eager to contribute to the cause. Fortunately, others may go out of their way to include you today, making it more fun for you to participate. There's no reason to exclude yourself from the fun; enjoy the feeling of camaraderie that's all around you now."
aries,2010-12-25,"You may feel as if others are being critical of your behavior today, even if you're not doing anything differently. It could be that their pickiness seems unnecessary, but consider addressing their concerns before you just write them off as inconsequential. Look at this as an opportunity to improve your game rather than wasting energy by complaining about your raw deal. Fortunately, a simple adjustment in your attitude can turn an unpleasant situation into a joyful one."
taurus,2010-12-25,"You may be able to keep your focus now no matter how many distractions tempt you. But those same friends and family members who usually lure you away from your plans currently have enough happening to keep them busy. Relaxation should be on your schedule, but don't stay lazy all day. You can accomplish a lot at home by concentrating on specific tasks that are easy to complete. Tomorrow will be easier to handle if some chores are crossed off your list today."
gemini,2010-12-25,"You may attempt to make wise use of your time today, but everything seems to be conspiring against your agenda. Luckily, unexpected social situations can brighten your day, but you must be willing to drop your previous plans in favor of something new. But this isn't about completely abandoning your original ideas; it's about carefully analyzing all your options so you can make the best possible choices."
cancer,2010-12-25,"You are usually happiest when your ideas resonate with your emotions, even if you're feeling more serious than everyone else around you. The down-to-earth Virgo Moon is moving through your 3rd House of Communication, amplifying your confidence. But there's no hurry to do anything now; your current vision will still take a few days to solidify. Give yourself the gift of time and enjoy the magic of the holiday season to the fullest."
leo,2010-12-25,"The Moon's entry into your 2nd House of Material Possessions is a great time to take stock of what you already have acquired. But it's also an opportune moment to step back and reevaluate your beliefs. Instead of getting hung up in the world of things, shift your attention to the metaphysical and spiritual realms to round out your spectrum of experiences."
virgo,2010-12-25,"The Moon returns to your sign today, bringing a mixed bag of emotions along with it. You are reminded of everything you have to gain by maintaining integrity in your relationships and continuing on your path of self-improvement. But the Moon also emphasizes your subjective feelings, which can send you into a spiral of self-doubt as you second-guess a recent choice. Pay attention to both your heart and your head. Fortunately, good information, combined with awareness of your feelings, enables you to think clearly enough to make wise decisions."
libra,2010-12-25,"You can feel the intensity building and it would be smart to tie up as many loose ends as possible today. But this is not a good day to begin a project around the house, even if you have the time. It's a much better idea to focus on completing an unfinished task, instead. But you won't be satisfied with simply meeting your obligations. Although there can be a variety of paths to success, you will be happiest if yours also embraces elements of beauty and grace."
scorpio,2010-12-25,"The Moon's visit to your 11th House of Hopes, Dreams and Wishes can draw your thoughts toward the future. However, you cannot afford to forget where you are today and what is right in front of you. Find a way to balance your visions with mundane reality. Remember, you are on track if you can hold on to your fantasies, even when you are being practical in the real world."
sagittarius,2010-12-25,"You are usually comfortable with grandiose plans and big ideas, but today's detail-oriented Virgo Moon reminds you to narrow your vision, rather than to widen it. Nobody can do this for you; this new focus must originate from within. Every time you become conscious that you're longing for the distant horizon, bring your attention back to what's right in front of you. Staying in the present moment will enable you to experience the power of now."
capricorn,2010-12-25,"You may still be trying to shake the extra responsibilities that seem to gravitate toward you today. Although your cautious thinking leads you to make sound decisions, you deserve a temporary vacation from being in charge. Forget about the calculations and the analysis now; just open your heart and follow the path that leads to joy. Seeking spiritual answers, rather than chasing material distractions, can infuse your life with newfound meaning."
aquarius,2010-12-25,"You may grow uncomfortable if someone raises a sensitive issue that you cannot gracefully avoid today. Your repeated attempts to resist an emotional journey into an unfamiliar place can create more problems than just closing your eyes and diving in. Even if layers of complex feelings are challenging, take a deep breath and push ahead. You could emerge from a difficult encounter recharged with renewed vigor and an appreciation for the possibilities ahead."
pisces,2010-12-25,"The cool Virgo Moon's shift into your 7th House of Partnerships turns the focus away from you and toward those who are an important part of your world. But your friends and family may not be so quick to encourage your dreams now, and this can be upsetting to you. However, you cannot get away with blaming them for your discomfort. Try spending a bit of time by yourself today to nurture your inner process that still remains unacknowledged by others."
aries,2010-12-26,"You are highly motivated to set goals and figure out how to accomplish them today, without worrying about helping anyone else. You might mistakenly believe that the likelihood of your success could be jeopardized if others also have a chance of succeeding. But this comes from your outdated belief in a competitive model where there are winners and losers. The truth is that reaching your destination now won't get any easier if someone else fails."
taurus,2010-12-26,"Your need for adventure could become obsessive today as the Sun joins relentless Pluto in your 9th House of Big Ideas. No matter how much you try to relax, your current sense of urgency won't likely disappear. Instead of attempting to minimize your current wanderlust, consider ways to satisfy your needs without upsetting your life. Think about enrolling in a course of study to expand your mind, instead of distracting yourself with visions of exotic travel."
gemini,2010-12-26,"Stay away from discussions about risky financial investments today while the Sun-Pluto conjunction activates your 8th House of Shared Resources. You may think that you could come out on top if you take the time to do your research. Nevertheless, schemes that promise you a fast fortune should be avoided like the plague. Trying to improve your position through a smart investment sounds enticing, but greed will cost you more than you can imagine."
cancer,2010-12-26,"Today's magnetic Sun-Pluto conjunction may attract an intense person into your life, but he or she now plays the role of an important catalyst. Your friend or associate could reflect a portion of yourself that you don't necessarily want to acknowledge. Even if you believe that it's worth holding on to the status quo, dynamic changes are already afoot. Relinquish control and be ready to flow with the currents, wherever they may take you."
leo,2010-12-26,"You may try to start a new diet today while the rest of the world is indulging in holiday feasts. But you're not in your usual party spirit because you are strongly driven to clean up your act right now. It's not that you want to have any less fun; it's just that you know you need to improve your health and are currently motivated to do something constructive about it. Your goals are admirable, but don't forget to give yourself permission to enjoy the magic of the season."
virgo,2010-12-26,"Feelings of jealousy or envy can fuel an emotionally exhausting melodrama that has you playing a leading role. You are clear about what you want now and have a sensible plan to get it. But love doesn't always play by the rules, so parts of your well-constructed strategy might not work as well as you expect. Don't push to get something for nothing. Paradoxically, living in the present moment only works if you can also keep an eye toward the future."
libra,2010-12-26,"The intense Sun-Pluto conjunction in your 4th House of Home and Family may distract you from the important tasks at work today. However, you must manage the complexity of the situation to realize your fullest potential. Sidestepping an interpersonal issue isn't a viable choice because your frustration could precipitate an emotional meltdown. Bringing secrets out into the open could be just the preventative measure you need."
scorpio,2010-12-26,"You are accustomed to a higher level of intensity in your interpersonal communications, but sometimes you know that avoidance is a smarter strategy than direct confrontation. Unfortunately, you cannot dance around your wounded feelings today, even if you are not comfortable talking about them. Luckily, your prospects for real healing improve once your past hurts are carefully revealed to someone you trust."
sagittarius,2010-12-26,"You may become quite upset today if someone assumes that your possessions are meant to be shared. You might overreact and could even become hostile if what you own feels like an extension of your identity. But your current attachment to your toys is not very sensible. If you cannot share what you have now, then you probably shouldn't be playing with others."
capricorn,2010-12-26,"A volatile Sun-Pluto conjunction occurs in your First House of Self, gracing you with an apparently endless supply of energy. But your feeling of power is a double-edged sword today, for you may be driven by psychological forces you don't fully understand. One way of handling this intensity is to create a simple ritual to help channel your intentions in a positive manner. Writing down your goals and then stating them aloud helps you concentrate so you can fulfill your dreams."
aquarius,2010-12-26,"You may want to take care of someone else's needs today, but it's not a good idea now if you haven't been asked to help. An awkward situation can develop if you push your assistance where it's not wanted. If someone refuses your aid, simply be gracious and politely wish them well. But don't hang on to any feelings of rejection or your good intentions will quickly turn into resentment."
pisces,2010-12-26,"A disagreement with your friends or family members may lead to discouragement today as others seem to be especially hard on you. Group interactions have a high level of intensity as the Sun joins relentless Pluto in your 11th House of Friends. Don't focus all your feelings onto any one person; instead, disperse your current emotional charge over as many people as possible. Channeling your energy into positive action will help you more than you think."
aries,2010-12-27,"Having clarity about your relationship goals is a good thing, unless your needs are at odds with what is expected of you. It's challenging to find common ground in this particular conflict because your obligations can make it difficult to follow your heart. Don't give up by denying your feelings; you'll have more choices if you express your truth instead of trying to avoid it."
taurus,2010-12-27,"You may seem as if you are scattered as you go from one activity to another now, without necessarily finishing what you start. Your intent is to complete each job, but you're easily distracted by the intensity of others. Don't be so concerned about what you accomplish today. Getting a handle on your resistance to change could be more useful than demonstrating your ability to be productive."
gemini,2010-12-27,"You want to enjoy the rising energy of the day, but unexpected turbulence can make it difficult to surf the incoming waves. Instead of complaining about the rough waters, change your perspective and consider it as a way to bring more excitement into your life. It's not necessary to find lasting solutions to the problems that arise now. You're better off navigating your way through this temporary situation, instead of assuming that it's a permanent part of your life."
cancer,2010-12-27,"You may be fully focused on maintaining harmony in your relationships now. But even if you attempt to ignore your uncomfortable feelings, you won't be able to do so for long. Your eyes are wide open and once you see what is behind the flimsy curtain, you will surely want others to see it, too. But don't wait until a growing problem becomes too overwhelming to handle. Bring what you know out into the open as soon as you learn the truth."
leo,2010-12-27,"Playing someone else's game according to arbitrary rules was acceptable for a short while, but you cannot go on now without adding your opinion of the situation. Your workmates might expect you to continue what you've been doing in the same manner, but you are ready to clarify confusing boundaries to reestablish your authority. Overreacting isn't useful, but neither is remaining quiet. It's ultimately best to just let others know exactly what you are thinking."
virgo,2010-12-27,"It could take several days to reach satisfaction now, yet it still makes sense to stir up the energy to see where it goes. Conflicts that escalate today are symptoms of deeper material issues that are not yet resolved. You can probably talk yourself into believing anything that ends well, but be ready to readjust your thinking if a reality check points to a different conclusion."
libra,2010-12-27,"Your emotions are close to the surface today, yet it's challenging to turn each of them into decisive action. Your moods shift often now, and every thought you have brings up another feeling that is different from the last one. Someone may try to force you to make a choice, but it isn't necessary yet. Wait a few more days before deciding what to do."
scorpio,2010-12-27,"Floating downstream in the flow of your feelings could be idyllic today, but each time you start getting comfortable, crazy thoughts startle you awake from your reverie. As the day unfolds, you may grow increasingly aware that the real events in your daily life must take precedence over everything else. It isn't easy to land yourself back on solid earth, yet this is exactly what is currently needed."
sagittarius,2010-12-27,"You may truly believe your solution to a serious problem is a just one. However, it's not smart to move too quickly, for you might change your mind a few more times before you settle on one particular answer. Instead of rushing off impulsively, wait and see if you feel the same way later or if your final answer will be different from your current one. Be careful; your inflated sense of urgency could deceive you into acting impulsively."
capricorn,2010-12-27,"The sweet Libra Moon squares the Sun in your ambitious sign today, pitting your desire to please others against your drive to get ahead. It may be tough to fully grasp the fact that if you want to succeed now, you don't need to do it at someone else's expense. Pay attention to the feelings of those around you and make sure you consider their needs on your way to success."
aquarius,2010-12-27,"You could easily come across with more confidence than you actually feel as feisty Mars quintiles your key planet Uranus. Although you may be projecting your biases, you are ready to change your mind if you are offered the right supportive facts. But your bravado can be a deterrent if it scares others from sharing their radical ideas with you. Soften your aggressive stance to make room for a real and conscious dialogue."
pisces,2010-12-27,"A partnership that's been based upon equality can temporarily run into problems today, especially if someone tries to exert pressure on you. However, while you are sinking deeper into the relationship, your partner may be withdrawing. Unfortunately, this emotional disconnect can become frustrating unless you have the foresight to step back before making a long-term commitment. Fostering your independence now creates a happier future."
aries,2010-12-28,"Although you might not want to admit it, you don't always feel as good as you claim. But you cannot go on pretending forever; sooner or later you need to realize that you don't have to hide your true feelings. Sharing your fears with someone you trust today can open the way to profound conversations that deepen a friendship or improve your position at work. Stop resisting the positive changes that could occur once you acknowledge your vulnerability."
taurus,2010-12-28,"Your key planet Venus' presence in your 7th House of Others over the past few weeks may have brought you hope and increased your expectations in a romantic relationship. Now, however, it makes sense to reestablish more reasonable goals as your feelings grow stronger. If you don't own up to the truth, reality will do it for you. Inflated dreams all but assure failure, so clarify your view of the future while you still have time."
gemini,2010-12-28,"You may have a hard time sharing your feelings today, because you cannot figure out how to say what's in your heart without eliciting a negative response. Your message will probably be so on target that it can carry even more weight than you intend. Even if you have good intentions, you may lack the execution skills to get the delivery just right. Begin slowly and feel your way through the conversation, rather than blurting everything out in the first sentence."
cancer,2010-12-28,"Your sense of fair play may be rewarded today, but you'll have to wait longer than you think. Luckily, you Crabs have strong pincers and can be quite tenacious. Nevertheless, you will still need to muster up extra patience now. There's nothing wrong with knowing what you want as long as you aren't in a hurry. Stay on your present course of action and you'll likely see the results you want."
leo,2010-12-28,"Your creativity has been hampered by distracting circumstances, but your life is now ready to move forward again. You may feel the changes coming, but you'll still have to suppress the urge to try to do too much in the present moment. Don't waste your energy coming up with new material for your next project or presentation. Instead, revisit an old idea or retell a story that can help you process your feelings about the past."
virgo,2010-12-28,"You want to be clear when sharing your perspective, but you may be misunderstood today by someone who isn't really listening to what you say. Unfortunately, others might form an erroneous conclusion if they don't hear the facts as you report them. Nevertheless, don't let anyone else speak for you, because you're the only person who is capable of expressing your unique point of view."
libra,2010-12-28,"This holiday season might not be turning out the way you thought it would. But the gulf between your expectations and what's actually occurring can still put you in touch with your roots as you think about old traditions you wanted to revitalize or avoid. Instead of worrying about the past, recognize that you can begin right now in the present. Create your own vision about how you want to celebrate the New Year and share your fantasy with someone special."
scorpio,2010-12-28,"Mercury's retrograde into your 2nd House of Money may have reawakened some old financial concerns. Although you might not be feeling very confident today, your situation isn't nearly as bleak as it seems. Instead of fretting over what's wrong, set new goals by narrowing your vision and doing a serious reality check. But don't reach too far or you'll create imbalance in other areas of your life. Using your common sense when planning for your future will increase your chances to regain stability."
sagittarius,2010-12-28,"You may not be in a party mood today, but your current malaise won't last long. You might wonder how you got so enthused about an idea that turned out to be less important than it seemed at first. Nevertheless, your excitement grew along with your vision. Now, however, you must rethink the whole scenario because it's not living up to your expectations. Don't be afraid to let go of an old dream so you can invent a new one."
capricorn,2010-12-28,"It's crucial that you finish as much as you can now that Mercury's retrograde cycle is ending and the messenger planet will return to your sign in a couple of weeks. Unfortunately, the end of the year is a difficult time to tie up loose ends, but the struggle will be well worth the effort. Even if simplification isn't easy, lightening your load will allow you to say yes to a new opportunity."
aquarius,2010-12-28,"This is a very social time for most people, but you may be feeling a bit more reclusive this year. The Sun and Mars continue to track together in your 12th House of Spirituality, motivating you to put your attention to something other than lighthearted fun with your friends. As much as you can benefit from some time alone, there's no reason to resist being with like-minded friends. The love and support you receive will help you on your metaphysical journey."
pisces,2010-12-28,"You have grown weary of your daily responsibilities and may be ready for a change. But even if you are working today, give yourself some time to imagine your ideal job. Thinking about a different career path could trigger a cascade of feelings that awaken a deeper sense of purpose. But don't get discouraged if it's not time yet to make changes right away. No matter what, hold true to your vision of your greatest potential."
aries,2010-12-29,"Your ruling planet Mars is telling you that all systems are go, but your path appears to be blocked nonetheless. Your impatience tempts you to blast forward no matter what signals you're receiving; however, this isn't a smart strategy now. A better tactic would be to pay attention to the current obstacles and stop pushing so hard. However, your most intelligent move might be to start clearing the road ahead."
taurus,2010-12-29,"You have work to do that may not be much fun today, especially if your current obligations don't leave room for you to express your creativity. Even if you believe that you can finish your tasks, it still may be wise to moderate your enthusiasm. Your boss could easily misinterpret your confidence and give you more work to do instead of praising you for what you've done. Understate your optimism and focus on productivity instead."
gemini,2010-12-29,"Although you may set your goals high today, your work pace will be slowed by unforeseen circumstances. Instead of letting your anxiety get the best of you, remain clear about your abilities and simply acknowledge your current limitations. Everything should turn out okay as long as you don't promise more than you can deliver. However, even a simple job could get messed up if you take on too much. Work hard, but don't apologize for something you cannot control."
cancer,2010-12-29,"Your ability to mastermind a successful retreat can turn you into a winner today. But your workmates may continue to make demands on your time, even if you aren't available to help them out. Although you may be tempted to lash out and set them straight, it's smarter to just step aside and let them discover the truth for themselves. Others will ultimately appreciate you for knowing how to execute a defensive strategy when it's to your advantage to avoid conflict."
leo,2010-12-29,"You have extra energy to put into your job or your chores today, but still may end up frustrated because everything takes longer than you expect. The problem isn't that you may leave something unfinished; you can always tie up loose ends later. The real difficulty stems from your desire to be done so you can move on to what's next. It's challenging for you to accept the fact that it's not time to push for closure. Patience is your most valuable asset now."
virgo,2010-12-29,"You may feel anxious now as impulsive Mars floods your system with adrenaline to trigger an immediate response. Uncharacteristically, you're tempted to throw all caution to the wind and run as hard as you can toward your current destination. However, this would be a mistake, for the apparent proximity of the finish line is the result of your mind playing tricks on you. Instead, maintain your pace, but keep some energy in reserve for when you need it later on."
libra,2010-12-29,"You might feel unsure of your actions today, even if you can justify your behavior to others. Unfortunately, you may be stopped in your tracks anyhow because taskmaster Saturn, now in your sign, won't let you proceed if you're not ready or if you're heading in the wrong direction. Don't let self-doubt further impede your progress; remember that the current obstacles are there to remind you to stop running around and wasting energy. Success comes from concentrating your intent on the most significant matters first."
scorpio,2010-12-29,"You have lots happening now but your anger may get in the way of your productivity and happiness. Fortunately, you can transform the current situation by clearly letting others know what you want. But telling them exactly what they need to do isn't quite enough; you must also lead by example. The bottom line is that you shouldn't ask anyone for anything that you aren't prepared to do yourself."
sagittarius,2010-12-29,"Austere Saturn's tense square to the Sun signals a clear message for you to watch your limits now. If you are prone to exaggeration, someone in charge might be heavy-handed with their response in order to rein you in. And even if you aren't making a big deal out of everything, you still may be uncomfortable with the restrictive pressure you are feeling. It's unproductive to waste your energy by pushing back; instead, try self-restraint as an alternative to outright conflict."
capricorn,2010-12-29,"Your ruling planet Saturn enables you to be more productive when you are moving at a sustainable pace. But today you grow less comfortable with having to take on more responsibilities as red-hot Mars fires up your own ambitions. You may not mind the hard work, but you will be better off if you set healthy limits. Do your best to help out someone in need, but don't be afraid to say no when necessary."
aquarius,2010-12-29,"You are feeling more social as the New Year approaches and your friends entice you with invitations to gatherings that sound quite enjoyable. Meanwhile, a powerful person may be leaning on you to do extra work, forcing you to make difficult decisions about your schedule for the next few days. Letting the fun and games pass you by won't be your first choice, but it may be the right one. There's no need to fret; you will have a chance to play later if you meet your obligations now."
pisces,2010-12-29,"Arguing with your boss or your partner isn't necessarily your idea of a good time, but you may feel pushed to stand up for yourself now if someone gets in your way. Unfortunately, whoever is trying to stop you from accomplishing your goals can wield quite a bit of power. However, you have a lot to gain by facing this resistance instead of acquiescing. Still, slowing your progress may be a smart strategy in order to appear like less of a threat to those in charge."
aries,2010-12-30,"Paradoxically, your long-term plans seem to be slipping away as you move closer to your immediate goals. You are at another crossroad now, so reset your compass and take a new bearing on your destination. Don't worry if you decide to head off in a slightly different direction from your previous one. You've learned a lot about yourself and your world, so be prepared to change your course, if necessary."
taurus,2010-12-30,"Trickster Mercury is turning around today, making this a time of increased mental activity. However, some external events actually appear to unfold in slow motion, giving you the illusion of thinking relatively fast. No matter how small the differences are between your inner and outer worlds, you may experience a temporary disconnection with your friends or family. Unfortunately, trying to bridge the gap might only add to your frustration. If you keep your cool, the tension should subside all by itself."
gemini,2010-12-30,"Your uncharacteristic caution today is mixed with uncertainty, causing confusion about your upcoming weekend plans. You are sure of what you want, but there isn't sufficient time to get everything done. Instead of settling for any less, try to keep a steady pace through the New Year. Although it may feel as if your time is running out, there's a sufficient supply of it right in front of you."
cancer,2010-12-30,"You may need to listen more carefully today or you might miss an important message. But this isn't about being unconscious; it's just that you are resistant to changing anything in your routine that works. Of course, no one else can make a decision for you, but, at least, remain open to the practical suggestions you receive now. Trust that your friends will support you by offering you true words of wisdom."
leo,2010-12-30,"You are quite accomplished at squeezing a little bit of playtime into your already packed schedule, yet this strategy is not without its challenges. Fortunately, there may be significant shifts in your priorities now, especially if enough time opens up to allow you to seek a bit of elusive fun. You don't need to justify your desire for pleasure to anyone; just enjoy yourself while you can."
virgo,2010-12-30,"There may be a number of creative projects for you to work on today, yet previous responsibilities can still get in the way of your artistic pursuits. The pressure could create anxiety, especially if you haven't fulfilled a recent commitment. Let go of any remaining attachment to having a perfect holiday weekend. The most rewarding thing you can do now is to use your common sense and take care of unfinished business."
libra,2010-12-30,"A bit of advanced planning should make today unfold smoothly, yet you still might have to handle a few glitches in your schedule. It probably doesn't even matter how busy you are because something unexpected could grab your attention, enticing you to put off everything else. An unanticipated activity may prove to be a lot of fun, but you'll still need to return to your chores sometime over the weekend."
scorpio,2010-12-30,"You've probably accomplished more in the past few weeks than you realize, yet powerful feelings can cloud your reasoning now that the Moon is visiting your intense sign. Your emotions are in a state of flux today, so it won't be helpful to express yourself until they stabilize. Don't get carried away by your changing moods. Instead, simplify your goals and keep bringing your attention back to the basics so you can reach your desired destination."
sagittarius,2010-12-30,"You may sense that you're standing on familiar ground now and it can be unsettling if you believe that your window of opportunity is closing. But Mercury's retrograde return to your sign is about more than just revisiting the same intellectual terrain. Luckily, you are receiving another chance to reinvent your life, so celebrate the potential of your future rather than dwelling in the past."
capricorn,2010-12-30,"You could be stuck between a rock and a hard place, but this uncomfortable situation won't last much longer. Although fleet-footed Mercury is turning direct today, it won't regain its regular speed for another week. This interim phase can seem like forever, but it's important not to push anything along faster than reality allows. Being extra patient will help you conserve your energy for when you'll need it most."
aquarius,2010-12-30,"Expressing what's on your mind can be quite useful today, especially if you're having second thoughts about going to a party. If you're worried about running out of steam prior to your upcoming social obligations, remember that you will soon have the time to regroup and rejuvenate your body. For now, it requires more energy to avoid others than it does to simply go along with the group. Don't worry if self-doubt returns for a brief visit; once it passes you'll be able to have as much fun as anyone else."
pisces,2010-12-30,"Your career aspirations may be temporarily on hold, but once the holidays are over, it will be time to put them back on the fast track. Accordingly, it would be very smart to spend at least some of the next few days reconsidering your current strategy. Previously insurmountable obstacles are growing more manageable every day, especially if you're willing to acknowledge your role in creating the external blockages. Taking personal responsibility for the next phase of your life can start right now."
aries,2010-12-31,"Although the day may start off on a more serious note, you're ready for a party when the Moon enters your 9th House of Adventure. However, you are not just seeking fun; you want to do something that charges your system with adrenaline. But your interest in celebration won't eliminate your previous obligations. Others are relying on you now, so finish up old business before letting the good times pull you off track."
taurus,2010-12-31,"Your plans seem to be in line with your goals today, making it easier to reach your destination, even if you aren't being completely realistic. But you may have to break down a big job into several smaller tasks so that you will be able to track your progress as you go along. Don't worry about how much there is to do, just continue to take those small steps one at a time. Slow and steady wins the race."
gemini,2010-12-31,"Your friends are a constant source of distraction today, for they keep tempting you with pleasurable activities -- and they want you to join them. Fortunately, you are ready to do nearly anything as your key planet Mercury is being shocked by unpredictable Uranus. Don't expect the day to go according to your plan. Nevertheless, loosening your grip on the reins of control can pleasantly surprise you by landing you in an interesting situation."
cancer,2010-12-31,"You could be so psyched up today that you begin to experience free-floating anxiety because you cannot stop your erratic thoughts. It's difficult to know which way to turn to calm yourself down, because normally you would prefer to just retreat and be by yourself. Although you must take care of your responsibilities, you can also still be responsive to those who need your help. Make an extra effort, but don't consider it a personal failure if you cannot do everything you wish."
leo,2010-12-31,"Your energy level rises as the Moon shifts into fiery Sagittarius. Luckily, you don't need a good reason to dress up in your best party outfit and head out to kick up your heels with your friends. Revitalizing yourself shouldn't be difficult now because the Moon in your 5th House of Self-Expression encourages you to do what's the most fun. Find a way to finish your work early in the day so you can be free to get into the holiday spirit later."
virgo,2010-12-31,"Grandiose thinking can get you into trouble today unless you also pay close attention to the facts. It's difficult to turn a fuzzy vision into reality unless you're willing to make a concrete plan and then execute it. Although the determined Scorpio Moon feeds your ambitions now, overconfidence can result in carelessness when the Moon enters cavalier Sagittarius. Thankfully, you are still able to take charge of a situation if you're willing to focus on the details and lead by your positive example."
libra,2010-12-31,You may begin the day wishing that you did more work earlier so you don't have to finish your last minute chores now. It's your choice; you can choose to grow more stressed as you slip farther behind or you can scale back on what you expect to get done throughout the day. But announcing your intentions to pare down your to-do list won't help much unless you actually follow through and do it.
scorpio,2010-12-31,"Although you are probably well intended now, it's still a smart idea to weigh the pros and cons before you do something nice for someone else. All the wonderful things you can do for others will be empty gestures unless they come directly from your heart. Keep in mind that each charitable act can further deplete you, unless you are also nurturing yourself."
sagittarius,2010-12-31,"The Moon returns to your sign this evening, increasing your subjectivity. You may frustrate yourself trying to be logical for the next few days. Instead of wasting valuable time, money and energy attempting to be something that you are not, respond by honestly sharing your feelings. If you commit to being one hundred percent authentic, then everything else on your path to success should fall into place."
capricorn,2010-12-31,"Your dreams cannot be contained by traditional rituals or rational thinking now. You have a free ticket to ride your magic carpet as the Moon visits your 12th House of Spirituality. Make a serious commitment to honor your ambitions and turn them into positive intentions. This kind of resolution can add meaning to your holiday festivities, while enabling you to also keep yourself on solid ground."
aquarius,2010-12-31,"You may be very happy with today's enthusiastic Sagittarius Moon because she is moving through your 11th House of Long-Term Goals. You love thinking about the future and now it could be your favorite thing to do for a while. Nevertheless, it's easier to daydream about the years ahead of you than it is to meet your current responsibilities. Even if you want to share your fantasies with friends, remember to stay practical at least for part of the time."
pisces,2010-12-31,"The visionary Sagittarius Moon shifts into your 10th House of Status late today, provoking you to run around in circles while making certain that every little detail is just right. Sure, you want others to have a good time, but you also want them to notice how competent you are. Don't focus on personal gain or you'll miss the true experience of the holiday spirit."
