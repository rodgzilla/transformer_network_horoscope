aries,2016-01-01,"The emotional landscape has changed abruptly, leaving you to wonder about the complexities of relationships. This unexpected shift can mark the start of something new as cracks appear in a brittle shell that once kept you safe. It's time to emerge and face the world on your own terms, so don't get sidetracked by trying to repair the breach. Instead, dream about all the potential ahead for the baby chick once it is free from the nest."
taurus,2016-01-01,"Although you deserve a day of rest, you're buzzing around today as original ideas and beautiful images cascade into consciousness. But you must be careful because your thoughts may not be as brilliant as you believe. Your unconventional desires could even border on craziness now, so listen to what a trusted friend says before doing something outrageous you'll later regret. Everything doesn't have to follow according to your plan; you can improve nearly any activity by loosening the reins and sharing responsibility with those around you."
gemini,2016-01-01,"Your friends may seem unreliable today, disrupting previous plans that required their participation. This unpredictability can be challenging, since you must make choices based upon your ability to deliver on your promises. Unfortunately, you can't depend on the unflagging support of others at this time. Don't expect any extra assistance; if someone comes through for you, take it as a pleasant surprise and graciously accept their support."
cancer,2016-01-01,"Your reputation among your tribe might radically change today. If you experience a minor setback, it's only reality's way of pointing out something that needs your immediate attention. On the other hand, others may think that you're a real genius if your unconventional idea actually works. Either way, the status quo is about to shift beneath your feet, so don't try to hold on to the past. Reassess your direction and put your new plan into action as soon as possible. Fortune favors the bold."
leo,2016-01-01,"You may shut the door in an attempt to keep out extraneous noise today. Yet everything is moving so fast now that you must deal with the sheer rapidity of the speed of change, even if you're not happy about it. Any misguided attempts to stick to your current position are futile; the more you resist the future, the faster it arrives. Let go and dance with the uncertainty. Allow exhilaration to replace your fear and embrace the unknown."
virgo,2016-01-01,"You typically can be counted on to play it safe, but you're suddenly tempted to step outside the box today and surprise someone with your willingness to take a risk. However, you may end up on an unexpected detour, even if you're acting in a cautious manner. Hidden tensions that express without warning are either initiated by you or else they happen to you. Naturally, a proactive strike is better than waiting for something to happen."
libra,2016-01-01,"You are fighting the Goldilocks syndrome today. Finding a happy medium may be impossible because your reactions to trivial events seem to be too much or too little. You might even grow annoyed because people assume you want everything while you feel as if you're not asking for enough. Rather than blurting out your needs impulsively, let them sit and simmer a while before sharing them. Thankfully, the extremes will continue to settle down for the next day or two, allowing you to say exactly how you feel without turning your life upside down."
scorpio,2016-01-01,"You're mesmerized by rational explanations of complex mysteries today as you seek answers to the unsolvable questions of life.

There's no way around it; your emotions must play an integral role in your mental breakthrough now for it to have meaningful value."
sagittarius,2016-01-01,"You might think you're acting in a more practical manner, but you'll probably end up letting your feelings dictate your activities now. You may be in the throes of a new relationship, consumed with a competitive sport or fascinated by a captivating hobby. Whatever the reason, you are willing to be pulled off course now. But this doesn't need to be all-or-nothing venture as you seek exciting avenues of expression. Play close to the edge and don't be afraid to move the boundaries. Just be careful not to step on anyone's toes in the process."
capricorn,2016-01-01,"If circumstances at home seem overly complicated today, you might be ready to try a more diplomatic approach to the dilemma. Nevertheless, everyone's emotions can quickly escalate once you start talking. Ironically, you may secretly enjoy the fireworks, since the unplanned free-for-all could catalyze stagnant issues and provoke radical change. No matter how disruptive the discussion becomes, the air will clear once everyone has a chance to be heard."
aquarius,2016-01-01,"Your emotions are at odds with your logic today, especially if you are tempted to behave in a way that conflicts with your core values. It's tricky to embrace a strong desire that pulls you off balance, but suppressing an attraction won't make it go away. You're being gifted now with a unique opportunity to heal a wound that you have carried within your heart for a long time. Soften your hard edges, forgive yourself and move on."
pisces,2016-01-01,"Although you may still be reveling in the holiday spirit, your mind is already thinking about your future career objectives. Thankfully, your current sense of duty holds you in good stead on the job now. But you can't perform the same old tasks in the same old way and expect to feel inspired. Be daring in your communication today, whether it's by email, phone or in person. Don't miss an opportunity to establish new connections because you might meet someone who could open doors to places you've never been."
aries,2016-01-02,"Listening to the voice of reason isn't easy today as relationship tension tugs at your heartstrings. Unfortunately, your words are more inflammatory than you realize, especially if you impulsively open your mouth before considering anyone else's feelings. Thankfully, you can reduce the negative impact of your rash reaction by simply remembering to be respectful of other people's perspectives. In the final analysis, acting for the good of all brings more emotional satisfaction than only looking out for yourself."
taurus,2016-01-02,"You Bulls are quick to dig in your hoofs and get ready for battle if you feel your stability is being threatened. You might even be provoked to fight back in order to maintain possession of what you assume is yours. Unfortunately, your opinions can magically turn into facts now. You could begin to believe them so intensely that you're unable to hear anyone's contrasting viewpoint. Nevertheless, remaining open to new information strengthens your connections with those around you."
gemini,2016-01-02,"Since you are usually the first one to change your mind, others may be caught off guard if you stick with a specific action plan even when better alternatives become available.

Happily, unbridled inspiration accompanies you on your journey today, stimulating your innate curiosity so you can learn even more about yourself and those you love."
cancer,2016-01-02,"You may need to stand up to people who refuse to give you what you want today.

leo,2016-01-02,"Your peers will either follow your lead today or just step out of your way because your positive attitude is so unflappable. No one can talk you into taking a different path if you already know where you're going and how you're getting there. Thankfully, you can accomplish more than you expect if you remain methodical in your approach now. Nevertheless, being obsessed with the details is counterproductive. Developing a concrete plan is useful only if it has enough  built-in flexibility to respond to the changing circumstances."
virgo,2016-01-02,"You may be preoccupied with wanting to have fun today and will do nearly anything to keep your social plans from falling apart. However, playing the role of a drill sergeant and telling people what to do isn't the most effective management style. Relaxing your grip on the reins of control contributes to a more pleasant and productive day for everyone. Leaving a bit of room for the element of surprise can make all the difference in the world. Spontaneity is your friend."
libra,2016-01-02,"Although you're not typically emotionally volatile, powerful desires can build until the pressure becomes unbearable today. A dramatic event in a relationship could rattle your cage; however, the stress won't lead to a volcanic meltdown if you stay on top of your feelings throughout the day. Calm your nerves with exercise, meditation or creative expression. Positive change is more likely now if you're willing to leave your familiar routines behind and jump into unknown territory with an open heart."
scorpio,2016-01-02,"There's no place in your life for passive behavior today; letting circumstances develop until you lose control is not a viable strategy. In fact, cosmic forces prompt you into action now, whether or not you are ready for the engagement. Clearly express what you want without issuing any ultimatums or placing expectations on anyone else. Say exactly what you mean and then allow the situation to cool down on its own, without being overly attached to the final outcome. Sometimes the greatest magic requires a bit of breathing room to come to life."
sagittarius,2016-01-02,"You often enjoy the excitement of a little chaos and confusion, but nearly everything seems up for grabs today. You may not feel as if you're in control of your destiny, and you can't yet put your finger on where the current changes are leading you.

Thankfully, your current sense of urgency will fade, giving you plenty of time to make your dreams come true."
capricorn,2016-01-02,"You are tired of sitting around waiting for someone else to get the ball rolling. You are running low on patience today and you might choose to handle your frustration by striking out on your own, leaving everyone else to fend for themselves. Be prepared to forge ahead if you want to make progress now, but it's advisable to remember the wisdom of moderated self-restraint. A black-or-white solution might not be the only answer, so consider all options now before resuming your drive to success."
aquarius,2016-01-02,"Bringing an unfinished project to its proper conclusion makes room for exciting new opportunities. However, anything that remains incomplete now will likely haunt you for weeks to come. Your next venture demands your full concentration which means that you can't drag your old baggage around much longer. But don't waste time wondering about what the future holds in store for you. Instead, focus all your energy on lightening your load today to prepare for the challenges of tomorrow."
pisces,2016-01-02,"A complex emotional issue that's been quietly brewing within a relationship or a group of friends may need to be brought out into the open today. The expression of hidden emotions is a good first step in a healthy process of honest dialogue, even if the information revealed isn't what's expected. Banish all fears and suspicions before they creep into the mix; rather than withdrawing in denial, focus on the rainbow of possibilities that waits beyond your current trials and tribulations. Set a shining example for everyone else to follow."
aries,2016-01-03,"You're swept up in a whirlwind of cosmic energy as you naively attempt to untangle your emotional attachments.

Luckily, your clear intentions help you to cast the current circumstances in a positive light, empowering you to walk fearlessly into the future."
taurus,2016-01-03,"You're doing everything you can to avoid an unpleasant confrontation today because you cannot see how it will lead to anything constructive. It's a lot less stressful to ambivalently sit on the fence and wait for resolution than to get caught up in the emotional fray. Nevertheless, inaction only works for so long. Everyone will feel better after the various opinions are out in the open, even if there's no apparent common ground to be found yet. Thankfully, it's not necessary to force a group consensus now; compromise is an art that cannot be rushed."
gemini,2016-01-03,"You are driven to defend your recent choices while messenger Mercury is put to the test by warrior Mars. If you proudly stand up to political pressure, your priorities evolve and your most spiritual thoughts will endure. Holding onto your vision helps you conquer a difficult opponent. You may feel that someone is out to defeat you; however, if you are clever enough to steer clear of conflict today, you can continue toward your destination without further interference. Take the high road and see who follows."
cancer,2016-01-03,"Showing your feelings comes more naturally now that action-planet Mars is camped out in your 5th House of Self-Expression. All emotional interactions may seem a tad overwhelming now; there's so much going on in your life, it's nearly impossible to know where to start. Although it's healthy to power through your hesitation, don't share everything at once. Choose your subject matter carefully and then take a creative route to prove your point; your wide-ranging knowledge base and infamous tenacity will help you to reach your goals."
leo,2016-01-03,"Fortunately, you're processing the waves of change today while standing on a strong foundation. However, you may be recovering from recently going out on a limb and sharing more than was necessary. And you might face an uphill battle, no matter how optimistic you are that everyone can step beyond their parochial thinking to see the bigger picture. Most attempts to demonstrate your intellectual superiority are bound to fail now. Instead of turning this into a game where someone is likely to lose, it's up to you to invent a way in which everyone can win."
virgo,2016-01-03,"Although you quickly acknowledge the power of your convictions, it's tricky when someone close to you works with an entirely different set of assumptions. But it's a waste of energy to engage in a fight just to prove someone else is wrong and you are right. Trying to change another person's mind is a dead-end street today. Thankfully, you will be free to re-focus on your continued self-improvement once you acknowledge that intelligent people can hold opposing views. When in doubt, err on the side of peace."
libra,2016-01-03,"Fortunately, your creativity is flowing directly from the source now, making it a breeze to be proactive in all your endeavors. Mercury's current visit to your 5th House of Self-Expression inspires eloquent communication and increases your mental agility. Still, you may need to fight for your right to speak your mind. Being considerate of people's feelings is an admirable trait, but don't allow your willingness to compromise stop you from doing what's best for you. Be as kind to yourself as you are to others."
scorpio,2016-01-03,"You might sense that someone is attempting to derail your plans behind your back, but it may just be your fears conjuring up these fantasies now. However, combative Mars and the evocative Moon return to your suspicious sign today, raising issues of jealousy or possessiveness in relationships. But don't succumb to your own negativity; the choice is truly yours. Choosing to believe in the best of others over all other options should be enough to keep the day rotating with a positive spin."
sagittarius,2016-01-03,"Your cheerful attitude can positively impact your immediate future, but self-doubt could wreak havoc on a perfectly good day.  Thankfully, delicious Venus forms a creative alignment with joyous Jupiter, lifting your spirits and raising your hopes. Make time to connect with your close friends because they will be the ones who can help to take your mind off of your troubles with a little laughter and a lot of love. Being mindful of your blessings keeps your heart humble."
capricorn,2016-01-03,"You may lock horns with your group of friends and find yourself in a standoff today, especially if you feel threatened by your own sense of insecurity. But other people's clever ideas are no match for your unforgiving persistence and the strength of your convictions. Although someone might provoke your anger now, don't let your emotions distract your focus from your ambitious goals. Your current optimism mixed with your unwavering concentration is an unbeatable combination."
aquarius,2016-01-03,You possess the gift of clear vision today and shouldn't let anyone dismiss your intuitive hunches. But interpersonal dynamics can get dicey if someone questions your authority. Your energy could quickly shift into a more aggressive posture now if you believe you need to defend your intentions. Don't bother justifying your dreams; just keep your eyes on the distant horizon and continue to march in that direction. Listen to your inner voice and your journey will be one of discovery and delight.
pisces,2016-01-03,"Although everyone seems very intense for some strange reason today, you're still able to stay slightly detached from your emotions. Luckily, your optimistic outlook on relationships enables you to sidestep an unnecessary conflict with someone who fundamentally disagrees with your position. Remember that you don't need to be right; you have absolutely nothing to prove now. Instead of stirring up trouble with a loved one, concentrate on manifesting your dreams."
aries,2016-01-04,"Withholding your thoughts today may be a sensible strategy, even if it's not easy to remain silent. Your key planet Mars is anxiously squaring contentious Mercury, making it exceptionally tough to speak your mind without blowing your cool. Even if you can keep your feelings under wraps for a while, you're likely to let loose later in the day. There's no question about it; the less you say now, the more peaceful your life is. Discretion is the better part of valor."
taurus,2016-01-04,"An unexpected social commitment could get in the way of your production at work today. You might be invited to participate in a group activity that distracts you from something that's less fun yet more important. Unfortunately, you may rush to say yes as a means of escape, even if it turns out to be a bad idea. Nevertheless, don't blame yourself  later if you wish you had chosen differently. All you need to do is make the best choices you can in the moment and take responsibility for the consequences. You reap what you sow."
gemini,2016-01-04,"You're not exactly certain what others expect from you today. However, you're ready to swing into action even if you don't know which direction you're going. Part of the problem is that interactive Mercury has you hyper-focused on the future while its square to impetuous Mars heightens your impatience. Nevertheless, flying by the seat of your pants now is asking for trouble you don't need. Spending extra time studying your maps increases your chances of arriving at the right destination."
cancer,2016-01-04,"You might get up on the wrong side of the bed today. Fortunately, early morning dissatisfaction can transform into afternoon hope, even if you don't have a clue as to how it might happen. It all starts with having faith in your dreams.

Your positivity is contagious; it's your attitude that determines your failure or success."
leo,2016-01-04,"Normally, you perform well under pressure, but formidable obstacles are not easily dismissed today. You're less certain about a recent decision, but might not want to expose your vulnerability by sharing your fears. Don't waffle now, even if you're unsure of your next move. It's simpler in the long run to take a strong position, even if it leads to conflict. At least others will know exactly where they stand and can make their plans accordingly."
virgo,2016-01-04,"You're eager to show everyone how adaptable you are today, but your patience may be running thin as clever Mercury squares impulsive Mars in your 3rd House of Communication. You wish that people would state their needs more clearly because you don't understand what they want. But rather than wasting energy criticizing others for being indecisive, just move forward by following through with your plans. Putting your own life in order is more constructive now than trying to manage anyone else's."
libra,2016-01-04,"You're highly sensitive to people's unexpressed feelings today and may try to settle the tense dynamics by boldly walking into the middle of a conflict. You have your own point of view, but still believe in the process of open dialogue. Unfortunately, the more you hear, the more you realize the current stress might not have an immediate resolution. Instead of pretending you know what to do, share your uncertainty. Ironically, your honesty catalyzes a solution that seemed impossible only moments before."
scorpio,2016-01-04,"Your unwavering commitment to the truth as you see it may generate some unexpected backlash today. You may struggle to open your mind as you're asked to entertain a variety of possibilities. You truly want to be more flexible, but too many choices can be quite overwhelming now. Nevertheless, it's wise to listen to the needs of everyone involved. The good news is that you can win what you want if you're acting like a team player. Everyone is more willing to compromise once competition turns into cooperation."
sagittarius,2016-01-04,"Although romance might be in the air, it's difficult to bring it down to earth today. You're so eager to engage your heart in an interaction with someone special that you can't separate your wishes from the true dynamics.

capricorn,2016-01-04,"No matter how disciplined or determined you are  today, you won't likely accomplish everything on your agenda. You're all too easily distracted because your curiosity is aroused by every new idea that floats your way.

aquarius,2016-01-04,"You may grow worried if you can't pin down a sensible course of action at work now. Even if you have a viable strategy for getting ahead, you're not sure that your timing is right. It's unsettling if you don't receive the support you expect now that assertive Mars squares interactive Mercury in your 1st House of Personality. But don't jeopardize your long-term plans with feelings of impatience or doubt. Sometimes you just have to wait for the right opportunity to knock at your door."
pisces,2016-01-04,"Visualizing the final outcome of your decisions is nearly impossible today; however, you can have a fine time by spinning a few fantasies within your imagination. Nevertheless, it's still a struggle to keep your behavior consistent with your thoughts while self-directed Mars crosses paths with rational Mercury in your 12th House of Spirituality. Forget about trying to explain your actions to anyone else, since the more you say now, the less sense you make.

However, you soon realize there's more work to do when others point out the missing pieces of the puzzle. Thankfully, you budgeted extra time in your schedule for just this sort of contingency. Taking pride in your performance demonstrates your professional touch."
gemini,2016-01-05,An ongoing project may have expanded way beyond your original intent. Now you begin to realize that you need to scale back your vision and bring your expectations down to size.

cancer,2016-01-05,"You may be hypersensitive as the winged messenger turns backward in your 8th House of Deep Sharing. Intimacy is built on clear communication, yet it's challenging to say what you mean today. Unfortunately, you can't move forward without including others in your plans, even if they seem to have a different agenda. If all the dissonance starts to wear you down, consider a temporary retreat until you regain your emotional balance. Being nervous isn't a bad thing; listen to your intuition when it's telling you to pay attention."
leo,2016-01-05,"Emotional stress may impact a partnership now until you address important issues through honest communication. Unfortunately, mischievous Mercury has slammed on the brakes and has shifted into reverse gear while visiting your 7th House of Relationships.

Don't worry about where you are going now; your destination will become clear soon enough."
scorpio,2016-01-05,"You are often a champion at overcoming obstacles, especially when they are between you and the object of your intentions. However, Mercury's retrograde in your 4th House of Security makes you question your competence. You could overcompensate by bulldozing your way through anything blocking your path.

sagittarius,2016-01-05,"You are your own greatest enemy today as you inadvertently work against your success. Although you feel uncommonly resistant to change, the pressure to reconsider your current path is intensifying all around you. Discussing your alternatives with trusted friends is wise when Mercury the Messenger turns retrograde in your 3rd House of Communication.

Proceed slowly if that adds to your confidence, but remember that exercising flexibility now will make your life less frustrating in the days ahead."
capricorn,2016-01-05,"You may discover you have more work to do to shore up your finances, especially if you've been concerned about your fiscal stability recently. But Mercury's retrograde turn in your 2nd House of Money cautions you against making immediate changes because you could act carelessly in a way that negatively affects your bank account. The more obsessive you feel, the more you need to cool your jets. Oddly enough, putting a little distance between you and your current predicament gives you the objectivity you need to decide upon a clear course of action."

As tempted as you might be to pull the strings that will create the desired effects, try to steer clear of this kind of control, especially if your emotions seem too extreme.

Even if you think you are making wise use of your communication skills, your quick mind can create more trouble faster than you can imagine.

leo,2016-01-06,"You are riding on a trajectory of inevitability that is changing everything. You can't take total control, even if your intentions are honorable, for others might interpret your actions as power-hungry meddling, rather than just helpful.

You may think you can handle this dilemma by ignoring it, but consider the radical alternative of telling the entire truth."

Just remember that your path is easier when you travel with a companion, so soften your words and listen with your heart."
scorpio,2016-01-06,"You have plenty riding on how you handle an explosive situation today while the Sun is still joined with your key planet, Pluto.

sagittarius,2016-01-06,"You may wrongly believe that you're unstoppable now, unless you know exactly when to call it quits. You're playing at the top of your game now, but you might not have the common sense to hold back now. You could provoke unneeded resistance from others who feel you are attacking them. Even if you are on a roll, you're probably not as important as you would like to believe. Success is more easily attained today by practicing humility."
capricorn,2016-01-06,"You're fully aware of your inner strength now as you resolve to do a project your own way. However, problems arise if your extreme behavior motivates you to steamroll over someone who is resistant to your control. Nothing positive will come from intense ego battles. It makes more sense to soften your stance today instead of acting like the tough guy. Gentle persuasion is more effective than relentless pressure."
aquarius,2016-01-06,"An overwhelming desire to act in a rebellious manner can create a real mess now. If you take things too far, it won't be easy to recover what you lose in the process of being yourself. What seems like an exciting moment at first turns into a complex web of unspoken passion. Be cautious, since heading down this path also requires you to change in unexpected ways."
pisces,2016-01-06,"You must step up and fully own the magnetic power others see in you today. If you remain in denial, the challenges will continue to grow. However, a strategy based on avoidance could leave you feeling victimized by the unfolding circumstances. However, you can learn a lot about yourself and the changes ahead if you face your fears instead of looking for the easy way through."
aries,2016-01-07,"You can't contain your excitement today as the obstacles to pursuing your happiness seem to fall away. You may be buzzing with anticipation about an upcoming adventure, but satisfaction isn't as close as you think now. Don't be flippant about the complexities you must manage or you could miss the nuggets of wisdom waiting to be discovered. If you're truly serious about your goals, you just might be able to execute your plans flawlessly. Humility is the ticket to your success."
taurus,2016-01-07,"Keeping up with your social commitments is super-stressful when there are too many demands on your time. Thankfully, you're capable of stretching beyond your usual limits today, but don't overextend too far or you will upset the delicate balance between work and play. Holding onto the spirit of the holiday season long after it has passed is a lovely goal, but don't be afraid to end the party if your common sense warns you that it's time to get back to work. The key to maintaining a healthy balance is knowing when you lost it."
gemini,2016-01-07,"It's tempting to jump on someone's bandwagon today because you're currently more interested in enjoying yourself than with achieving success. Luckily, the Moon's presence in your 7th House of Companions amplifies the strength of another person's strategy, further enticing you to drop your previous plans. Your cooperative spirit empowers you to work seamlessly with others now; the joy of collaboration brings you more emotional satisfaction than doing something on your own."
cancer,2016-01-07,"You're cautiously optimistic about what you can finish at work today, but your expectations might be slightly unrealistic. You don't know what unscheduled crisis might rear its ugly head, so streamline your to-do list as a proactive measure. Rather than wasting time on tasks you can't complete, focus on accomplishing the most important ones; otherwise, you could exhaust your resources before the day is done. Conserving your energy is your ace in the hole."
leo,2016-01-07,"You are on a creative burn today with the buoyant Sagittarius Moon bouncing around in your 5th House of Self-Expression. However, you're not in the mood to perform the repetitive tasks that may still be required of you now. Be careful about reacting before you make a plan because your frustration could explode into an emotional outbreak that flips your day upside down. Practicing patience might be your greatest challenge now, but it also is the most effective weapon to combat your stress."
virgo,2016-01-07,"You might believe you can achieve anything you focus your intention on now. Unfortunately, your schedule could fall apart at the seams if someone's need for independence clashes with your agenda. You may be required to reinvent your day on the fly or postpone tasks when something requires more time than you expected. Your immediate reaction could upset others, but your reassurances should settle them down. However, it's more important to remain true to your purpose now than to be sidetracked by anyone else."
libra,2016-01-07,"Stuffing one more activity into your day could be the straw that breaks the camel's back. But you may not realize anything has gone wrong until after the fact. The entire house of cards might need to fall in order to alleviate the tension if you stretch your commitments too far. Even if you're confident that all is well in your world today, it's still smart to lighten your calendar before you find yourself in hot water. Sometimes saying no to one thing is really saying yes to everything else."
scorpio,2016-01-07,"Exercising caution is wise today because the adventurous Sagittarius Moon in your 2nd House of Possessions encourages you to spend more than you should. Your discretionary funds may be more limited than you want to admit, so budgeting your resources is a strategic move. It's smarter to acknowledge how easily you can fool yourself before you end up facing an unnecessary cash crisis. Thankfully, a little sensible planning goes a long way to ease your concerns. A penny saved is a penny earned."
sagittarius,2016-01-07,"You're surfing a wave of self-confidence, but ignoring practical details can lead you astray. Relying on your logic instead of your optimism is a good idea now, but it's not easy to maintain a balanced perspective. Your visionary powers are so strong today that you could easily trick yourself into believing you're invincible. Don't avoid reality just because it's unpleasant. Positive thinking improves the situation as long as you face the truth."
capricorn,2016-01-07,"You prefer taking a rational approach to complicated situations, especially while the radiant Sun is shining in your sensible sign. Unfortunately, the current circumstances defy logical analysis. Instead of downplaying your creativity by trying to stay on a straight and narrow path, give yourself permission to be inspired by your imagination. Don't justify your choices to anyone today; simply trust in the process. Your intuition is a gateway to other dimensions."
aquarius,2016-01-07,"Your dreams are the source of great inspiration but they may also lead you in a more practical direction today. Three planets lurking in your 11th House of Long-Term Goals lure you out of the present reality and into the world of possibilities. Luckily, your imaginative excursions can have a lasting influence on whatever comes next in your life. But instead of just losing yourself in fantasyland now, consciously paint your future with the colors of your mind."
pisces,2016-01-07,"You're pretty confident about your prospects now, believing you have the ability to advance your career path simply through the power of positive thought. However, your visions might be distorted, causing you to see your future through the rose-colored glasses of your desires. Nevertheless, there's no reason to assume the worst-case scenario, either. Don't avoid difficult facts today; a reality check only heightens your chances for success."
aries,2016-01-08,"Giving someone the cold shoulder isn't nice, even if you want to send a message of disapproval today. Withdrawing support isn't helpful if your response is actually based on your current fear of the unknown. It's more productive to engage in an honest discussion about the cause of your concerns without throwing any blame around. However, don't expect the tension to dissipate immediately. A river cuts through rock not because of its power but because of its persistence."
taurus,2016-01-08,"It's no fun feeling like you're being left out of all the action today. It's as if there's an emotional chill in the atmosphere now that affectionate Venus is burdened by the weight of karmic Saturn. Although you might push back against the resistance at first, the smartest way to turn an uncomfortable situation into a sweet one is to let go of control. Relinquish some of your independence voluntarily; it's a small price to pay in the big scheme of things and can improve your chances of feeling like you're a part of the pack."
gemini,2016-01-08,"You may be required to make a tough choice today, especially if you're not one to sign on to a commitment easily. You could be quite convincing now as you reveal your desire for greater intimacy in a relationship, but you might still feel the urge to run for the hills if someone gets too close to your heart. Thankfully, you're not doomed to repeat the same old patterns just because you're worried about getting hurt. Mustering up the courage to push past your fears is the secret to your happiness."
cancer,2016-01-08,"Gaining support from a coworker is tricky business today, but you won't know what you might receive unless you ask for it. Even if you can't imagine that anyone will actually go the extra mile on your behalf, taking a calculated risk could turn out in your favor. Don't scare yourself by assuming the current situation demands an all-or-nothing approach. Instead, be cautious and systematically establish common ground as the basis of a solid working relationship. You're not alone; let others nurture you the way you would nurture them."
leo,2016-01-08,"It could be awkward to engage in a casual conversation today because your feelings might be exposed, and you're worried that you won't get what you want. Ironically, your unspoken concerns could manifest into a self-fulfilling prophesy, especially if you choose to withdraw from social interactions. Luckily, you have the resolve to overcome the negativity of your own fears. Turn things around quickly by changing your attitude and opening your heart."
virgo,2016-01-08,"It may be disheartening if you don't receive the respect you deserve from a loved one as vulnerable Venus bumps into judgmental Saturn in your 4th House of Home and Family. You've done everything right, yet your ego can trick you into believing you should be more appreciated than you are today. Don't waste your time dreaming about receiving accolades and standing ovations. The best reward is the deep satisfaction that comes from within when you know you've done your very best."
libra,2016-01-08,"Too much resistance from a friend or coworker doesn't give you an excuse to sulk and brood today. Don't isolate yourself from your companions just because you think that everything isn't copacetic between you. It may be tempting to hide your feelings from those closest to you, but this avoidance tactic is not a satisfying solution. Confronting the shortcomings of a relationship might put you back in touch with what you admire about each other the most."
scorpio,2016-01-08,"You're not inclined to put too much effort into sharing your feelings today. In fact, you're quite practical when it comes to allocating your time and energy now that resourceful Venus joins forces with austere Saturn in your 2nd House of Resources. You may be very straightforward about cutting back on frivolous pleasures to assure you will have what you need on a rainy day. Naturally, exercising caution makes logical sense at first. However, there's an unlimited supply of love in the universe, so you can always splurge when your heart is involved."
sagittarius,2016-01-08,"The time has come to make a crucial decision about how to spend or save your money. But this choice goes much deeper than being a simple cash flow problem because the underlying issue is more likely about your self-esteem. When you realize all the skills you have to offer, your earning power could grow beyond your current expectations. Don't fall into the trap of thinking that you're worth any less than you actually are. Real wealth is not about your income potential; it's about appreciating what is already yours."
capricorn,2016-01-08,"There's no reason to suffer in silence today if you're willing to face an old fear with a fierce new attitude. Your emotional isolation is probably more voluntary than you care to admit now that the sobering Venus-Saturn conjunction influences your 12th House of Invisibility. It helps to acknowledge that the current situation is not the same as what happened in your past. You can choose to respond defensively, based on an old habit, or you can live in the present. There's no question about it, being an optimist is a much more empowering strategy than being a pessimist."
aquarius,2016-01-08,"Don't rush to the conclusion that your friends are putting you down today when your limited perceptions may be contributing to your worries. In fact, you could be so sensitive now that you imagine trouble where there isn't any. Unfortunately, it might be too late to sidestep a dance with discomfort. Nevertheless, it's not necessary to project your previous failures onto others; discuss your concerns without pointing fingers at anyone. A heart-to-heart discussion may be all that's needed to put things right."
pisces,2016-01-08,"Unfortunately, there's no room on your busy schedule to surrender to your desires now. Instead, you must maintain an emotionally cool and competent presence at work while flirty Venus hooks up with responsible Saturn in your 10th House of Career. There's no time to waste energy complaining about what you're missing as you strive to achieve your long-term goals. Seeking personal satisfaction can wait; practicing patience today is your best strategy for realizing your dreams tomorrow."
aries,2016-01-09,"Assuming you have the right to boss people around won't necessarily demonstrate your ability to lead in the way you wish. Although the Capricorn New Moon intensifies your 10th House of Status, people are more likely to follow you when they see you're walking your truth, not when you run around barking commands at them. Ironically, you can produce the lasting impact you want if you adopt a gentler approach in all your interactions. In fact, all you need to do now is take responsibility for your own actions and hope others will do the same."
taurus,2016-01-09,"You might believe you know how your day will unfold, but an unexpected event may require you to change your plans. The sure-footed Capricorn New Moon grounds your 9th House of Big Ideas, but its square to wily Uranus adds uncertainty to the mix. Unfortunately, overreacting only makes matters worse. Well-considered modifications are your best bet today, even if you don't see results from your actions right away. You still can reach your goals if you remember to take a few deep breaths, step back and broaden your perspective."
gemini,2016-01-09,"You might experience a run-in with self-doubt if your day deviates from your expectations. You could even start to worry that your efforts for the past few weeks have been an exercise in futility. Nevertheless, change is slow and steady as the conservative Capricorn New Moon lingers in your 8th House of Transformation. Your key word now is patience; it's a mistake to act recklessly just because you're frustrated with your apparent lack of progress. Be persistent; you will begin to feel more productive once you see the results from your recent hard work."
cancer,2016-01-09,"You may be emotionally stressed by your relationship with a friend or lover now, especially if you each approach conflicts in radically different ways. It's challenging to put your feelings out on the table because the reserved Capricorn New Moon lands in your 7th House of Partnerships. Thankfully, consistency is rewarded  and your willingness to reveal your vulnerability in spite of a difficult issue could actually bring the two of you closer together. Even if a conversation seems strained today, sticking with the process can result in a welcome sense of relief all the way around."
leo,2016-01-09,"Your typical weekend routine may be turned upside down today as the Capricorn New Moon triggers your 6th House of Details. You aren't happy about doing things differently now, so a change of pace could be upsetting at first. Nevertheless, shaking up old patterns can reveal habits that might benefit from change. But don't waste too much time looking back; there is little to be gained by replaying your past, except for the taste of regret. Instead, create the future you want by modifying how you respond in the present."
virgo,2016-01-09,"If you are waiting for the best time to share something near and dear to your heart with someone special, this may be your moment. The calculating Capricorn New Moon mobilizes your 5th House of Self-Expression, encouraging you to finally come forward. After much careful deliberation, you're ready to show your cards today. Remember, keeping too many secrets could prevent you from having a shot at success now, so be honest and turn this moment into the chance for happiness you deserve."
libra,2016-01-09,"Your personal life might not be unfolding as you wish, but you will probably get what you want, anyhow. Although there may be a few unscheduled stops along the way, the ambitious Capricorn New Moon ultimately leads to stability as it energizes your 4th House of Foundations. Keep in mind that satisfaction could still take a while because now you are building the solid base for future operations. Ironically, the longer you wait for something, the more you appreciate it once it's yours."
scorpio,2016-01-09,"It's time to initiate an overdue conversation about a sensitive topic, especially if you can feel tension bubbling just beneath the surface. Avoiding an uncomfortable discussion only adds to the strained relationship dynamics. Thankfully, the earthy Capricorn New Moon stabilizes your 3rd House of Communication, enabling you to make real progress toward creating common ground. But it's not wise to push for closure today; allowing time for the current intensity to soften will help you reach a more palatable resolution for everyone involved."
sagittarius,2016-01-09,"Expressing your feelings is more challenging than it should be today, but you're at a turning point and the resistance is finally ready to dissipate. Luckily, the Capricorn New Moon emphasizes your 2nd House of Self-Esteem and it seems as if your luck is improving. However, this current shift is more likely the result of all your hard work. You will enjoy the fruits of your labor soon enough, but don't expect too much too fast as you continue to build on your accomplishments."
capricorn,2016-01-09,"You might believe you have all the answers today, but recent events suggest otherwise. The pragmatic Capricorn New Moon switches on your 1st House of Self, but your blind optimism can backfire if you become too confident of your plan. Avoid extreme reactions; don't waste time getting excited about what's ahead or being sad for what you've left behind. Instead, maintain a positive attitude in this moment of heightened awareness where your thoughts are busy creating your future."
aquarius,2016-01-09,"Everything may seem overly important now, as if this current moment in time is more significant than all others. The formidable Capricorn New Moon's visit to your 12th House of Karma could stir up unresolved issues from your past if you think they could foil your ambitious plans. But you might not remember the events as they really occurred since your imagination is bending the facts out of shape. Take the current truth, as you see it, with a grain of salt; your perspective will return to normal in the days ahead."
pisces,2016-01-09,"It's as if you're standing on a mountaintop on a clear day, ready to choose your direction off the summit. You can clearly see the horizon in the distance every way you turn as the shrewd Capricorn New Moon rocks your 11th House of Long-Term Goals. Although you might normally employ your imagination to create the next phase of your life, it's nearly impossible to replace reality with dreams now. Although you're often inspired by fantasy, taking a matter-of-fact approach enhances your current chances for success. As Voltaire wrote, ""Common sense is not so common."""
aries,2016-01-10,"You're so sure you must be practical today that you're likely to put your dreams on hold and channel all your energy into producing tangible results. It isn't that you're incapable of acting sensibly; it's just your irrepressible need for independence comes out when the Moon enters unconventional Aquarius this afternoon. But be forewarned this is not a smart time to burn bridges by alienating anyone who supports you. Instead, find ways to speak your truth without instigating a fight. When in doubt of your next move, remember Mr. Spock's Vulcan proverb, ""The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few."""
taurus,2016-01-10,"You could feel as if you're out of the loop today, especially if others don't bend over backwards to include you in their plans. Thankfully, you are patient enough to wait for your turn, even if you are quietly frustrated with the process. Oddly enough, losing your temper might not be the worst thing you can do now because it releases all your pent-up negativity. Unfortunately, the tension continues to build if you keep your growing annoyance to yourself. However, it's one thing to vent some steam; it's another thing to strike out in anger. Walking that fine line is a delicate dance."
gemini,2016-01-10,"You're intent on getting all your chores done today, even if it seems like you have too much to do. You could reach a point of no return, when you're tempted to throw your hands up in the air and just walk away from your world of never-ending commitments. However, you can't escape from your obligations that easily. Instead of trying to sidestep reality, demonstrate your persistence by sticking with your agenda. Luckily, checking a few things off your list will alleviate the stress more than you think."
cancer,2016-01-10,"You are less likely to play nicely just to get others to like you today. You are clear about your needs and are willing to take personal responsibility to achieve satisfaction. You typically might not be this assertive, but it seems natural now to chase your dreams. Even if you believe you are justified to feel so certain that you'll reach your goals, don't shrug off  the concerns of your friends and colleagues. Nothing will be gained by disenfranchising an ally. Treating others with the same respect you want in return is always a sound plan."
leo,2016-01-10,"You're taking your promises to heart today and you're committed to delivering on your word. Even if there are too many repetitive tasks on your plate now, concentrate on them one at a time until they are done. However, you're just as likely to jump into something totally new if given the chance. Either way, it's tempting to test to see how far you can push the energy. Curb your enthusiasm just a notch; a touch of sensible self-restraint at the right moment maximizes your progress no matter what projects are in front of you."
virgo,2016-01-10,You might want to schedule your day backwards by having your fun first and then getting serious about your chores later on. It may be nearly impossible to narrow your focus in the morning while the Moon is still camped out in your 5th House of Play. But you won't have the time to partake in any distracting activities once Luna enters your 6th House of Work this afternoon. Do not wait; grab the opportunity for enjoyment while you can and start your day with ice cream before you eat your vegetables.
libra,2016-01-10,"Pressing family obligations may require your attention during the morning, but you're eager to shift gears later on so you can let loose and enjoy yourself. Scheming about your escape might be more fun than you expect, especially if you attack it as if it were a competitive game. Don't impulsively rush ahead; wait until you feel the time is right before doing your disappearing act. Make sure you follow the plan you devised so that you honor your commitments first before you embark on your big adventure."
scorpio,2016-01-10,"Your extrasensory perceptions are attuned to an unpleasant wave of energy still out on the distant horizon of your awareness. Needless to say, your concern makes it difficult to enjoy the good vibrations around you today, but it isn't wise to push your darker emotions away for the sake of harmony. Ironically, avoiding uncomfortable feelings just gives them more power. Instead, express what's in your heart, even if it isn't what others want to hear. It's kinder for your loved ones to learn your truth now than to receive a watered-down version of it at some later date when they can't offer to help."
sagittarius,2016-01-10,"You need to get some work done today, even if it's normally your day of rest. Chores that piled up in your absence demand your immediate attention. Ironically, establishing manageable limits grants you additional freedom now. But, if you're not good at setting healthy boundaries, you might have to overcompensate later by admitting to your failure. Don't delay the inevitable; even if you feel uncomfortable, a clearly drawn line in the sand will be enough to hold your position."
capricorn,2016-01-10,"The beginning of your day seems to flow smoothly enough, but someone may unexpectedly question your values later on. You're probably resistant to talking about your goals today because you're still developing your strategy. It doesn't feel right to climb out on a limb in order to defend a position that's still unformed. Unfortunately, your silence is easily misinterpreted now. Hiding is not a wise idea, for it encourages others to draw the wrong conclusion. Transparency is your friend."
aquarius,2016-01-10,"Sometimes you need a not-so-gentle reminder about the importance of your emotions. You are often satisfied to set them aside for the sake of convenience. However, your life is enriched when you bring your heart into the equation. Fortunately, you don't need to change your behavior today; you only need to adjust your frame of reference. Living life to the fullest brings greater satisfaction when you stop trying to overrule your subjective feelings with your rational thoughts."
pisces,2016-01-10,"You may be overwhelmed with an unrealistic desire to avoid your current responsibilities. Although you might dream of running away to an exotic locale, you could quickly become disappointed once you realize how impractical it would be to drop everything right now. However, you can't ignore your frustration or it will morph into anger and erupt again in a few short days. Instead, find a way to slip away for a while today, even if it's only to escape with an intriguing movie or a good book. A little inspiration will recharge your batteries faster than anything else."
aries,2016-01-11,"Starting something new is typically your idea of a fun time. However, today you are fixed on finishing a project that's already in progress. Although you may not be panicking because the deadlines aren't looming close enough yet, complacency is not your friend. Something intriguing could easily distract you if you're not paying close attention to your priorities. Consciously narrowing your field of vision enables you to singularly focus on the next critical task. Work now, play later."
taurus,2016-01-11,"Drawing a line in the sand requires very little effort today as you set clear boundaries and make big plans for your future. However, you might have such an inflated idea about your goals that you get carried away with your own enthusiasm now. Even if everything seems to be copacetic, trouble begins to brew once you realize you may be overshooting your mark. Don't let your ego stop you from reassessing your trajectory; there's no shame in downsizing if it improves your chances for success."
gemini,2016-01-11,"It seems as if time is running out, forcing you to scale back any overly ambitious schemes. Nevertheless, sharing your ideas with someone who is opposed to your strategy can be your most brilliant move because it will reveal the weakest links in your plans. Just remember that the feedback you receive might not be what you want to hear. However, there's no point in arguing when everyone else has already moved on. You will be happier in the long run if you demonstrate your intelligence by adapting to the changing dynamics with a positive attitude."
cancer,2016-01-11,"You could convince yourself that it's best to remain silent about your feelings now, but non-communication isn't a viable strategy. Although it may be easier to keep everything to yourself, anything that isn't said will only strengthen in its intensity. You still must deal with your emotions eventually before they inadvertently turn up as a projection. Your smartest defense is to react honestly and deal with the cookie as it crumbles."
leo,2016-01-11,"Your attempts to be emotionally available could backfire on you in a exasperating manner today, especially if you're being overly optimistic. Perhaps you missed an important fact or simply didn't want to acknowledge someone's pessimism, especially when you are feeling so positive. Balance your desires with a realistic perspective in order to prevent disappointment in the immediate future. Truth may be a bitter pill to swallow, but it's medicine that's better taken sooner than later."
virgo,2016-01-11,"You might want others to believe that you're busy focusing on your work. However, you are likely having trouble preventing your thoughts from being carried away by the crazy schemes of your friends or coworkers today. In fact, your attraction to outrageous ideas and intriguing adventures could actually be a reflection of your current boredom. Don't pretend that everything's fine if it is not. Be proactive; seek constructive ways to shake up your routine before you feel really stuck."
libra,2016-01-11,"Your overconfidence could make you careless in your actions today. However, you can minimize your chances of making mistakes by remembering to double-check your work as you go along. Your plans won't turn out well if you are absolutely certain that everything you start will be great. But if you maintain a sense of humility now, your creative powers will be free to manifest at a highly productive level. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure."
scorpio,2016-01-11,"You may believe that it's prudent to let an opportunity for a friendship or a romance pass without any action on your part. But even if you're worried about feeling emotional pain now, it's still worth overcoming your fears, taking a risk and reaching out. Your silence will ultimately be more hurtful than any vulnerability you might feel in the moment. The adage, ""No risk, no reward"" couldn't be more true when it comes to matters of the heart."
sagittarius,2016-01-11,"An uncomfortable situation at home begins to settle down today. But just as you assume everything is on the mend, someone might do something so out of character that you don't know how to respond. Honestly, you are tempted to retreat from the drama and take care of some personal errands. But don't fall into the trap of believing you can just walk away and ignore the problem. The same dynamics will be there when you return, so face the music while it's still playing."
capricorn,2016-01-11,"You have a strong sense of direction today and you're not willing to let anyone redefine your agenda. Unfortunately, you might upset someone by simply holding your ground. It feels as if everything could be blown out of proportion, leading you to believe you have more at stake than you actually do. Nevertheless, a little calculated risk-taking will be positively rewarded in the days ahead. It's easy to stand with the crowd; it requires courage to stand alone."
aquarius,2016-01-11,"Your best ideas could run into trouble today, as if reality is throwing up roadblocks to test your will. You might be tempted to hit the brakes and turn your car around to avoid the trouble. However, you are encountering a setback and not a defeat; this is no time to throw in the towel. Your determination is your secret weapon and overcoming the current obstacles will strengthen your plans and execution. It may take more effort to reach your destination, but it will be well worth it in the end."
pisces,2016-01-11,"You appear a bit less stable than you actually are today. However, your unorthodox behavior may only be superficial because deep down you know that karmic Saturn's rules and regulations need to be acknowledged and obeyed. Nevertheless, you must tread carefully; if you inadvertently step over the line of acceptability, you will have to make amends quickly. Walking a straight and narrow path now is your most direct route to happiness."
aries,2016-01-12,"You are driven by a powerful desire to experience the thrill of sensual enjoyment today and are drawn toward anything that stimulates an emotional buzz. Your nerves are on edge and you don't want to wait for satisfaction. Thankfully, your irrepressible spontaneity can be expressed creatively. Take a chance and cross to the wild side of the street while sexy Venus aligns with rebellious Uranus in your sign. Sometimes you have to risk going too far in order to discover how far you can go. Poet Robert Frost wrote, ""Freedom lies in being bold."""
taurus,2016-01-12,"People might believe that you're doing everything by the book but your current desires seem off the wall to you. Although you're not feeling restrained by rules of social etiquette, it appears as if you are more cautious than you actually are now. Fortunately, you have enough freedom of movement today to make it up as you go along. Nevertheless, be careful how you strive to realize your dreams  because you could strangely end up being the very same authority that you're trying to resist."
gemini,2016-01-12,"Your schedule won't likely unfold according to your plan, since you are riding high frequency waves of erratic emotional currents today. Ironically, you won't be destabilized by the unexpected curves and detours in your path if you hang onto your core values. Your behavior may appear shocking to others now, but it's just good clean fun to you so you might as well enjoy yourself. Luckily, people might be more supportive than you expect as long as your actions are aligned with your heart."
cancer,2016-01-12,"You are thankful for the emotional security you can create when you retreat into your protective shell. However, unstable circumstances at work  won't leave you alone today, disrupting your inner sanctuary. It's tempting to avoid the action now, but it's not wise to hide behind a rock or crawl deep into a cave in order to escape. The high level of intensity might make you nervous but you need to push through it; the potential for progress is off the hook if you release your concerns and jump into the fray."
leo,2016-01-12,"Relationship dynamics can be pretty intense now, even if no one realizes how much you're going through at the moment. Thankfully, an uncomfortable situation improves quickly if you don't burn your bridges today in the throes of the emotional volatility. Somehow, you intuitively know that something wonderful is about to happen, but it's not smart to get too cocky about it. In the meantime, make time to rest and recharge because you will need all your energy for the long journey ahead."
virgo,2016-01-12,"Your physical energy is a mixed bag today, especially once the Moon begins to hang out in your 7th House of Partners. Although your desires may seem almost palatable now, you are wary of letting your imagination dictate current events. You might be itching to shift direction and break free from a boring routine, regardless of what anyone thinks about your unorthodox vision. Ironically, your wildest ideas can lead you down a practical path. Creativity is the secret weapon to your success."
libra,2016-01-12,"A magical day is within your grasp while your key planet Venus dances in lockstep with out-of-the-box Uranus. Oddly enough, even the wildest fantasies don't seem so crazy to you. This is your chance to step past your fears and grant yourself permission to seek sensations that are different from anything in your past. Luckily, you can excel at whatever game is necessary to obtain your object of desire. Enjoy the excitement today before it fades into yesterday. Your biggest risk now is the one you don't take."
scorpio,2016-01-12,"You may find yourself dreaming about doing things that are typically outside of your comfort zone. Oddly enough, even with the highest of spiritual intentions, you might not be able to keep your more primal instincts from stealing the show after the Moon slips into fantasy-prone Pisces to activate your 5th House of Love and Romance. But don't fall into the trap of believing that you must act on every thought today, romantic or lustful. Fortunately, there is no harm in indulging yourself within the privacy of your own mind, but some secrets are not meant to be shared."
sagittarius,2016-01-12,"Your thoughts are free to soar high above the clouds of illusion today while you sit back and enjoy the fruits of your labor. However, you must keep your exorbitant desires in check to ensure the greatest benefits. People may share crazy ideas with you that aren't as outrageous as they first seem. Even if an inventive plan sounds unrealistic, it still could be viable with the right team in place, making it a fun endeavor to pursue. Take your chances, but don't put all your eggs in one basket."
capricorn,2016-01-12,"Be gentle with those close to you because your loving acceptance of others can catalyze an unexpected reward. You may experience an emotional earthquake today, if someone rattles your heart. But don't lash out in return, even if a surprise is shocking to your ears. Keep in mind the messenger only delivers the news and is not responsible for its content. Roll with the punches and offer your unconditional support. Your flexible attitude makes all the difference in the world."
aquarius,2016-01-12,"You don't have much time to attend to your agenda today because people keep showing up unexpectedly. Thankfully, your friends and associates recognize your brilliance and seem to be supportive of your plans, even if they require your immediate attention. Take advantage of their interest and involve them in your activities. Fortunately, you can work closely with others without sacrificing your individuality as long as you are clear about your goals. Ironically, setting boundaries not only brings the respect you deserve, it also enables you to feel proud of your accomplishments."
pisces,2016-01-12,"Toss the nets of your dreams as far as you can reach, and be ready to pull in the big fish. You're receiving an electrical buzz from magnetic Venus' presence in your 10th House of Career as she trines brilliant Uranus today. Luckily, the Moon's shift into your compassionate sign enables you to imagine an amazing scenario starring you as the conquering superhero. Your creative efforts will not go to waste; ironically, stepping over the edge to express your individuality now leads to long-term stability later on."
aries,2016-01-13,"You are poised in anticipation, eager to ride the fluctuating waves of contradictory energy. You believe that maintaining a positive attitude will overcome all challenges, but you may have underestimated the power of the cosmic tides now. A smarter strategy could be to retreat and reevaluate your plans today, instead of futilely pushing against the currents. A steadier pace improves your chances of reaching your destination. By practicing a little patience, you can transform your unbridled optimism into tangible results."
taurus,2016-01-13,"Everything seems to be flowing your way today, but all the positive feedback could have a surprising negative effect. You may become so sure of your actions now that you overlook a potential problem. Luckily, you can rely on your common sense to remind you that it takes less work if you do something right the first time around. Thankfully, your world will continue to spin in your favor as long you don't let the current energy of abundance encourage greed. More isn't necessarily better; if you already set an attainable goal, be prepared to stop when you reach it."
gemini,2016-01-13,"Although it might seem as if every word you say now encounters resistance, sit tight and wait your turn as communication continues to improve over the next couple of days. Your bright idea is close to paying off, but you must remain persistent in your efforts. Unfortunately, too much stress on the job can make you less effective today, so just coast for a while if you run into trouble. Fight the temptation to dig in your heels because a stubborn stance won't work in your favor. Adaptability is your not-so-secret weapon, so don't be afraid to use it to your advantage."
cancer,2016-01-13,"Your moods are brewing up a storm today, yet you won't gain any respect by giving up at the first sign of conflict. Neither do you need to battle against an immovable stone wall. Your most sensible approach is based upon a high level of consistent behavior without any signs of aggression. It may even be helpful to consciously let go of control so you can float with the flow now. Calm your nerves by surrounding yourself with the sounds of nature, soothing music or just good old-fashioned silence."
leo,2016-01-13,"A flood of brilliant ideas opens many possibilities at work today, yet you may grow agitated because you can't find the hook that could turn this magical moment into something more. If you experience an unexpected setback now, pushing harder won't bring success any faster. Instead, connect with the intellectual buzz but wait for the energy to quiet down before finalizing your career plans. Exploring your options enables you to make the most of the amazing opportunities knocking at your door."
virgo,2016-01-13,"This is a significant day for your relationships and you might end up pleasantly surprised with the outcome. However, you need to demonstrate a modicum of self-restraint or someone could rain on your parade now. There are long-lasting ramifications if unequal power dynamics are left unaddressed today. Even if it feels like you're being bent out of shape, express the love that is already in your heart. The simplest act of kindness may be enough to shift the energy in a brighter direction."
libra,2016-01-13,"There's plenty of detailed busywork on your agenda today but you really don't want to mess with your schedule to make it all fit in. Unfortunately, your lack of rigidity only stirs up more conflict. You gain the most by meeting others halfway and acting as spontaneously as you can. Paradoxically, a gracious compromise may be the most sensible way to get what you want now. Just make sure you don't go running in the opposite direction and become so enthusiastic about every idea that nothing gets done at all."
scorpio,2016-01-13,"Some of the current complexity in your life stems from how you chose to react to recent events. If you pursued an opportunity without overplaying your hand, you won't likely run into any problems at all. But if you overcompensated by listening to your ego and making a hasty decision, today's consequences might be a bit tougher to accept. Nevertheless, relaxing your grip and letting go of your old expectations frees you to achieve your new goals. Embracing your future is easier when you carry less baggage."
sagittarius,2016-01-13,"Although you are concerned that your secret isn't safe today, you still could enjoy yourself while navigating all the twists and turns of the day. This high level of action is what you asked for so don't waste everyone's time wishing that your life was less hectic now. The Sun's sweet trine to auspicious Jupiter suggests that there really is a pot of gold at rainbow's end for those who believe. However, you must meet your current responsibilities before you can magically transform a tricky moment into an awesome day."
capricorn,2016-01-13,Living up to your end of the bargain and managing all the minute details of a project means that delicious rewards may be just around the next corner. But the dark clouds might not clear until later in the day so it's best to keep your shoulder to the wheel since it's uncool to fall behind in your work. Part of your current lesson is learning to live with more uncertainty now. Dig deep to find spiritual meaning in the present moment while also honoring your dreams for the future.
aquarius,2016-01-13,"Keeping your thoughts in line is a fruitless and frustrating endeavor today. You might not have much fun at first, but don't waste energy berating yourself if your agenda isn't working out according to your expectations. Your maps successfully brought you this far but now you must set them aside to explore the uncharted territories ahead. Stay optimistic about the possibilities, even if everything continues to change. Turn any remaining fear into courage and trust your intuition to keep you safe and sound."
pisces,2016-01-13,"Someone may shock you with unexpected criticism today, refocusing your attention back on reality. If your fantasies have hijacked your goals, embrace the unsolicited advice you receive from others now, instead of rejecting it out of hand. Be sure to establish healthy boundaries so you can maintain your emotional sanity. Nurturing your confidence, not your skepticism, will guide you toward fulfillment."
aries,2016-01-14,"You're quite sure of your ability to perform the impossible today, even if your energy is dispersed over too many projects. Although your current confidence is refreshing, it might very well seem out of place. You understand you should take your commitments more seriously, but you possess an irrepressible certainty that everything is going to play out just the way you planned. Thankfully for you -- and annoyingly to others -- your intuition is probably right on the mark. Allowing events to unfold organically now could magically lead to success."
taurus,2016-01-14,"Your uncharacteristic tendency to exaggerate today may turn every little issue into an unnecessary drama. If people push your buttons, you might just tell them exactly what's on your mind, whether or not it makes sense. Fortunately, the outcome could be better than you expect; at least, everyone will know where you stand even if you were planning on keeping some of your misgivings under wraps. Nevertheless, it's still wise to put your opinions out into the open as gently as you can and then step back to give everyone room to respond."
gemini,2016-01-14,"You are rambling a mile a minute now that loquacious Mercury is receiving loud signals from excessive Jupiter. Although you try to keep the conversation light, you can't shut off the flow of intense information. You may be a bit mentally overstimulated but something keeps drawing you back into the less comfortable emotional realms today. It's tricky business because you don't want to stop talking, but it's wise to know when to hold your tongue. In fact, a silent meditation might be just what the doctor orders to help you  regain your balance."
cancer,2016-01-14,"Keeping your thoughts to yourself is challenging today, even if you know that it's prudent to remain quiet. Part of you feels as if it's your personal responsibility to bring the information you have out into the light. Although you may wonder if your disclosure is appropriate, a friend might convince you to talk -- and once you start, you won't hold anything back. When in doubt, erring on the side of caution is your safest bet. The better part of valor is discretion."
leo,2016-01-14,"Your secret admirer or a spiritual adviser may be the source of good news today. Luckily, you could learn something that opens your mind to an entirely different way of looking at your current circumstances. Even if you believe you should stick to your original agenda, stretch beyond your current point of view and consider what's best for everyone involved. Adopting a less personal and more spiritual perspective paves new paths to success."
virgo,2016-01-14,"You may be known for your critical thinking, but today your thoughts carry you far past your usual limitations. Although your key planet Mercury is retrograde, its harmonious trine to lucky Jupiter sends your mind to greener pastures. Much to your surprise, you could be less practical and more philosophical in your approach now. Keep in mind that it's not necessary to apply your ideas to something tangible at this time. Write down your colorful visions while they last so you can make good use of them when your feet return to earth."
libra,2016-01-14,"You want to be understood by your friends, especially if emotional distance has developed over the past few days. However, explaining yourself clearly is a challenge; others might not understand why you are so passionate today. Nevertheless, you're eager to share your ideas about a variety of things because discussing conceptual ideas feels safer than revealing your feelings. You may be quite a captivating conversationalist, but be careful not to speak in such vague generalities now that you lose touch with your heart."
scorpio,2016-01-14,"Meaningful relationships with friends and colleagues offer you the encouragement you seek these days. You might even receive some wonderful news, which can take the pressure off other stresses in your life. However, opportunities that come to you now will likely increase the complexity of your everyday activities, prompting you to wonder if the potential benefits are really worth the extra effort. There's no need to respond too quickly; run through all the logistics and then rely on your intuition to uncover the best answer."
sagittarius,2016-01-14,"Your current domestic situation may give you some valid reasons for doubt, but you can rise above the difficulties now. Although you're unsure of your next move, you're lucky enough to receive helpful guidance from someone you can trust. Your key planet Jupiter is blessing your 10th House of Status, bringing you closer to your goals. Instead of worrying about what could go wrong today, acknowledge all that is right in your world; use the power of positive thinking to propel you toward your preferred destination."
capricorn,2016-01-14,"It's all too tempting to swing into action today and take charge of the situation, assuming that your plan is the best one. You know everything will fall into place if you can stick to the program without any outside interference. Thankfully, your dogged attention to details adds to your overall productivity. However, your eagerness to demonstrate your competence might just be a way to cover your emotional vulnerability. Choose a trustworthy friend and share a part of yourself you normally don't let others see. Confiding your deepest fears to someone now could be the catalyst you need to open your heart."
aquarius,2016-01-14,"Opportunity knocks on a variety of strange doors today, offering you a chance to show off your innovative brilliance. However, if someone presents a winning strategy now, it may not be as incredible as you think. Remember, bountiful Jupiter is increasing the lighting on each cloud's silver lining, so everything appears brighter than it actually is. Nevertheless, saying yes is still your best move, as long as you have a concrete end game in place. Blending reality with the seeds of your imagination is a combination that leads to personal growth."
pisces,2016-01-14,"Unrealized hopes are re-stimulated today when a friend shares his or her idea for success with you. However, what begins as a casual discussion can lead to premature commitments now because it's so easy to get swept up in the excitement and go over the top. Remind yourself throughout the day that your idealism is running on overdrive. Tempering your exhilaration with a dash of down-to-earth practicality gives you the best chance of setting realistic priorities and reaching your goals."
aries,2016-01-15,"You are known for your willingness to run ahead of the pack, whether or not the Moon is visiting your impetuous sign. Nevertheless, the Aries Moon provokes you to say yes quickly now, without considering alternative paths. Meanwhile, the Moon's harmonious alignment to karmic Saturn in your 9th House of Future Vision requires you to find a more reliable route to success, even if it means you won't get there as soon. Don't jump on the fastest horse today, because learning a meaningful lesson along the way might be more important than reaching your destination."
taurus,2016-01-15,"Handling the demands of your day-to-day affairs can be so exhausting now that you're ready to slip away for some much-needed rest and recuperation. But the more you try to retreat today, the more it seems as if others won't leave you alone. Everyone wants to chime in with their opinions on what you should be doing, so it's up to you to resist outside pressure by clearly establishing boundaries. Everything becomes easier to manage once you create enough space for a quick getaway. The time to relax is when you don't have time for it."
gemini,2016-01-15,"You may be much more interested in your social  life than performing your job today, even if it is a busy workday. You're sorely tempted to take a long lunch or waste time in idle chatter with your coworkers. And even if you try and behave, you might still end up searching for other ways to fulfill your need for interpersonal interaction. Unfortunately, your boss or some other authority figure could step in and prevent you from escaping your duties. Be proactive; finishing your to-do list early in the day will leave you plenty of time to play later on."
cancer,2016-01-15,"People may be genuinely surprised with your actions today because you're uncharacteristically eager to take charge at work. Although others think that you're reticent to be in the spotlight, you are more than willing to assume authority when you know exactly where you want to go. Just be careful not to indiscriminately share your feelings with anyone who might not have your best interests in mind. Finding the right person to confide in can make all the difference in the world."
leo,2016-01-15,"You're currently dissatisfied with the family dynamics today, tempting you to escape into your dreams. However, withdrawing into fantasyland isn't a viable strategy for achieving long-term happiness. Thankfully, the courageous Aries Moon's presence in your 9th House of Adventure convinces you to make changes to create the excitement you seek. Nevertheless, you  still have to do what others expect of you prior to putting your big plan into motion. To everything there is a time; to everything there is a reason."
virgo,2016-01-15,"Your coworkers might be operating with hidden agendas today. On the surface, they may continue to voice their support for you, even if you retreat in order to delve deeper into your own emotional process. However, you can't help but feel the pressure from their unspoken demands, prompting you to pull away even more now. One way to handle the current tension is to simply let others know that you just need some time alone to regroup and gather your thoughts. You can always reconnect with your teammates once you're ready to return to the game."
libra,2016-01-15,"A close friend or coworker may seem too pushy for your refined taste today while the impudent Aries Moon visits your 7th House of Others. Unfortunately, you could overreact by emotionally withdrawing from the unpleasant situation. Thankfully, a lunar trine to stern Saturn enables you to clearly set the limits you need to feel comfortable. Just remember, relationships require give and take, so keep the communication channels wide open for the best results."
scorpio,2016-01-15,"You can't sit around twiddling your thumbs while the irrepressible Aries Moon is wildly activating your 6th House of Work. But you could be so enthusiastic about plowing through your chores today that you rush ahead with your next task before you map out the smartest approach to managing your resources. Unfortunately, you may expend lots of time and energy without finishing anything you start unless you're willing to slow down, rethink your strategy and begin anew. Haste makes waste; slow and steady wins the race."
sagittarius,2016-01-15,"You might mistakenly believe that everything would be great now if people just gave you some breathing room and didn't expect so much from you. It's tempting to resent those who rain on your parade by wielding their authority or withholding their approval. Unfortunately, your resistance only reinforces your negativity. You can improve the dynamics in a flash by changing your assumptions. No one wants to ruin your day; they only want to help you realize your potential. Turn your critics into allies and you'll be surprised how quickly attitudes improve, including your own."
capricorn,2016-01-15,"Personal issues demand your attention today, especially if you recently have been lost in your work-related responsibilities. Luckily, this is a great time to clean up matters at home while serious Saturn harmoniously trines the Moon in your 4th House of Domestic Affairs. Unfortunately, you might believe you will arrive at your destination faster by taking a few unauthorized shortcuts along the way. Avoid the potential for frustration by giving yourself plenty of time to process your feelings. Keeping it real inspires others to do the same."
aquarius,2016-01-15,"You may be running around in circles today, without having much to show for all your efforts. Instead of compulsively continuing to spin in motion, stop for a while so you can reconnect with your center. Of course, adopting a more practical approach will help your cause, but restarting slowly at first is the real key to gaining traction. You'll be able to deliver on your promises as long as you don't rush ahead without any forethought at all. A more linear perspective improves your productivity."
pisces,2016-01-15,"Taking a methodical approach is the best way to tackle a financial problem that's been bothering you lately. Unfortunately, attempting to solve your dilemma by initiating aggressive action gets you nowhere fast while retrograde Mercury is in the picture. Thankfully, the Moon's emphasis on your 2nd House of Money harmonizes with calculating Saturn today. Don't shift the blame for a difficult situation onto anyone else. Claim responsibility for your position and establish a sensible plan to alleviate the current pressure. Highest intention plus hard work equals magical success."
aries,2016-01-16,"There's an overload of excitement in the air today, yet you have no way of knowing what might happen next. Contrary to your reputation, you actually enjoy a bit of stability but drudgery can weigh you down, prompting you to crave dramatic change. Although you prefer to call the shots, you're definitely not in charge now. Accept reality's challenge by letting go and trusting that someone else will step in and do the right thing. Knowing what you can and can't control is the sign of true wisdom."
taurus,2016-01-16,"People seem to be acting strangely today as if they desire more independence but are too scared to ask for it. You have no reason to prevent anyone from moving forward with his or her life, but your buried insecurities could interfere with your initial reaction. Don't shy away from exploring your own fears now, since there are important lessons to learn about your irrational feelings. Taking time to sort through your emotional biases helps strengthen your relationships more than you realize."
gemini,2016-01-16,"Unconventional visions of your future can be upsetting to the status quo, but you can't just stop thinking about them. You might even discover that you enjoy the uncertainty as you're eagerly plotting your next move. Nevertheless, it isn't wise to choose a path too quickly now. Instead, research a variety of alternatives so you can make a well-educated choice. The more options you entertain, the more fantastic the outcome will be when you finally choose your direction."
cancer,2016-01-16,"A familiar discomfort rises into your awareness now if you respond too impulsively to a sudden change in schedule. Sometimes you miss opportunities because you are overly concerned about making a wrong choice. However, indecisiveness is not your problem today. You're eager to mix things up and follow a different drummer. But immediately initiating action  could lead you down a road better not taken. Proceed with caution; there's not as much of a hurry as you might think. True brilliance lasts."
leo,2016-01-16,"You're likely to lose your temper today if you believe someone is attempting to prevent you from being the captain of your own ship. Or perhaps, your irresponsible behavior might provoke someone else's anger. Either way, extreme feelings are triggered by a deeper energetic imbalance and you won't help the situation by suppressing your emotions. Instead, review your assumptions and untangle your convoluted logic so you can deal with the source of your negativity in a calm and reasonable manner. It's not what happens to you that matters, it's how you respond that makes  all the difference."
virgo,2016-01-16,"People may appear totally irrational now and their inexpiable behavior can be quite unnerving to your well-organized world. However, you have cosmic permission to express your concerns today, even if your disclosure precipitates emotional conflict. Don't spend too much time second-guessing your feelings and reevaluating your alternatives. Your most reliable strategy is to take the bull by the horns and shake everything up; act first and ask questions later. The truth will find its way to the light."
libra,2016-01-16,"Taking a much-needed break from your professional responsibilities is prudent today, especially if you have something to show for your recent efforts. Instead of focusing on your long-term goals and ambitions, concentrate on the current dynamics of your personal life. Don't be afraid to express your feelings as directly and succinctly as possible if you're seeking out a new relationship or trying to revitalize an old one. Your emotional honesty and mental clarity can create the fireworks you desire."
scorpio,2016-01-16,"You might be in for a big surprise today, even if you're looking to stir up a bit of trouble. But you don't need to seek out any complications, since they will naturally find you. The truth is, problems that erupt into awareness now are simply revealing a significant issue you have been doing your best to avoid. Stop worrying if circumstances get out of hand for a while; people will grow more supportive as they witness your ability to rise to the challenge. Change creates opportunity."
sagittarius,2016-01-16,"You dislike receiving mixed messages because you feel as if you can't respond properly. You love the thrill of flowing along with a swiftly moving current, especially if it's carrying you toward an unknown destination. But your forward movement can still encounter resistance today, which only provokes you to push harder. Unfortunately, you can't progress any faster without running into a detour, so avoid the temptation to rush the process. Accept the fact that the universe has its own cosmic timing where your future is concerned."
capricorn,2016-01-16,"The fevered pace remains steady all day, making it nearly impossible to find respite. Although you're inspired by all the action, you may feel frustrated because you can't resolve an important dilemma now. But don't turn a trivial question into one of ultimate concern just to distract you from the real issues. You don't need any more noise on your plate, so just be quiet and listen to the wisdom of your inner voice. Leave your logic at the door and trust your intuition for a change."
aquarius,2016-01-16,"You are too impatient to waste time waiting around for others, but you may also have your own delays to handle today. You know you're on the right track, but you can't seem to push things along the way you wish. Unfortunately, you can drive yourself crazy now if you don't change your perspective. Settling back into your comfort zone for a while isn't as unproductive as you think if you keep reminding yourself that satisfaction is looming on the horizon."
pisces,2016-01-16,"You're on a roll today and it might feel like nothing will get in your way. But your morning's enthusiasm can explode into a barrage of angry words if you believe your feelings aren't being respected by your friends or family. However, you won't find a solution through emotional dialogue now; unfortunately, talking about your concerns may only make matters worse. Instead of attempting to force change in others, adjust your own attitude. Believe it or not, when your outlook improves, so will everything else."
aries,2016-01-17,"Although the recent cosmic energy keeps spinning you in circles, wonderful experiences and amazing opportunities continue to open your eyes. In fact, you're not ready to let the good times slip away without one last attempt to capture the gold. Luckily, the stars are on your side now, but you could end up offending someone if you don't know when to quit. It's likely that everyone can tell when you're exaggerating, so be honest and stick to the facts. Thankfully, speaking the truth won't impede your success or interfere with your fun if you keep the fuss to a minimum."

Unfortunately, you may easily step beyond your limits if you don't stop to listen to your inner adult. You could relinquish reasonable constraints now, only to realize later that your self-indulgent binge wasn't worth it. Even if you are craving more fun in your daily life, keep track of when it's time to get back to work. Moderation is the key to experiencing the best of both worlds."
gemini,2016-01-17,"It doesn't take much to be swept up in the excitement of a lovely distraction today, but it's wise to keep your feelings in perspective. You might end up wasting a lot of your time and energy if you can't figure out when to say no when your heart is saying yes. Unfortunately, acting responsibly is easier said than done now, for you're not likely to turn down an invitation if you think it offers the potential of pleasure. Make the most of your clever charm to find a way to have your cake and eat it too."
cancer,2016-01-17,"You need every ounce of your concentration to keep your emotions under wraps today. However, it's crucial to create healthy boundaries so you can be more effective in the professional world. However, containing your moods won't make you feel them any less. In fact, you might be more inclined to stay in close touch with the passions of your heart once you realize you don't have to reveal your secrets to anyone. Others can't help but be impressed with your decorum and discretion. Silence is your secret weapon of success."
leo,2016-01-17,"You could be hiding something significant, yet the pressure to come clean is driving you close to the edge. You are probably ready to unload your burden as long as you find someone you can trust. Remember, the emotional rewards might be worth whatever stress you feel along the way. Instead of getting hung up in the potential discomfort of the present moment, focus your awareness on the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Your dreams of the future are your guiding light now as long as you know when to return to reality."
virgo,2016-01-17,"Your legendary ability to focus your thoughts and stay on point is tested today, but you would rather walk on the wild side now than stick to the familiar path. A conscious change of attitude may be required because you can see possibilities for delicious pleasure everywhere you look. You can't help but want to discover where your choices might lead. Nevertheless, folks are counting on you so it's best to put your blinders on if needed; you can always explore the delights of the world another day."
libra,2016-01-17,"A nagging sense of guilt pulls you out of your reverie today, motivating you to reevaluate your priorities. It requires an enormous amount of strength to walk away from sweet pleasantries while beautiful Venus continues to cycle back into your dreams and fantasies. But it could take days to dig your way out of the hole you create if you let yourself fall into a self-indulgent trap. It's healthier to flirt around the edges and save yourself from the embarrassment of going too far."
scorpio,2016-01-17,"You might be a slave to your previous promises now, since you have likely taken on more than you can accomplish. But there's no need to stress out; you're at the beginning of an industrious cycle where you are perfectly capable of performing mighty feats and possess the energy to deliver the goods. However, there may also be an internal whisper running on repeat today, giving you permission to have fun. Go ahead and indulge your inner child; you'll return emotionally refreshed and energetically ready for the next round of work."
sagittarius,2016-01-17,"The biggest problem with riding waves of unrestrained optimism is that you can land in a pile of trouble without even knowing it. You might see glimpses of a more realistic perspective now, but you're not willing to sacrifice your piece of blue sky just yet. While it's true that denial may put a smile on your face for a while, it won't make you very happy in the long run. Facing the truth is your only viable option, even if you must temporarily temper your carefree ways for a worthwhile cause."
capricorn,2016-01-17,"You may mistakenly believe you can sidestep a relationship dilemma today by just burying your head in the sand; however, escapist behavior will only take you so far. You could certainly end up with something to show for your work if you redirect all your attention toward a home-improvement project or an artistic pursuit. But left unattended, the underlying stress will only grow stronger throughout the day. Find the courage to sort out your negative feelings for the sake of closure. Your honesty could raise a few eyebrows now, but your authenticity will improve interpersonal interactions in the future."
aquarius,2016-01-17,"There are chores to do that simply can't be delayed any longer. However, you still might try to slip in another round of procrastination if you think you can get away with it. Thankfully, your laissez-faire approach works in your favor now, enabling you to easily convince others that your plan makes sense. Nevertheless, overplaying your hand is a bad idea because you could lose the support of a trusted ally. It may be a bitter pill to swallow, but maintaining your integrity is more valuable than making yourself look good."
pisces,2016-01-17,"Although you are imagining every possible way you could enjoy yourself today, you're torn by a familiar tug-of-war between fun and responsibility. Your current lack of motivation makes the conflict even more annoying because you can think of so many other things you'd rather do before you finally take care of weekend chores still left undone. Instead of struggling with an all-or-nothing approach, strive to balance work with play. Aiming for the middle path makes it easier to squeeze some rest and recreation in without compromising your productivity."
aries,2016-01-18,"It seems as if everyone is in a tizzy over the storms appearing on the radar. Meanwhile, you're busy rounding up a search party to go out and locate all the potential rainbows. It's not that you are in denial of the danger lurking ahead; it's just that you can see the good in almost anything today -- whether it's there or not. Others may think you're acting recklessly, but you figure that someone has to believe in the silver lining hiding in the dark clouds, even if it doesn't really exist."
taurus,2016-01-18,"You Bulls are counted among the most sensible folks of the zodiac kingdom. There is an integral part of your personality that doesn't like to be confused or misled for any reason. You want to know exactly what's going on all around you. Thankfully, you're attuned to subtle vibrations and open to the spiritual truths revealed to you today. Don't just take the easiest path now. Use your imagination to visualize your perfect future and then follow through without taking your eyes off your goals."
gemini,2016-01-18,"Your fantasies seem so unbelievably real today that you are tempted to enthusiastically agree to every plan you hear. It's as if you aren't paying close  attention to the instructions you're given and can't count on your cleverness to figure out how long a job should take. In fact, it's tricky to determine your limits on several fronts now. Thankfully, you can rely on a trustworthy ally to provide the objectivity you currently lack. Asking for help when you need it is a sign of  intelligence."
cancer,2016-01-18,Keeping your personal feelings separate from the global tensions that continue to simmer and thicken is quite a struggle today. You're operating on the ideological premise that humanity is an extension of your brothers and sisters. It's as if the world's pain and  suffering is all happening within your own immediate family. Watch your energetic boundaries since your empathy for others can easily morph into a debilitating anger or sadness which won't help anyone now. Shining your light of love and compassion is your only true option.
leo,2016-01-18,"Your life seems to make more sense today as some of the larger pieces of the puzzle fit into place. However, you can't shake the notion that you're just fooling yourself and there are other issues you should be addressing now. Your unsettled feelings contribute to the uneasiness that nags at your current well-being. Nevertheless, you're resigned to perform your assigned role in the wider scheme of things. Your old confidence will return later in the day if you continue going through the motions. You might not be capable of singlehandedly saving the world, but it's worth doing your part."
virgo,2016-01-18,"Your most proficient rational analysis won't help you solve your current dilemma, but you are caught in the trap of thinking it should.  It's impossible to use logic to break out of the binds of logic. You must experiment with poetry, music, dance or any other creation the imagination conjures up. You might not like it, but you're going to have to trust something beyond words. Taking a leap of faith makes you more anxious than you want to admit; nevertheless, embracing the unknown can be so liberating that it may surprise you."
libra,2016-01-18,"Your expectations are blown out of proportion today, setting you up for disappointment. Although the day may not unfold according to your plans, you might decide that denying the dissonance is easier than confronting it. Nevertheless, assuming an adaptable attitude allows you to accommodate changes in your schedule by modifying your agenda accordingly. Your easygoing style rubs off on those around you, creating a supportive atmosphere for all involved. Your penchant for harmony serves you well."
scorpio,2016-01-18,"Interpersonal dynamics are more complex than they seem now. But your extrasensory antennae are so attuned to invisible mysteries that you won't be fooled by the physical world. Nevertheless, you still may try to step around the scary shadows if you're frightened or confused by what you don't understand. There's no time to waste clinging to the familiar because you're feeling insecure about the future. Let go of anything that robs you of your self-confidence. You need as much faith as you can muster because today's dreams are building the foundation for tomorrow's castles."
sagittarius,2016-01-18,"The larger the wheels, the easier they seem to spin. The bigger your ideas, the easier it is for you to get totally lost in them today. Be cautious because you're treading on treacherous ground. You may adopt altruistic causes based upon your current beliefs. You might even think that everything is ethical and on point, but you can deceive yourself now, especially when it comes to spiritual matters. It's less important to be right than it is to find peace and enlightenment."
capricorn,2016-01-18,"Life presents you with a test today to see how far you can stretch reality without breaking it. How fast can you go without hitting the brakes? Although you might be worried that things will get worse before they get better, you have the power to turn your day around. Concentration and hard work pay off now, especially if you let common sense act as your guide. There's no hurry, so start off slowly to set a sustainable pace. You'll gain steam and speed as your momentum carries you along on the road to success."
aquarius,2016-01-18,"You have an ideal vision for the future and it concerns you that everything is so far off from your perfect picture. In fact, you may feel quite  isolated now, because you can't relate to how people are treating your home planet, other animals and even each other. You're dismayed by the state of humanity but you don't have a quick and easy solution. Allowing your attention to wander through the major issues facing the world is healthy as long as you eventually bring your focus back to your immediate environment. Think global but act local."
pisces,2016-01-18,"You're constructing a bridge to your dreams, but you must do it one stone at a time. Unfortunately, the ground beneath your feet isn't very stable. Thankfully, the foundation is strong enough to support you even if the earth shifts. You're expanding your range of possibilities like a child blows up a colorful balloon, but you can't tell where the limits are now. You might not find satisfaction if you always believe the ideal solution is right around the next corner. Happiness is an elusive creature that can only be experienced in the present moment."
aries,2016-01-19,"It's easy to hope that your dreams will come true if you take a risk and tell people exactly what you want today. But the Moon's  awkward connection to Mars can put so much passion into your words that you might frighten others with your intensity, rather than showing your sincerity. Thankfully, adopting a gentler approach allows you to be more convincing when sharing your true intentions. Make the effort to understand your audience before you jump in too fast and steer the conversation in the wrong direction."
taurus,2016-01-19,"You may seek pleasure from an entirely new spectrum of activities today. However, you need to be careful that you don't neglect your responsibilities in the pursuit of emotional gratification. Just remember that entertaining a variety of options doesn't mean that you must act on every whim. You can still make merry while keeping your feet on the ground and meeting your obligations. In the long run, setting priorities gives you the best chance of experiencing life's little joys while working toward lasting satisfaction."
gemini,2016-01-19,"A friend or coworker might reveal an intriguing scheme today, yet you are fearful of getting swept up in a whirlwind of activity that spins your day out of control. There's no harm in relaxing the reins a bit, but don't let anyone take them out of your hands. Although you may think it would be nice not to be in charge for a while, you will find out quickly that you are happier following your own agenda now instead of someone else's. Nevertheless, you never know what is possible unless you keep an open mind."
cancer,2016-01-19,"Your partner or associate is so persistent today that it's difficult for you to refuse their demands. However, it's still wise to take a few deep breaths and give yourself more time to consider what you want before agreeing to anything you might later regret. Don't acquiesce just to win a popularity contest. Step through the awkward process of establishing clear boundaries now. Pursuing your dreams on your own brings more long-term happiness than setting them aside to appease someone else."
leo,2016-01-19,"Everyone wants to know your secret today because you seem unusually cheerful and confident as you go about your business. Luckily, you are blessed to be having fun while fulfilling your everyday responsibilities. Unfortunately, you can't reveal your magical method because you don't have a hidden formula in your pocket. Continue to do what you do best by being honest and living your life as transparently as you can. The simplest things bring you great joy now, even if the current challenges you face demand your attention."
virgo,2016-01-19,"You can get ahead of the game today by taking a clever idea and building on it; just be wary of over-inflating your expectations in the process. It's more advantageous to achieve modest success that leaves you feeling good about your accomplishments now, rather than reaching too high and encountering the disappointment of failure. Thankfully, your current choices aren't set in stone; there will be plenty of opportunities to modify your goals as you learn and grow."
libra,2016-01-19,"You may actually believe that today is your lucky day - and your special fantasy just might come true. Although it's not smart to assume that you'll receive exactly what you wish for now, it's still a good idea to trust your intuition. Your natural flexibility is the key to receiving a surprise that exceeds your expectations. However, stubbornly sticking to your previous agenda could cause you to miss the magic that is knocking loudly at your door."
scorpio,2016-01-19,"Your unrelenting faith in yourself makes a tangible difference today, for your thoughts are  creating a clear blueprint of your future. The inquisitive Gemini Moon is traveling through your 8th House of Transformation, initiating a metamorphosis of your goals. You might be eager to swing into action now and go for exactly what you want. But you won't likely make much progress with bold actions that only encounter obstacles. Instead, focus on your most positive thoughts and let them work their magic. No matter how hard you try, you can't rush the process of a caterpillar becoming a butterfly."
sagittarius,2016-01-19,"You could be feeling uncharacteristically anxious today, but it's not because there is anything specifically wrong. On the contrary, you might worry that you are missing something important in your positive assessment of your current trajectory. Don't let your concerns trick you into impulsively taking corrective action. Just methodically complete as much unfinished business as you can in preparation for the exciting new cycles ahead. Timing is everything."
capricorn,2016-01-19,"You can't help but worry that people are impeding your progress by undermining your positive efforts today. Unfortunately, you may not be able to find any concrete evidence to support your current fears. Ironically, the exact opposite might be true; something you decide to keep secret can have a negative effect on a relationship. Reconsider what you are afraid to reveal and then shine the light of your awareness into this shadow. Bringing your unexpressed truth out into the open is the first step to dissolving the apparent gulf between you and others."
aquarius,2016-01-19,"Don't hold back your creative flow now, even if your dreams seem unrealistic. Your unrestrained imagination enables you to visualize a myriad of possibilities for the future. The Moon's visit to your 5th House of Self-Expression opens multiple doors that can propel you and your friends into the unknown. Rather than allowing logistics to slow you down today, share your visions as they are revealed to you. You can always refine your plans to make them more concrete when you are in a more pragmatic frame of mind."
pisces,2016-01-19,"Separating your personal issues from what you do in the real world isn't a simple task now that the Moon is moving through your 4th House of Emotional Security. Whether you are concerned with your professional status, your role in the community or your place within your family, it's crucial to understand where you stand so you can reconsider where you are going. There's no reason to blindly rush  ahead; instead, create a new agenda based upon your needs and then make a manageable plan to reach your goals."
aries,2016-01-20,"Starting new projects can be quite exciting since you can't wait to see what's next. Although your mind is on fire with lots of amazing ideas, you're not interested in jumping into an unstable set of circumstances just for the thrill factor. But you need to know that even the most brilliant plans you initiate now might not produce tangible results for at least another week. Take your time and make sure you're working toward sensible goals before you set out in a new direction."
taurus,2016-01-20,"You might think you are rounding a corner now and are ready to apply everything you know to get ahead at work. But even your most innovative plan will fail unless you can thoroughly ground it by taking the most practical approach. Leaning on your peers is tempting but only carries you so far. Even if you receive unexpected support today, you'll still be disappointed if you expect too much from others. Practicing self-sufficiency is the safest way to ensure your success."
gemini,2016-01-20,"Your efforts may be for naught today, especially if you try to accomplish too much at once. You want to participate in every cool activity on your radar, but it's best to limit your involvement in projects that don't further your agenda. Trusting your initial impulse is dangerous now because you are likely to underestimate the resources needed to complete a task. Just do the best job you can without making promises that are impossible to keep. Say ""less is more"" until you believe it."
cancer,2016-01-20,"It's tempting to fantasize your way to success because today's vision can grow into tomorrow's reality. However, the Moon's presence in your 12th House of Imagination gives you the wrong impression if you play out a familiar scenario in your mind and assume it will automatically occur. One way to take control is to color your mental pictures in with as much detail as possible. Adding specific pieces of information to your developing ideas facilitates bringing them into existence. Creating a viable plan is the most logical first step as long as it's followed by lots of determination and hard work."
leo,2016-01-20,"It seems as if your current life path is on a collision course with your dreams once you realize where you're going today. However, learning the truth is only the first step in a longer process that can help you break through blocked energy in a relationship. Free yourself from responsibilities you no longer need to carry by letting go of old habits and unhealthy patterns. Exercise your individuality and set yourself back on a realistic course that will lead you straight to your true goals."
virgo,2016-01-20,"Your natural efficiency often separates you from others because you are less worried about social acceptance than you are about getting the details exactly right. Nevertheless, your pursuit of perfection could become a major obstacle on your way to finding happiness today, especially if you feel the pressure of being short on time. Sometimes it's wiser to be expedient rather than getting stuck struggling with the minutiae. The sense of pride you feel is so much more satisfying if you finish the job on time."
libra,2016-01-20,"You are certain your future holds the promise of success and you're willing to wait a little while longer if you think it will help you get what you want. Nevertheless, your patience is running thin and your desires are growing strong. Luckily, it's more constructive to be optimistic because you truly believe that your hard-earned rewards are right around the corner. Your positive attitude, in turn, directly impacts your chances for satisfaction."
scorpio,2016-01-20,"Although channeling most of your energy into your career may be required these days, you still need to schedule a little downtime for yourself. The Sun's shift into conceptual Aquarius and your 4th House of Home and Family motivates you to downplay professional pressures so you can focus on more personal goals. Thankfully, slipping away from the office early won't raise any eyebrows or make you any less productive now. In fact, your newly found joie de vivre enables you to wrap up your work quicker than before."
sagittarius,2016-01-20,"You're conflicted about your options today, yet you know the importance of keeping your word. But with serious Saturn settled into your sign for the long haul, you're tired of being the one who rides to the rescue to bail someone out at the last possible moment. You're tempted to just let things fall apart now, but it's not a smart idea to abandon your commitments. Give it your absolute best shot to help those in need and then call it a day without trying to take responsibility for the actions of anyone else."
capricorn,2016-01-20,"Making an appointment is easy today, but showing up for one may be a lot tougher. However, your current story is not about irresponsibility or disrespect. It's just that you might choose to avoid making commitments for a while because you believe it's wise to explore all your options now. Unfortunately, your newly found compulsion to keep a flexible schedule is counterproductive to your ambitions. Ironically, honoring a calendar gives your day the structure you need to achieve your goals."
aquarius,2016-01-20,"You've been patient long enough; you're pacing the floors, anxious to make your move. The Sun's shift into your heady sign may find you sitting on pins and needles. The road ahead leads into unknown territory, which might surprisingly rattle your nerves. Fortunately, you can reduce the negative effects of your uncertainty by recognizing the pressure comes from within. Take all the time you need to determine your most intelligent course of action before you embark on the next amazing phase of your journey."
pisces,2016-01-20,"You don't want everyone to know your business now that the Sun is camping out in your 12th House of Secrets. Although there's no need to hide your emotional reactions from your friends, it's still prudent to use discretion when revealing your true feelings today. It's really not about the words you speak since people are able to read your intentions through your actions. Thankfully, you can contain your energy by simply monitoring your thoughts and carefully choosing which ones to share. Rely on your instincts to tell you the best time to bring others into your confidence."
aries,2016-01-21,"Engaging others at work may be a struggle today because the super-sensitive Cancer Moon encourages you to find shelter behind a solid wall. You might find yourself worrying about personal matters, distracting you from your assigned tasks. You could even ask for extra time off to take care of a family matter now. Ultimately, increasing your efficiency on the job helps you create a little magic. Completing tasks quickly is the first step to gracefully balancing your private and public obligations."
taurus,2016-01-21,"Staying within your lane can be tricky today because you believe that anything is possible. Nevertheless, your exuberant approach won't even be apparent to others while the introverted Cancer Moon visits your 3rd House of Communication. Although your judgment is clouded by your desires now, you're more likely to err on the side of generosity rather than stinginess. Even if your day doesn't unfold as expected, maintaining a firm grip and a flexible attitude helps to smooth over the rough spots."
gemini,2016-01-21,"Your intuitive hunches could get in the way of having a good time today, but it's not a sensible strategy to ignore your feelings for the sake of convenience. If you try to cover up your misgivings, you may become disconnected from your closest friends and co-workers. Sharing your emotions might seem awkward at first, but initiating a conversation could be enough to dispel the sense of alienation. Revealing a vulnerable spot requires courage, but it's the magic key to deepening a special relationship."
cancer,2016-01-21,"Opening your heart seems more natural today while the evocative Moon is hanging out in your sign. It's even more likely that you will share your aspirations if you're confident about your current course of action. However, others might hesitant to offer their approval, leaving you to wonder whether or not they support your ideas. It's a strategic mistake to over-personalize the feedback you receive now. Instead of wringing your hands in dismay or doubt, get busy and make your plan so awesome that it can't be ignored."
leo,2016-01-21,"It's too soon to reveal your honest feelings today, for others may not be as trustworthy as they appear. A coworker might play off your hopes and entice you to change your mind. But your best strategy now is practicing self-containment; keeping to yourself adds the power of conviction to your dreams. Take time for your inner work and include others in your process only after you are ready. As Francis Bacon wrote, ""Silence is the sleep that nurtures wisdom."""
virgo,2016-01-21,"Staying on track is challenging now because your emotions are at odds with the current circumstances at work. You may not be feeling very practical today, and your perfect strategy might fall apart if it's not based upon real observable cycles. Luckily, cutting back on superfluous activities helps you to concentrate on the most important work at hand. Sticking to your priorities is the most powerful thing you can do when it comes to climbing the ladder of success."
libra,2016-01-21,"Contacting a few key colleagues and asking them for their support can take up a lot of time and energy today. However, you won't likely get anyone to commit to your plan since everyone seems to be pushing an agenda of their own now. Instead of trying to make a river run uphill, pare back your current ambitions just a notch. Simplifying your goals and limiting your conversations greatly increase your chances for success. Narrowing your focus lets you concentrate on what matters most."
scorpio,2016-01-21,"You may be dreaming about an upcoming trip now, but you're not ready to share your plans with the rest of the world yet. You're afraid that people won't understand your needs, so you don't want to waste time justifying your intentions. It's more useful to develop your ideas and take them to the next level before losing steam from responding to any negative judgments. Sometimes remaining silent is the best way to ensure you will have something worthwhile to say later on."
sagittarius,2016-01-21,"Confronting familiar fears that stem from an old relationship wound may seem quite overwhelming today. Hang tight; thankfully, the energy grows lighter as the day wears on. There are gentle cosmic winds blowing now, untangling the complex dynamics and softening your resolve. Learning how to be more comfortable with your emotions will help everyone relax. Interactions with others can take on a life of their own now, yet practicing the art of compromise is your saving grace."
capricorn,2016-01-21,"You need more clarity in your relationship world now, but the security you crave may be nearly impossible to find if others aren't playing by the same rules of the game. You could feel let down when someone doesn't match your high expectations for consistency or productivity. Getting your colleagues to sign on to your deadline seems like a positive step today, but this strategy doesn't mean they will actually deliver on their promises. Unrelenting patience and a healthy sense of humor are essential tools to have on hand during these uncertain times."
aquarius,2016-01-21,"You're feeling out of your element today as your unmet desires swirl around, creating complex currents and subtle nuances that are hard to deconstruct. The simplest task requires extra time to complete now, simply because you don't want to do things the same old way. If you can use your enthusiasm for exploring new methods to jump into an emotional discussion, you may be pleasantly surprised with the outcome. Temporarily setting logic aside opens the door to life-changing ways of seeing your world."
pisces,2016-01-21,"Your brilliant thinking fuels your best efforts today, but their execution may be thwarted, anyhow. Nevertheless, your willingness to let go of your original course of action enables you to overcome the current obstacles without much hassle. Paradoxically, you -- and not the circumstances -- create the limitations now. Unfortunately, a can-do attitude and hard work won't be enough to achieve success. Your unwavering persistence is your ticket to the top."
aries,2016-01-22,"You've been surfing the waves of change with such concentration that you forgot to give much thought to what you will do next. Now that you have a little time to contemplate life, you can begin to see how much has already shifted at the workplace. Nevertheless, tread lightly today; there are still more twists and turns ahead. Don't let any words slip out of your mouth before you consider the effects of your message. Think first, talk later."
taurus,2016-01-22,"Your perceptions are as sharp as a razor today, making it unlikely that anyone will pull the wool over your eyes. Oddly, you may be able to hear words in your brain before they are actually spoken; it's almost like you possess x-ray vision of the mind. Be careful how you wield this temporary superpower, for inappropriate usage will only get you into more trouble than it's worth. To whom much is given, much is required in return."
gemini,2016-01-22,"You might see a power play unfold right before your eyes at your place of work -- and it appears to be aimed at you. Don't worry about your counter-move; just do whatever you can to minimize the pressure today. Avoid direct confrontation at all costs, for it won't lead you to a better situation now. Even if you can just delay the showdown until next week, things will work out better in the long run. Giving yourself time to get your ducks in a row before you come out swinging offers you the best chances for success."
cancer,2016-01-22,"Your partner or lover may raise a sensitive subject today. Your opinions are strong, making it nearly impossible to avoid an intense conversation about an important matter as verbose Mercury runs into passionate Pluto. Your only viable strategy is to stay focused on what's real. No matter what kind of emotional distractions are brought into the equation, bring the discussion back to the topic at hand. And, always remember that love has the power to overcome even your deepest fears."
leo,2016-01-22,"Although harmony at work might be elusive now, a bit of emotional intensity won't slow you down. Your highest priority is to reestablish the balance of your life so you can improve your overall perspective. A large part of your attention is concentrating on the big picture now. Nevertheless, it's imperative to also focus on the drama in front of you. Don't let go of your high ideals and great visions, no matter what you encounter along the way."
virgo,2016-01-22,"Mischief could be your cup of tea today while chatty Mercury and relentless Pluto scheme in your 5th House of Spontaneity. All interactions take on a greater significance and you can't seem to turn the intensity off. The problem is that what starts out as simple entertainment may quickly turn into a cut-throat competition. Although you might believe that your survival is at stake now, it's not. Changing the rules so that everyone can win makes you the most valuable player in the game."
libra,2016-01-22,"You are your own greatest distraction now, yet you might choose to keep your thoughts quiet. Your newly formed ideas aren't anyone else's business so there is no need to share them with others. Even if you don't reveal the nature of your inner world today, give yourself permission to explore it on your own. Muster up the courage to go wherever your imagination takes you, for there are surprises in the darkness that can lead you back into the light."
scorpio,2016-01-22,"It may be impossible to ignore the difference between what's right and what's wrong today. You're ready to jump on your soapbox and speak your mind, but people still might think you are sitting on the fence now. However, there is nothing uncertain about your beliefs. In fact, it's wise to remember that your decisions are not as simple as you think. Allow the complexity to surface, for there could be a better solution available that's still buried by the noise."
sagittarius,2016-01-22,"You feel the urge to make a public stand about something that's ubiquitously important to you. But remember, you are treading on unstable ground while trickster Mercury is busy hooking up with shadowy Pluto. Thankfully, your determination won't let up no matter the amount of resistance you run into now. However, you can perpetuate your dreams if you fly under the radar today. Whatever is going on, things can change in unexpected ways. Avoid the excitement of the bright lights and just keep yourself on the right track."
capricorn,2016-01-22,"The missing ingredient to your secret sauce of success now is mental intensity. The emotionally potent Mercury-Pluto conjunction falls in your ambitious sign, making you a formidable force to be reckoned with today. But ironically, you might be overly worried that other people's arrows of thoughts will be able to pierce even your toughest armor. Although your impulse may be to attack first, everything will work out better if, above all things, you remember to be gentle and kind."
aquarius,2016-01-22,"You can say things with the utmost care today yet your words might have totally unexpected effects. Unfortunately, others may not hear you clearly while mischievous Mercury is still retrograde, blurring the boundaries between you and those in your immediate environment. You might read the situation wrong because you overlooked an important piece of information. Don't go out on a ledge until you are sure that you have all the facts in hand. And once you declare your position, be ready to change your mind if necessary. Flexibility is your secret weapon for success."
pisces,2016-01-22,"Social activities seem to be lingering long past the holiday season. You may have assumed that the rowdiness would gradually settle down, but the flames are fanned back to life each time they do. The intensity of your interactions with others might even surprise you today. Try going along with the group instead of taking on the entire community. Wait until next week when Mercury turns direct before you make a scene you will later regret."
aries,2016-01-23,"You might believe the strength of your convictions is enough to overcome a challenging relationship issue now. The Leo Full Moon emphasizes your 5th House of Self-Expression, possibly triggering an emotional outburst that can help your cause as long as you remain reasonable. Don't ride roughshod over other people's feelings; if you inadvertently offend anyone, be gracious and apologize as soon as you realize your mistake. Rather than fanning the flames of drama today, let it go. Take the high road and move forward to love."
taurus,2016-01-23,Your tireless patience with a domestic concern is stretched to the breaking point as the Leo Full Moon activates your 4th House of Family. The dynamics of a minor crisis are complicated by pressures that prompt you to juggle the private aspects of your life with public responsibilities. Just don't let laziness get in the way of what must be done now. Start early in the day and apply yourself steadily until all of your personal and professional obligations are wrapped up to your satisfaction.
gemini,2016-01-23,"Planning for the future is just as necessary as keeping up with your current commitments. However, the fiery Leo Full Moon is shining in your 3rd House of Immediate Environment, indicating that your life is incredibly busy now. Consider where you want to go from here and start creating proactive plans to reach your goals. Achieving tangible success may take longer than you think, but don't let frustration hijack your ambitious trajectory. Believing in your dreams is the first step to making them real."
cancer,2016-01-23,"You Crabs are naturally more susceptible to the energy of the lunar cycles than the other signs, and the proud Leo Full Moon highlighting your 2nd House of Values is no exception. You feel a sense of urgency to hold on tightly to your current position. Nevertheless, a project that hasn't reached fruition might begin to lose its appeal today, making you wonder if it is wiser to walk away before it's too late. Pushing your current work ahead as long as it's still relevant is more productive than heading back to the drawing board."
leo,2016-01-23,"You may seem extremely intense while the extroverted Leo Full Moon illuminates your 1st House of Self. Luna's opposition to the willful Sun in your 7th House of Relationships can trigger contentious arguments now, especially if you just assume communication will solve a difference of opinion today. Actually, you might scare someone away with your brazen confidence. Instead of acting like a know-it-all, just explain your thought process and then listen to everyone else's story with a generous heart. Roar less, purr more."
virgo,2016-01-23,"You must respond to an emotional dilemma as today's demonstrative Leo Full Moon exposes your 12th House of Secrets. You are obsessed with figuring out how you can express yourself while also maintaining your privacy on certain aspects of your life. Partially sharing information can be tricky business because you may find it tough to stop talking once you start. Set clear limits before you open your mouth, so there's no ambiguity as to how far you will go in your disclosure."
libra,2016-01-23,"You might inadvertently squelch the fun at a social gathering now that the warmth of your key planet Venus is constrained by her arrival in conservative Capricorn. Nevertheless, the playful Leo Full Moon reflects your 11th House of Friends, encouraging you to tell someone what you need. Luckily, others will take you seriously without misunderstanding your demands if your intentions are pure. Fortunately, with a little diplomacy you can be an integral part of the group while also acting in a responsible manner."
scorpio,2016-01-23,"It's natural to express yourself passionately in your work today because the Leo Full Moon heats up your 10th House of Career. Paradoxically, you can maintain a sense of objectivity even if your emotions are an integral part of the equation. But don't wait for people to create your reality now; instead of sitting on the sidelines or playing the role of a cheerleader, go out there and make something happen. Visible progress may take longer than you expect, so let your faith and determination lead the way."
sagittarius,2016-01-23,"Your heart is fixed on setting aside your previous plans so you can pursue a bigger and better goal. The melodramatic Leo Full Moon amps up your 9th House of Adventure today, but keeping your life in balance is a smarter strategy. Unfortunately, you could miss a real opportunity if you aim too high. Follow a practical course of action now, instead of jeopardizing your emotional and fiscal security. Thankfully, you can meet your current obligations while still holding onto your dreams for the future by coloring within the lines."
capricorn,2016-01-23,"Although you might be afraid that people will judge you negatively, your authority doesn't need to slip as long as you are honest about your concerns. The lively Leo Full Moon fires up your 8th House of Deep Sharing today, feeding fears if you're feeling emotionally vulnerable. Meanwhile, Venus shifts into your reserved sign, tempting you to overcompensate by hiding your feelings. However, once you start taking risks by sharing what's in your heart, your attitude will lighten. Laughter is the best medicine, especially if the truth is a bitter pill to swallow."
aquarius,2016-01-23,"Opening your heart is advisable today as long as you don't go overboard with your true confessions. The childlike Leo Full Moon casts your 7th House of Relationships in the spotlight, provoking you to share your feelings about your romantic attractions. Just remember that what you don't say now might have greater significance than what is spoken aloud. If you come on too strong, people may worry that you expect something in return. Just casually express what's on your mind and then allow the rest of the story to unfold on its own."
pisces,2016-01-23,"Nearly any physical exercise will help calm your nerves, but you'll feel much happier if you accomplish something useful while exerting yourself today. The innocent Leo Full Moon brightens your 6th House of Work, creating a palpable tension between your playful desires and your current obligations. Of course, you can reduce the stress by expending some of your excess energy sweating at the gym. However, you earn karmic bonus points now if you channel your passion into furthering your ambitions."
aries,2016-01-24,"Instead of complaining about the weekend chores that are still on your plate today, quickly prioritize the tasks and decide which ones can be temporarily set aside with no ill effects. It's healthy to make time for guilt-free fun while the creative Leo Moon is kicking up her heels in your 5th House of Play. Although you're eager to join in social activities, you're not sure how much personal freedom you must sacrifice to be a part of the group. Risk-taking is favored now; the only way to discover your limits is to jump on the bandwagon and embrace the unknown."
taurus,2016-01-24,"If ever there was a day to fly beneath the radar, this would be it. Consider yourself lucky if you don't have to work today, since the reflective Moon's presence in your 4th House of Home and Family turns your energy inward. However, if you can't avoid a trip out into the big wide open, at least keep your private world with you in the form of your daydreams. Hold your favorite visualizations close like a child clutching a favorite security blanket. No one can take your sense of comfort away from you unless you let them."
gemini,2016-01-24,"You are flitting to and fro today, riding the energy of the showy Leo Moon as she activates your 3rd House of Distraction. However, your early warning system is picking up on annoying changes that are looming on the horizon. You sense a storm is on its way and you feel the undercurrent of adrenaline in anticipation of what's ahead. Thankfully, you are more than ready for the action. Timing is everything now so don't make your move too soon; your efficiency will soar if you wait until after Mercury turns direct tomorrow."
cancer,2016-01-24,A creative approach to managing your finances can greatly improve your situation today. You might suddenly discover a way around an obstacle that's prevented you from buying something you set your heart on. Don't worry if your plan isn't completely in place because there's no rush to iron out every detail yet. Investing in something of value is a smart move now as long as you're not fooling yourself into believing it's something you really need. Discernment is your friend.
leo,2016-01-24,"People seem to be reading your emotions as if they are written on your forehead today. You're not necessarily one to bury your heart, but now that the moody Moon is making noise in your fiery sign it's as if your feelings are being broadcast on a loud speaker for everyone to hear. There's nothing to be gained by withdrawing from those who love you the most; the give and take of a honest dialogue can help you clarify what you really want."
virgo,2016-01-24,"There are valid reasons for not saying everything that's on your mind today. Someone might assume you're telling the entire story, but there is a great danger in jumping to conclusions for everyone involved. Still, it's smarter now to stay mum on the subject than to lay your internal conflict out on the table where others feel forced to deal with your unresolved feelings. You can always share more once the intensity begins to subside and you have a better handle on the situation."
libra,2016-01-24,"You might believe that everything will change today, but you are experiencing trouble filling in the details of what's next. You are approaching the close of a chapter in your life, but you can't determine where the plot is heading. Tie up as many emotional loose ends as possible since you won't have time to look back once the pace accelerates next week. Lighten your load now so you will be ready for your big adventure when it calls your name."
scorpio,2016-01-24,"You are facing a complex dilemma while trying to resolve a conflict between your head and your heart. Logically, you know what you must do and are prepared to play your hand accordingly. Nevertheless, you might be uncertain about which of your emotions can be trusted today. Keep in mind this is not the best moment to turn your life upside down just because you are unsure of which path to follow. Your patience is your strong suit now; fortunately, time is on your side."
sagittarius,2016-01-24,"Others will follow your lead if you can be your own boss and set a proper example. Relying on long-winded rationalizations won't work today because your arguments are not very convincing. It's fortuitous that your current actions speak louder than words since you're at the top of your production game. However, you could get a bee in your bonnet and go off on some half-cocked crazy idea. People may respond favorably and offer their support even if your plan is without merit. Be the responsible one and stop yourself before you do something you will soon regret."
capricorn,2016-01-24,"You're not content to just paddle around in shallow waters today. You long to dive into the deeper places, where your search for meaning overshadows reality itself. The Moon's visit to your 8th House of Regeneration can stimulate complicated feelings. These aren't simple times as old emotional hurts might come back to haunt you. Thankfully, there are blessings to be found in the current process of discovery. If you are willing to do the inner work and face the issues, profound healing can occur on many levels to change your life for the better."
aquarius,2016-01-24,"Nearly everything you say and do creates an immediate reaction today. Oddly enough, the fallout from following your intuition isn't what you expect. You must respond to each situation as it unfolds, even if it steals your time and energy from more enjoyable activities. You can't resist the inevitable; as frustrating as it might be to stick to your agenda, there may not be much you can do to change the overall course of events. Surrendering the reins of control is your sanest strategy."
pisces,2016-01-24,"You could wear yourself out trying to make up for someone else's shortcomings today. Even if you're fully committed to a family gathering or another type of group event, you still want to be recognized for your unique contribution. However, there's no need to be overly concerned if others are receiving all the credit now. The tide will turn soon enough as long as you continue to maintain integrity in your words and deeds. Being true to yourself empowers you to emerge as the hero you are missing in your life."
aries,2016-01-25,"You might have thought all was sitting pretty within your world, but it becomes apparent today that something was wrong all along. You may not be able to fix it immediately, but that won't stop you from trying now. Keep in mind that your tendency to impulsively respond to a crisis isn't always the most productive solution. Putting things right is going to take some serious time and thought. Proceed with great determination but don't expect miracles overnight."
taurus,2016-01-25,"You can't help but feel frustrated if you haven't made much tangible progress toward your goals this year. Nevertheless, there's no reason to fret because the planets asked you to make some very big plans and then required you to begin very slowly -- so slowly that it may seem as if you've been moving backwards. Actually, no time has been wasted at all. If you remain patient and persistent, you'll see over the next month how your delayed start was just what you needed to be successful."
gemini,2016-01-25,"Although you may be weary of all the little setbacks you've already faced this year, you are rather hopeful that your path is finally clearing now. Even if a series of mix-ups and frayed loose ends are taxing your patience, don't even think about giving up today. There were important lessons to learn over these last few weeks, but it might take additional time to figure out what they mean in regards to your future. In the meantime, try not to judge yourself harshly for what you haven't yet finished. Being a student of life is an integral part of the soul's journey."
cancer,2016-01-25,"Your thoughts have been preoccupied with all kinds of relationship issues over these last weeks and it's not always been easy to face the truth. Conflicting emotional needs, stirred by Mercury's recent retrograde through your 7th House of Others, now seem to need immediate resolution. But current tensions may be a result of simple misunderstandings. The only way to find out is to engage in an open dialogue. Luckily, the tides are turning now, enabling everyone involved to be more forgiving. A strong partnership starts with honest communication."
leo,2016-01-25,"These past few weeks may have thrown you a few curve balls, making it difficult to follow through with your normal daily routine. This period of testing isn't quite over, but today marks a turning point in the energetic flow. Pay attention to what unresolved issues resurface now, for these specific problem areas hold keys to the solutions of even larger questions. The pace of positive change picks up over the next few days if you're willing to push for progress."
virgo,2016-01-25,"Although you are in the midst of a highly creative phase, your ideas have been unable to gain traction this year. You might even feel as if you are running around in circles or covering old ground. Since Mercury is your key planet, its three-week retrograde cycle affected you more strongly than most. Thankfully, this deja vu phase is coming to its conclusion. You've been treading water long enough; it's finally time to move forward. Keep in mind, this energetic shift can take a few days to find its rhythm, but you should prepare for blastoff at any given moment."
libra,2016-01-25,"Maybe Nietzsche was right when he suggested that we live in a cycle of eternal recurrence, revisiting the same issues again and again. However, this feeling that you've been here before is actually an opportunity to break out of your old patterns. Strong foundations are crucial for your future success, and you have a chance to firm up your base as Mercury turns direct in your 4th House of Roots. What you start now can develop into something of lasting value if you're committed to do the work."
scorpio,2016-01-25,"You're beginning to realize that the future is coming at you faster than ever before. The pace of your everyday life may have slowed down to a crawl while Mercury was retrograde in your 3rd House of Immediate Environment. Or, even if events were moving at a more rapid pace, you felt lethargic and couldn't catch up. However, the time for you to make changes is today. Look back over the past month and decide if you want to stay in the comfort zone you created or if you're ready to explore unfamiliar ground. Sometimes ""later"" really means ""never."" Act now or forever hold your peace."
sagittarius,2016-01-25,"You have an opportunity to experience some healing around issues of self-esteem now that logical Mercury is turning direct in your 2nd House of Values. This personal challenge is about examining your core beliefs, your sense of self and how you built a philosophical foundation that protects you from your own emotional pain. You might put a lot of energy into making people think you're wide open to new experiences when secretly you're not. Fortunately, the solution is simple today; change the way you think, which in turn opens new paths for the adventure of self-discovery."
capricorn,2016-01-25,"You might feel weighted down by your own heavy thoughts, but you don't seem to be able to work your way out of your current predicament. It's as if you're close to understanding something very important, but it keeps vanishing like a dream fading in the morning light. For the past three weeks, cerebral Mercury has trudged backward in your sign requiring you to go over things one more time to make sure you have them right. Now, as it turns direct, review time is over. The future is calling; don't look back."
aquarius,2016-01-25,"You are on the verge of your dreams coming true. You replayed your favorite fantasies over and over again while mental Mercury retrograded through your 12th House of Spirituality during the past three weeks. But imagination opens the way for reality as quicksilver Mercury's direct turn motivates you to get real now. You still have plenty of sweat equity to invest but, thankfully, your revitalized determination can give substance to your visions. Intention plus hard work equals magic."
pisces,2016-01-25,"Your friends and associates are simultaneously a great help and a major pain in the neck today. They may remind you of a past hurtful situation without even realizing it. You might choose to push these memories away -- or you can embrace conversations that initiate a deeper healing process. Open your heart and you'll experience interesting changes within the next week or so. As Lao Tzu wrote, ""Nature does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished."""
aries,2016-01-26,"You have been trying to manage career-related issues based on old information while Mercury did its retrograde dance in your 10th House of Profession. Although you made valiant efforts to  move forward, your thinking was stuck in the past. However, it's now time to let go of recent events and get serious about executing your plans. Although you may temporarily lack confidence, don't seek security by looking back. It will take a few days until you gain enough objectivity to see that you're truly on the right track."
taurus,2016-01-26,"You are finally ready to share your opinions on a delicate matter. You wisely kept your feelings to yourself as you developed your ideas because you didn't want to rock the boat until you were sure your position could be defended. Although you have the certainty of facts and the power of conviction on your side, the dynamics are trickier than you might think. Your words pack an extra punch now, which can put others off. Toning down your intensity is the key to creating the positive effect you desire."
gemini,2016-01-26,"You can tell that a power shift is in the air now that messenger Mercury has turned direct in your 8th House of Deep Sharing. You might feel as if you're a kite at the whim of the changing winds. Although it's always a temptation for you adaptable Twins to pursue the next intriguing curiosity, it makes more sense to anchor yourself to the ground, stick around and dig beneath the surface. Paradoxically, the most profound growth occurs if you can hold your position for a few more days and face your fears."
cancer,2016-01-26,"You could receive a visit from an old friend or acquaintance tied to your past as mischievous Mercury spins around in your 7th House of Companions. Meanwhile, issues at work grow more complicated now as a topic that was discussed weeks ago returns to the forefront. Whatever surfaces today may prove to become more important over the next week or so. Scan the significant events of the last few weeks to ascertain if there is any unfinished business that still needs to be completed. Stepping into the future is easier when your house is in order."
leo,2016-01-26,"You may not want to say everything you are thinking today, but you know exactly what's going on and you know what you need to do about it. However, you're emotionally sensitive now, but your inner stress isn't apparent to others. You're uncharacteristically cautious because you intuitively understand how significant these days are to your success, and you don't want to blow your chance. Trust your instincts and make your move only once you're truly ready."
virgo,2016-01-26,"Your emotional reactions are strong today while the moody Moon is howling in your sign, yet it may be tricky to express what's going on within your heart. If you reveal your feelings to others, you could inadvertently change the game and things might intensify too quickly. Keeping your thoughts quiet isn't a bad strategy now if you don't want to upset the apple cart. Nevertheless, you can't predict the future, so leave room to share your desires with someone special as circumstances permit."
libra,2016-01-26,"Your ideas continue to be innovative and bold, but you can scatter your precious energy today instead of using it wisely. Even if your mental game is in top form now, sloppy thinking could prevent you from reaching your final destination. Take a few deep breaths and then get back to work; your current confidence will help you achieve your goals on time. Your mantra for the day is ""pushing the river won't make it go faster."""
scorpio,2016-01-26,"Focusing your fierce intensity on your goals heightens your senses in the present moment. Your fixed purpose allows you to see straight into the eye of the hurricane. Thankfully, you have nothing to fear now and might even gain strength from experiencing the stillness of the center. The time for contemplation is over; fortunately, you can jump back into the winds of change and reclaim your power when you're ready to move boldly into your future."
sagittarius,2016-01-26,"You might forget about your chores today as you wistfully replay childhood fantasies. Perhaps you are dreaming about possessing super-hero powers, imagining what you would accomplish if you could defy gravity, stop time or eliminate evil. Although your most human characteristics are all too obvious, you still can perform magic in everything you do. Don't fritter away your time. Be fearless and use your creativity to express the passion in your heart."
capricorn,2016-01-26,"Although you are quite clear about the road ahead, it feels as if something is wrong with the picture today. You can't put your finger on your uncertainty, but an inner voice is telling you not to trust your desires now. Normally, you're an expert at compartmentalizing your emotions if they interfere with your progress; however, shutting down your feelings is not a smart plan while Venus is casting her spell in your sign. Stay connected with your heart, no matter how inconvenient it may be in the moment."
aquarius,2016-01-26,"You might be concerned that something is lurking on the outskirts of your awareness today. Unfortunately, you could waste valuable resources in pursuit of the unknown keys to your life. Sometimes a mature attitude is required to let go of a goal that can't be reached, instead of setting yourself up for further disappointment. Review the past few weeks and make up your mind to push past anything that has been holding you back from following your destiny."
pisces,2016-01-26,"It's as if the entire world has temporarily stopped spinning, just to give you extra time to think through a pesky problem. However, Mercury's direct turn in your 11th House of Long-Term Goals indicates a change of direction. If you recently made a decision that greatly impacts your future, take one more look at the alternatives before heading down the new path. Reconsidering your options one last time is wise now; once you make up your mind there's no going back."
aries,2016-01-27,"You may be emotionally conflicted today because it's not all that easy to restrain your impulses. You are worried about misplacing your efforts, yet you also enjoy the feeling of inner power. Your concern is sufficient to stop you from wasting your talents by succumbing to your need for immediate gratification. You understand that waiting for the right moment is necessary now to insure you great success. Philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau reminds us, ""Patience is bitter, but its fruit is sweet."""
taurus,2016-01-27,"You are all about momentum today, making it tricky to change direction on a moment's notice. If you are taking it easy, you want to continue doing nothing until you feel enough pressure to make you uncomfortable. But if you've been on the move since you jumped out of bed, it will be tough to stop. Once you make your mind up, you are reluctant to switch teams mid-stream. Don't let your fixed ways get the best of you since change is necessary whether you are ready for it or not."
gemini,2016-01-27,"You might experience a minor meltdown today as you temporarily perform like a perfectionist. It's not that you're necessarily sloppy by nature; it's just you usually are happy to let go of something once you are done with it. Nevertheless, you're currently motivated to obsess over every little detail, and you don't want to leave any loose ends untied. Your uncharacteristic tenacity may trigger a power struggle with someone who isn't supportive of your idea of precise execution. If necessary, don't be afraid of digging in your heels to honor your truth."
cancer,2016-01-27,"Your feelings are larger than life today, but you still prefer to keep them to yourself. Although people might attempt to manipulate you by pulling on your heartstrings, you possess the strength to hold onto your point of view without budging. However, you could cling to your perspective so adamantly now that others think you're the one trying to control them. Avoid the temptation to engage in an unnecessary battle of wills. Ironically, the situation will take care of itself without any outward fuss on your part if you simply smile and walk away."
leo,2016-01-27,"You're encountering a strange bout of self-doubt today, but you will find a more positive place to land before you know it. Your feelings and actions seem to be out of kilter with each other now, yet your coworkers might not even notice the difference. Nevertheless, being overly cautious one moment and more exuberant the next can feed unrealistic expectations in those around you. Maintaining a code of transparency prevents unnecessary complications later on."
virgo,2016-01-27,"Lingering problems that re-stimulate past memories have been festering quietly beneath the surface. These could be your feelings or someone else's, but in either case it's a perfect time to face the music and talk it out. An unpleasant encounter or awkward moment might act as the catalyst, but once the emotions are out in the open, there is great potential for resolving the conflict. Take a deep breath and speak from your heart. Visualize a positive outcome and it will be yours."
libra,2016-01-27,"You feel close to making a breakthrough concerning your spiritual beliefs, but you might have to wait a little bit longer before shouting it from the rooftop. Perhaps you have been dreaming about a new direction in life, but kept your wishes quiet. Now it's time to finalize your plans before putting them into motion. But don't let your best ideas leak out prematurely; the greatest obstacle to your potential success comes from glossing over details and spreading yourself too thin. Fools rush in where angels fear to tread."
scorpio,2016-01-27,"You could be so enthusiastic about your future that you lose proper perspective. Unfortunately, it is your inflated confidence that can lead to trouble today. Be willing to question your own assumptions and listen to what people are telling you without putting up protective defenses. It's only when you think you already know the truth and shut people out that you have cause for worry. You have nothing to fear if you keep an open mind and act with a humble heart."
sagittarius,2016-01-27,"Archers are cosmically blessed with the gift of seeing the world through a wide-angle lens. After all you are known to be the great philosophers and travelers of the zodiac. However, you're more cautious in your thinking today. Paradoxically, narrowing your scope of vision allows you to open your mind wider than before. It's as if carefully fine-tuning your ideas makes them more popular. It seems like everyone wants to jump on your bandwagon, so make sure your motives are clear and honorable. Success is more easily achieved if you are looking out for the good of all."
capricorn,2016-01-27,"There are days for action and days for planning. You may be less productive today, but your analytical abilities are operating at their optimum. What you currently lack in physical stamina is compensated by your practical organizational skills, which are working on overdrive. For now, forget about your shortcomings and focus on what you do best. Establishing an ambitious but sustainable strategy to achieve future success is a highly efficient use of your time."
aquarius,2016-01-27,"You are quite philosophical about life now, making this a perfect time to reconsider lingering emotional issues that are weighing on your mind. Your current advantage is your ability to see where your personal needs are not being satisfied without losing objectivity. If a relationship is the source of struggle today, be rational about the reality of the situation so you can make intelligent decisions about what to do next. Don't look too far off into the future. Handle the most immediate issues first before solving the problems of the world."
pisces,2016-01-27,"Your current interactions with people are the source of both good news and bad news now. The good news is amazing opportunities are knocking loudly at your door. However, the bad news is you might be so enchanted with what you are already doing that you can't stop to let them in. A chance of a lifetime won't just stand there waiting forever, so jump up and joyfully embrace the future while the planets are smiling in your direction."
aries,2016-01-28,"You might think you're being incredibly flexible today and that everyone should just fall in line with your plans. However, your faulty assumption could lead to awkward relationship dynamics as others tire of acquiescing to your demands. Don't wait for someone to lose their temper before you are willing to listen to their concerns. Acknowledging your rigidity around certain issues creates a focal point for a conversation. Talking it out gives you the best chance for working things out to everyone's satisfaction."
taurus,2016-01-28,"Finding a healthy balance between work and play may be a necessity today, especially if you recently took some time off. The Moon's shift into your 6th House of Daily Routine demands that you attend to the details of your job. Temporarily set aside your big plans so you can make certain nothing slips through the cracks. Paradoxically, narrowing your vision opens a field of possibilities that you might have never seen without changing your perspective."
gemini,2016-01-28,"It's no use shutting off your creativity for the sake of convenience today. You must make the necessary corrections to everyone's unrealistic expectations, even if your irrepressible ideas get in the way of doing your work. However, you won't be able to simply ignore your responsibilities; you need to deliver on your promises sooner or later. Just remember, the longer you procrastinate, the more complex your job becomes. Dancing between two worlds is not a luxury now; it's a requirement."
cancer,2016-01-28,"Burying your feelings isn't necessary today since it seems you can get away with revealing whatever you choose. However, the more you keep to yourself, the harder it will be when you finally want to open up. Unfortunately, you might not get to pick the moment to come clean, especially if you wait too long. Although it may be challenging to get the conversational ball rolling now, you'll be more relaxed once everything is out on the table. Unburden your heart while you have the chance."
leo,2016-01-28,"You can be so wrapped up in your perspective today that it impacts everything you do. Unfortunately, you might mistakenly think your beliefs are the basic building blocks of everyone's work. However, this kind of over-generalization will undoubtedly lead to chaos and conflict. Recognizing multiple points of view as valid is your current key to happiness. You could be unpleasantly shocked into awareness by someone at work if you stick to your assumptions. It's better to be the lightning than to be struck by it."
virgo,2016-01-28,"It seems as if the weight of the world is being lifted from your shoulders today, but the real issues are still lurking in the shadows waiting for their moment to pounce. Nevertheless, you're inclined to take the easy way out now, rather than responding in your typically responsible manner. Your current thinking is more influential than you realize and you could pay a high price for slacking off. Balance your desire to relax with your astute understanding of consequences. Although you might want a vacation, karma is still at work."
libra,2016-01-28,"You believe you can clearly see both sides of an important issue today, but your perspective is more limited than you realize. The Moon's return to your sign blesses you with increased objectivity, but there are more subtle energies at play than you might expect. There's no doubt that you are aware of the opposing points of view. Nevertheless, the solution may come from a totally different direction. It's not an either/or dilemma; the hidden harmonies are the best when it comes to uncovering the truth."
scorpio,2016-01-28,"Although you're a champion at holding your feelings close to your heart, you might need to take your skills to the next level today. The Libra Moon's visit to your 12th House of Secrets motivates you to weigh and balance every thought before deciding whether or not to share it. Although this constant process of consideration takes a lot of energy, it forces you to anticipate the possible reactions to every disclosure you make. Your words have more power when none are wasted."
sagittarius,2016-01-28,"Finding a comfortable place among your peers isn't usually a challenge for you socially savvy Sagittarians. But there are unspoken undercurrents undermining your easygoing approach today and you cant put your finger on the source of the negativity. The harder you search, the deeper the energy sinks -- as if it has initiated evasive tactics because it knows you're looking for it. Denial is not an often-recommended strategy, but now it works to your advantage. If you only acknowledge what is on the surface, the rest will transform and morph into a more positive expression."
capricorn,2016-01-28,"Your professional motivation is tempered with a healthy dose of common sense today. Rather than setting ambitious objectives that lack rhyme or reason, you're more willing to moderate your need to succeed with a desire to retire. The equalizing Libra Moon is influencing your 10th House of Career, helping you balance work with relaxation. Let the extremes fall toward the center. Nothing will be lost in the long run if you take time out to recharge your batteries."
aquarius,2016-01-28,"It's as if your blinders are finally removed and now you can see further off into the distance than before. In fact, you may be quite excited by what's unfolding right in front of your eyes and you want to push the limits as far as possible -- even if you haven't yet made a sustainable plan. Don't let anyone else's judgments of what you should or shouldn't do damper your enthusiasm. Your attitude will, undoubtedly, go through its ups and downs as your vision continues to develop. Destiny is not a matter of chance; it's a matter of choice."
pisces,2016-01-28,"Someone may block your progress today, but not necessarily through any overt actions. However, a powerful person's words could send ripples through your social network. Or, a coworker might present an unflattering analysis of your pet project that triggers your insecurities, sending you into a tailspin. Flip the criticism in your favor by incorporating the best ideas into your own. Graciously accepting the additional point of view no matter its source swiftly turns an enemy into an ally. A grateful mind is a powerful mind."
aries,2016-01-29,"Your natural tendency to run the show can be blown out of proportion today. Your ability to visualize the best way to complete a project tempts you to exert control over your coworkers. But you may be so certain of your plan that you miss what your associates are bringing to the table. Relaxing the rigidity of your single-mindedness will be a relief to everyone, including you. There are many roads that lead to the same destination. A healthy exchange of ideas produces a successful collaboration."
taurus,2016-01-29,"Your plans to embark on a great adventure have gone through plenty of ups and downs over the past couple of months. Following the twists and turns of your schemes has been an exhausting task for your friends. Finally, you can solidify your itinerary, but convincing others that your current decisions are final is another story. Fortunately, there's no need to try so hard to prove you mean business. Let your actions speak for you rather than your words and everyone will be suitably impressed."
gemini,2016-01-29,"The Twins are known for their gift of gab and keeping a conversation light and easy. But sometimes you can annoy people with your witty repartee that tap dances around the real issues. However, messenger Mercury's alignment with transformational Pluto pulls you into the underworld and compels you to talk about subjects normally hidden in the shadows. Don't waste this powerful moment searching for the nearest exit. Going deep maximizes the potential for positive change."
cancer,2016-01-29,"You're sensitive to the perspectives of others even if they don't support your current actions. You might try to avoid an intense conversation today, but people won't leave you alone until you finally agree to engage. However, the process of honest dialogue can raise uncomfortable feelings that alter your basic assumptions about relationships. It's not fun stepping into the uncertainty of emotional transformation, but you will emerge with a new direction and increased self-worth. No pain, no gain."
leo,2016-01-29,"You may have initiated an intense reevaluation of your lifestyle during the holiday season, revisiting your concerns throughout this month. Now it's time to make a commitment, focus your intentions and put a concrete plan into motion. But don't attempt to change too much all at once. Start small and don't backtrack instead of turning your life inside out and then falling back into old habits. Making several minor improvements to your daily routine one at a time will produce lasting results. Slow and steady wins the race."
virgo,2016-01-29,"Your need to be understood can make you quite aggressive in your communication today. You might not ask whether or not someone is interested in what you have to say; you just go ahead and share what's on your mind anyhow. However, you won't find satisfaction in spewing your intense reactions where they're not invited. You can still make your point; just take the time to confirm that your audience wants to go along for the ride before you grab the wheel."
libra,2016-01-29,"You're not willing to let go of a piece of your past, even if you would be better off without it. In fact, you can be quite obsessive today, as if you need one last dance with nostalgia before moving on. Thankfully, you've reached a transition point and are already anticipating what comes next. However, there's no reason to force the process. Give yourself permission to sink into your memories; you still have time to recover buried treasure before heading out to explore new lands."
scorpio,2016-01-29,"You might not be able to fight the urge to say what's on your heart. Even if you recently avoided the intensity of taking someone to task, it's nearly impossible to keep your feelings quiet today. Honesty is the best policy, but you will only make your life more difficult by being too blunt. No matter what news you have to share, it can be done in a constructive and compassionate manner. Kindness is the key to your success."
sagittarius,2016-01-29,"Your world will seem in perfect order today if your professional ambitions support your idealistic philosophy of life. But you may sense trouble brewing if your values are pulling one way while your career trajectory is otherwise aimed. Everything doesn't need to be in alignment just yet, but you must create a sensible plan that you can execute with finesse. Being true to yourself is essential, but the practicalities of everyday life cannot be ignored."
capricorn,2016-01-29,"It's your intention to be evenhanded while dealing with difficult political dynamics at work today. However, your patience is growing thin and your true feelings might overwhelm your strategic thinking. Even your best-laid plans can fall apart as circumstances change in unexpected ways. Work with your current intensity, but don't let it get the best of you. Although flexibility is your friend, there's no reason to overreact by changing your goals. Modify your approach and your method without altering your destination."
aquarius,2016-01-29,"You have a lot on your mind today, but might choose to keep most of your opinions to yourself. Although you put a lot of effort into maintaining a sunny disposition on the surface, some folks will still see through your pleasant veneer. Ultimately, it's less awkward to reveal your thoughts, especially since honesty is so important to you. Even if people have a hard time with your ideas at first, they will get over it eventually. Luckily, you already know you don't have to conform to the group to be well respected."
pisces,2016-01-29,"You may find yourself in the middle of a squabble with friends today, and it's possible that your disagreement stems from divergent values. However, it's tricky to maintain a close relationship now if your likes and dislikes seem so vastly different. Chances are you've covered this ground before, but don't let its familiarity pull you into the same conclusions as the previous rounds. You're moving into new territory and you can take the current interaction in an entirely new direction. Instead of assuming resolution is required, seek common ground and understanding, instead."

Now it's time to make a commitment, focus your intentions and put a concrete plan into motion. But don't attempt to change too much all at once. Start small and don't backtrack instead of turning your life inside out and then falling back into old habits. Making several minor improvements to your daily routine one at a time will produce lasting results. Slow and steady wins the race."
virgo,2016-02-03,"Your need to be understood can make you quite aggressive in your communication today. You might not ask whether or not someone is interested in what you have to say; you just go ahead and share what's on your mind anyhow. However, you won't find satisfaction in spewing your intense reactions where they're not invited. You can still make your point; just take the time to confirm that your audience wants to go along for the ride before you grab the wheel."
libra,2016-02-03,"You're not willing to let go of a piece of your past, even if you would be better off without it. In fact, you can be quite obsessive today, as if you need one last dance with nostalgia before moving on. Thankfully, you've reached a transition point and are already anticipating what comes next. However, there's no reason to force the process. Give yourself permission to sink into your memories; you still have time to recover buried treasure before heading out to explore new lands."
scorpio,2016-02-03,"You might not be able to fight the urge to say what's on your heart. Even if you recently avoided the intensity of taking someone to task, it's nearly impossible to keep your feelings quiet today.

Kindness is the key to your success."
sagittarius,2016-02-03,"Your world will seem in perfect order today if your professional ambitions support your idealistic philosophy of life.

Being true to yourself is essential, but the practicalities of everyday life cannot be ignored."
capricorn,2016-02-03,"It's your intention to be evenhanded while dealing with difficult political dynamics at work today. However, your patience is growing thin and your true feelings might overwhelm your strategic thinking. Even your best-laid plans can fall apart as circumstances change in unexpected ways. Work with your current intensity, but don't let it get the best of you. Although flexibility is your friend, there's no reason to overreact by changing your goals. Modify your approach and your method without altering your destination."
aquarius,2016-02-03,"You have a lot on your mind today, but might choose to keep most of your opinions to yourself. Although you put a lot of effort into maintaining a sunny disposition on the surface, some folks will still see through your pleasant veneer. Ultimately, it's less awkward to reveal your thoughts, especially since honesty is so important to you. Even if people have a hard time with your ideas at first, they will get over it eventually.

taurus,2016-02-04,"Your plans to embark on a great adventure have gone through plenty of ups and downs over the past couple of months. Following the twists and turns of your schemes has been an exhausting task for your friends.

taurus,2016-02-09,"Your plans to embark on a great adventure have gone through plenty of ups and downs over the past couple of months.

leo,2016-02-09,"You may have initiated an intense reevaluation of your lifestyle during the holiday season, revisiting your concerns throughout this month. Now it's time to make a commitment, focus your intentions and put a concrete plan into motion. But don't attempt to change too much all at once. Start small and don't backtrack instead of turning your life inside out and then falling back into old habits.

sagittarius,2016-02-14,"Your world will seem in perfect order today if your professional ambitions support your idealistic philosophy of life. But you may sense trouble brewing if your values are pulling one way while your career trajectory is otherwise aimed. Everything doesn't need to be in alignment just yet, but you must create a sensible plan that you can execute with finesse. Being true to yourself is essential, but the practicalities of everyday life cannot be ignored."
capricorn,2016-02-14,"It's your intention to be evenhanded while dealing with difficult political dynamics at work today. However, your patience is growing thin and your true feelings might overwhelm your strategic thinking. Even your best-laid plans can fall apart as circumstances change in unexpected ways. Work with your current intensity, but don't let it get the best of you. Although flexibility is your friend, there's no reason to overreact by changing your goals. Modify your approach and your method without altering your destination."
aquarius,2016-02-14,"You have a lot on your mind today, but might choose to keep most of your opinions to yourself. Although you put a lot of effort into maintaining a sunny disposition on the surface, some folks will still see through your pleasant veneer. Ultimately, it's less awkward to reveal your thoughts, especially since honesty is so important to you. Even if people have a hard time with your ideas at first, they will get over it eventually. Luckily, you already know you don't have to conform to the group to be well respected."

Chances are you've covered this ground before, but don't let its familiarity pull you into the same conclusions as the previous rounds. You're moving into new territory and you can take the current interaction in an entirely new direction. Instead of assuming resolution is required, seek common ground and understanding, instead."
aries,2016-02-15,"Your natural tendency to run the show can be blown out of proportion today. Your ability to visualize the best way to complete a project tempts you to exert control over your coworkers.

taurus,2016-02-15,"Your plans to embark on a great adventure have gone through plenty of ups and downs over the past couple of months.

Let your actions speak for you rather than your words and everyone will be suitably impressed."
gemini,2016-02-15,"The Twins are known for their gift of gab and keeping a conversation light and easy.

leo,2016-02-15,"You may have initiated an intense reevaluation of your lifestyle during the holiday season, revisiting your concerns throughout this month. Now it's time to make a commitment, focus your intentions and put a concrete plan into motion. But don't attempt to change too much all at once. Start small and don't backtrack instead of turning your life inside out and then falling back into old habits. Making several minor improvements to your daily routine one at a time will produce lasting results. Slow and steady wins the race."
virgo,2016-02-15,"Your need to be understood can make you quite aggressive in your communication today. You might not ask whether or not someone is interested in what you have to say; you just go ahead and share what's on your mind anyhow.

libra,2016-02-15,"You're not willing to let go of a piece of your past, even if you would be better off without it. In fact, you can be quite obsessive today, as if you need one last dance with nostalgia before moving on. Thankfully, you've reached a transition point and are already anticipating what comes next. However, there's no reason to force the process. Give yourself permission to sink into your memories; you still have time to recover buried treasure before heading out to explore new lands."

leo,2016-02-20,"You may have initiated an intense reevaluation of your lifestyle during the holiday season, revisiting your concerns throughout this month. Now it's time to make a commitment, focus your intentions and put a concrete plan into motion. But don't attempt to change too much all at once. Start small and don't backtrack instead of turning your life inside out and then falling back into old habits. Making several minor improvements to your daily routine one at a time will produce lasting results. Slow and steady wins the race."
virgo,2016-02-20,"Your need to be understood can make you quite aggressive in your communication today. You might not ask whether or not someone is interested in what you have to say; you just go ahead and share what's on your mind anyhow.

You can still make your point; just take the time to confirm that your audience wants to go along for the ride before you grab the wheel."
libra,2016-02-20,"You're not willing to let go of a piece of your past, even if you would be better off without it. In fact, you can be quite obsessive today, as if you need one last dance with nostalgia before moving on. Thankfully, you've reached a transition point and are already anticipating what comes next. However, there's no reason to force the process. Give yourself permission to sink into your memories; you still have time to recover buried treasure before heading out to explore new lands."

You're moving into new territory and you can take the current interaction in an entirely new direction. Instead of assuming resolution is required, seek common ground and understanding, instead."
aries,2016-02-26,"Your natural tendency to run the show can be blown out of proportion today. Your ability to visualize the best way to complete a project tempts you to exert control over your coworkers. But you may be so certain of your plan that you miss what your associates are bringing to the table. Relaxing the rigidity of your single-mindedness will be a relief to everyone, including you. There are many roads that lead to the same destination. A healthy exchange of ideas produces a successful collaboration."
taurus,2016-02-26,"Your plans to embark on a great adventure have gone through plenty of ups and downs over the past couple of months. Following the twists and turns of your schemes has been an exhausting task for your friends. Finally, you can solidify your itinerary, but convincing others that your current decisions are final is another story. Fortunately, there's no need to try so hard to prove you mean business. Let your actions speak for you rather than your words and everyone will be suitably impressed."
gemini,2016-02-26,"The Twins are known for their gift of gab and keeping a conversation light and easy. But sometimes you can annoy people with your witty repartee that tap dances around the real issues. However, messenger Mercury's alignment with transformational Pluto pulls you into the underworld and compels you to talk about subjects normally hidden in the shadows. Don't waste this powerful moment searching for the nearest exit. Going deep maximizes the potential for positive change."
cancer,2016-02-26,"You're sensitive to the perspectives of others even if they don't support your current actions. You might try to avoid an intense conversation today, but people won't leave you alone until you finally agree to engage. However, the process of honest dialogue can raise uncomfortable feelings that alter your basic assumptions about relationships. It's not fun stepping into the uncertainty of emotional transformation, but you will emerge with a new direction and increased self-worth. No pain, no gain."
leo,2016-02-26,"You may have initiated an intense reevaluation of your lifestyle during the holiday season, revisiting your concerns throughout this month. Now it's time to make a commitment, focus your intentions and put a concrete plan into motion. But don't attempt to change too much all at once. Start small and don't backtrack instead of turning your life inside out and then falling back into old habits. Making several minor improvements to your daily routine one at a time will produce lasting results. Slow and steady wins the race."
virgo,2016-02-26,"Your need to be understood can make you quite aggressive in your communication today. You might not ask whether or not someone is interested in what you have to say; you just go ahead and share what's on your mind anyhow. However, you won't find satisfaction in spewing your intense reactions where they're not invited. You can still make your point; just take the time to confirm that your audience wants to go along for the ride before you grab the wheel."
libra,2016-02-26,"You're not willing to let go of a piece of your past, even if you would be better off without it. In fact, you can be quite obsessive today, as if you need one last dance with nostalgia before moving on. Thankfully, you've reached a transition point and are already anticipating what comes next. However, there's no reason to force the process. Give yourself permission to sink into your memories; you still have time to recover buried treasure before heading out to explore new lands."
scorpio,2016-02-26,"You might not be able to fight the urge to say what's on your heart. Even if you recently avoided the intensity of taking someone to task, it's nearly impossible to keep your feelings quiet today. Honesty is the best policy, but you will only make your life more difficult by being too blunt. No matter what news you have to share, it can be done in a constructive and compassionate manner. Kindness is the key to your success."
sagittarius,2016-02-26,"Your world will seem in perfect order today if your professional ambitions support your idealistic philosophy of life. But you may sense trouble brewing if your values are pulling one way while your career trajectory is otherwise aimed. Everything doesn't need to be in alignment just yet, but you must create a sensible plan that you can execute with finesse. Being true to yourself is essential, but the practicalities of everyday life cannot be ignored."
capricorn,2016-02-26,"It's your intention to be evenhanded while dealing with difficult political dynamics at work today. However, your patience is growing thin and your true feelings might overwhelm your strategic thinking. Even your best-laid plans can fall apart as circumstances change in unexpected ways. Work with your current intensity, but don't let it get the best of you. Although flexibility is your friend, there's no reason to overreact by changing your goals. Modify your approach and your method without altering your destination."
aquarius,2016-02-26,"You have a lot on your mind today, but might choose to keep most of your opinions to yourself. Although you put a lot of effort into maintaining a sunny disposition on the surface, some folks will still see through your pleasant veneer. Ultimately, it's less awkward to reveal your thoughts, especially since honesty is so important to you. Even if people have a hard time with your ideas at first, they will get over it eventually. Luckily, you already know you don't have to conform to the group to be well respected."

aries,2016-02-29,"Naturally, you prefer to be in total control of your fate, but these days you seem to spend more time responding to external circumstances than creating your own direction. You're more dependent on the skills of other people and the resources they bring to the table now than is comfortable. Fortunately, you can still manifest your destiny if you repeatedly reaffirm your personal goals. Your independence is not in jeopardy just because you are willing to accept someone else's gifts in order to maximize your potential."
taurus,2016-02-29,"Although you recently slipped into your fantasies and are enjoying your reverie now, it's time to establish a basis for your visions in the three-dimensional world. However, the Moon's current visit to your 7th House of Companions is a gentle reminder that you can't ignore the people in your life. Instead of withdrawing from social interactions today, it's better to fully engage in the relationship dance. Your chances for success improve if you face the facts instead of hiding out in the safety of your imagination."
gemini,2016-02-29,"You might not be able to avoid the tricky waters you are sailing through today. Although a complex relationship situation is still developing, it's obvious that you need to separate out the big ideas floating around so you can dive into a specific problem. Setting aside your personal whims helps you handle the volatility of the current situation. Self-restraint is your secret weapon now; save the most important discussions for later in the evening when the planets are more conducive for conflict resolution."
cancer,2016-02-29,"You are quite adept at expressing your passions creatively today with the powerful Scorpio Moon's presence in your 5th House of Spontaneity. Thankfully, you can claim your share of fun now without sacrificing the deeper meaning of the moment. Surprisingly, your emotional intensity is appreciated by others. A romantic encounter is favored if you're willing to demonstrate your vulnerability by honestly asking for what you want. You might be pleased with the response you receive when you reveal the wishes of your heart."
leo,2016-02-29,"Complicated interpersonal dynamics on the home front might lead to a lingering conflict. Fortunately, your annoyance has time to settle down on its own if you shift the focus by returning to school or work today. Nevertheless, you can help to ease the pressure by acknowledging the emotions that are lurking just beneath the surface and bringing them out into the open. Although an honest conversation could feel awkward at first, it gives you the chance to clear the air of tension before the bad vibes get out of hand."
virgo,2016-02-29,"Communication may feel strained today, but it's crucial to keep a healthy perspective on personal and business relationships instead of focusing on an issue that ultimately doesn't matter. Your current concern isn't about your message; it's whether to broach a sensitive topic or remain silent. Unfortunately, denying the problem is not a long-term solution. Ben Franklin said, ""Tricks and treachery are the practice of fools who don't have brains enough to be honest."" Sit down for a heartfelt discussion now before it is too late."
libra,2016-02-29,"You are an expert at maintaining an even-keeled approach to a stressful situation at work. However, you're fearful of hitting rocks that you cannot see today. It's nearly impossible to tell if you are paddling into the deeper waters now or if it's shallow. Either way, you must get to the bottom of the dilemma or you'll run aground. Reassessing your position enables you to reestablish equilibrium. Reconnecting with your core values helps you regain control of your vessel. Keeping your balance is possible when you know where you stand."
scorpio,2016-02-29,"A journey into your private world of unexpressed emotions is often triggered by the Moon's monthly visit to your sign. However, it's even more complicated this time around because someone might appear to be angry with you, but won't share their feelings. Thankfully, there's no reason to struggle for understanding now; it's just your insecurities rising to the surface. Simply observe what's happening around you without taking everything so personally; no one can fault your intentions if your heart is in the right place."
sagittarius,2016-02-29,"You're tempted to withdraw into your own world today by running off to join a monastery, escaping to a quiet spot in nature or just hiding out in your office. Unfortunately, retreat isn't a viable option now. There are simply too many demands being made on your time. You are obliged to be clearheaded -- not only for your own good, but also for the people who depend on you. Struggling to stay in the communication loop  will pay off over the weekend when social activities bring you the satisfaction you seek."
capricorn,2016-02-29,"It's your intention to be evenhanded while dealing with difficult political dynamics at work today. However, your patience is growing thin and your true feelings might overwhelm your strategic thinking. Even your best-laid plans can fall apart as circumstances change in unexpected ways.

You're moving into new territory and you can take the current interaction in an entirely new direction. Instead of assuming resolution is required, seek common ground and understanding, instead."
aries,2016-03-01,"Although current challenges may go unresolved today, it might seem as if you are on a temporary holiday. It's not that the pressing predicaments have disappeared into thin air; it's just your spirits soar with the Sagittarius Moon, allowing you to fly above the troubles that complicate your life. You're free to dream about visiting your own future, even if it's only a figment of your imagination. Luckily, your positive thoughts can have more of an uplifting impact on your life than you could ever expect."
taurus,2016-03-01,"You are inspired by your dreams this week but this doesn't mean that every wish will automatically manifest according to your favorite fantasy. Nevertheless, practical thinking isn't the answer now because your imagination can help you envision what you want. Acknowledging your extreme idealism might not help you reach your goals, but it minimizes disappointment from setting in when you confront the limits of reality. Dream big, work hard and stay humble."
gemini,2016-03-01,"Relationship tensions might be exacerbated by your unrealistic ideas today. Ambitious plans won't necessarily create problems all by themselves; the real difficulty stems from the apparent impossibility of living out your adventures in the real world. Nevertheless, it isn't constructive to needlessly worry about what will happen next. Simply make sure everyone realizes you know the difference between the facts and your fantasies. Muhammad Ali said, ""The man who has no imagination has no wings."""
cancer,2016-03-01,"Someone turns the passion up enough that you might change your mind today, preventing you from sinking into a deep emotional stew. However, your current discomfort is alleviated when you rise above the drama by refocusing on a project you put aside a few days ago. Remember, you're not escaping from responsibility; the unresolved issues will still be there upon your return. Feelings are like waves; you can't stop them, but you can choose which ones to surf."
leo,2016-03-01,"Gentle breezes blow through the hidden backwaters of your mind. This new awareness stimulates memories of something you really wanted in the past but life required you to put it on the back-burner. The refreshing movement is actually a sign that you're not as trapped as you believed. Although the changes you desire won't happen overnight, you should feel better just knowing that they're not as far away as you thought. The trick is to never forget that you are the master of your own destiny."
virgo,2016-03-01,"You might feel like you're stuck in an invisible eddy of cosmic energy today, even if others are supporting you. However, the help you currently receive doesn't necessarily improve the circumstances that ultimately need to change. Your closest friends may honestly believe their behavior is nurturing, but they could be exerting too much emotional control. Thankfully, this imbalance won't last long, so rather than making waves just go along with the present conditions for now. Today's frustration leads to tomorrow's satisfaction."
libra,2016-03-01,"You're less self-contained today and you may experience a strong urge to communicate your thoughts and feelings to others. Your current restlessness might get the best of you now, prompting you to take action. Heading out into the real world is a good start; anything that stirs up the energy will also elevate your mental game. Seek out like-minded souls who also want to make positive changes and exchange ideas for further inspiration. People coming together as a community can make things happen."
scorpio,2016-03-01,"Your life is taking on the appearance of a great adventure and although this can be scary territory, it is also exciting to dance with the unknown. Your higher self knows that you are on a path meant for you alone. Meanwhile, the fiery Sagittarius Moon offers you a fresh perspective on all the powerful emotions you've been experiencing lately. Be careful what you wish for today, since your current desires help to crystallize your future."
sagittarius,2016-03-01,"Any encouragement received today is good for your mental outlook. Unfortunately, you may not be getting all the rest you need since free-floating anxiety still lingers in the atmosphere. Fortunately, the Moon's current visit to your sign symbolizes emotional rejuvenation, especially if you've recently experienced some turmoil. Accept the fact that there isn't a quick fix to your dilemma. Slowing down and living in the present moment frees you to also create the life you want."
capricorn,2016-03-01,"A chapter in the book of your life is drawing to a close. However, there are still many elements to be prioritized before launching your next project. Most importantly, give yourself enough time to focus on your closest relationships. Regardless of any current interpersonal struggles you might be embroiled in now, take a few minutes to smell the flowers when you get the chance. Yesterday's the past, tomorrow's the future, but today is a gift."
aquarius,2016-03-01,"You can't avoid the myriad of things you need to do today, but at least you can see some light at the end of the tunnel. The notion of finally coming out on the other side is thrilling because it seems you've been subterranean long enough. You're more than ready for the fresh air and blue sky, but everyone else's schedules may prevent you from reaching your destination until later in the week. There's no need to hurry; rest assured you are on the right track."
pisces,2016-03-01,"You are acutely aware of the role you are to play today, but you might not be able to deliver on all of your promises. Thankfully, your intentions are honorable and you inspire others with your cheerful willingness to champion nearly any good cause. However, you might inadvertently leave your own needs out of the mix. Taking care of yourself isn't being selfish; attending to your health and well-being now enables you to continue helping others."
aries,2016-03-02,"You're so eager to get what you want today that you might make your move too soon. You may be totally perplexed if your enthusiasm is dampened by insignificant events. But it's challenging to know exactly how much self-restraint to apply since you don't want to overwhelm anyone with your irrepressible intensity. On the other hand, neither do you want to miss your chance. Thankfully, maintaining a cool demeanor and a healthy perspective will guide you in the right direction."
taurus,2016-03-02,"You may be uncharacteristically impatient today, latching onto any ideas that help to justify your cause. Although sensual Venus hints at the potential of exciting pleasures as she continues to offer you an effective solution to your dilemma, it's tricky putting your knowledge to work. Containing the current energy takes more effort than you initially realize. There's no reason to rush ahead now; you will have a better chance of reaching your destination if you slow down to establish a steady pace that you can sustain for the long haul."
gemini,2016-03-02,"You're longing for a transition now because the lack of structure could grant you additional freedoms. But you still might struggle to try to find your rhythm today because the speed of change keeps shifting between too slow and too fast. Unfortunately, the more you believe you can control the direction of the day, the greater your level of frustration. Let go of your preconceived  agenda and enjoy the ride. Spontaneity is your friend."
cancer,2016-03-02,"Your adaptability to sudden change may pay off today, but your current victory is only a short-lived solution to a complicated problem. You might be able to prevent yourself from blindly speeding ahead because you realize that it's smarter to take your time. However, you can't prevent the wheels of progress from grinding on. Eventually, you must lift your foot from the brake and adjust to the faster pace of life."
leo,2016-03-02,"You are committed to breaking out of a rut today, but something unexpected might happen at the last minute to thwart your best efforts. Thankfully, your discouragement won't last long, since it's nearly impossible to feel disappointed when there are so many positive signposts that keep leaking into the mainstream. Satisfaction seems to be right around the next corner. Your penchant for excitement will be rewarded if you can keep things low-key for a little while longer."
virgo,2016-03-02,"Emotional shocks add to the recent buildup of intensity, issuing a wake-up call to anyone not paying attention. You can feel the cosmic surge of energy now as electric Uranus zaps sweet Venus. Nevertheless, you still must be careful to take care of your needs or you could end up depleting your reserves. Don't waste your physical and mental resources by chasing every single enticing idea that crosses your radar screen today. Make a sensible plan of attack and stick to it until you produce tangible results."
libra,2016-03-02,"You could be swept up by someone's enthusiasm today, but don't relinquish your own dreams in the process. It requires a high level of expertise to establish a healthy balance between the boundless adventure awaiting you in a relationship and your personal drive toward success. Whatever you decide to do now, it's not wise to just agree with your friends so you can take the easiest way out. Listen to your heart before making any significant decisions that you might later regret."
scorpio,2016-03-02,"You can clearly see the end destination to your professional trajectory, which encourages you to work diligently on a project today so you will achieve success down the line. Unfortunately, there are always circumstances beyond your control, so avoid additional stress now by concentrating on your goals without worrying about all the logistics. Instead of visualizing the big picture, focus on manageable milestones along the way. Inch by inch it's a cinch; yard by yard it's hard."
sagittarius,2016-03-02,"An all-too-familiar dilemma may resurface now that the Moon is back in far-seeing Sagittarius. You are ready to choose between boldly charging ahead without a plan and waiting until you're fully prepared for the next step. You truly understand the wisdom of patience, but you still prefer to move quickly today. Your current drive for self-expression is powerful, so be sure to maximize the potential of the moment with a healthy dose of common sense. Ultimately, balance is the key to your success."
capricorn,2016-03-02,"Your friends and coworkers seem to have lost touch with reality today as they get swept up in a flurry of impatience. You might feel as if you're the only person left with any common sense because you're willing to stop and actually consider the consequences of your actions. Nevertheless, being cautious without sounding negative involves some gentle diplomacy. Don't worry if others criticize your need for a more reliable approach to success; they will come around to appreciate your solid advice in due time."
aquarius,2016-03-02,"You can't settle into a consistent rhythm at work today, which could make you feel socially awkward. One moment you are bombarding everyone with your crazy ideas, but then suddenly your embarrassment prompts you to overcompensate by keeping your mouth zipped. Don't put too much effort into following the middle path between these two extremes or you might end up being disheartened by your lack of progress. Let the instability play itself out and then your solution will be crystal clear."
pisces,2016-03-02,"Embracing criticism is your wisest strategy today, especially if your erratic energy is flying all over the map. Thankfully, an acquaintance's accurate perceptions and clear feedback might offer just the right advice you need to turn your scattered initiatives into a highly effective action plan. Nevertheless, don't take anything you are told too personally; just listen carefully and be patient while deliberating your next move."
aries,2016-03-03,"Although you may wake up feeling invincible, running into an unexpected problem could motivate you to reconsider your strategy. You might question your chosen path even if you have recently been hopeful about your future. Luckily, your self-doubt won't likely last for very long if you stand back and reassess your strengths and weaknesses. Nevertheless, be careful not to overdo it by attempting to make up for lost time once you're back on track. A wise superhero knows her limitations."
taurus,2016-03-03,"You might actually believe your thinking is extremely practical today, but you could be sadly misleading yourself. You're tempted to take a risk if you are playing catch-up with your work now, but you may try so hard that your extra efforts actually complicate matters more. Instead of worrying about doing the right thing, just follow your instincts without hesitation. Aligning your actions with your intent will enable you to reach your goals in the nick of time."
gemini,2016-03-03,"A friend who recently encouraged you to be more adventurous may suddenly turn on you for no apparent reason. Fortunately, you know better than to listen to someone who assumes authority without having earned it. Nevertheless, it's still smart to avoid confrontation if you find yourself in a conflict with a previous ally today. Your current actions produce unpredictable results, but the tension will subside on its own if you are willing to wait it out. Taking the tolerant route is a winning strategy."
cancer,2016-03-03,"There's a touch of cosmic luck in your corner and you might receive a helping hand from an unknown person today. Or perhaps the missing piece of a puzzle just fatefully slips into place as if guardian angels are working on your behalf. However, fulfilling your destiny won't happen without work, so be prepared for a challenging road ahead. Nevertheless, focusing your mind on your goals -- even if distracted by an odd twist of circumstances -- should minimize your delays."
leo,2016-03-03,"You really don't know what to make of a rapidly changing situation at work now. You shift from being fine with the instability to freaked out and back to okay in a matter of minutes. Although these extreme mood changes may be mildly confusing to you, your emotional intensity can be truly disconcerting to others. Consequently, you're wise to keep your feelings to yourself until they settle down. Channel your passion into your art and your clarity will soon return."
virgo,2016-03-03,"You're feeling quite confident about your role in your relationships today and may even appear a bit self-righteous if you offer advice to those around you. However, your swagger could put someone off, especially if it doesn't seem to resonate with what's actually going on. Instead of sounding sincere now, you might come across as pompous or even overbearing. Toning down your enthusiasm prevents you from stirring up unwanted resistance. Demonstrating your vulnerability inspires others to do the same."
libra,2016-03-03,"You are excited to see a world full of opportunities today, but for some reason can't seem to turn any single one of them into anything real. Instead you could waste too much time chasing rainbows, only to discover that someone beat you to the pot of gold. Ironically, pacing yourself at work is currently your smartest strategy. There's no need to try so hard to impress others. If you relax your expectations now, good fortune will come to you on its own accord."
scorpio,2016-03-03,"You might believe you can't win today, no matter what you do. If you choose to change your mind, you could later wish that you didn't. But if you stick to your recent decision, you may end up frustrated at yourself for being too rigid. Luckily, neither of these approaches means you will fail to reach your goal. Remember, there's a big difference between judging yourself harshly and actually missing your mark. Treat yourself as kindly as you would treat someone else."
sagittarius,2016-03-03,"You could feel like a yo-yo spinning on its string today as your moods swing up and down, again and again. As soon as you figure out something important, your perspective shifts along with your goals. Your peers may grow weary of listening to your latest and greatest plan, especially if you present it each time as if it is a closing argument in front of a jury. Don't rush your final proclamation because it's going to change before you know it. Talk less, think more."
capricorn,2016-03-03,"Don't be so certain that an impulsive urge will set you on the right path, even if it seems like the right thing to do. The Moon's return to your sign today may leave you feeling on edge as she stirs an array of intense feelings. Keep in mind that it's senseless to engage in philosophical debates that have nothing to do with managing the practicalities of life now. Keeping your priorities straight and taking one step at a time is not a guarantee for success, but it certainly moves you in the right direction."
aquarius,2016-03-03,"Sticking with an apparently successful plan doesn't necessarily mean progress will be a piece of cake. You might assume your persistence is the key to obtaining results, but in fact, success is more likely tied to your flexibility now than to sheer determination. Show others how well you can listen and let them know that you're willing to incorporate their best ideas into your own strategy. The willow tree persists because of its ability to bend in the wind."
pisces,2016-03-03,"Avoid making any long-term decisions today because your thinking is so inconsistent that it's running you ragged. Unfortunately, it might be all too easy to make a bad choice now because you can see the big picture just fine but you can't concentrate on the details. Nevertheless, you still could create an innovative plan with the right resources and community support; just remember that your ideas will need further development and clarification in the days ahead."
aries,2016-03-04,"You may hear something in the tone of a friend's voice that leads you to believe they are not on your side while mischievous Mercury short circuits your cerebral wiring today. Luckily, you can avoid overreacting by staying aware of your current tendency to make everything more dramatic than it actually is. Ultimately, your decisions should work out for the best as long as you don't jump to conclusions that justify unkind behavior. Make peace, not war."
taurus,2016-03-04,"Your intention to be fair-minded with everyone doesn't overcome your lack of objectivity today. It's not easy to express your irritation with someone close to you, because you don't want to waste energy on emotions that detract from the work you need to do. Unfortunately, pretending like everything is okay only adds to your annoyance. Take a deep breath and then share your feelings, but do it without blaming anyone else in the process. Instead of finding fault, find a remedy."
gemini,2016-03-04,"It seems as if your professional status is at stake, but you're probably so suspicious now that you make a mountain out of a molehill. Unfortunately, warrior Mars forms a conflictive aspect to your key planet Mercury, luring you into an unpleasant exchange of words. Step back before reacting; it's more important that you understand what's currently happening before you try to fix it. The first step toward change is awareness."
cancer,2016-03-04,"Someone could unexpectedly accuse you of being negative today while you believe you're acting more like a Pollyanna. However, others might demand that you explain your behavior and your denial won't do much to change anyone's mind. There's no reason to let yourself get sucked into peripheral dramas, but it will feel better to get your frustration out into the open. Honesty creates harmony."
leo,2016-03-04,"You might not be willing to devote enough time now to explain your current actions or, possibly, your rationale for doing nothing at all. You think it's your inarguable right to keep your feelings to yourself. Nevertheless, you could inadvertently add more confusion to the situation if you don't share your motives when given the opportunity. Even if you believe there are better things to do today, let your coworkers know exactly what's on your mind. Communication is the lifeblood of healthy relationships."
virgo,2016-03-04,"People may encourage you to discuss a topic you usually prefer to avoid. But once you start talking, it may be difficult to know when to stop because expressive Mars antagonizes interactive Mercury today. Even if you know better, you could lose your temper now and give someone a piece of your mind. However, angry words won't make anyone happier, so think twice before you escalate a minor difference of opinion into an open conflict. Listen to understand and not to reply."
libra,2016-03-04,"Your rational logic isn't enough to keep the peace today as chatty Mercury squares combative Mars. Unfortunately, your colleagues might not play fairly when they refuse to engage in a discussion, even if all you want is a bit of honest feedback. Paradoxically, communication may work backwards now; if you try too hard to start a conversation, people will just retreat even further. Fortunately, giving others room to breathe allows them to come out of their shells at their own pace."
scorpio,2016-03-04,"Another layer of frustration is unpeeled today as you try to manage an already tricky situation. Thankfully, you possess the stamina to follow through on whatever you start now. But your hopes are larger than your follow-through, tempting you to bite off more than you can chew. Taking a few steps backward to reconsider what makes the most sense is currently the most viable strategy. Don't let one bad moment stop you from reaching your goal."
sagittarius,2016-03-04,"You may become entangled in lengthy philosophical discussions today. Although words roll off your tongue, they won't likely lead to anything useful. You might grow annoyed if others are less than forthcoming with their true intentions now that cranky Mercury is at cross purposes with contentious Mars in your 12th House of Secrets. You can't understand why people don't just come right out and say what they're thinking. Even if satisfaction is elusive, practicing tolerance teaches you that many meaningful things can be communicated without words. Silence is a source of great strength."
capricorn,2016-03-04,"An interaction may not be what it appears if friends are rude and belligerent now. Unfortunately, your self-composure can be quite irritating to someone whose emotions burn hotter than yours. A solution to the current imbalance isn't necessarily the obvious one. Rather than telling others to back off today, you might need to reveal your vulnerability. Ironically, a looming fight could be avoided by your willingness to express your feelings before a conflict grows out of hand. Open your heart and see who follows."
aquarius,2016-03-04,"You wish to be left alone today so you can finish your work before the weekend, but everyone continues to bother you with their ideas. Instead of overreacting, adjust your attitude about what's happening in the present moment. If you try to prevent others from speaking their minds now, they might angrily grow even more vocal. But if you take their suggestions in stride, they will feel acknowledged and you could even learn something valuable in the process. An honest dialogue cultivates positive change."
pisces,2016-03-04,"You experience everything with greater intensity today and your emotional sensitivity can be draining on those around you. But turning off your feelings is not the solution, since all forms of avoidance or denial just charge the atmosphere with even more tension. However, you don't need to express every thought or share every passion that stirs your soul. Discretion is being able to raise your eyebrow instead of your voice."

virgo,2016-03-08,"Everyone seems a lot less reliable today as the Pisces Solar Eclipse fogs your 7th House of Partners. You expect one thing to occur, but something else appears out of left field. You could become anxious if you're too rigid in your approach to the day. Being less self-critical now also enables you to relax your judgment of others. Developing a flexible attitude is a smart strategy to get you through these uncertain times. As George Bernard Shaw wrote, ""Those who cannot change their minds cannot change anything."""
libra,2016-03-08,"A healthier diet and a more disciplined exercise plan usually sounds like a sensible idea, but you might lack the commitment necessary to make it work. Nevertheless, the imaginative Pisces New Moon Eclipse activates your 6th House of Habits, motivating you to begin a new regimen to improve your well-being. Fortunately, your sincere intentions empower you to start a new routine that has a lasting positive impact. Making an enduring little change now is better than a big one that doesn't last."
scorpio,2016-03-08,"A romantic fantasy may be exactly what the doctor orders today, even if you don't actually say a word about it for the sake of propriety. The magical Pisces Solar Eclipse flows through your 5th House of Love and Creativity, potentially inspiring a wonderful experience. Don't be concerned if the pleasure takes place only within your imagination since it still can have real implications if you choose to act on your feelings now or later on. Whether or not you tell anyone your secrets, acknowledge your current attractions without worrying about where they could lead."
sagittarius,2016-03-08,"You are wise to keep your feelings to yourself today as the disorienting Pisces New Moon Eclipse electrifies your 4th House of Roots. Even if you must head out into the world, your emotions are best left at home now. Sharing your private life at work might not be your smartest move if you want to be taken seriously. But don't slip into denial by shutting yourself off from your heart. Writing in a journal or talking about your personal issues with a trusted confidant is the safest bet. Discretion is your friend."
capricorn,2016-03-08,"A close friend or associate might do something that is totally out of character today, but don't let someone else's behavior become the main focus of your day. Although the Pisces Solar Eclipse unsettles your 3rd House of Communication, you have your own agenda to follow and can't waste time untangling other people's motives. If you're compulsively curious, be direct and ask them what's going on. However, if satisfactory answers aren't readily forthcoming, let it go for now; you can always return to the conundrum when time is not an issue."
aquarius,2016-03-08,"Your visionary ideas tempt you with many ways to increase your income as the dreamy Pisces Solar Eclipse enlightens your 2nd House of Personal Resources. But financial planning won't necessarily lead to fiscal rewards because you might be misled by your own idealism now. Be smart and consider every inspiration that comes to mind, but don't put all your eggs in one basket. Your current key to success is keeping each dream alive until a reality check requires you to leave it in the past."
pisces,2016-03-08,"There is no limit to what you can imagine now, but there's also nothing to be gained by rushing into anything monumental just yet. The New Moon Eclipse polarizes your creative sign today, offering you a new lease on life. You're at the edge of a spiritual journey, but your diaphanous thoughts will eventually solidify into reality. Don't fall victim to a false sense of urgency; move cautiously and consider all your options prior to focusing on any one path. Henry David Thoreau wrote, ""The world is but a canvas to the imagination."""
aries,2016-03-09,"Your life already seems to be in high gear and the cosmic intensity ratchets up another notch today. The moody Moon's return to your sign adds an emotional charge to the next couple of days, prompting you to react without restraint. Remember, everyone else isn't as boisterous as you are now, so be gentle and patient while continuing to express your feelings with passion. Taking a few moments to consider how your enthusiasm might come across to others could make all the difference in your relationship world."
taurus,2016-03-09,"A hidden feeling is the critical ingredient to an emotional stew you are cooking out of sight as the evocative Moon slips into your 12th House of Secrets. It's crucial to pay attention to the littlest details or they could have a negative impact on your interactions with others. Remember, it's best to catch any potential problems before they manifest and not after. As Gandhi said, ""The future depends on what you do today."""
gemini,2016-03-09,"You crave more social activity now, but you must be careful that you're not too aggressive in the pursuit of fulfillment. You can quickly exhaust others since they might not be wired to communicate at the same frenetic speed as you. Rather than blindly charging ahead, visualize blinking yellow warning lights at every interaction. Proceed with caution without coming to a full stop. You possess the power to upset the apple cart today, so ease up before you have  a big mess to clean up."
cancer,2016-03-09,"An all-too-familiar dilemma requires you to choose between pushing ahead and retreating to safety. Unfortunately, today's contradictory cosmic signals won't help you pick the best strategy. On one hand, the assertive Aries Moon encourages you to take your idea to the next level. On the other hand, you don't want to be left high and dry as several planets in watery Pisces stimulate your fear of the changing tides. You want to decide now and be done with it, but it's more advantageous to consider your options carefully before selecting your path."
leo,2016-03-09,"You may try to ignore an inner voice telling you to take life more seriously these days. Perhaps you already decided it isn't worth fighting the inevitable. Additionally, you might believe that everything will run its course and you won't have to work so hard if only you could let go. But you can't change a somber disposition overnight if there are valid reasons for your feelings. Be patient with your emotional journey. The sooner you acknowledge that life isn't all sunshine and roses the sooner you will find yourself back on the road to joy."
virgo,2016-03-09,"Circumstances require you to muster up your courage today and be emotionally expressive in a way that might be uncomfortable for you. You're usually capable of logically analyzing the task at hand to arrive at the most efficient way to reach your goal. However, staying in your head won't get you where you want to go now. Thankfully, exploring your feelings allows you to enter a magical space where time slows down, enabling you to run circles around everyone else. Don't wait for a better moment; it's your day to go for the gold."
libra,2016-03-09,"You can't get in the final word on nearly any conversation today, and the more you try to make yourself heard, the less likely anyone will listen. External logistics demand that you initiate action, but nothing you do now seems to alter the overall tone of the day. Nevertheless, you can modify your attitude which creates the potential to change everything. Take the events in stride and enjoy yourself in spite of the work you still need to do. Turning lemons into lemonade inspires others to do the same."
scorpio,2016-03-09,"You might find yourself in trouble today because you start one thing after another after another, finishing the day without much to show for all your running around. You must perform a tricky dance now, but fortunately, you can turn this chaotic energy to your advantage. Visualize yourself wearing blinders as a reminder to narrow your field of perception. And don't begin a new project until you've completed your current tasks and are truly ready to move on."
sagittarius,2016-03-09,"Although you're restless to spread your wings today, you still may feel like the eternal optimist who believes you can deliver on every promise you make. But it's hard to turn your brain off from all its random wanderings, even if you have a wonderful play day for you and friends on your schedule. Thankfully, you possess an overabundance of creativity that can help you get whatever you want. Be careful what you wish for because you just might get it."
capricorn,2016-03-09,"You're right in the thick of things trying to discover a solution to a complicated problem. What makes this challenge even more difficult today is that you're clearly missing an intrinsic part of the puzzle and are hesitant to take sides until you have a clear picture constructed from the facts. Acknowledging that it's hard to come up with useful answers now lessens the pressure. However, continuing your research will lead to success as long as you don't give up on your search for the truth."
aquarius,2016-03-09,"The notion of breaking out of a restraining situation is an exhilarating thought these days, but it may be wiser to wait a while longer. If you decide to turn your life inside out now, it could take a while for everything to settle back down. But even if you are committed to finding an effective way to operate within the current limitations of your schedule, you're still free to apply your rational skills and spiritual training to your work. However, the most brilliant plan is of no value until you put it into practice."
pisces,2016-03-09,"Taking a long hard look at your finances is top priority now, but unfortunately, this isn't just about balancing your checkbook. You are being pushed to decide how you will optimize your current gains and move into the future with an attitude of prosperity. However, it's time to be practical about your life. Don't make a problem more important than it is today; just put your energy toward getting your fiscal world in order. It's not a matter of if you should plan for your future, it's when."
aries,2016-03-10,"Your spirit is restless, prompting you to start a new project today. Even if there are several logical reasons to wait, one thing after another keeps encouraging you to hurry up and harness the power of the moment. You are quick to push against any resistance so you can make something magical happen. But overly assertive behavior isn't necessary now. Your life is about to change; be ready to go along for the ride when you are invited. Proper preparation prevents poor performance."
taurus,2016-03-10,"Achieving your lofty goals might seem like an overwhelming task today, but this is no time to throw in the towel. Even if you are disheartened by difficult circumstances, your ideas are innovative and potentially very valuable. Recognize the recent setbacks as opportunities that enable you to strengthen your plans. Just don't hold onto old expectations; anything is possible if you're willing to shift gears quickly now."
gemini,2016-03-10,"You might wonder why you're spending your free time gazing off into the future while there is so much happening in the present moment. Actually, planning for what comes next is an exercise in futility today, since you can't be certain where the current changes will lead. Navigating your way through a major transition is much easier if you let go of your desire to be distracted by a plethora of possibilities. Focusing singularly  on your immediate goal offers you the best chances for success. Work now, dream later."
cancer,2016-03-10,"You may be expected to step up and care for the very same people who usually help you out when asked. But it can rattle your sense of fair play if your efforts go unappreciated today; nevertheless, you still need to deliver the goods as promised. Although you are flirting with the idea of withdrawing so others notice your absence, a strategy based on passive resistance will likely backfire. Integrity is doing the right thing even when no one is watching."
leo,2016-03-10,"You have a lot of rational justifications for throwing caution to the wind today, but it's confusing when there are also signs you may be traveling on the wrong path. Although you could run into opposition to your ideas, it's smarter to slow down rather than halting your progress altogether. Believe it or not, there is nothing to be gained by reaching your destination in a hurry. Stop chasing what your mind wants and you'll get what your soul needs."
virgo,2016-03-10,"Listen carefully to the quiet voice of your intuition today, rather than taking your cues from close friends or trusted professionals. They can't see things from the same vantage point as you do and their well-meaning advice may lead you astray. Reaching your personal goals is so important now that you must be willing to disengage from social activities. Focus on your own dreams for a while; standing alone is better than traveling with a group in the wrong direction."
libra,2016-03-10,"You are often the one everyone turns to when interpersonal dynamics grow complicated. However, it's not easy to get others to settle down today, especially if no one appears to be listening to your words of reconciliation. You might struggle with your role as a negotiator because you aren't patient enough now to figure out everyone's conflicting motives. Just remember it pays to be kind in your delivery, even if you cannot consider each person's possible individual reaction to your message. Speaking from your heart is an example for the rest to follow."
scorpio,2016-03-10,"You're usually quite capable of thinking strategically in a cool and collected manner. However, you may reach the end of your rope today and grow very close to tossing out your previous plans. Just remember impulsive actions won't likely benefit anyone in the long run. Acting without forethought puts you on a path of unnecessary resistance. As Confucius said, ""It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop."""
sagittarius,2016-03-10,"A weird mixture of positive intentions and negative encounters makes for a rather interesting day. Nevertheless, you can't decide whether to take the obstacles you face at work as a signal that you really need to change your direction. Or, maybe, someone's aloofness has you worrying if you did something wrong. Either way, you have the power to turn the seeds of doubt into the fruits of your labor. You can reach nearly any destination if you put your shoulder to the wheel and push."
capricorn,2016-03-10,"Your measured and methodical approach to your goals usually works in your favor. Unfortunately, your current level of elevated enthusiasm is making it difficult to keep a lid on your excitement today. You're eager to let others know exactly how you feel now, but you are acutely aware that they're not going to like what they hear. Trust your inner voice to steer you in the right direction. Author Terry Goodkind wrote, ""Your life is yours and yours alone; rise up and live it."""
aquarius,2016-03-10,"You are itching to share your perspective today, but might not stop to consider the impact of your words. Your unpremeditated revelation could be hurtful to someone you like, even if you intended no harm. Rather than finding yourself in an intense argument over something that ultimately isn't important, walk away and reevaluate your motives. The truth is a beautiful and terrible thing, and therefore should be treated with caution."
pisces,2016-03-10,"Your self-esteem is soaring today, and you're ready to do something that you went out of your way to avoid in the past. Although it's important to stick to your core values, be careful not to try to sell your point of view to others. It's not about convincing anyone that your position is right; act from the center of your own heart by following convictions that are unshakable by someone else's judgment. Let your faith be bigger than your fear."
aries,2016-03-11,"You may wake up so excited that it's nearly impossible to contain yourself. However, it becomes obvious later in the day that you might have overreacted, which in turn makes the situation even more awkward. Thankfully, smoothing any ruffled feathers is quite simple today if you put your mind to it, plus you get to enjoy the calm after the storm. Take a few deep breaths; after all, you earned the right to relax if you were busy mending fences."
taurus,2016-03-11,"It might seem as if you are given one last chance to get it right, but this time you're certain it's your final opportunity. However, once again your assessment of the situation is wrong. Undoubtedly, you need to tie up as many loose ends as possible before the Moon enters your sign this afternoon; but whatever isn't completed today will still be there tomorrow, like an eager puppy waiting for its human companion to return. In the meantime, counting your blessings allows you to see how truly fortunate you are."
gemini,2016-03-11,"Concentrating on your job seems like an uphill battle today because there are so many interesting diversions that vie for your attention. Your insatiable curiosity often tempts you to explore a variety of avenues whether or not there is enough time. However, your mental inquisitiveness just makes you feel annoyingly scattered now. Thankfully, you can still complete your assignments by remembering to return to the work at hand each time your brain wanders. Focus on being productive instead of being busy."
cancer,2016-03-11,"You're tired of being responsible for everyone else's happiness now because it might feel like your own needs are lost in the process. Although you aren't one to walk out on your commitments, it's time to restore a healthy balance to your life. Begin by acknowledging those things that make your heart sing. Slowly move in the direction of your dreams, even if you must take an emotional risk. There's nothing wrong with occasionally letting others take care of themselves. There's a fine line between loyalty and co-dependence, and someone has to draw it."
leo,2016-03-11,"You continue to ride the waves of change, but it's wise to be fully prepared today as you head into rough waters. A storm isn't necessarily an indication of a major problem; it might simply be a sign to slow down and review your plans before nonchalantly continuing on your way. Don't worry about resolving every dilemma now. Simply navigate your way around the obstacles until you find a safe place to land. Keep your internal compass handy and everything will be alright."
virgo,2016-03-11,"You recently excavated buried psychological intrigue and drama, but now you are ready to take a simpler approach to life. Your imagination is running wild, tempting you with a wide array of fantasies. Even if satisfaction is elusive at first, you can rest easy knowing that your fair share of fun is on the way. Making the right choices early today sets the stage for an adventure tonight or over the weekend. Don't be afraid to give yourself exactly what you want."
libra,2016-03-11,"An intense emotional interaction with someone special may have zapped a lot of your energy in the recent past. Thankfully, it's now time to turn this powerful engagement into something more meaningful that truly nurtures your soul. It's as if an overbearing electric guitar riff is bridging into a gentle flute solo right before your eyes. And as the melody wafts, so does your pleasure. No resistance is necessary; accept the current positive changes as a reward for your previous efforts. Lead with your heart and happiness will follow."
scorpio,2016-03-11,"You believe you possess a secret weapon today, but mentioning it to anyone is unwise because your power currently stems from remaining silent. Although some people might think your charisma is a byproduct of your sexual energy, your magic goes deeper into more spiritual realms. Your magnetism remains alluring as long as the mystery stays in place. Keep others guessing with your dazzling smile and let your actions speak for themselves."
sagittarius,2016-03-11,"It's more than likely that you recently devoted your energy to pursuing pleasure instead of getting your work done. It's time to pay the piper by catching up on your chores today, even if that means turning down a leisurely lunch or an evening out with your friends. However, attempting to do everything at once only creates more complications. The most straightforward route to success is traveled by prioritizing your tasks now and then attacking them in order, one after another, until you are finished. A goal without a plan is just a wish."
capricorn,2016-03-11,"You may be discouraged this morning because it feels as if you're running on a hamster wheel without getting anywhere. Honestly, even your most dependable rituals don't seem to contribute to your progress today. Paradoxically, your smartest strategy is to loosen your expectations without giving up on your goals. Fortunately, you should be able to find your groove later in the afternoon and quickly make up for lost time. Albert Einstein wrote, ""Strive not to be a success, but to be of value."""
aquarius,2016-03-11,"A wall of exhaustion may hit you unexpectedly today, requiring you to stop and assess how much you have already accomplished this week. Unfortunately, you might still have a distance to go now, even if you've run out of time and energy. Accepting your fatigue is a crucial first step in overcoming it. Step out of the fray to give yourself a chance to recuperate; you'll be much more efficient once you return to your tasks with the benefit of a little rest."
pisces,2016-03-11,"It is a tortoise-and-the-hare kind of day -- and you are now playing the role of both of these characters. You're off to a quick start as the hare and you're excited about getting ahead of the pack. But instead of thinking you can steal a quick nap, you become more tactical through the afternoon as you consider how to sustain your efforts. Slowing down like the tortoise makes perfect sense; the sooner you do it, the longer your energy will last. Endurance is the key to your success."
aries,2016-03-12,"Pay attention to personal matters today, including issues that affect your overall well-being, and everything else should fall into place. Conflicts that surface now represent opportunities to focus on utilizing your common sense. Forget about lofty ideas of philosophy and metaphysics; instead, work around your home or at your desk, but don't waste your time on anything that's not useful. Concentrating on activities that achieve tangible results brings you more emotional satisfaction than you expect."
taurus,2016-03-12,"You know exactly what you need to do in order to find happiness. Fortunately, the planets are on your side today, enabling you to establish concrete goals and work steadily to achieve them. However, you might have to overcome someone's objections to your plans before you can proceed. Be as clear as possible when stating your intentions and don't waste too much time justifying your position. Ultimately, the simplest way to demonstrate your convictions is to walk your talk."
gemini,2016-03-12,"You could easily spend the entire day lost in daydreams about what you want to do with your life. Meanwhile, your family history -- both the good and the bad -- is flooding into your awareness now. Your imagination is communicating a message to your conscious mind, and it's crucial to keep your rational perspective out of the way. Allow the images to wash over you without seeking logical explanation today. The disconnected memories will fit together like puzzle pieces when the time is right."
cancer,2016-03-12,"A spontaneous healing can be quite unexpected today. Although you may have unintentionally hurt someone in the past, your insecurities about your feelings might stir up the most pain. Talking about your emotional process is the most beneficial thing you can do now. But it still makes sense to take care of your needs first so you're better equipped to nurture others. Nevertheless, your willingness to be vulnerable opens the way to mutual understanding. Be confident yet humble, for pride goes before a fall."
leo,2016-03-12,"Open up your heart and express yourself today, but avoid creating unnecessary drama in the process of self-disclosure. Although you could be at odds with your own feelings, observing your fluctuating moods as they change can bring much-needed perspective on a practical matter. The truth is you don't have all the answers yet. Make sure to give others a chance to share their opinions on the subject. Nevertheless, being conscious is more important now than being right."
virgo,2016-03-12,"You might want to reconsider a decision now and put it back on the table for open discussion. There's no time like the present to sort through all the possibilities. But it's not enough that your practical experience is growing by leaps and bounds; you must put your skills to use as soon as possible. Obviously, you can't reap the rewards if you don't take initiative and stretch outside of your comfort zone today. Strike while the iron is hot."
libra,2016-03-12,"Although you may be the one who usually tries to make everyone feel comfortable, you might assume that others are doing better than they actually are today. Unfortunately, someone could take your apparent lack of interest personally, jumping to the conclusion that you're ignoring them when they need you. Luckily, you can minimize potentially hurt feelings now by going the extra mile and keeping communication channels open. Making certain that people know you care is what matters most."
scorpio,2016-03-12,"Your emotions are heightened with five planets now drifting through sensitive Pisces. However, you're still able to establish steady rhythms in your life so that your relationships at home and at work stabilize over the days ahead. Unfortunately, you might believe you need to juggle everything all by yourself. Nevertheless, you must collaborate with others as part of your current personal transformation. Giving and receiving support creates a healthy network you can count on to lift you up when times are rough."
sagittarius,2016-03-12,"You might not be able to stop thinking about all the chores you must do today, especially if you recently made a commitment that you want to keep. Luckily, your energy is externally focused, making it easier to plan your next move. Plotting a strategic course could feel like a game, but it's not; you must be ready for the serious changes that are on the horizon. Prepare for the future by attending to as many details as you can now, rather than later. Clearing your slate gives you the chance to jump at the next opportunity that piques your interest."
capricorn,2016-03-12,"Exercising your creative muscles comes naturally today because visionary ideas seem to flow so easily. Luckily, you receive positive encouragement from the Grand Earth Trine that includes the sensual Taurus Moon shining in your 5th House of Self-Expression. But this cosmic energy doesn't just highlight your performance; it's also excellent for exploring how to best work with your current resources. Don't focus on your limitations; find a way to get the job done, no matter what. The personal satisfaction you experience at the end of the day makes the extra effort worth the trouble."
aquarius,2016-03-12,"Undeniable feelings push you to make concrete choices today, even if you can't fully resolve the differences between your head and your heart. You might believe you must neglect some part of yourself either way, but this gulf between your wishes and reality is just a temporary illusion. Go ahead and make the best decision by following your instincts. Thankfully, the pressure will likely lift by nightfall and you will realize you did the right thing. Listen to the voice that doesn't use words and everything will work out fine."
pisces,2016-03-12,"Your feet land firmly back on the ground today, empowering you to create a master plan for success and then boldly put it into motion. Although you might experience a bit of confusion early in the day, you should be able to convince everyone that your strategy makes the most sense. But there's no need to waste time engaging in arguments that lead nowhere. Ultimately, your actions will state your case better than anything you can say. Be the shining example others want to follow."
aries,2016-03-13,"Use your excess energy wisely today while you can. Unfortunately, you could be interrupted by many different activities and end up frittering away your time before you know it. Instead, establish clear priorities so you can take care of the most important tasks first. Long conversations with friends might be fun, but they are just mere distractions when you can't afford to fall behind with your chores. You need to follow through with your commitments early in the day if you want to be taken seriously by those who matter most."
taurus,2016-03-13,"Uncertainty about the future pushes you to make a concrete decision today. You might think you have a solution in place only to discover that you're not as sure as you thought. You may struggle trying to make up your mind once the inconstant Moon slips into changeable Gemini this afternoon. Rather than trying to confirm your choice now, concentrate your efforts on acquiring more information. Remember, sometimes there are several right answers to the same question. Mental flexibility is an invaluable asset; following your curiosity can lead you into some very interesting places."
gemini,2016-03-13,"There could be someone lurking about who is ready to judge every mistake you make now. However, you may become so chatty once the Moon is back in your sign that you need to watch what you say. Choosing the wrong words might negatively impact your credibility. If you must make your view known today, make certain to brush up on your facts so you don't invite unnecessary criticism. A little advanced preparation establishes your competence and maintains your integrity."
cancer,2016-03-13,"You might settle into the rhythm of the morning, only to feel on edge later when your dissatisfaction makes it difficult to sit still. Instead of allowing your frustration to build to an intolerable level, apply your extra energy to assist a friend who may be in need of personal attention today. You can deepen your sense of purpose now by supporting someone who seems lost or confused. Ultimately, lending a helping hand to others is one of the best ways to nurture your soul."
leo,2016-03-13,"You have more on your plate than just having fun now because people are depending on you to lead the pack. Involving others on your project is wise today because a joint effort gets the job done more quickly than you could alone. The key is to listen to everyone's input, for leadership is as much about understanding and appreciating your teammates as it is about telling them what to do. A creative collaboration improves your chances for achieving success."
virgo,2016-03-13,"You can deconstruct the most complex situations better than almost anyone. But you still need to be vigilant today because you could miss a critical piece of information right in front of your nose if you rush your process. However, your perspective may a bit skewed by your personal desire for adventure now, so make sure the problem truly requires your attention before you get too wrapped up in something that's not ultimately all that important. Reshuffle your priorities so you can pursue the whims of your heart."
libra,2016-03-13,"Setting long-term goals is an essential key to your success now, but it's not yet time to make any major decisions. Do the research first, discuss your plans with your friends and reevaluate all the possible options. Additional education at this crossroads in your life will be invaluable since it can help you advance further as long as you don't lose track of your original objectives. There is no elevator to success; you must take the stairs one step at a time to reach your destination."
scorpio,2016-03-13,"If you are confused by the behavior of a loved one today, speak up and share whatever is  bothering you. Acting in denial by sidestepping a problem causes more trouble down the road than it's worth. Expressing your thoughts without pointing blame improves the relationship dynamics. You are being offered an opportunity to fill in the missing information that helps you appreciate the other person's position as long as you don't allow the dialogue to turn into your own personal rant. Listening with your heart is just as important as talking with your mouth."
sagittarius,2016-03-13,"You are able to interact with almost anyone about anything today, so set up the meetings that are necessary to talk about your pet ideas. You can effortlessly impress people with all of your knowledge and enthusiasm. Just remember that the devil is in the details. All the charm in the world won't be enough to close a deal unless you have the solid facts to back up your ambitious plans. As Ben Franklin wrote, ""By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail."""
capricorn,2016-03-13,"Ironically, your willingness to change horses midstream may be more valuable now than possessing a solid game plan. Playing the role of a bossy parent or know-it-all friend would be a drastic mistake. It could turn out to be a tough day if you try to maintain tight control over everything and everyone. However, you will find new strategies that can be very effective for you both professionally and personally if you learn to relax your grip a little. Trusting others to take the reins inspires them to rise up to the challenge."
aquarius,2016-03-13,"Your intuition is incredibly sharp now, inspiring you to pull metaphysical rabbits out of imaginary hats. Somehow, you can miraculously come up with the right answers as if by sheer magic. Luckily, your spiritual channels open even wider when you simply enjoy the flow of energy and live in the present moment. Utilizing your sense of humor enables you to put on quite an impressive performance, leaving your audience in awe. Shine, baby, shine."
pisces,2016-03-13,"You may feel a bit disoriented today, especially if family matters make it nearly impossible to concentrate on your own life. Don't make any serious decisions or major commitments unless you are feeling confident about your current direction. Although it's tempting to agree to many things just to make someone else happy, reacting immediately isn't a wise move. Giving your ideas time to develop before responding empowers you to accomplish more in the long run."
aries,2016-03-14,"You may be so quick to react to an awkward situation at work today that your coworkers might conclude you are hiding something from them. But your speedy response is more likely about your impulsive need to be creative than about keeping a secret. Your current emotions are complex, yet grow more transparent later in the day because your desire to live spontaneously brings your feelings out into the open. Don't pretend to be absolutely certain about your plan now, since new truths are discovered when you acknowledge that you don't have all the answers."
taurus,2016-03-14,"You have plenty of promises to keep today, but might be afraid of acknowledging a recent commitment that you just can't fulfill. You're concerned about your inability to meet other people's expectations, but worrying about factors that are beyond your control is counterproductive. Don't judge what's happening now by something that occurred in the past. Keep your life as simple as you can; give each task your unrestrained best effort and then move on to what's next. Your dedication is appreciated more than you know."
gemini,2016-03-14,"It can be demoralizing if you think your dreams are slipping through your fingers today. Unfortunately, your discomfort deepens if you are confronted with the realization that something is amiss with your current strategy. Nevertheless, you can't afford to waste a moment fretting about what could go wrong. Just do whatever is necessary to integrate the new information into your objectives now and modify your plans to allow for the change of direction. Adaptability is an essential key to your happiness."
cancer,2016-03-14,"You might be familiar with sinking deeply into the recesses of your inner world, but today's visit to your subconscious realms may be quite different than in the past. Tension on the job requires you to face a serious issue yet you could make matters worse if you believe you can just manipulate everything to your advantage. Luckily, you are in for a pleasant surprise now if you're strong enough to surrender to your feelings. Being emotionally available clears a path to an unexpected transformation."
leo,2016-03-14,"You could run straight into an old fear in pursuit of satisfaction today, yet the prognosis for your happiness is still quite positive. Although you might be worried about receiving criticism if you fail to meet your goals, being  honest about your current bout with low self-esteem is wise as long as you express your concerns and then let them go. Success may actually be within reach if you're not in such a hurry to prove your competence; take the scenic route if you encounter a detour along the way."
virgo,2016-03-14,"You want to serve others today as you search for renewed meaning in your life. You might consider stepping outside of your safety zone to help victims of a recent crisis or volunteer for a political cause. Unfortunately, you could fall short of your own idealistic standards now, no matter how hard you work on the behalf of others. However, your new spiritual vision can be revitalizing for your soul if you don't take your altruism too far. Find something to do that will create a positive impact without turning your entire world upside down."
libra,2016-03-14,"You could slip into familiar fantasies about producing great works of art today, but you may needlessly worry that you lack the talent and resources to pull it off. Nevertheless, imagine what you would do if you didn't need to earn a living and manage your regular responsibilities. There's no place for self-limiting thinking now, so express your creativity any way you can. Make time for playful endeavors, even if only as a practice to connect with your inner child."
scorpio,2016-03-14,"Nothing is gained now by idly wondering how your life might have turned out if one thing or another happened differently in the past. Although it may be tempting to dream about time-traveling so you can change a critical event today, this sentimental journey is a pointless waste of time. There's no need to rewrite your personal history; instead, use your active imagination to bring a memory into the here and now to positively impact the present moment. The only limits to your future are the ones you create in your mind."
sagittarius,2016-03-14,"You might become so excited about doing something in your own unique way today, that you completely forget about fulfilling a previous promise. Make time to quiet your mind so you can actually hear a meaningful message that's coming from your subconscious. Don't be so cavalier that you totally disregard the symbolism of a dream or fantasy. Everything that enters your awareness now contains clues about your life's purpose. Following through on your commitments is the first step in the right direction."
capricorn,2016-03-14,"Striving to reach your goals is admirable as long as you don't lose sight of why they are so important. It's useful to recollect a formative childhood experience that motivated you to be serious about making such ambitious plans. But routine obligations also demand your attention now, so don't drop the ball on your daily chores just so you can revise the story of your life. Balance your current necessities with what you see on the horizon before making any hasty life-changing decisions."
aquarius,2016-03-14,"You are more spiritually inclined these days and happily reliant on your vivid imagination to add color to your world. However, you're entering a transitional phase and today's realizations may be instrumental in redefining your life. Naturally, you want to understand the mysteries of the cosmos right away, but patience is required now; your transformation will take months to unfold. In the meantime, don't let your fixed nature stand in the way of your success. Free your mind and the rest will follow."
pisces,2016-03-14,"You yearn for a chance to reminisce about your childhood today and indulge your need for nostalgia. Although delving into your personal history can be delightful, it's also a distraction especially if you're trying to escape from your current circumstances. You may wish you could revive a meaningful connection with your past; just don't forget to express your creativity in the present moment or you might miss a wonderful opportunity to show the world your masterpiece."
aries,2016-03-15,"Someone might need to tell you that you're shouting before you even notice you raised your voice. Your enthusiasm may be over the top today, encouraging you to turn a simple idea into one that is so overblown your credibility suffers. Fortunately, practicing a little sensitivity serves you well now, preventing you from unconsciously making things more important than they actually are. When your excitement rises, take a few deep breaths and tone down your message. As your awareness increases, so does your ability to control your actions."
taurus,2016-03-15,"You could overreact with stubbornness if people try to override your decisions today. It's so easy for a little disagreement to quickly escalate that you find yourself in the middle of a conflict without even realizing there was an issue. Thankfully, you can prevent an exhausting battle if you're willing to go out of your way to compromise. Take the high road and let tempers settle before you resume discussions. If you can master patience now, everything else will fall into place."
gemini,2016-03-15,"You may try to exert more self-restraint than you actually possess today. Thankfully, you're not worried about getting too worked up over something that's important to you. Instead, you're probably overly concerned with honoring someone else's privacy. The Moon's presence in your sign urges you to vent your feelings, but expressing the whole truth might be inappropriate now. Be discreet about what isn't yours to share because it's wise to keep some things quiet. Simply smile and tell others to mind their own business."
cancer,2016-03-15,"You're often someone others confide in because they can usually count on your willingness to listen. But your receptivity may be overshadowed now by your eagerness to talk about your  feelings for a change. It's perfectly natural to harbor your own ambitions and want to share them instead of just reflecting on everyone else's needs. Nevertheless, keep your enthusiasm in check or you might say more than you want. Sometimes it's better to raise your eyebrows instead of your voice. Discretion is your friend."
leo,2016-03-15,"You may be panic-struck today once you realize how much work there is to do this week. You might even experience a twinge of regret if you recently took off too much time to play. But the illusion that time is running out is exacerbated by the restless Gemini Moon, and worrying won't help you get back on track. Instead, roll up your sleeves and put your nose to the grindstone. You can invent countless reasons to procrastinate, but you only need one good idea to initiate action. The sooner you start, the sooner you will be done."
virgo,2016-03-15,"Your rational mind normally doesn't require external supervision, but the encouragement you are currently receiving could color your deliberations. Your ruling planet Mercury opposes audacious Jupiter today, spinning your mental process out of whack and making you susceptible to inflationary thinking. Nevertheless, don't criticize anyone else for your outrageous conclusions. Blaming others takes time and energy away from improving your game."
libra,2016-03-15,"You sincerely want to explain your position to your coworkers now, but everything you say seems to be taken out of context. It's more complicated than simply telling your story, since you may feel the need to exaggerate and turn your presentation into a melodrama. Your motives for sharing might not be apparent to others, prompting them to pull back in uncertainty. If people withdraw today, graciously let them go and tell your tale another day."
scorpio,2016-03-15,"You wish everyone would recognize your contributions and appreciate the fact that your efforts go beyond the call of duty. Unfortunately, expecting so much from others could make satisfaction even more elusive now. Unrealistic demands won't make anyone feel better today, nor will acquiescing to something that's not in your best interest. No one else can decide what's right for you, so follow your intuition and proceed with confidence."
sagittarius,2016-03-15,"You could grow overly concerned with how you make decisions today, yet this obsession won't necessarily help you choose the right course of action. Visionary Jupiter's opposition to rational Mercury forces you to seek solutions to the most complicated problems now. Thankfully, there's no reason to prove your analytical superiority to anyone. Just focus the best you can and methodically push ahead toward your goals. Don't spend too much time thinking when you can simply let your heart choose your path."
capricorn,2016-03-15,"You mountain-climbing Goats often get ahead in life because of your sure-footedness, but your unflappable persistence could be your secret ingredient to success now. You may be surprised by how quickly everyone else gives up today, especially when they see an easier path to follow. But even as alternative routes appear, keep your eyes focused singularly on your destination and don't deviate from your chosen course. Wake up with determination; go to bed with success."
aquarius,2016-03-15,"It's nearly impossible to hide your dissatisfaction with the status quo today, especially in a close relationship. Someone could irritate you now by taking undeserved credit or  simply needing too much attention. You aren't interested in feeding anyone's ego; you just want to create change with the least amount of drama possible. Nevertheless, you may underestimate the resources needed to complete a job and other people might be needed to bail you out. Be lenient with your judgments; the path to success is a long and winding road with many twists and turns along the way."
pisces,2016-03-15,"Unfortunately, once you start explaining your perspective to a friend or associate today, you might not know when to step off your soapbox. You may be extra talkative with mischievous Mercury buzzing about in your sign, opposing exaggerating Jupiter in your 7th House of Relationships. Try and remember that your current thinking is anything but objective. Don't be afraid to keep your involvement in a project to a minimum or, if possible, just say no. Being brutally honest is kinder now than disappointing others later on."
aries,2016-03-16,"It may feel as if you don't have the time to do those things that could bring you the most spiritual and emotional growth. But your concern is based on a faulty illusion because progress originates from very practical places in your life today -- like fulfilling your responsibilities at work. Don't worry about what you might be missing; everything is where it's supposed to be if you apply yourself to the mundane logistics. Thankfully, exploring the outer galaxies and the inner reaches of your imagination can be done in your sleep."
taurus,2016-03-16,"Your creativity is longing to run wild and free today. Thankfully, the roadblocks that were standing between you and your satisfaction are finally falling to the wayside. Ironically, circumstances are not shifting enough to give you a break from the dramas of ordinary life; it's more likely that you're cleverly surfing on a wave of cosmic power now. The world is your oyster; adventure is calling and it's up to you to answer."
gemini,2016-03-16,"Your inner confidence is on the rise today, especially with your family and friends acting as a source of genuine encouragement. Channel the support you receive to boost your resolve even higher. Everyone goes through periods of doubt, but now it's time to reclaim your inheritance and put your natural talents to good use. In the meantime, don't let the opinions of others consume you when you're following your dreams. Let your faith be bigger than your fear."
cancer,2016-03-16,"You're certain your conclusions are correct and you're all set to tell the world your viewpoint exactly as you see it. Although you're willing to shout your message from the mountaintop today, you're unsure if you are up for the climb. Something may still be holding you back from fulfilling your appointed destiny. There's no need to fight the obvious resistance now since it will only feel like shadowboxing. Instead of trying to convince anyone else of your integrity, find a solution within. Wait to share your story until the time is right."
leo,2016-03-16,"You can make a lot of progress now by taking stock of your resources and managing them to the best of your ability. The good news is you stand to gain both financially and emotionally if you don't push too hard to be on top. However, you can easily fall victim to unrestrained optimism today, especially related to how you handle your money. Don't get distracted by an immediate payoff or a shortcut to success. Plot a path for long-term security and things will fall into place piece by piece."
virgo,2016-03-16,"Your expectations are lofty, even if reality has been testing your resolve on every level lately. Don't quit when things are finally starting to take a turn for the better; make the most of your positive attitude while your mind can transform hardship into great opportunity. This auspicious energy could be most apparent in your love life where relationship difficulties may finally begin to find resolution. Make your intentions as clear as possible and hope for the best."
libra,2016-03-16,"Invisible helpers seem to be watching your back today. You may assume that it's just good luck, but you could actually have spirit guides or guardian angels who are looking out for your best interests. Although your analytical mind won't let you entertain the possibility of supernatural friends, your subconscious mind is now the source of guidance that will get you out of a difficult situation. No matter what you believe, trust your instincts and never apologize for honoring your intuition."
scorpio,2016-03-16,"You can feel your idealism slowly making its return today. Even if you've been through a crisis of confidence, there is good reason to be more optimistic in your outlook now. However, do your best to avoid manipulating others, even if you think you're being kind to someone else while also helping yourself. You might inadvertently create sticky webs when you are motivated by ulterior motives. Keep it clean and don't attempt to control the actions of anyone else. Have faith in the universe and maintain your integrity at all costs."
sagittarius,2016-03-16,"This could be the time of your life if you were simply in it for the payoff. However, you know it's not only about fame and fortune because your soul craves meaning and passion. Nevertheless, it is still prudent to reevaluate your current career path if you look at it from a lifetime perspective. Ask the important questions: Are you making the most of your skills and talents? Are you happy or is there something else you would rather be doing? Don't postpone your soul's journey; embrace the future and take a small step in your new direction."
capricorn,2016-03-16,"You might not be out of the woods yet, but jolly old Jupiter is flying around you like a hummingbird returning to the feeder. Sure, there still may be some tricky situations to handle, but they need not define your life. The most crucial thing to understand is the effort you exert now will have lasting impact. Reflect over the past few months prior to projecting forward. Don't sit and wait for something magical to happen; moving confidently toward your ideal future plays a large role in creating it."
aquarius,2016-03-16,"It might seem as if something precious is being taken from you now, but believe it or not, things will still likely work out for the best. You are being offered an important opportunity, although what the gift is may not become apparent until you've made enough room in your life for it to manifest. Your hard work in the present moment can pay off in the future. Don't waste energy worrying about what isn't working today. Sometimes you must first let go in order for something better to come along. When one door closes, another opens."
pisces,2016-03-16,"It's time to rush to the rescue where your friends are concerned. In addition, help is also on the way to you, even if you don't think you need it. The good news is that you can actually do amazingly well if others appear with just what you need. However, you must first get past your initial resistance to outside interference. There is cosmic magic working on your behalf now. Don't hold back; your current actions determine your future."
aries,2016-03-17,It's crucial to nurture your quiet and sometimes even introspective side that often is overridden by your inner warrior. There is more than one way to win a battle and today your training is of the heart and not of the hands. Practice meditation or set some time aside for contemplation. Give yourself the gift of allowing your mind to wander; whatever comes to you during your self-reflection will help to pave the road to your success.
taurus,2016-03-17,"There is an unrelenting pressure on you to take a current solid opportunity and turn it into something better. This auspicious opening may be about money, a natural talent, or it could even involve a relationship. Oddly enough, its focus is not the important part. The critical thing is what you choose to do with your good fortune. There are unseen helpers coming to your aid, so don't be afraid to think big and go long."
gemini,2016-03-17,"You may be concerned now with the impact of your political beliefs in the social sphere of relationships. Sure, your values can affect your closest relationships, especially if your basic views on war, the economy or political candidates differ from your partner's. If you try to avoid stating your position because you don't want to start an argument, you'll probably end up in a squabble anyway. It's better for everyone involved if you lay it on the line and share your convictions. Demonstrating your integrity inspires others to do the same."
cancer,2016-03-17,"Be ready to shift directions as the emotional tides of your immediate environment change. But don't lose sight of your priorities because you'll certainly be washed away in the tides of chaos if you do. Rely on your moral compass to guide you and don't take your concentration off your destination, even if the fog rolls in. You could work magic with your eyes closed now while the cosmos is on your side, but you'll need to trust in yourself first."
leo,2016-03-17,"In spite of feeling insecure today, you may be successful with whatever you set out to accomplish. However, you will do your best work when you're motivated by interests that extend past your own. You're in a highly creative phase now and can turn the sourest lemons into the sweetest lemon meringue pie ever tasted. Just remember that you'll need to tap into the source of your inspiration by going within before you reach out to help anyone else."
virgo,2016-03-17,"An unexpected detour on your search for meaning can prove to be a wonderful opportunity. You aren't going to solve the unsolvable today, but you might be surprised by what you discover from delving deeper. Your friends and family want you to follow your heart, but any expressed hesitancy is motivated by their concerns for your well-being. Ultimately, you must be responsible for your actions. You may think you should restrain from sharing your real dreams, when in reality they are the key to your happiness."
libra,2016-03-17,"Your spoken words carry extra weight today, so use them with the utmost care. Your tendency is to say less than what's actually on your mind now, but be careful about trying to manipulate the situation for your own good. The planetary currents are strong and your best use of them is to ride the waves of change for the advancement of all, and not just for yourself. The good of the many outweighs the needs of the one."
scorpio,2016-03-17,"Total transformation could be in the picture while you are considering how much your values have changed. You are worth more than you are making at your job and you can't help but think about how you are going to move ahead, even if you have to turn your world on its ear to accomplish your goals. The good news is that you're probably receiving encouraging signals from the universe, letting you know your ambitions are not out of reach. Real success comes from being true to yourself and not surrendering to the expectations of others."
sagittarius,2016-03-17,"You're the big thinker and grand planner of the zodiac. You might have gone over the top a few times if you're true to your Sagittarian nature. Although you're in one of your inflationary phases, something is very different this time around -- for your innovative idea can really work. You are quite powerful now and able to move mountains if your journey requires it. Challenges make life interesting; overcoming them makes your existence meaningful."
capricorn,2016-03-17,"You are extremely persistent today as you evaluate how to make the best use of your time. You're on the edge of a dramatic change that may involve other people's resources and complex interrelationships. Although it's tempting to inflate a large project until it's too big for you to handle, it's best to keep the nonessential elements of your plans to yourself. Nevertheless, if you ask the right people for help, you'll have a much easier time over the weeks ahead. As Helen Keller wrote, ""Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much."""
aquarius,2016-03-17,"The greatest journey still begins with a single step. Your visionary mind has trouble focusing on mundane issues. However, methodical progress is the only logical way to reach your destination. For example, the thought of changing your work schedule so you can be more effective may seem overwhelming. But making a minor change in some aspect of your daily routine feels like a manageable start. Don't just dream about success; work for it."
pisces,2016-03-17,"Life's purpose isn't currently about finding yourself; it's about creating yourself. No matter how great the task before you, it still boils down to whether or not you believe in your talent. Unfortunately, you might settle for less, acknowledging unnecessary limits on your capabilities because you fear you're setting yourself up for failure. Nevertheless, hang your sights on something special and make it happen. If you need a hero, put on your cape and become one."
aries,2016-03-18,"Unexpected changes to your plans may actually prove to be enjoyable today, but only if you are flexible-minded and adapt quickly to current events. Nevertheless, concentrate on each present moment rather than worrying about past behavior that can't be changed. Although other people's motives might not be apparent, there's no reason to assume anything is wrong. Thankfully, expressing your feelings as clearly as possible will keep the energy moving in a positive direction."
taurus,2016-03-18,"Making up your mind seems nearly impossible today because there are two distinct paths to choose from. On one hand, you want to stay home and start a creative project like redecorating a room or working on your latest masterpiece. On the other hand, there are errands to be done that could entail a bit of running around. The sooner you shift into gear, the earlier you will finish. Obviously it's basic common sense, but taking care of your chores as efficiently as possible gives you more personal time later on."
gemini,2016-03-18,"You might not make as much progress at work as you expect today, even with a clear sense of purpose. It seems like you're speaking a foreign language; you believe you're expressing yourself succinctly, yet people still don't understand your ideas. Fortunately, your behavior conveys your message more effectively than rambling on with words that are not authentically connected to your heart. Your actions will tell others everything they need to know."
cancer,2016-03-18,"There is no valid reason to dissipate your positive outlook today, worrying about what anyone else thinks of your plans for self-indulgence. Keep in mind that anything you do that is in complete alignment with your core beliefs -- even if it doesn't move you closer to your goals -- is still better than maintaining the status quo. Being true to yourself is more important than living up to the expectations of others. Follow your heart and don't look back."
leo,2016-03-18,"You are enthusiastic about showing people your best side today, especially with the reflective Moon lighting up your expressive sign. But somehow your well-meaning intentions seem to get lost in one too many cliches and colorful stories. Instead of talking about your plan for the day, just jump in and do it. Your words may not impress anyone but your behavior will. An honest heart sends a clear message."
virgo,2016-03-18,"You may be quite confused today if someone's behavior doesn't seem to support what is being said. Nevertheless, the difference between people's statements and their actions begins to make sense when you realize that something important has been purposefully left out of the conversation. Instead of struggling to find the missing piece of the puzzle now, wait patiently for the rest of the story to reveal itself when the time is right. Life will be easier once you accept the fact that everyone doesn't necessarily operate as logically as you do. Keep calm and carry on."
libra,2016-03-18,"Although your colleagues might invite you to join  in their extracurricular activities, you're still aware of the awkward tension that is building in your professional relationships. Luckily, you possess the right words to reduce the interpersonal stress now, but your sweet pleasantries don't really resolve the underlying issues. Let your charm work its magic; applying a lighter touch today paves the way for the real work down the road."
scorpio,2016-03-18,"Clever magicians draw your attention to one hand, while the other one is doing something you're not supposed to see. Similarly, you may appear to be walking your talk out in the open now, but with several dreamy planets hanging out in Pisces, you're able to hide the real action from full view. Don't waste too much energy wondering when you should spill your secrets since people won't likely notice that they're missing anything today. Wait until you're in the right company and appropriate place before sharing the complete story."
sagittarius,2016-03-18,"You may have mixed feelings about a friend's well-meaning gesture. On one hand, you see him or her as generously offering you a ticket to an adventure that's within easy reach. But on the other hand, you're not convinced that the trip is exactly the one you're looking for now. Fortunately, there's no reason to make any long-term decisions yet. Whatever you choose to do today, don't take things too seriously because it could all change tomorrow."
capricorn,2016-03-18,"You have specific goals running through your head, but they seem so far away from your current day-to-day affairs. This apparent distance could elicit feelings of ambivalence about what you should be doing to realize your potential. You might even entertain the idea of giving up now and changing your direction drastically. Although you may feel an urgent need to make some quick decisions today, let this wave of intensity pass before you alter your current course. Sometimes inaction is the most effective course of action."
aquarius,2016-03-18,"A friend or associate may brighten your day by making you an offer you can't refuse. Although there might be valid reasons to decline a social invitation, saying yes is still a good idea for your emotional well-being. Enjoying yourself now while you can is sensible because the pace will only grow more hectic in the days ahead. As Socrates wrote, ""Beware the barrenness of a busy life."" Cultivating connections puts your life in balance."
pisces,2016-03-18,"Surprisingly, a case of extreme boredom can set in today, turning a relaxing day into a study in frustration. Your current restlessness prompts you to mix things up and change your plans at the very last minute to save you from feeling trapped. Nevertheless, it still is prudent to stick to your regular routine than to break rank and do something totally off the wall. Happily, your great escape will be more emotionally satisfying if you wait a few days and build the anticipation."
aries,2016-03-19,"Although you're quite enthusiastic about your future prospects, the energy begins to transform once you make your move. The paradox is that you can't figure out where you want to go until the new path is revealed. Nevertheless, this dilemma doesn't reduce the likelihood of a significant shift when the radiant Sun enters your sign tomorrow. Big changes are in the air, even if you're unable to see around the bend. Don't try to make something happen today; prioritizing your goals will be a piece of cake once your common sense returns next week."
taurus,2016-03-19,"You might be called upon to respond to an unexpected twist of fate today that tests your confidence. But an unscheduled hiccup won't necessarily ruin your day, since you can turn an upsetting situation into one that is quite enjoyable. Unfortunately, you probably won't see where the day is leading, even if you have a perfect plan in place. Don't worry if it feels like everything is falling apart; your life will reorganize into something better in the next few days. Embrace the chaos as a catalyst for creating positive change."
gemini,2016-03-19,"You may be preoccupied about losing your independence because new responsibilities weigh heavily on your shoulders now. Unfortunately, your energy is scattered all over the place, so it's imperative to find a quiet place and reclaim your center. Your meditation eliminates some of the extraneous noise in your atmosphere and can turn your productivity around. Thankfully, you could be pleasantly surprised how quickly things come together once you remove the unnecessary distractions and focus on the work at hand."
cancer,2016-03-19,"Overcoming an unusual set of complications isn't your idea of a fun-filled weekend, especially when others don't seem to be playing according to your rules of the game. Although confusion isn't usually the source of happiness, an unplanned detour could bring additional freedom that empowers you to respond in new ways. Trusting your intuition now can help you stabilize the imbalanced dynamics and save the day."
leo,2016-03-19,"A healthy dose of chaos now is not as worrisome as it seems at first. You are on a creative roll, yet could miss the most valuable inspirations if you are too swept up in your own performance. It's crucial to keep your eyes peeled so you can recognize the truth when you see it. It doesn't matter whether or not information is coming from totally unexpected quarters. You are being shown an extreme solution to a problem that doesn't have a normal way out. Take a leap of faith and fly toward your dreams."
virgo,2016-03-19,"Your current dilemma is that logic and practicality won't fix anything now, which doesn't make you happy at all, especially if you're itching for a dramatic transformation. Tread carefully since there is irrepressible movement stimulating tension within a relationship. Don't try to suppress your energy today or it will just be expressed awkwardly by someone else. It's healthiest when change originates from your heart; proactive measures are key to your success."
libra,2016-03-19,"You're often considered the champions of harmony and grace, but you aren't feeling so accommodating today. Roll with the sudden shifts of energy, even if you have trouble putting your finger on the source of the disruptions. If you can't wrap your mind around an idea someone suggests now, don't judge it too quickly. It's essential to your growth to remain open to radical change and a new perspective offers you a chance to build something real and lasting. Let your sense of humor and curious mind run the show."
scorpio,2016-03-19,"Your friends and relatives might seem rigid in their thinking today, possibly prompting you to lose your temper at an inopportune moment. You could regrettably end up making a scene, yelling facts and figures to wake others up to the truth. Don't try to force anyone to see things your way, even if you're thinking about the sacrifices you made and the freedom you gave up. Concentrate on improving the emotional dynamics now and don't focus on any one particular outcome. Keeping your options open encourages everyone else to do the same."
sagittarius,2016-03-19,"You could be chasing rainbows today, only to see them reappear over another distant hill over and over again. You are standing at one more fork in the road, weary of the disappointments and frustrations. You want to make something magical happen now and you're eager to go places you've never gone. Change is in the air; striking out on the path of adventure greatly improves your chances of actually finding the pot of gold."
capricorn,2016-03-19,"Escaping the stress is highly unlikely if you continue to insist on your world being so neat and tidy that everything appears to be under control. However, seeking the safety of stable structures isn't an option today. Whatever you have relied on in the past for self-assurance is now shifting beneath your feet. Fortunately, once you move beyond your fear of the unknown, you may find your journey quite exhilarating. Free your mind and enjoy the ride."
aquarius,2016-03-19,"Something may happen that helps to facilitate the changes you want, especially if your life seems unsettled somehow. A close friend could request your assistance, even if you can't deliver what's needed now. Instead of stressing over an impossible situation, explain your limited availability as objectively as you can. Although you might have to manage someone's disappointment today, a compassionate approach should soothe over any ruffled feathers you encounter along the way."
pisces,2016-03-19,"You're eager to swim along with the changing tides now, even if the improvements you seek remain elusive from your grasp. Thankfully, you have a wonderful opportunity to alter your direction if you can remain adaptable to the current power shifts. You inspire others with your faith, especially if you aren't afraid of taking radical action at the right time. Remember, it's the most dramatic gestures that will have the greatest impact today."
aries,2016-03-20,"Your eagerness is bubbling over now that the Sun has returned to re-energize your sign, even if circumstances in your life are less than optimal. Nevertheless, you could become infatuated with your own reflection without realizing what's  going on. Fortunately, you can untangle your dreams from the actual events of the day with a healthy dose of self-awareness. Ultimately, the truth may not be as perfect as your imagination, but checking in with reality should eliminate most of your potential problems before they can even manifest."
taurus,2016-03-20,"You might jump through hoops today, believing that you're assisting others while your ruling planet Venus conjuncts delusional Neptune in your 11th House of Social Networking. However, you may actually have your own self-interests at heart, rather than being motivated by altruism. But don't waste time questioning your motives. The reason you are doing something isn't as important now as whether or not you are kind in your interactions with others. When in doubt, err on the side of love."
gemini,2016-03-20,"A relationship with a friend is complicated now because you are seeing things through rose-colored glasses. Although your subjective view of reality is biased by your unfulfilled desires, you can easily sidestep trouble today by tempering your unrealistic expectations with critical thinking. You really don't have to be afraid of dreaming as long as you stay aware of the difference between fact and fantasy. Walking in both dimensions is essential for your personal satisfaction."
cancer,2016-03-20,"Your personal standards for sharing your feelings are set at a very high level these days because you don't want to fool yourself into believing that everything is safe if it's not. However, it's quite challenging today to create a healthy balance between expressing the truth and bending it to your advantage. Even if you are tempted to evade a potentially unpleasant situation now, you will be happier if you take enough time to address unresolved issues before they grow out of control."
leo,2016-03-20,"You may run into an emotional wall today, and although you cannot just keep pushing ahead, it's not sensible to retreat, either. Thankfully, you can imagine an ideal picture of your future and your unwavering focus enables you to create a concrete plan to reach satisfaction. Sharing your ideas provides positive feedback, but ultimately the responsibility to make your dreams come true is yours alone. Don't wait for help that might not arrive; you can perform manifestation magic on your own."
virgo,2016-03-20,"You know what you want to do today and could grow angry with anyone who stands in your way. But even without resistance from others, you might grow confused as you inch closer toward your goals since you can't understand why everything is taking so long to finish. Nevertheless, your current impatience is counterproductive because you have more time than you realize, anyway. It's more important now to keep your faith than to reach your destination."
libra,2016-03-20,"You are unfazed with the knowledge that there's more work to do before you earn your rewards. Your ruling planet Venus is touched by angelic Neptune today, dangling idealistic fantasies just beyond your reach. On another day you might grow frustrated at your progress, but now you see the plan in motion and you're happy to let it continue to unfold organically. Find a sustainable pace and stick with it. Intention plus hard work equals magic."
scorpio,2016-03-20,"You can look far ahead today, unencumbered by your recent past. Your character is strong enough to maintain your focus on the present while also dreaming about your future. Use your creative imagination to set the tone during the next phase of your life. Nevertheless, you can't turn your visions into reality by just thinking about them. Success is not a gift; to accomplish great things, you must be willing to earn them."
sagittarius,2016-03-20,"Intentionally bending reality enables you to imagine all the possibilities that are waiting in the future. You have a clear aim at whatever you want now, assuming you can conjure up a vivid image of your desires. Just remember that daydreaming isn't the only ingredient to your success; perseverance is also required now. Don't give up on your highest hopes, or you'll never know what might have been possible. Shoot for the Moon; even if you miss, you'll land among the stars."
capricorn,2016-03-20,"People secretly admire your natural ability to be patient when striving toward accomplishing your goals. Thankfully, you don't have to try too hard now because the magic of the planets is already on your side as you dream about your next adventure. Of course, there still may be real-world obstacles to overcome if you give free rein to your vision. No matter what, don't take your eyes off the prize; it will be yours once you've earned it. The things you work hardest for bring the greatest rewards."
aquarius,2016-03-20,"You typically approach something you want with an emotional detachment that may seem odd to others, but this logical strategy enables you to maintain a greater sense of freedom. However, you still might swallow the bait if the object of your desire is enticing enough today. Instead of wasting time and energy struggling to work your way free, avoid headaches by steering clear of the hook right from the start."
pisces,2016-03-20,"Magic unfolds so fast now that you're instantly mesmerized by your lovely daydreams and surreal visions. Delicious Venus hooks up with your key planet Neptune today, transforming simple facts into multicolored streams of cascading fantasies. There's no need to deny yourself the sweet pleasures in the real world or in your imagination; you can always make your way back to reality tomorrow. Dance in the land of enchantment while you have the chance."
aries,2016-03-21,"The workweek ahead appears to be turning into a stew that gets better and better as it simmers. The Sun and Mercury's visit to your sign inspires you to be at the very top of your game over the next several weeks. The energetic buzz is heating up your imagination, even if the weather is still cool. You can visualize the myriad of possibilities that stretch out in front of you. If the current situation isn't exactly your cup of tea, be courageous and take a few bold steps in the direction of your dreams."
taurus,2016-03-21,"A significant project is drawing to an end, yet this isn't necessarily bad news. Perhaps you were working as part of a team on a major initiative that is finally coming to completion. However, you could be tempted to dig in your heels and hold onto the recent past, especially if you have grown to enjoy the sense of camaraderie. No matter what, you can still share common goals and cultivate a support network; but don't be afraid of heading off to a destination that is more aligned with your own individual needs."
gemini,2016-03-21,"Your career objectives are undergoing a metamorphosis and you must change with the times. You were quite involved recently with your profession or your community, but your drive for success is currently being replaced with a stronger emphasis on family matters and personal dreams. Wrap up loose ends on the job so you can have time to reestablish significant friendships that have fallen to the wayside. Share your hopes for the future with those you trust and bask in the loving support showered upon you."
cancer,2016-03-21,"You might be coerced to directly face an old fear of moving into the future, or memories of the past could hold you back for unknown reasons. Either way, dynamics at work are changing quickly now and you can shift gears with ease when the timing is right. You know what you need to do, so summon up enough courage to ride these emotional tides with awareness and intention, instead of being pulled under by self-doubt. Nothing will stop your pursuit of success if only you believe in yourself."
leo,2016-03-21,"You may assume you're in a very delicate position now because your heightened sense of vulnerability tosses you one way or another. You could subconsciously react to the current pressures by protecting yourself and hiding your softer side. Unfortunately, this classical defense mechanism only isolates you from loved ones and might even push your closest allies away. On the other hand, you can set the stage for real intimacy by opening up your heart, even if it hurts. The choice is all yours, whether you realize it or not."
virgo,2016-03-21,"It's apparent that you're on the edge of something entirely new today, yet it's too early in the game to see how everything is going to fall into place. Instead of being frightened by the intensity of your emotions, you're intrigued by all the possibilities and thrilled to explore new territory now. Although you excel at knowing how to apply your analytical skills, you may also be required to trust your intuition. Logic is a masterful tool, but it might not be sufficient to get you through these illogical times."
libra,2016-03-21,"Managing relationship dynamics is an ongoing dance for most socially adept Libras. The action-packed visit of the Sun and interactive Mercury to your 7th House of Partners radiates additional warmth onto nearly everyone in your life. Although you may feel as if your emotional ground is shaky, honest communication can help you regain stability. Luckily, you won't be forced to bring up new topics for discussion today; instead, revisit a recent conversation with an open mind and a forgiving heart."
scorpio,2016-03-21,"The details of your life are brought into sharp focus today as the radiant Sun and messenger Mercury shift into your 6th House of Daily Routine. Unfortunately, this dance of tiny steps could be problematic if others find your desire to fine tune reality a bit too obsessive. Remember, there are multiple ways to look at nearly every situation, even if you feel sure about your current perspective. There's no harm in listening to different opinions before making up your mind."
sagittarius,2016-03-21,"It's not that easy to get your plans off the ground today, even if you're on a creative roll. Although mental Mercury and the willful Sun are  traveling through your 5th House of Self-Expression, they encounter a fair share of resistance now, requiring you to review your ideas and edit your words before speaking them out loud. Paradoxically, your confidence is still running strong. Instead of just giving up, rest assured the outcome will be even better if you're not in a hurry. Perseverance is your friend."
capricorn,2016-03-21,"You can sense a change in the energetic tide and you want to capitalize on the shift. You're not one to alter your plans on a whim, but you may be quick to head off in a new direction now if you think there's potential to get ahead of the curve. Nevertheless, you aren't interested in temporary distractions or quick fixes; you seek long-term solutions that will stand the test of time. Work methodically to maximize your chances of success."
aquarius,2016-03-21,"All kinds of activities in your immediate environment are placing a heavy burden of demands on you now. If you feel pressured to respond to a developing situation at home or work today, remember that you can't force events to conform to your personal preferences. However, you can change your reactions to the evolving circumstances. It won't hurt to try a radical strategy, especially if the old one isn't really working anymore. Fortune favors the bold."
pisces,2016-03-21,"You might think you're ready to make your move today, but you would be wise to wait a few more days before starting anything new. You may know exactly what you want to do, but your plans won't begin to solidify until later in the week. Be prepared to scale back your goals because you'll be more effective if your coworkers applaud your efforts. Adopting a more conservative approach makes it difficult for others to justify withholding their support."
aries,2016-03-22,"Finishing your work may be impossible today, especially if you underestimated the size of the job. If you hit a wall now, your first impulse is to rev up your engines and plow ahead while you have the energy. But you could be stuck dealing with mundane responsibilities that are more pressing than your long-term goals. Don't work yourself into a state of high anxiety, for the current resistance will eventually dissipate. Accepting your obligations and reshuffling your priorities accomplishes more than you realize."
taurus,2016-03-22,"You're determined to make progress on your goals today, but your attention may be required in different areas of your life. Although you realize there are many paths for growth, you still grow annoyed if you don't have the freedom to choose which one to take. Rather than chasing your professional dreams, concentrate on more personal aspirations for now. To make your heart happy seek spiritual fulfillment, joy and purpose, not material success."
gemini,2016-03-22,"You might feel as if someone has tied your hands, preventing you from following through with the work that's been assigned to you. Sometimes, you're easily distracted but you're not willing to give up now, since you believe that your persistence will pay off. Be careful not to assign blame to the apparent obstacles. Others may play antagonistic roles in your life, but in the long run their presence will only make you stronger. The greater the resistance, the deeper your satisfaction when you reach your goal."
cancer,2016-03-22,"Your nurturing spirit may be met with indifference now, making you reconsider if being nice is really worth the effort. As much as people might not be appreciative of your contributions today, it's still important to take the high road while coming from a place of love. Happiness will become even more distant if you allow anyone's negativity to subdue your heart. Life is better when you're laughing, especially if it inspires others to join in."
leo,2016-03-22,"Just as you are beginning to understand how self-restraint can effectively increase your creativity, something happens that tempts you to let go of the controls. You might momentarily think that taking a risk and saying what's on your mind will lead to a communication breakthrough today. However, resisting the urge to loosen your grip will actually sustain your relationships for the long haul. If you are on the right trajectory, slow and steady progress is better now than a mad dash for the finish line."
virgo,2016-03-22,"Your smile is big now, fooling others into forgetting how serious you are while you keep them off guard with your easygoing attitude. Still, behind your happy face, you're just as cautious and critical as ever, working to tie up each and every loose end. But there's really nothing to be gained from struggling today, for no matter how hard you try to appear a model of perfection, you simply can't control everything. Choose your battles wisely and preemptively let some of the details go."
libra,2016-03-22,"Opposition comes from others today, apparently because you're the one pushing the group into new territory. However, just because you can see the big picture better than anyone else, people are not willing to blindly follow your lead. Take your time and share all the information you have at your disposal. It really doesn't pay to keep anything to yourself now; when everyone knows what you know, then they will eagerly go along with your plan."
scorpio,2016-03-22,"You're searching for a new wave of illumination in your life. But your attention may need to be temporarily redirected as real world responsibilities get in the way of your metaphysical meanderings. You have recently survived a few years of hard work and character testing where you didn't have much time for contemplation. Although the tables have turned, you still need to respect common sense. Nevertheless, your friends and coworkers can inspire you when you need it. As the mystic poet Rumi wrote, ""Set your life on fire. Seek those who fan your flames."""
sagittarius,2016-03-22,"The motivational power of your key planet Jupiter often inspires you to face life with great enthusiasm. However, stern Saturn moving through high-minded Sagittarius is raining on your parade now and confronting you with one reason after another to wave the white flag. Although your optimism can lead you astray, it's not useful if you succumb to the illusions of negativity. Adjust your sights to take reality into consideration and then slip back into gear. Your relentless efforts will bring rewards, even if delayed."
capricorn,2016-03-22,"Although your energy level is returning to normal, you may be daunted by the commitments you made. Exuberant Jupiter is taunting your key planet Saturn, encouraging you to take on more work than intended. But don't waste energy worrying if you can deliver the goods. Just narrow your focus and get on with the tasks at hand. Even if you aren't performing up to your own exacting standards, no one can fault you if you give it your best."
aquarius,2016-03-22,"You must stand up to an individual powerhouse today as someone tries to block your forward movement. However, confident Jupiter is on your side and you should be able to easily overcome any resistance as long as you don't overstate your position. Your best strategy is to seek a way to stay on your present course without turning an opponent into an enemy. Instead of doing battle with each other, seek common ground so you can ultimately work together for the highest good."
pisces,2016-03-22,"Your vision is vast now and others seem to just expand your perspective even more. Buoyant Jupiter is your traditional ruling planet, yet it doesn't feel so great today when it runs into taskmaster Saturn. On a deeper level, someone in control can block your path, even as you're being lured into the distant future. If you are insisting on yes while your boss is saying no, rethink your plans before continuing on your journey. As Lao Tzu wrote, ""Nature does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished."""
aries,2016-03-23,"Describing what you see is challenging while communicator Mercury is swallowed by the Libra Lunar Eclipse in your 7th House of Others. Your confidence is high, but others may not be able to meet you halfway on your plan if you come off too arrogantly today. Although you might prefer everyone to follow your agenda, it's not wise to push to get your way. Don't fret if your message isn't getting across now. Instead, take a deep breath, gather your thoughts, and then try again once the energy settles down. Time is what prevents everything from happening at once."
taurus,2016-03-23,"Making progress on your long-term goals is a walk in the park when all the details fall into place. Nevertheless, something still seems a bit off as the Libra Full Moon Eclipse rattles your 6th House of Minutiae. Although you understand that it may be prudent to keep your discomfort quiet, you also worry that the opportunity for improvement could fade if you don't speak up right away. Nevertheless, it's smarter to smile and save your words for another day when your audience will be more receptive to your feedback."
gemini,2016-03-23,"You're on your best behavior today because you know that your unrestrained shenanigans could interfere with opportunities for pleasure. Nevertheless, the Libra Full Moon Eclipse polarizes your 5th House of Play, encouraging you to get into mischief anyhow. You might believe your friends will cut you some slack now, but tiptoeing around the real issues will only annoy them when they see through your charming antics. Instead of simply seeking a good time, balance your lighthearted spirit with a serious approach to your relationships."
cancer,2016-03-23,"You might choose to distract your attention from a vulnerable spot by starting a new project around the house. In fact, you could be so effective with this evasive tactic that you alleviate the tension for a while. The strategic Libra Lunar Eclipse occurring in your 4th House of Home and Family triggers familiar issues regarding childhood insecurities. But you can't escape completely today; the sooner you face your emotions, the sooner everyone will begin to feel better. True healing takes courage and compassion."
leo,2016-03-23,"You're motivated by your personal need to know everyone's business while the Libra Lunar Eclipse shakes up your 3rd House of Information today. Simultaneously, you may become so preoccupied with an impractical idea that it can turn into an obsession. However, your desire for a bit of adventure leaves you little time to get involved with another person's drama. Distractions are not your friend; concentrate on the most immediate situations and then apply what you learn toward reaching your goals. There are no shortcuts to success."
virgo,2016-03-23,"Balancing your personal desires with your available funds could lead you to the conclusion that you're not in any position to buy something you don't really need. Money issues are emphasized while the Libra Full Moon Eclipse activates your 2nd House of Finances. You might realize that your old values are out of sync with your current aspirations now. There's no hurry, so step slowly into your future. If you move at your own pace, you can reestablish fiscal integrity sooner than you think."
libra,2016-03-23,"Maintaining a peaceful relationship life is highly unlikely while the pleasure-seeking Libra Full Moon encounters several combative planets in the sign of Aries. The emotional drama might be more meaningful if there was someone special with whom you could share your experience. However, you may not have the patience to cultivate open lines of communication today. Don't lose hope when it comes to love; you could be in for a sweet surprise when you least expect it."
scorpio,2016-03-23,"You might be quite certain about the intimacy you're currently seeking, but an enticing opportunity could disappear upon closer analysis. The imbalanced Libra Full Moon Eclipse is like an emotional time bomb in your 12th House of Secrets, preventing you from reaching satisfaction. Don't attempt to resolve any decisions too quickly. If you take the time to talk about what you want, the right person may be eager to follow your lead. Author Brene Brown wrote, ""Courage starts with showing up and letting ourselves be seen."""
sagittarius,2016-03-23,"You could place such inflated expectations on your friends that you just assume they'll come through for you today, although they might not actually meet your idealistic standards. Meanwhile, you're distracted with interpersonal politics while the Libra Full Moon Eclipse in your 11th House of Groups opposes the Sun and Mercury in your 5th House of Creativity. Concentrate your intentions on expressing yourself now instead of worrying about others. Satisfaction is more readily achieved when you actively pursue your own self-interests."
capricorn,2016-03-23,"You know exactly what you must do to come through for the people who depend on you. The Libra Full Moon Eclipse accentuates your 10th House of Public Status, enabling you to focus your mind like a laser light on whatever must be coerced into place to reach your professional objectives. Nevertheless, tread lightly today; if you are overconfident of your position, your current self-promotional scheme could backfire and leave you with a mess on your hands. Your best contribution is your honest commitment to be as present as possible now when interacting with others."
aquarius,2016-03-23,"You enjoy visualizing how you will live in years ahead, but your daydreaming could be rather distracting to everyone else today. However, the energy-balancing Libra Lunar Eclipse falls in your 9th House of Adventure, encouraging you to keep a foot in the future while stabilizing the other one in the here and now. Widening your perspective enables you to maintain your unflagging vision for a better tomorrow while avoiding unrealistic idealism in the process."
pisces,2016-03-23,"Your most pressing dilemma today is how to strike a workable balance between simplicity and complexity. You desire all the creature comforts of being in a relationship, but you might not be eager to pay the emotional price while the Libra Lunar Eclipse shakes up your 8th House of Intimacy. Consider the consequences of unrestrained ambitions to avoid complications later on. Let your love light shine brightly by setting aside personal desires now in the name of harmony."
aries,2016-03-24,"You're eager to take the most direct path to your goals now and consciously try to avoid the emotional distractions that others present along the way. Although concentration may not come naturally, you could benefit from a concerted effort to stay focused today. Exercising self-discipline is much more effective than following someone else's command to obey the rules. Accept your responsibilities as a challenge; you will earn respect if you stick to the program and fulfill your commitments."
taurus,2016-03-24,"Someone at work might disappoint you today, making you feel betrayed at first. Nevertheless, the Moon's presence in your 6th House of Routine urges you to respond in a stabilizing manner, regardless of your initial reaction. Let go of any habitual emotional responses because there is an opportunity to make changes now that ultimately increase your security rather than jeopardizing it. Reassessing what you want from a professional relationship is a good place to start."
gemini,2016-03-24,"Your positive attitude makes all the difference in the world today, especially if your job duties aren't very satisfying. Your rewards will arrive in the future if you tackle the toughest chores now. But it's not in your best interest to go against the grain or to buck the system. Even if you believe you know a superior way to run things, you're better off following the tried-and-true path. Acquiesce to those in authority until you complete your obligations. Put on a happy face and your work will be finished before you know it."
cancer,2016-03-24,"Channeling your excess energy into your work today goes a long way on the road to recognition. However, the ambivalent Libra Moon's presence in your 4th House of Home and Family begs you to step back and take a long-term view of your life. Instead of blindly trying to get ahead in your chosen career, consider the impact of the demands of the job on your domestic life. Chasing your ambitions comes with a cost. Sometimes success and money have nothing in common."
leo,2016-03-24,"Oddly enough, meeting your obligations could lead to a romantic opportunity today or, at least, an enjoyable encounter. You might be overly cautious about observing social boundaries, but don't entirely rule out the possibility of becoming more personal with an acquaintance. Just remember, flirtatious behavior won't work in your favor now, even if your intentions are honorable. A friendly gesture is sufficient to get your message across. Then, patiently wait to see what develops before making your next move."
virgo,2016-03-24,"Sometimes you need someone to persuade you to join the party, but you usually have fun once you say yes. However, you may do well to pass on the social invitation now that cerebral Mercury is harmonizing with Mars in your 4th House of Emotional Security. Naturally, you still want to enjoy yourself, but a contemplative state of mind suggests that an evening at home alone or with your immediate family would be more in sync with your mood. Carving out a bit of quality time for yourself today gives you the chance to reconnect with your creative self."
libra,2016-03-24,"You might offer your best ideas to others today, but people may assume you're meddling in their affairs. It doesn't matter if your motives are well-meaning; someone's casual comment could be perceived as serious criticism. Go out of your way to express your admiration; gentle encouragement, along with your suggestions, gives your advice a better chance of being heard now. Your kindness will be appreciated more than you know."
scorpio,2016-03-24,"The current emphasis on your financial picture heats up while Mercury trines energetic Mars, now traveling through your 2nd House of Personal Resources. If you are thinking about making a significant purchase, consider the long-term value of your potential acquisition. If it's not a good bargain, let it go or try to negotiate a price that sweetens the deal for you. Remember, there's an important difference between something you want and something you actually need."
sagittarius,2016-03-24,"It's time to focus your attention on your own needs for a while by setting limits on your social activities and commitments. Practicing moderation makes you more effective in all that you do today and could even simplify your life. You're wildly tempted to start something new, but it's still wiser to wait a few more days before forging ahead. Rather than scattering your energy now, concentrate on the steps needed to reach your personal goals."
capricorn,2016-03-24,"You may need to modify your plans today due to circumstances beyond your control. And even if you don't have to change your schedule, it's still possible to lose your cool when something throws you off balance. Naturally, remaining light on your feet helps you maintain your adaptability, for an unexpected turn of events might be a blessing in disguise. Luckily, you could be released from an unwanted obligation and end up having more time to yourself. Stay calm and keep your sense of humor close at hand."
aquarius,2016-03-24,"Your friends try to include you in their big plans today, but you're not so quick to follow the crowd. Macho Mars and somber Saturn are in disagreement as to how you should handle their presence in your 11th House of Networking. Nevertheless, a little common sense is required when it comes to socializing now. Don't be so quick to compromise your integrity if you are feeling reclusive. Acknowledge your personal needs by graciously declining the invitation and create an evening just for you. Honor your desires and be gentle with your heart."
pisces,2016-03-24,"Someone's marvelous idea might catch your attention today, but it's wise to think long and hard before committing personal resources and lending a helping hand. It may sound like an amazing project at first, but will likely morph into more of a burden than you want to undertake now. Nevertheless, if you reject a colleague's plan, take extra time to explain your decision so your refusal doesn't generate any hurt feelings. The smallest amount of conscious diplomacy can solve a large problem before it even manifests."
aries,2016-03-25,"Pursuing pleasure sounds like a good idea, but it can be disconcerting if you're feeling anxious about meeting everyone's expectations today. However, you could simply declare this a welcome day of rest, especially if you have been working hard and responsibly attending to your chores. Give yourself permission to indulge your senses while you have the chance. True happiness comes from appreciating your blessings in the present moment."
taurus,2016-03-25,"You might not be overly interested in doing the right thing today, even if you are sternly reminded to finish your chores. Flirty Venus opposes jovial Jupiter in your playful 5th House of Romance, motivating you to rattle up some fun wherever the opportunity arises. But ignoring your obligations now might lead to unpleasant consequences. Consider the ramifications of your actions before you stir up an avoidable mess. Maximize your creativity by setting yourself up for success."
gemini,2016-03-25,"You're pulled in two distinctly different directions today, but there's no need to resolve this all-too-familiar dilemma right away. On one hand, you feel a growing sense of urgency to express what's on your mind. On the other hand, you want to sidestep any complications now so you can relax in peace. Even if pleasant events distract you from what you originally intended to do, there really isn't any harm in having fun as long as you know how far you can push your limits."
cancer,2016-03-25,"Someone might not come through for you today in the way you expect. You must pay meticulous  attention to every little thing that's happening now because you can easily convince yourself that your life is better than it truly is. You're tempted to overstep boundaries and may even end up regretting your lack of discretion, unless you're wise enough to restrain your blind enthusiasm. Make decisions based on the rules of reality instead of what you wish to be true. The truth will set you free."
leo,2016-03-25,"A synchronistic confluence of circumstances creates a perfect day for you Lions to purr and play like carefree kittens. Although it's a cat's job to sleep in the afternoon sunshine, your current laziness is not an excuse to escape from your responsibilities. Nevertheless, you still can have a wonderful time as long as you don't overdo it. Balancing work and play may be extra-challenging now, but it's the key to finding personal satisfaction."
virgo,2016-03-25,"Although you may secretly worry that your strategy won't lead to success today, you are likely to go ahead with your plans, anyhow. Your uncharacteristic indecision might have you playing the waiting game at first, but your confidence builds until you're motivated to take a risk in your search for love. It's easier to believe someone who encourages you to follow your heart's desire now than to face the facts. Nevertheless, a quick reality check does more to ensure your emotional gratification than leaping before you look."
libra,2016-03-25,"Your resistance to participating in a fun adventure today may originate from your natural instinct to nurture others instead of yourself. Although wanting those you love to feel cherished is an admirable trait, you can take your good intentions too far and possibly even discourage yourself in the process. You might end up resenting the very people you are trying to please unless you honor your own needs first. Practicing enlightened self-interest sets a better example for everyone in the long-run."
scorpio,2016-03-25,"Unavoidable obligations continue to stack up, making it difficult to kick back and chill today. Nevertheless, your desire for sensual pleasure is quite strong now that jolly Jupiter is activating indulgent Venus -- and you can't fathom any reason to deny your cravings. Just be careful to watch the quantity of food and drink you consume, the money you spend or the love you promise since you can inadvertently overdo anything that makes you feel good. Applying a touch of moderation is a healthy strategy when you attempt to experience the finer things in life."
sagittarius,2016-03-25,"Following the expected rules of behavior is no simple matter today. Although you can normally stay on track if it's part of a larger plan, you're intrigued by the alternatives now. However, you're more enamored with your own original ideas, rather than the contributions of anyone else. Unfortunately, you might be so gung ho about the big picture that you don't see the problem staring you in the face. Step back to consider what could go wrong before a minor complication becomes a major dilemma. Success favors the prepared."
capricorn,2016-03-25,"You may believe you have waited long enough to get what you want. However, voracious Venus forms a tense opposition to permissive Jupiter today, making it temporarily difficult to manage your desires. There's no harm in harboring this perspective as long as you don't go too far defending your self-indulgence. It's okay to enjoy an extra dessert or a lingering flirtation if you're so inclined, but think twice about exhibiting a brazen disregard for sensible limits unless you're willing to suffer the consequences."
aquarius,2016-03-25,"You could be nearing a point of exhaustion today, and don't want to spend your entire day trying to meet everyone else's expectations. You're eager to break the mold of responsibility while letting others fend for themselves. It's time to satisfy your own needs by doing something memorable. Your previous commitments can be better fulfilled after you take some quality time for yourself. Pull out your bucket list and choose an item that makes your heart skip a beat."
pisces,2016-03-25,"You possess an uncommon knack for turning a fleeting conversation into a long-winded philosophical debate today. Or, maybe you transform a minor crush into a major romance because everything is taking on bigger-than-life proportions now. Of course, you should delight in this sweet phase while your key planet Jupiter inspires beautiful Venus. Don't worry if you waste the day engaging in pleasant social interactions and have little to show for it, except for fond memories. Follow your bliss and see who follows."
aries,2016-03-26,"You're fearless today, confident that your pet plan will be successful while the radiant Sun harmonizes with your ruling planet Mars. You are blessed with an abundance of energy and are willing to pace yourself so you don't end up exhausted. Following your regular routine will work in your favor as long as you aren't distracted by something trivial. Consciously utilize the sweet connection between your head and your heart, but don't assume your dreams will come true right away. Sometimes the best things take a while to manifest. Stay humble and press on."
taurus,2016-03-26,"You possess a high level of stamina today and therefore can play at the top of your game. But you might grow restless if you're required to focus on too many details at once. You typically don't mind being practical as long as you can see that you're making progress. However, boredom quickly sets in if obstacles slow you down too much. Nevertheless, stick to your initial plan since impulsive actions will only complicate matters now. Determination and hard work bring a well-deserved victory."
gemini,2016-03-26,"Although listening to someone else's story is more interesting than dealing with your own issues today, it's clear that this harmless diversion is partly an evasive tactic. Actually, another person's dilemma could hit very close to home, leading you back to the very thing you were trying to avoid. If a discussion brings up a subject you would prefer to ignore, push through your fear anyway. Remaining open to a potentially uncomfortable topic now allows you to learn something positive from it."
cancer,2016-03-26,"Minimizing your emotions can be tricky business today, since your feelings appear to be spilling over into your actions. Thankfully, you really don't want to keep secrets any longer and just need the right moment to speak your truth. Nevertheless, anything you do now could have a long-lasting impact on the people closest to you. Err on the side of caution when it comes to declarations of the heart. Although you can blurt out your perspective without much thought, others may treat your words as the ultimate truth."
leo,2016-03-26,"Sometimes you are so crystal clear about your agenda that everyone knows exactly what's on your mind. Even if your message creates conflict, you're usually courageously open about who you are and what you feel. However, be mindful and remember to keep some things to yourself today. Although it takes extra effort to stay quiet, you will benefit in the long run from exercising thoughtful disclosure now rather than spilling the beans all at once. Discretion is your secret weapon for relationship success."
virgo,2016-03-26,"No matter what complications make your life difficult, the resistance is finally fading and you are standing at the threshold of taking a giant leap forward. Thankfully, today's harmonious alignment between action-hero Mars and the willful Sun in your 8th House of Deep Sharing is a harbinger of good news. If everything is going well, your life should only continue to improve. Let go of the past by turning the power of now into a positive strategy for a successful future."
libra,2016-03-26,"Always knowing what to do with your emotions isn't as simple as it sounds. In fact, it can be downright discouraging when you must rein in your feelings and connect them to a specific event. You might not be able to fit your actions into a current social context today, even if your plan seems logical. Recognizing that you don't understand all the relationship issues at play helps you to reclaim your objectivity. Continue to methodically work toward your goals rather than wasting energy overreacting to circumstances out of your control."
scorpio,2016-03-26,"You're absolutely certain your perceptions are on target today, since your natural ability to keep things real in a relationship is one of your greatest strengths. You'll do whatever it takes to reach your goals as the bright Aries Sun trines brave Mars traveling through your 2nd House of Self-Esteem. This isn't a cosmic permission slip to fly off into fantasyland, but a constructive excursion into your imagination may be exactly what you need now. Visualizing the most amazing possibilities inspires you to stretch beyond life's current limitations."
sagittarius,2016-03-26,"Your enthusiasm about your future makes you believe that you can do nearly anything now. Convincing you to sign onto an extra project is a piece of cake, and luckily, your unrelenting determination enables you to accomplish things that would be impossible on another day. You might as well aim for the stars today, since your chances for success are as good as they get. Focus on the right target or you will end up reaching the wrong destination."
capricorn,2016-03-26,"You're like a well-nurtured seedling today; thankfully, you have the support you need in order to pursue your destiny. Additionally, you possess enough energy to finish your work and still have time left over to relax. Nevertheless, it's still advisable to complete as much as you can in the morning because you could lose focus as the day unfolds. If in doubt, push yourself to accomplish more; you'll be glad later on that you did. Growth is the only evidence of life."
aquarius,2016-03-26,"Someone might attempt to coerce you into making a commitment you can't fulfill. However, you may harbor very real concerns that you prefer keeping to yourself now. Although relationships can grow quite complicated today, clear communication goes a long way toward reestablishing manageable boundaries. Let others know your limits; this encounter is your chance to regain stability as long as you don't promise too much. Your word is your wand."
pisces,2016-03-26,"You feel maxed out now and need some time to revitalize your emotional batteries. You know what's good for you and aren't shy about putting the necessary pieces in place to make the day go your way. However, your friends and relatives want to share their unsolicited advice for your growth and prosperity. Their intentions are well-meaning, but you're better off listening to  your heart instead of following someone else's vision. Be grateful for the love and support  offered to you, but remain resolute on your own path."
aries,2016-03-27,"Maintaining a positive outlook gains the admiration of others today, but even your best efforts will fail if you are avoiding an important issue. There's really no viable alternatives other than being brutally honest now. Pretending that everything is fine just increases the tension. Distorting the facts won't lead you to where you want to go, so take a few deep breaths to center yourself and then simply speak from your heart. Integrity is choosing your words based on the truth rather than potential personal gain."
taurus,2016-03-27,"Your friendly attitude is contagious today. Normally, your personality warms up to others slowly and steadily, although your loyalty is legendary once you establish an emotional bond. However, you're eager to do away with the surface chit-chat, jump in and make something special happen without going through all the proper channels. Thankfully, your spontaneous affection opens the doors to a memorable experience as long as you remain attuned to the present moment."
gemini,2016-03-27,"You may be lost in contemplation, dreaming about your plans with great intensity and concern; nevertheless, people might not even notice your struggle now. However, you could become quite irked if someone doesn't acknowledge your feelings today, especially if you have taken the time to explain them. Don't dwell on what others think; your routine will likely shift back to normal by tomorrow. In the meantime, what's most important is that you have faith in yourself."
cancer,2016-03-27,"When the storm tides of emotions rise, you ocean-friendly Crabs happily go about your business. You're pleased to be back in the sea where you feel safe now that the Moon is visiting watery Scorpio. However, others might not perceive any differences in your behavior because you are adept at hiding your true feelings. Nevertheless, relaxing your boundaries with a friend you trust encourages you to take a significant relationship to the next level. As Rumi wrote, ""Love is the bridge between you and everything."""
leo,2016-03-27,"You might appear to be overly moody today, especially if your emotions contradict your intentions. Others can mistakenly believe your current irritability originates from a sticky situation that isn't working out as you expected. Nevertheless, the source of your stress is a familiar contradiction between your head and your heart. It makes sense now to retreat peacefully while you can; fortunately, spending time on your own helps you reclaim your center of balance."
virgo,2016-03-27,"You may be preoccupied with family matters or domestic responsibilities today, but others still see you as more upbeat than you actually feel. Your optimism is readily discernible, even if you're experiencing tugs of self-doubt. You're determined to move away from emotional vulnerability and lean toward the analytical realms where you can gain more control. But instead of trying to circumvent the uncertainty, explore the colorful range of your emotions. You will be richer in wisdom for having the courage to delve into the realms of your heart."
libra,2016-03-27,"You can quickly skip right over a controversial issue now because you're an expert at transforming uncomfortable situations into pleasant experiences. Nevertheless, there may be mixed messages heading your way, making it more complicated to know which direction to turn. Ultimately, you want to be gracious, but your feelings might be too intense to hide. Don't fake it for the sake of false harmony; covering up your real emotions isn't necessary. In fact, you can free yourself from an old fear if you take a chance and say what's on your mind."
scorpio,2016-03-27,"You're prepared to step out on the edge in order to make positive changes in a relationship today. Your current confidence puts others at ease, potentially inspiring them to open their hearts. You might even feel as if you're sitting on top of the world, enabling you to express the intensity of the Scorpio Moon without the negativity that often accompanies emotional self-expression. Watch the signs so you know when your audience reaches its limit. Your extreme reactions are a blessing in disguise as long as you don't take yourself too seriously."
sagittarius,2016-03-27,"Your intuition won't lead you astray today unless you try to sidestep any controversial subjects. If you're not paying attention to the emotional flow, someone with a less carefree attitude might just have something crucial to teach you. Consider volunteering at a retirement home, hospital or a community event where you have the opportunity to interact with people who are less fortunate than you. Deep satisfaction will be your reward if you simply take time to connect with others who can benefit from your positive outlook on life."
capricorn,2016-03-27,"Your day off may be so tightly scheduled that it doesn't leave you much breathing room. This kind of structure might bother many people, but you thrive in the security of knowing what you must do. Nevertheless, everything doesn't necessarily progress according to your preconceived plan today, especially if you discover something more interesting than your original agenda. Cut yourself some slack and pursue your heart's desire now, even if it changes during the day. It's better to bend than to break."
aquarius,2016-03-27,"Enjoying yourself may be challenging today, especially if you feel trapped by previous commitments. However, getting annoyed with others is pointless, even if they appear to be preventing you from following your bliss. Shift the energy by finding ways to let off some steam, so your unexpressed anger doesn't transform into resentment. When you stop blaming everyone else, you can finally begin to discover what truly makes you happy."
pisces,2016-03-27,"Strong waves of emotions are building within you, motivating you to accomplish a lot now. All you need to do is figure out a clever way to harness the energy. If you're feeling confused by the uncertainties ahead, don't miss this cosmic opportunity to settle your nerves today. There's no reason to be entangled by what you don't know. Instead, visualize your most idealistic scenario for the future, color in every detail and then behave as if your dreams are real."
aries,2016-03-28,"Although no one seems to fully understand what you need now, others will ultimately support you on your current journey rather than throwing up  roadblocks. Don't assume that people are resisting your unorthodox ideas because they aren't enthusiastic about your plans; they just might not want to be actively involved. If you believe you're on the right track, demonstrate your courage by moving ahead on your own, no matter what anyone else says. Those who fly solo have the strongest wings."
taurus,2016-03-28,"Knowing what others are thinking is less important to you today. In fact, the best answers might arrive out of the blue when you are alone. Electric sparks of awareness are shooting through the dark as Venus and the Moon activate brilliant Uranus in your 12th House of Solitude. But don't rely on your memory to recall a sudden breakthrough. Instead, write your thoughts down as soon as you can and revisit them later when you have the time to integrate your vision with your reality."
gemini,2016-03-28,"You are feeling an intellectual buzz today, but you still may face a few challenges as you try to keep up with others. Although you are usually curious about someone else's ideas, you could be hopelessly stuck on an ingenious one of your own now. Nevertheless, it's not time to put up unnecessary resistance; if a coworker reveals a plan with potential, quickly jump on board and make the most of the moment. Open your mind before your mouth."
cancer,2016-03-28,"The emotional safety net that offered you reassurance in the past seems to be missing in action today, leaving you no choice but to take control of your destiny. Circumstances are up in the air and you don't want to miss the chance to soar on the strong thermal currents. Although you might get off to a slow start, you can't help but enjoy your newfound freedom even if it means that you need to establish your own limits. Create a new routine gradually; there's no reason to do everything all at once."
leo,2016-03-28,"You're interested in deepening an existing relationship today or you might choose to throw in the towel and head off into the unknown. Instead of interacting with your friends and coworkers as you have in the past, explore unconventional ways to add more excitement to your life. Although personal obligations continue to demand your attention, you should be able to wrap up loose ends quickly if you make an honest effort. Experimenting is fine as long as you don't cross any lines."
virgo,2016-03-28,"You take your goals quite seriously today as you begin to detach your desires from anything or anyone that ties you down. However, the freedom to express yourself on your own terms is a privilege that might take a while to earn. Don't be discouraged if your progress is uneven; it's better to build momentum gradually when trying to create radical change. Your quest for independence is a personal journey only you can take."
libra,2016-03-28,"Your relationship world might be confusing today because you are longing to play in the realm of romance but have trouble reading the signs. The conflicting signals may be enough to prevent you from following through with your original intentions. Initiating action too soon can sour a situation that has great potential, tangling the feelings of those involved into a complex web. Be wise and wait until this evening when the cosmic forces conspire with your fantasies about love."
scorpio,2016-03-28,"The most skillful sailors are the masters of their ships, and can set a course against the challenging winds. This is your chance to demonstrate your knowledge of navigational techniques. But don't waste your energy doing combat with the emotional tides for no reason. Instead, plan a route that enables you to avoid the tumultuous currents now. Once you have time to relax and catch your breath, it will be much easier to continue on your way with renewed enthusiasm."
sagittarius,2016-03-28,"Applying what you have already learned this year can seem like an uphill battle, but, luckily, if your first idea doesn't work, you have plenty more up your sleeve. Unfortunately, your mind is moving much faster than reality, and you could become frustrated as you wait for events to catch up to your thoughts. Nevertheless, your patience is about to be rewarded while the Moon visits your uplifting sign. Make as much progress as you can during the next couple of days when the cosmic winds are blowing in your favor."
capricorn,2016-03-28,"Your frustration rises to the surface today as the pace of change increases. You don't mind having a lot to do, but readjusting to new circumstances can quickly tire you out. You're not happy if each and every activity opens yet another can of worms. You may reach a point when you realize there is too much happening all at once. But don't crawl under a rock and hide; finding the humor in the situation helps you regain your perspective. Your confidence returns later in the day, empowering you to move forward once again."
aquarius,2016-03-28,"A host of exciting activities leaves you little downtime today, and you love the current variety of distractions. However, everything can get a bit crazy as wild Uranus agitates sweet Venus in your 2nd House of Values. Although you're happy to be in your element, you can't keep up the hectic pace forever. Take time to smell the flowers and reconsider your priorities. Once you have a chance to regroup, you'll be eager to jump back into the fray, refreshed and raring to go."
pisces,2016-03-28,"Waiting for the most propitious moment to take action can be irritating because you're ready to execute your plan right away. You really don't see how you gain any sort of tactical advantage by delaying until the Moon connects with impulsive Mars in your 10th House of Career. Fortunately, there is no harm in starting immediately; it's just that your current efforts will have more enduring consequences if you consciously build your momentum gradually. Trust the process; good things take time."
aries,2016-03-29,"You're itching to rush out of the starting gate, but circumstances delay your progress until you put a concrete plan into place. Thankfully, you can deftly think through the alternative contingencies while under pressure and map out your strategy. But don't let logic limit your options; it's smarter now to combine a rational approach with your visionary ideas. Giving up too soon won't work in your favor; however, your unwavering commitment to reach your goal is currently your ticket to success."
taurus,2016-03-29,"Practicing self-discipline is crucial today because you will struggle unnecessarily if you try to overextend your limits. Nevertheless, opportunities abound to finish whatever you start if you establish attainable goals and then focus only on the most essential tasks. Positive thinking is a definite plus as long as you don't assume that your attitude is the only thing that matters. Intention plus hard work leads to a gratifying sense of accomplishment."
gemini,2016-03-29,"Your ability to rationalize is so amplified now that you could be the victim of your own cleverness. Mischievous Mercury is working overtime today, stimulating conversations to smooth over the rough spots in your life. Be careful not to dance around an unpleasant discussion now because denial can backfire and strain the relationship dynamics later on. Believe it or not, running from the truth is a lot tougher than facing it squarely in the eye."
cancer,2016-03-29,"You excel at communicating your feelings today, but unfortunately, even your closest friends might not fully understand your perspective. The problem is that certain complex emotions don't fit into language; a nuance can be lost in translation unless everyone understands the motivation behind your words. Remember that your behavior also speaks loudly, so make sure your actions are consistent with the message you're trying to get across."
leo,2016-03-29,"Although your insecurities might not be apparent, you're still concerned with the emotional response of your coworkers today. Unfortunately, your non-disclosure strategy is ineffective if you try to hide your anxiety by being purposefully vague. However, it's healthier to share as much information as possible, even if you must do it in bite-size pieces. Your associates are willing to help you even more if they are fully informed. Thankfully, there's no need to carry your burden alone."
virgo,2016-03-29,"You could probably get away with sloppy thinking today as long as you don't let the situation grow out of hand. Authoritative Saturn is beaming a stabilizing energy to your key planet Mercury, enabling you to improve your game while maintaining a sense of control. Thankfully, your allies will cut you some slack now if your logic momentarily falters. Remain true to your spirit and let your imagination run wild and free."
libra,2016-03-29,"You are adept at minimizing your needs to make a situation more pleasant for someone else. However, you could go overboard today, trying to remedy an emotional problem that's not your responsibility. Nosing around in other people's business rarely helps anyone, but you can still be a true friend by listening and showing your support. Caring for those you love is a gift as long as you remember to maintain healthy boundaries."
scorpio,2016-03-29,"Your emotional and spiritual needs are complex, often prompting you to keep them to yourself. However, your aspirations are wildly vivid and wonderfully specific now, and you may be hesitant to reveal your inner process. But there's no reason to close yourself off completely today; confiding in another person can help you process your feelings and deepen your relationship. Give yourself permission to wait until you're ready to share your colorful fantasies with someone you trust."
sagittarius,2016-03-29,"You're submerged in a sea of deep thoughts now, but you don't want to go public with your feelings just yet. Nevertheless, you might come across flippantly -- as if your emotions aren't very important -- especially when you talk about them in an offhand manner. Ironically, you may believe that changes are occurring, even if nothing obvious is happening today. Be courageous and seek your voice. Take a risk and reveal your heart."
capricorn,2016-03-29,"Although living up to your responsibilities is nothing new for you, taking care of business quickly fills up your schedule today. In spite of your ambitious agenda, you still might believe that you can pack another activity into your day. Unfortunately, even the time you set aside for exercise or relaxation is rapidly disappearing now. Thankfully, you can prevent your plans from falling apart by making smart choices early in the day. Less is more."
aquarius,2016-03-29,"You may feel strange if a casual conversation at work suddenly turns personal today. You might overreact, provoking you to say more than you would normally share and inspiring a real heart-to-heart connection. Although it could feel great at first, the mood likely grows awkward as the discussion continues. Don't be afraid to push past your comfort zone or you can undo the potentially positive consequences of breaking down an unspoken and unnecessary boundary."
pisces,2016-03-29,"It's so tempting to slip into an invisible caretaker role today because you are so empathic when it comes to the feelings of those you admire. It may be a real challenge to avoid playing the role of a martyr now, but giving away too much of yourself too quickly and transform compassion into resentment in the blink of an eye. Fortunately, you can truly help those you love in the long run if you remember to maintain healthy boundaries when opening your heart."
aries,2016-03-30,"You're ecstatic about sharing your ideas today, expecting others to either wholeheartedly agree with you or just keep their opinions to themselves. But even if you are on the right track, your know-it-all approach could upset people who are threatened by your apparent lack of humility. Fortunately, you can quickly smooth out potential bumps in the road before you reach them by simply softening your tone. When you don't take yourself so seriously, others will follow your lead. A healthy dose of self-deprecation is your secret weapon of persuasion."
taurus,2016-03-30,"It seems as if someone is trying to coerce you into accepting more responsibilities than you want now, but you might be unable to say no without causing static. Your resistance may stir up more negativity than just swallowing your pride and doing what's expected of you. But don't be too self-critical if it's a struggle to get motivated today. However, once your head is in the game, keep up the pace and follow through on whatever you start. Satisfaction will be yours for a job well done."
gemini,2016-03-30,"Being open-minded should be easy today, especially if the weight of responsibility is lifted from your shoulders, taking your self-doubt with it. However, reality gets in one last punch that could land you in a challenging situation if you unwittingly start a discussion that pushes people's buttons. You may end up unleashing more emotional drama than you intended. Nevertheless, sticking with the process should lead to a resolution sooner than you think. As coach Vince Lombardi said, ""A quitter never wins and a winner never quits."""
cancer,2016-03-30,"There are specific activities you would prefer to be doing now and you're not interested in waiting for someone's approval. However, your current impatience might exacerbate a fundamental disagreement between you and a coworker. Thankfully, it can be healing to discuss issues that you have been avoiding for the sake of convenience. There is no reason to shy away from a sensitive topic as long as you don't shift the blame to anyone else and take responsibility for your feelings. An atmosphere of mutual respect cultivates trust."
leo,2016-03-30,"You are on an energetic roll, but your intensity can land you in trouble today. Even if it seems like the big pieces are falling into place, you still may push harder than is necessary. Unfortunately, your eagerness could provoke others to resist your progress if you're trying to make up for lost time. Someone might even attempt to dull your sparkle just to bring you down a notch. Luckily, a bit of conscious constraint on your part now will ameliorate any bad feelings that surface. The trick is to shine your light without overshadowing the group."
virgo,2016-03-30,"You wish you could keep your feelings quiet today, but someone might lure you into their personal melodrama without warning. You may grow annoyed with the entire situation, provoking you to express yourself in an unrestrained manner. Unfortunately, you can lose your temper so quickly that you don't even realize what's happening until the deed is done. It's completely unnecessary to turn a difficult interaction into a major crisis by dwelling on your anger. Take the high road; let it go and move on."
libra,2016-03-30,"Everyone's attention appears to be directed toward someone else today, but your feelings need to be acknowledged, too. Typically, you thrive on being supportive of your friends and coworkers, but now you realize you must stand up for yourself. Say whatever is required to make your wishes known. Although you might not reach satisfaction by being fully recognized, at least you will feel satisfied that you attempted to reestablish balance in a relationship. Don't be afraid of failing; be afraid of not trying."
scorpio,2016-03-30,"You can't help but grow agitated if someone seems to hurry you along today. You might choose to deliberately postpone your forward progress for a while in order to assimilate all the recent changes. Nevertheless, it's not always possible to avoid your current commitments. People are counting on you to do your part, so you may need to wait another day or two before pursuing your own ambitions. Fulfilling your obligations leads to the freedom you seek."
sagittarius,2016-03-30,"These are exciting times, but you could be so steadfast in your beliefs now that you waste energy defending your position. Instead of worrying about the future, try experiencing the present. Thankfully, you can sidestep an unnecessary conflict today by toning down your rhetoric. A sweeping generalization or an unsubstantiated accusation might do more harm than good. Be persistent in the pursuit of your goals and flexible in your methods."
capricorn,2016-03-30,"Although you might be preoccupied with a personal problem today, the actual situation probably isn't as critical as you think. Your current emotional insecurity can unexpectedly overwhelm your rational outlook, tempting you to run home to hide away from everyone's judgmental glances. But the real message now is about holding your ground rather than throwing in the towel. Write your own script instead of playing a part in someone else's movie."
aquarius,2016-03-30,"Consider ditching your previous plans and starting from scratch today. Acting in a totally spontaneous manner empowers you to be extremely creative and, ultimately, more productive than following a preconceived agenda. Don't be concerned with what others think about your rebellious behavior now, even if you face emotional objections to your new strategy. The discussion might grow heated in the moment, but you will be happier in the long run if you structure your schedule to reflect your own needs and not acquiesce to anyone else's."
pisces,2016-03-30,"Developing an amazing idea just isn't enough to make your day memorable; you must include others in your planning now or you won't have the resources to reach your goals. Everything could fall apart at the seams if you don't involve your friends or coworkers. Nevertheless, discussing the alternatives with your peers prior to making a final decision improves the odds for your success. Fight against the tide and don't act impulsively today; listen to the feedback you receive before deciding how best to proceed."
aries,2016-03-31,"Your focus is internally directed today, even if your day is filled with a variety of activities. You might not be able to relax, yet the notion of withdrawing from your commitments and taking it easy is still quite appealing. Whatever happens next originates as a thought, and you are relatively free to conjure up anything you choose within your imagination. Put your fantasies to work by filling your mind with new possibilities that move your life forward in a positive direction."
taurus,2016-03-31,"Unexpected events can shock you out of your sleepy reverie today. Nevertheless, you may attempt to avoid all the commotion by keeping your revelations quiet. Unfortunately, you might just waste a lot of energy suppressing your thoughts. The sooner you acknowledge the fact that you can't escape from the action, the less stress you will carry on your shoulders. Graciously letting go of your previous plans allows you to enjoy yourself more than you expected. A surprise could be fun if you don't resist the change in the air."
gemini,2016-03-31,"Your current annoyance with feeling emotionally restricted is exacerbated now by an irrepressible rebellious streak. Your associates may be concerned about your unpredictable behavior, but you're at the opposite end of the spectrum, excited about all the possibilities. Nearly anything that distracts you from your boredom seems like a fantastic opportunity today. Chase your dreams but don't let your responsibilities go unfulfilled. Nearly anything is possible if you reach for the stars while keeping your feet on the ground."
cancer,2016-03-31,"If you're worried that you haven't been such a great friend recently, you now have the chance to step up to the plate and be awesome in the eyes of others. Don't dwell on past regrets; guilt only blocks your path in the present. Instead, act with confidence and people will appreciate your presence in their lives. No matter what, do the right thing. Imagine your ideal future and take a risk in order to create it. A leap of faith is your ticket to redemption."
leo,2016-03-31,"Exciting revelations about your choices on the path of life are occurring faster than you can integrate them into your plans. But making rational sense of your brilliant flashes may not be as critical as you think. Even if you are committed to holding steady on your course, at least give yourself permission to entertain a few out-of-the-box possibilities that cross your mind today. There will be plenty of time to prioritize your options over the days ahead but for now color outside of the lines."
virgo,2016-03-31,"You might think reality is testing you today to see if you can be practical even while your erratic thoughts are jumping all over the map. Although you haven't yet agreed to participate in a plan developed by your coworkers, it doesn't make sense to resist too strongly. Other people's inspirations could be the catalyst for your own fantastic ideas as discussions excite you with new schemes that won't fit neatly into your preexisting world. This is a time of substantial growth; the exploration of uncharted territories teaches you vital lessons that you need to learn."
libra,2016-03-31,"There's no reason to abandon your entire schedule today, even if sticking to it becomes an exercise in futility. Just make the specific changes you must, while keeping the basic structure of your routine intact. The attention you put on the tiniest of matters now may be exactly what brings you the most knowledge. Practicing self-discipline is no easy task, but it can produce the greatest rewards. Paradoxically, an intellectual breakthrough comes from limiting your options rather than exploring them."
scorpio,2016-03-31,"Your hopeful plans about an upcoming social escapade could unexpectedly fall apart now. However, this sudden change doesn't need to be cause for disappointment. If one course of action fails, it creates additional room for something better to happen. Unbeknownst to you, your free will is influencing the present moment and your current attitude determines the trajectory that follows. Think outside of the box today because your future is not limited by the conventional. Radical thought can take you to amazing places."
sagittarius,2016-03-31,"It appears as if you are finally being released from a difficult emotional situation that has been weighing you down. Luckily, there is great potential for a real transformation today. But don't waste energy ruminating over something you could have done differently. Instead, reframe the past in a larger perspective before making plans for what's next. Even if you're not quite ready to swing into action, at least decide where you want to go and when you will start your new journey. Be the change you want to see in the world."
capricorn,2016-03-31,"New information is bombarding you on an emotional front now, but it's challenging to remain receptive. Your natural tendency is to resist if people rely on their authority to put you in your place. When your feelings are stirred, you are inspired to rebel against those in charge in order to reassert your position. Don't worry about losing face today by revealing your vulnerability. Nothing is gained by fortifying your ego or pretending you know everything. Your best chance of coming out on top occurs when you simply trust in the truth as you know it."
aquarius,2016-03-31,"Your pet project may undergo a surprise attack from a friend today. Or, perhaps, you might be required to consider surprising facts that contradict your previous position. Either way, stay open to whatever you learn now, since it can catalyze an emotional release or loosen intellectual restraints that are holding you back from your potential. Reexamining your basic assumptions and updating your perspective frees you to embrace your future."
pisces,2016-03-31,"You could react erratically as others push you to your limit today, empowering you to break free from their control. However, your current rebellion is not as surprising to you as it is to everyone else because you are fully aware of the motives that are driving your behavior. Don't waste time and energy justifying your actions; your ideas won't likely be understood now, anyhow. Fortunately, your unconventional behavior will make more sense to your coworkers over the days ahead. Carpe diem!"
aries,2016-04-01,"An unrelenting influx of new information from multiple directions entices you to change your mind today. However, the most critical things you learn now don't necessarily arrive through regular communication channels. You might think you're being offered a direct connection to the center of the cosmos, but the creative juice is really originating within your own imagination. Write down as many ideas as you can, for they hold the seeds to the next phase of your personal growth."
taurus,2016-04-01,"Previous assumptions are quickly shattered today as a friend relates a story that blasts open your mind to reveal a new point of view. Normally, you are resistant to this kind of sudden change, but your mind races ahead now and eagerly integrates the exciting ideas. Make the most of your newly acquired intellectual freedom while you're still riding the adrenaline rush. Letting go of your past makes room for your future."
gemini,2016-04-01,"Surprising changes in your career path can bring dramatic fluctuations to your finances in the form of an unexpected windfall or an unscheduled expenditure. Remember, you're likely to overreact as your mind makes quantum somersaults today, so don't assume that your acrobatic thinking is without flaws. Reconsider any large purchase before you acquire something you don't really want. Managing your money wisely now will pay off handsomely in the end."
cancer,2016-04-01,"You're too quick to put up protective boundaries now as coworkers insist that you execute your job in a very specific manner. Unfortunately, you might have a totally different idea about how to go about your work, but it's nearly impossible to put your thoughts into words today. Meanwhile, people may assume you're keeping a big secret if you seem nervous, but don't buy into their insecurities. Instead of allowing someone else's fears to limit your choices, act on the strength of your convictions."
leo,2016-04-01,"Unusual thoughts can lure you into unfamiliar waters today, and you must travel alone on this journey of the soul. You may be concentrating on finding the solution to a particular problem, yet you are actually poised to make a larger breakthrough now. Don't share your ideas with anyone else yet; it's better to be quiet and explore your own thought process without interruption. Express what's on your mind later on when you're ready to share your plans with the rest of the world."
virgo,2016-04-01,"Limiting your communication to the facts won't prevent a conversation from drifting into uncharted territory. Clever Mercury and brilliant Uranus send shockwaves to the masterful Capricorn Moon, brightening your dreams and synchronizing your nervous system with the present moment. Cultivate a flexible attitude; your willingness to change gives you the chance to learn so much about yourself and the world. Your mind is like a parachute, it functions best when open."
libra,2016-04-01,"You could wake up feeling like you can't please everyone now, so why should you bother trying? Anyhow, the Cosmos wants you to be outrageously original today, and as unconventional as possible. Breaking free from predictable patterns can actually strengthen your hand, so be experimental -- or even slightly rebellious -- as you move outside your normal safety zone. Thankfully, your natural sense of balance will keep you safe and centered wherever you roam."
scorpio,2016-04-01,"It feels as if your mind is running a repeating loop of movie trailers featuring your possible future paths. Surprisingly, these flashes of light are not matching up to your five-year plan. There's no reason to panic because your current fantasies are simply your way to rebel against the status quo. However, there may be ingenious ideas worth pursuing that could disappear due to the sheer volume of creative thoughts. If something strikes a chord, write it down immediately so it doesn't get lost in the noise."
sagittarius,2016-04-01,"Your first reaction to new opportunities on the horizon may reflect your need to control anything that's beyond the immediate sphere of your influence. Thankfully, you can see that relationship dynamics are shifting for good reason. Nevertheless, you're not ready to jump on board of the next big thing that appears on your radar now. Fortunately, the tension eases once you accept the new direction your life is taking and recognize that you're blessed to be along for the ride. The only difference between fear and excitement is your attitude."
capricorn,2016-04-01,"You're one to build your reality on stable foundations, yet trouble can develop if uncertainty or self-doubt turns you overly rigid. Today's lessons can help you understand exactly where in your life you need to loosen up, especially when you must respond to the feelings of others. Fear of change is your nemesis now, so practice flexibility as you stretch and bend in the face of emotional transformation."
aquarius,2016-04-01,"You are living in a data-rich environment, so make maximum use of everything you're currently learning by thinking as far outside of the box as you can. Your key planet, eccentric Uranus, is on day two of receiving an interplanetary power boost from intelligent Mercury. By incorporating your radical ideas into the flow of events now, you inspire everyone around you to be more original in their thought process. Cosmic Genius Albert Einstein said, ""Creativity is contagious; pass it on."""
pisces,2016-04-01,"You have a galaxy full of magic at your disposal today, but you must take the initiative to start something new. Of course, you can share your emotional spontaneity by communicating a message from your heart, but it might not work if you take too much time searching for the right words. There's no reason to rationalize your desire to establish a deeper connection with a friend. Just reach out by coming from a place of love; your sincere overtures will convey your true intentions."
aries,2016-04-02,"You often exhibit extra amounts of enthusiasm in pursuit of making improvements to your life. Pushing the envelope now fuels an even higher level of excitement as new ideas and people entice you to explore uncharted lands. Nevertheless, don't put all of your eggs in any one basket; keep your options open by spreading your energy around, instead. Your reward for following your passion is the possibility of experiencing a spiritual renewal. Author Joseph Campbell wrote, ""Follow your bliss and the universe will open doors where there were only walls."""
taurus,2016-04-02,"Although you may be clear about your career goals now, confusing circumstances at work prevent you from creating an action plan. You wish there was someone to share your concerns with but disclosure might feel inappropriate at this time. However, if particular events recently triggered you emotionally, don't be afraid to tell your story. You are psychically attuned today, and your intuition can work in your favor if you're willing to listen to the feedback you receive from others. No risk, no reward."
gemini,2016-04-02,"You can teach people a thing or two about the art of persuasion today, but you need to be careful about using your charming personality to influence others for your personal gain. You're anxious to discuss your opinions and beliefs, even if you're not currently interested in the normal chit-chat that people expect from you. Although you have serious issues on your mind, you can appear innocent enough to rope others into your agenda. Don't misuse your coercive powers by acting on selfish motivations; instead, work for the common good and sleep more soundly at night."
cancer,2016-04-02,"Your next move might be unclear because you can't predict how people will react to your emotions now, and the potential fallout seems a bit scary. Remember, your inner landscape influences your outer world, so don't sequester your heart away where it can't be found. Instead, wear your personal likes and dislikes on your sleeve like a badge of courage. Follow your instincts today while remaining detached from the final outcome. Spontaneity is your friend."
leo,2016-04-02,"You were waiting for a day like this, yet everything depends on how honest you are about what's transpiring in your heart. Your chances of success in the department of love and romance depend on you making your move with confidence. You are possessed by a power that comes from the belief that you're doing the right thing. Nevertheless, nothing you do now is casual, so initiate action only if you really mean it. Do it with passion or not at all."
virgo,2016-04-02,"You can be easily misunderstood in the realm of romance because your actions might be easily misinterpreted by others. But you're not always aloof and cool, even when you're willing to patiently wait until the setting is perfect. A developing situation may ignite a fire in your heart now. Don't think twice; slip past the practical words and social constraints into the emotional world of desires and feelings in order to make the most of a current connection. Go big or go home."
libra,2016-04-02,"Conflicting messages on this high-energy day can force you to seek harmony in the midst of confusion and chaos. You long for some good old-fashioned romance today, and your attraction isn't necessarily rational. The intensity of your fantasies is surprising, but don't be afraid of sharing your romantic feelings. The bad news is your illusions could be shattered, but the good news is the potential positive outcome outweighs the emotional risk. Take a chance; you never know what might happen unless you put your heart on the line."
scorpio,2016-04-02,"Although your feelings appear to be riding on a roller coaster these days, you get a welcome taste of stability today. Thankfully, even wildly shifting emotions are more pleasant to experience for a while. Nevertheless, a melodrama may still play out now in the presence of an intimate partner or close friend. But transferring your fears and desires onto an unsuspecting victim won't help anyone. Staying conscious of your motives positively inspires your interactions, making it easier for others to benefit from your newfound grace and compassion."
sagittarius,2016-04-02,"Relationships are an open playing field for your passions now. In fact, your life is already growing more colorful with sexy Mars stirring up mischief in your sign for the next couple of months. Don't hold back when expressing your needs because you won't scare a worthy partner away. If your enthusiasm is too much for others now, they won't be able to engage your energy down the road, either. Let down your guard or current issues will only become more problematic later on. Trust in the truth; play your cards out on the table and let the chips fall where they may."
capricorn,2016-04-02,"You never know what might happen if your emotions sink into dark places. However, you're more comfortable with the possibilities now because you're better equipped to control your feelings. You can choose when and where to shine the light of your awareness into the darkness. Your healthy sense of detachment makes this journey perfectly safe, possibly even enchanting. It's time to let go of your fears, close your eyes and surrender into the uncertainty. A better version of you is waiting on the other side of the door if you're willing to open your heart."
aquarius,2016-04-02,"You quickly feel uneasy when situations pull you into places of intense passion. Although the evocative Moon is wandering through your sign today, your need to share your desires is sufficient to push you outside of your old comfort zone and into unfamiliar emotional realms. Avoid an unnecessary verbal confrontation by simply moving past the restraints of language. Taking the high road now invites others to follow your lead."
pisces,2016-04-02,"You seem to be spending more time exploring your own private dreamland now, but simultaneously, the most practical issues in your life are currently visible, too. Paradoxically, the deeper you journey inward, the more power you display as your confidence radiates from within. Happily, you're able to engage the real world directly from your imagination by taking a chance and sharing your vision. If you are successful in your endeavors, you will be happy. If you fail, you will be wise. You win either way."
aries,2016-04-03,"You see exciting possibilities nearly everywhere you look today. However, don't expect to be suddenly struck over the head with answers to all of your pending questions. Instead, notice how your perspective is changing when it comes to your future. You're more willing to let an ambiguity resolve naturally. It's healthy to visualize the desired outcome to a situation now, but there's no need to force resolution to the issue prematurely. Sometimes waiting for the right moment is the toughest thing you can do."
taurus,2016-04-03,"Although you wish you could make plans for the future, you're not that eager to peer too far into the distance now. You may believe you are close to reaching an important milestone on your path to success, even if there's still a long way to go. But there is no reason to waste energy by concentrating on an immediate problem or unforeseen obstacle today. Just get busy and create a new timetable that charts a more realistic arrival at your destination."
gemini,2016-04-03,"You might experience an uncharacteristic desire for solitude today, but your friends will probably seek you out and ask you to accompany them on their latest adventure, anyway. Don't waste your time trying to rationalize your reclusive behavior because your logic won't resonate with others. Save your energy and just say yes. Once you resign yourself to joining the group, you'll quickly forget why you wanted to be alone earlier. Sometimes, relinquishing control is the smartest thing you can do. Never underestimate the importance of having fun."
cancer,2016-04-03,"If you're not comfortable with the interpersonal dynamics in a relationship, you have a perfect opportunity to push beyond your fears and speak up today. Although you often cling to the familiar because it fosters security, be courageous and take an emotional risk. Nothing is gained now by playing it safe; do whatever you can to align your deeds with your needs. You may be happily surprised when you take the initiative to stretch past your old limitations. There's no time like the present moment to claim your power."
leo,2016-04-03,"An eccentric might arrive on the scene while the non-conformist Aquarius Moon reflects the energy of your 7th House of Others. A potentially exciting invitation may not be what you expected, but you could be tempted to turn down the offer because of scheduling constraints. However, today won't likely unfold according to your original plans anyhow, so consider setting aside your agenda for some spontaneous fun. Your flexible spirit will be rewarded with laughter and happy memories."
virgo,2016-04-03,"You may have several unusual tasks on today's to-do list, and you're eager to get started. However, you're not clear how everything will unfold until you actually begin, so don't waste time trying to fill in the details. Your best strategy is to relinquish your need to micromanage and simply make impromptu decisions along the way. You already have the necessary skills in your toolbox for whatever obstacle you might encounter. Adaptability is the key to your success."
libra,2016-04-03,"You're easily enticed into avoiding your long-term responsibilities for a while as you pursue a bit of pleasure today. Take time to express yourself in the present moment while the Moon is spotlighting your 5th House of Play. Don't be overly concerned about your unfinished business; you can complete your obligations tomorrow. For now, be creative in all your endeavors. Instead of trying to impress someone with your productivity, do something for the sheer fun of it."
scorpio,2016-04-03,"Your friends will need to put extra effort into convincing you to go out today because the Moon's presence in your 4th House of Security reminds you of how much pleasure you derive from staying home. You wish you could watch the world go by quietly since your inner experience is much more compelling now than scattering your energy socially. Don't worry if you fall short of someone's expectations; you're the only one who gets to decide what brings spiritual value into your life, even if it doesn't involve anyone else."
sagittarius,2016-04-03,"Your need for independence is so strong these days that you might not be willing to justify your desires to anyone else. Obviously, you are willing to discuss almost any subject, but no one has the authority to tell you what to think or insinuate that your beliefs are wrong. The Moon's harmonious connection with stabilizing Saturn in your optimistic sign today lifts your spirit above the mundane events of your daily life. Taking a moment to remember that you're in charge of your inner world is enough to make you happy now."
capricorn,2016-04-03,"You might want to make a decision about money matters today, but it's tricky to focus on the specifics when you're being pulled in several directions. There are a few things you would like to do now, but there may not be enough cash to go around. Although social obligations can make your choices more complicated, remember to be nice to yourself, too. Ultimately, you must follow your bliss and encourage others to do the same."
aquarius,2016-04-03,"It's unnecessary to hide your heartfelt needs just because someone else may be uncomfortable with them. The Moon's current visit to your eclectic sign grants you permission to express your feelings, even if they're not what others expect. Nevertheless, you don't have the right to spew your opinions without doing so in a kind and respectful manner. Being considerate of those you love might change your words, but it really doesn't have to alter your truth."
pisces,2016-04-03,"Your spiritual orientation is currently capable of turning the most boring chore into a sacred act of gratitude. Luckily, this will be a magical day if you remember that it's up to you to create a positive atmosphere wherever you go by virtue of your attitude. Honor the richness of your imagination and aspire to experience beauty, even if it cannot be put into words. Sometimes the most profound experiences can only be communicated by silence and a connection of the souls."
aries,2016-04-04,"You are all too familiar with overextending your energy and you could fall into this same alluring trap today unless you proceed with caution. Thankfully, avoiding trouble is not difficult now if you scale back your plans and promises before you are in over your head. Unfortunately, it's much trickier to find your way back to a manageable position if you wait until you run out of time or energy. Incorporating realistic thinking right from the start keeps you ahead of the curve throughout the day."
taurus,2016-04-04,"You can talk a big game today, but executing your plan isn't as straightforward as you wish. It's tempting to skip over important details, but they will probably come back to haunt you before you fulfill your commitments. Recognizing that everything seems better than it actually is now could be enough to prevent problems from developing later in the day. Taking time to analyze the situation before jumping in allows you to put an amazing opportunity into a healthier perspective. A self-administered reality check is your friend."
gemini,2016-04-04,"It's not wise to shoot the messenger, especially if she is bearing good news. But the planets may stir up trouble if you automatically believe everything you hear. Unfortunately, your current lack of discernment encourages others to stretch the truth even more. Thankfully, you can save yourself from a headache by verifying the facts as you hear them. But don't be so negative that you shut off the flow of incoming information. Balancing your skepticism with an open mind leaves an opportunity for your friends to surprise you with a bit of unexpected fun."
cancer,2016-04-04,"Although you may have your share of problems today, they appear to be quite manageable upon closer analysis. Your current willingness to take a risk increases your options, but having more alternatives doesn't necessarily mean that any of them will be the correct one. Standing up to defend your point of view right away enables you to avoid serious conflict before it grows out of hand. People will admire you even more if you honor your integrity right from the start."
leo,2016-04-04,"Be certain that you're motivated by good intentions when involving people in your personal drama today, rather than just seeking extra attention. Your current crisis needs to be handled and, thankfully, someone may ask the right questions that can help you focus your thoughts. Your intuition will steer you in the right direction now, but you still must bring your brilliant ideas down to earth. Ironically, a practical plan helps you capture the magic of this inspiring moment."
virgo,2016-04-04,"Your current business acumen is admirable, but your analytical superpowers could have a detrimental influence if you think you can justify anything you want to do. Your brain is smoking hot today, yet your brilliant thoughts may lure you down a slippery slope of inflated importance. Rather than wasting time trying to rationalize your choices, pay attention to the feedback you receive and adjust your course of action as necessary. Acting on the sage advice of others paves the road to your success."
libra,2016-04-04,"You prefer to keep the peace but you might feel called to speak up anyhow and give someone a piece of your mind today. Just be careful of where you step because you're about to get swept up in a whirlwind of fast-moving energy that sucks you into a jet stream and quickly carries you far away from home. Happily, you can talk your way into or out of almost anything now. Relying on your diplomatic charm works in your favor when you need it most."
scorpio,2016-04-04,"Spending a lot of money just to impress someone you admire won't be as appreciated as you wish. The fact of the matter is you can't accurately express your emotions by buying anything material. Instead of placing yourself in a precarious position by ignoring your budget and purchasing a token of your affection, just state your feelings as directly as possible. Your message is more powerful today if you simply speak from your heart. A gift of your love is a priceless treasure."
sagittarius,2016-04-04,"You're like a worker bee high on pollen in a field of spring wildflowers. Every individual thought that crosses your mind seems to be the best one ever and leads to yet another one. The supply of ideas appears endless as the radiant Sun aligns with bountiful Jupiter to increase your confidence. However, others might not agree with your optimistic assessment; they think that your Pollyanna approach is foolish. Waiting a day or two prior to making any final decisions helps you pick the best flower and cultivate it into a successful plan of action."
capricorn,2016-04-04,"An overdose of blind trust turns you practical goats into gullible sheep today. However, once led astray an unexpected event might require you to put your perspective back in balance. You can maintain a spiritual point of view based on the belief that everything is exactly as it should be at this time. But don't use this line of logic to justify your willingness to be a follower. Reclaim your power by setting a goal and working toward it, even if you don't see any appreciable progress right away. Live for the journey, not the destination."
aquarius,2016-04-04,"You could easily lose focus on your responsibilities today because it's more fun to imagine your future than to deal with reality. Unfortunately, acting like a hopeless romantic shifts your thoughts away from the tasks at hand. Imagining the possibilities of what may come to pass is often a useful endeavor; however, it can also get in the way of the work that's right in front of you. The real challenge now isn't about achieving your long-term goals; it's to remain present in the present moment."
pisces,2016-04-04,"You may feel as if you have another chance to grab the prize, yet your time is running out. However, the sense of urgency you are experiencing today is likely based on a faulty assumption. Although your current actions seem to wield greater influence now, pushing too hard stirs up more resistance than it's worth. Paradoxically, temporarily flying in a holding pattern might actually enable you to reach your destination sooner than if you continue to pursue your goals with all your heart."
aries,2016-04-05,"You may be so anxious about your future that it's challenging to pay attention to what's occurring in the present moment. Oddly enough, a past memory might be even more of a problem today than whatever actually happens next. Thankfully, this nostalgic detour down Memory Lane can become a significant learning experience once vulnerable Venus enters your passionate sign. Instead of obsessing about unresolved feelings left over from your sentimental journey, trust the intelligence of here and now."
taurus,2016-04-05,"You might be so preoccupied with a single idea that it's nearly impossible for anyone to talk to you about anything else. Nevertheless, following your friends is a clever move now since they will likely steer you in the right direction. Minimizing the overall significance of your own thoughts is a useful tactic today, making you more accessible to others. You currently gain more through cooperation than you possibly can on your own. A burden shared lightens the load for all."
gemini,2016-04-05,"You would like nothing more than to put your feet up and dream your troubles away today, but you're also worried about too many untied loose ends. Unfortunately, your lack of responsibility could be a familiar theme. Nevertheless, this uncomfortable situation is a fantastic opportunity to grow from your past mistakes. Forget about any recreational activities until you wrap up your unfinished business. It's much easier to fully relax once you have done the right thing and demonstrated your dependability."
cancer,2016-04-05,"The power of positive thinking sends you off in the right direction today, but you need to follow up with good old-fashioned hard work. Finishing your chores enables you to fully enjoy the pleasures you so richly deserve. Even if you only plan a quiet evening at home, create the time and space to imagine the positive changes you wish to experience in the near future. There aren't many sound reasons to constrain your creativity now; if you can visualize it, chances are you can make it happen."
leo,2016-04-05,"You thought you would be ready to make a major move today, but instead you grow more contemplative as the day wears on. You know you should be thankful for the stable ground in your life these days, but you also are painfully aware of the obstacles still blocking your progress. Nevertheless, there's no need to focus on what's wrong; concentrate on everything you could be doing to continue your personal growth. Slow and steady change wins out in the end."
virgo,2016-04-05,"You may try to deny your true intentions today. Even if you're clear about your feelings, you don't want anyone to know your secrets. Unfortunately, withholding information is a serious waste of energy now, especially since your peers probably already know more than you realize. Informing people of your plans isn't as much of a risk as it seems. Taking others into your confidence strengthens your position and helps you reach your goals sooner than you expect."
libra,2016-04-05,"You are tempted to express yourself in an outrageous manner today, but your common sense prevents you from going too far overboard. If you encounter resistance to your efforts as you try to do your own thing now, it's okay to fall back on your willingness to accommodate others. Let go of control and go along with the group for the sake of harmony. Being true to your heart while also keeping your mind open to different perspectives requires an experienced touch."
scorpio,2016-04-05,"Breaking out of your sequestered world requires extra effort on your part, but you might truly enjoy the company of others once you push past your own resistance. If you keep to yourself today, you may end up wishing you took a more social route, instead. Luckily, you don't need to hide your emotions or temper your desires now. Trust your instincts to pick just the right moment to share your feelings. Timing is everything when it comes to matters of the heart."
sagittarius,2016-04-05,"If you're running around like a lab mouse on a wheel today, you might be too distracted to fully appreciate the camaraderie of your friends and associates. Nevertheless, there is a solid support system in place, ready to carry you to the next level if you let it. Allowing yourself to be vulnerable with those you trust can prove to be the exact catalyst you need to remind you of what's most important. Slow down and smell the flowers right in your own backyard."
capricorn,2016-04-05,"You take your responsibilities very seriously today as the bright Sun trines your ruling planet, taskmaster Saturn. You may feel as if you're deeply immersed in a project, while still being eager to face a new challenge ahead. Nevertheless, you are committed to finishing the job you have already started. Be patient, build on your accomplishments and wait for the opportunities to reap the rewards. Your work ethic is a shining inspiration to everyone around you. Your dedication is an example to follow."
aquarius,2016-04-05,"Everyone's intriguing ideas motivate you to start something new now, but you need to be willing to change and grow so you can maximize the current opportunities. A personal transformation becomes a lot more challenging if you are unwilling to let go of the past. Don't cling too tightly to the status quo or you won't be able to take advantage of the amazing possibilities that are within your grasp. Open your mind and dance with the unknown."
pisces,2016-04-05,"You can learn a valuable lesson about human nature today by simply stopping to reevaluate your recent history. Paradoxically, your review process might also stimulate your anticipation of the future. Your life is taking on a greater meaning as social systems bend under the pressure of change. Meanwhile, you are one hundred percent committed to creating stability in the midst of chaos, even if you don't yet know how you will manage it. Don't worry too much about the details; you won't get lost if you follow your intuition and trust your moral compass."
aries,2016-04-06,"Complex issues of psychological intrigue tug on your psyche today. On one hand, your daily routine may be working fine when it comes to meeting your responsibilities. But on the other hand, you know it's necessary to stand up for your firm convictions. Nevertheless, consider softening your original position, not because you're wrong, but because it's wise to avoid instigating a meltdown. Thankfully, you can still share your plans as long as you don't assume that you have all the answers. There are many paths to the same destination if you're willing to listen."
taurus,2016-04-06,"You planned on declaring your ultimate truth today, but it's challenging to dig to the bottom of your current emotional discomfort. You could end up engaging in an intense disagreement that's motivated by your desire to wield your power. If you're unwilling to share your feelings, no one will be able to accept your words as sincere. Even if you can't decide on a specific outcome now, don't compromise your beliefs. You will end up just where you need to be if you follow your heart."
gemini,2016-04-06,"You are painting with a wide palate of feelings that are too complicated to express today. Unfortunately, your emotions tighten your hold on what's happening in your outer world, even if your motives are unconscious. For example, if someone attempts to control your behavior, your response might be to just let it slide. Keep in mind that whatever you don't deal with now will just surface again in a different context. Bring unresolved issues out into the open sooner than later for the best results. The sigh of relief you hear won't just be your own."
cancer,2016-04-06,"You might not be able to stop yourself from acting out your feelings today. Ironically, your decision to keep your insecurities or criticisms to yourself doesn't mean you'll be capable of hiding them. It's not that you're overly  demonstrative these days; it's just that your emotions are so powerful that they will find an outlet for expression now, no matter what. Fortunately, a healthy dose of honesty is just what the doctor ordered. Don't stay silent just so others can stay comfortable."
leo,2016-04-06,"Your emotional insecurity could lead you to act more passionately in a relationship today. But you're not faking anything; it's just that you might be experiencing an uncharacteristic bout with self-doubt now. Take a chance and start a conversation about your uncertainty. The outcome may be worth any temporary discomfort, even if you don't know what's lurking in the shadows of your heart. Holding a candle to the darkness casts an entirely new light on the situation."
virgo,2016-04-06,"You assume you're successfully camouflaging your feelings today, but those closest to you can read you like an open book. Nevertheless, you're not sure that anyone truly understands your current needs. Pay attention to where your thoughts are wandering or you might end up misleading others unintentionally. Fortunately, peeling off the layers initiates a long-overdue conversation that could resolve a lingering conflict. Life is too short for regret."
libra,2016-04-06,"Concentrate on being practical today or you could end up obsessing about something out of your control. Your goal is a familiar one -- to create middle ground that everyone can happily share. However, someone might not be willing to partake in your diplomatic process now. Nevertheless, don't be afraid to establish a playing field for negotiation because others will eventually join in once you establish the guidelines. Let there be peace on Earth and let it begin with you."
scorpio,2016-04-06,"You're not interested in playing any games today, unless you believe they will lead to something more substantial. Lighthearted banter is only worthwhile if it's the way into the shadowy world of Pluto, since that is where you really want to hang out. Be as clear as possible now when explaining your intentions; you can seductively entice someone to join you on your metaphysical journey, only to discover later they have a completely different idea about the destination."
sagittarius,2016-04-06,"You aren't following rules of logic today as you strive to fulfill your desires. Although you're eager to communicate with others, your words are just a smoke screen to hide your vulnerability. You're in touch with emotional needs you can't talk about with just anyone. A Zen master might instruct you to do nothing, but this passive approach won't help your cause. Bring your feelings out into the open to avoid unnecessary additional conflict later on. If you don't give up, you still have a chance."
capricorn,2016-04-06,"People often assume they know how deeply you feel, but just because you don't always wear your heart on your sleeve doesn't mean you are without passion. However, your emotions may be overflowing today, intensifying your interactions with others. You're aware that something profound is cooking but it seems too soon to take it out of the oven. Allow your process to marinate in its own creative juices before trying to explain your feelings to anyone else, but remember there's nothing wrong with being vulnerable with someone you trust."
aquarius,2016-04-06,"Your emotional needs differ from those of your friends and family, yet just the idea of standing up to anyone else at this time seems overwhelming. You might be afraid of creating too much ill will by bucking the tide today. However, resentment will continue to build if you keep your feelings to yourself. Adopting an open and honest policy is your safest route to peace of mind, even if there's bumpy territory to traverse first."
pisces,2016-04-06,"You are very accomplished at managing multidimensional living, but complex interpersonal dynamics could tax your patience today. You are being called to reevaluate your goals and do some powerful work within your imagination. Wander around in your thoughts until your desires begin to settle down. Just remember, sooner or later you must face your feelings through direct interactions with others. Wait for the right moment to act, but don't stand on the sidelines for too long or you'll miss your chance to connect."
aries,2016-04-07,"You could believe your perceptions are so accurate today that you don't want to bother consulting anyone else. Unfortunately, you might know the risks and take foolhardy action anyhow with the New Moon falling in your impetuous sign. Rather than making pompous gestures based on incorrect assumptions, ask others what they want first and then take their ideas to heart. Feedback from someone you trust can help you make a positive breakthrough in your own behavior. An open mind is the doorway to personal growth."
taurus,2016-04-07,"You may head into work with a secret today, but it's not likely that you will keep it to yourself for long. The Aries New Moon blesses your 12th House of Imagination, so you tend to focus on your inner world more than the events of the day. Nevertheless, the expressive Aries energy continues to push outward, motivating you to expose what was hidden. Decide in advance how much you want to share and then adhere to the limits you set. Balancing these contrary forces cultivates trust."
gemini,2016-04-07,"Hanging out with friends sounds like a fine idea now that the rowdy Aries New Moon activates your 11th House of Social Networking. However, you can't escape your commitments just to goof off. Thankfully, you should be able to enjoy yourself today as long as you get your work done first. Taking the easy way out will not be as rewarding as you might expect. You'll like who you see in the mirror more if you deliver on your promises with a smile."
cancer,2016-04-07,"It's a challenge to rein in your professional impulses while the enterprising Aries New Moon energizes your 10th House of Career. But telling everyone how to run the show isn't such a smart move today. You can talk about your life, career goals and plans for the future, yet your message might not align with your heart. It's not that you are misleading anyone on purpose; it's just that you are experiencing ambivalence. Let your emotions continue to settle naturally without trying to push your agenda. Opportunity often arrives in a fog of uncertainty."
leo,2016-04-07,"Your lion-like roar might be quite ferocious today as the expressive Aries New Moon fires up your 9th House of Opinions. Emotions are even tilted farther out of line when the Moon bumps into difficult aspects with suspicious Pluto and stern Saturn. Nevertheless, there's no reason to worry about what may happen down the road, because you don't have all the information at your disposal yet. Ironically, the whole story will come out later if you don't dig too hard for the answers now."
virgo,2016-04-07,"It's time to discuss the larger issues that are often set aside in the name of getting things done in the present moment. But even if you can't find the answers you seek while the Aries New Moon rattles your 8th House of Hidden Motives, just talking about your goals may be of great value now. Open communication is not only the way into a deeper relationship; it's also the way out of your current dilemma. As author Jack Canfield wrote, ""Each day is an adventure in discovering the meaning of life."""
libra,2016-04-07,"You are the partnership people of the zodiac and you tend to have a magical touch with those around you now. Fortunately, you can happily accommodate the needs of others, especially while the ardent Aries New Moon is heating up your 7th House of Companions. However, your perceptions are so sharp that separating your own feelings out of the mix might be tricky. Don't minimize your desires for the sake of harmony; taking good care of yourself enables you to be emotionally available to nurture those who need it."
scorpio,2016-04-07,"If you recently fell short of your own expectations at an attempt to make changes in a diet or exercise program, it's time to try again while the Aries New Moon is pressurizing your 6th House of Routine. Although you may be tempted to experiment in a radically new way, don't lose sight of your goals. Stay focused on your destination to minimize the distractions and keep on track. Making small healthy adjustments leads to lasting positive results. A butterfly needs to grow wings before it can take flight."
sagittarius,2016-04-07,"You can take your productivity to new heights, especially if you find the maturity to capture your brilliance instead of squelching it. But the red-hot Aries New Moon's presence in your 5th House of Self-Expression does not offer a practical strategy to success today. Nevertheless, stick with your innovative ideas when sharing your plans with others. Ultimately, an emotional disclosure may simply be the catalyst that gets you where you wanted to go all along. As Picasso wrote, ""The chief enemy of creativity is good sense."""
capricorn,2016-04-07,"If you have been wrestling with problems on the home front, everything may appear to vastly improve today. Thankfully, going to work takes the pressure off your personal concerns for a while. However, the Aries New Moon agitates your 4th House of Roots, reminding you that the family dynamics will likely be waiting for you whenever you choose to return. Set your caution aside and delve into the issues at hand. Your good intentions and sincere efforts won't go unnoticed by those who matter most."
aquarius,2016-04-07,"Your life is bursting at the seams, overflowing with a variety of things to do and people to see. All this noise is amplified by the polarization of the independent Aries New Moon in your 3rd House of Information, making it difficult to settle into the serious work in front of you. It really doesn't matter if you can't envision the outcome today. Just jump in and do your best. Good fortune may be delayed but, luckily, it's still on the horizon."
pisces,2016-04-07,"People can observe your confidence in action now, but, ironically, you might feel as if you're standing on shaky ground. Unfortunately, the Aries New Moon rocks your 2nd House of Personal Values, so the current situation grows even worse when you project an air of false optimism. Instead, just be honest. It's best to let others know if you are experiencing uncertainty beneath your sunny veneer. Ultimately, everyone involved will breathe a sigh of relief once the truth is out in the open."
aries,2016-04-08,"You feel lazy today, but you're still the one who can swing into action before considering the consequences. You often get away with overstepping limits, but your words have more influence than you expect now. Exaggerating the facts or overstating your position won't convince anyone that your ideas are sensible. Remember, you can't avoid reality for long, so you might as well be honest right from the start. The truth may hurt for a while but a lie hurts forever."
taurus,2016-04-08,"Your need to keep life simple is your prime motivator now that the Moon is making her monthly sojourn through your sign. Fortunately, you can positively impact a complex situation by changing only a few basic variables. There's no reason to pretend you're a master of nuance. Even if you wish that everything was less complicated, focus on the big picture and let the rest fall into place on its own."
gemini,2016-04-08,"Sometimes you enjoy talking about almost anything that pops into your mind. However, even the most casual of comments can turn into a major disagreement today. It seems as if everything you say is blown out of proportion or completely misunderstood. Avoid the temptation to prove everyone else wrong; instead, concentrate on cooperating with others rather than competing with them. If you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together."
cancer,2016-04-08,"You're not looking for any additional problems today, but trouble could find you anyhow when you least expect it. Although a stressful situation may demand your immediate attention at work, you're highly resistant to any form of change. Happily, your friends appreciate your ability to quickly grasp the subtleties of a complex situation. Step up to the plate and take charge, but keep in mind there's no reason to make a big fuss out of your actions. Fly beneath the radar now for the best results."
leo,2016-04-08,"You are caught between your confident thoughts and your tender feelings today. However, you will most likely end up sweeping your emotions under the rug given the chance. You might believe that rational plans are superior to irrational instincts now, but logic need not override your love. Turn your battle for control into a spiritual practice by opening communication channels while at the same time seeking balance between your head and your heart."
virgo,2016-04-08,"Talking your way around an obstacle might be impossible today, even if you think you're being outrageously clever. There is no escape; you must make a decision whether to continue on your current path or to consider a variety of alternatives that could ultimately change the course of your life. The time to hesitate is through; make up your mind by following your heart while you still have the courage."
libra,2016-04-08,"Creating a healthy balance in your relationships can seem like an intricate puzzle today. You may be simultaneously told yes and no every time you ask a simple question. You're willing to go to the edge in order to establish your limits, but it might be tough to follow any of the rules now. Pursuing art is one way of testing the reaction of the world around you. The situation is not as desperate as you may think, so slow down and wait until you discover a creative solution."
scorpio,2016-04-08,"It's a lot easier to just show up and take control of the situation now than mull over the facts for weeks or months. Plot your course of action spontaneously today, rather than retreating to analyze your logical next step. Usually, you are the one who measures each and every strategy but you're currently eager to jump in before knowing if the pool is filled with water. In your haste to act, don't try to detach from your feelings for they can teach you valuable lessons about your heart."
sagittarius,2016-04-08,"You can become so opinionated that you may inadvertently anger someone close to you. You're ready to share your feelings with everyone because you believe that it is just simpler to tell the truth. Ironically, you are a bit too evasive today when it comes time for a heartfelt emotional interaction. There's nothing wrong with your desire to keep your feelings hidden as long as you continue to maintain your integrity and respect the feelings of others."
capricorn,2016-04-08,"You might not be able to escape the responsibilities being placed on your shoulders today. You may even grow frustrated in your struggle to keep up with all the moving pieces. However, you could suddenly shift the energy by simply agreeing to play according to the current rules of the game. Regain your power by acknowledging your limitations and stop taking on more than you can handle. Asking for help when you need it is a sign of intelligence."
aquarius,2016-04-08,"You may have to juggle your personal affairs today without anyone outside of your home knowing about your current challenges. Although there are logical reasons to keep secrets now, you're still tempted to share private information with an ally or acquaintance. It's wise to only broach a sensitive topic after careful consideration; but if you decide to disclose your dilemma, don't put your revelation off until it's too late. Go directly to the heart of the matter with someone you can trust before it's impossible to have a meaningful discussion that could lighten your load."
pisces,2016-04-08,"You strive to be a kinder and gentler Fish today in an attempt to resist your growing sense of annoyance with a friend. You try to avoid unpleasant consequences by being thoughtful and considerate in all of your interactions. Nevertheless, your tone of voice could still be forceful enough to scare someone away. Moderation works in your favor now, so carefully understate whatever feelings you choose to share with others. Your words once spoken can't be forgotten."
aries,2016-04-09,"Suddenly arriving at an entirely new conclusion can be a thrill today. The brilliant Sun, currently in your sign, receives a zap from electric Uranus, releasing adrenaline with every radical new idea. The sparks are crackling as the fog dissipates. Even if you recently lost your bearings, just use your intuition to reset your compass and chart your path into new territory. Go for it; your wait is over. Your spirit soars when you explore the unknown."
taurus,2016-04-09,"You are buzzing at a very high frequency, even without the extra cup of coffee today. Unfortunately, your logic might not be as accurate as you assume. Even if you think you have the facts all in order, there are surprises waiting for you around the next corner. Be ready to change direction on a moment's notice to meet the unforeseen demands of the day. Relinquishing control is the most sensible strategy now, enabling things to work out better than you can imagine."
gemini,2016-04-09,"You could become upset if people change their minds without warning today. Normally, you're quite willing to adapt to shifting circumstances, but you might put too much emphasis now on someone else's decisions. Take your time responding because this instability is a gentle wake-up call that refocuses your attention. Your current happiness is dependent on your ability to create harmony, not destroy it."
cancer,2016-04-09,"Your reaction to someone who tries to constrain you today may distract you from your immediate goals. Luckily, you can quickly shift your perspective and see the current situation in a new light now. If you suddenly feel inspired, set aside your common sense and take a risk. You are not required to defy authority in order to be happy, but it could certainly help. Taking a leap of faith isn't so hard once you make up your mind to trust the universe."
leo,2016-04-09,"You're not interested in pursuing a safer course of action today, especially if you are excited about a recent discovery. Although you don't want to hear anything negative, knowing the truth is much better than remaining in ignorance -- even if the facts are inconvenient. You might not have such an easy path to travel, but you're eager to experience what's around the next corner. Remember, the clues you receive now can help you find peace during the days ahead. Enlightenment comes with a cost."
virgo,2016-04-09,"You're caught in a conflict between your emotional needs and the expectations of others. But the path of least resistance might require you to keep your desires to yourself today, while living up to your social obligations. Don't assume you can retreat on a whim. Luckily, relationship success is yours if you have the courage to empathize with others, without thinking that you have to fix their problems. Ultimately, you'll feel a sense of joy just from being around those you love."
libra,2016-04-09,"Unpredictable relationship dynamics might overwhelm your life today while the Sun hooks up with shocking Uranus in your 7th House of Partners. Thankfully, you're able to see beyond the excitement of the present moment and use your visionary powers to guide you. But don't let logic stand in your way; you are brilliant now when you trust your imagination. Following your creative instincts allows you to arrive at original answers to mundane questions."
scorpio,2016-04-09,"Although you might try to be sensible when managing your time, a sudden attraction draws you toward something mysterious and alluring this weekend. It's as if a gigantic magnet is pulling you off your current course and into the great unknown. Don't stick to the tried and true methods today; expressing your personality differently gets you ready for a pleasant surprise. If you're unwilling to take a risk, you're also unlikely to get a reward."
sagittarius,2016-04-09,"You're eager for a radical shift in your world so you'll probably enjoy the verbal fireworks today. Thankfully, a sudden emotional outburst or unexpected personal disclosure has the potential to change everything. Hopefully, everyone will  feel better once suppressed feelings are out in the open. Sharing a good laugh is one of the best ways to clear the air of awkward tension. But it might take some time and space for the pieces to fall into place."
capricorn,2016-04-09,"Ironically, you make your biggest breakthrough when you feel the most secure. Thankfully, you can accomplish your most original work now or have plenty of fun without even leaving home.  Don't be afraid to shake up the status quo; the exhilaration you end up feeling compensates for any anxiety and uncertainty you experience along the way. No matter what happens today, the dance between safety and adventure ensures that you'll enjoy a wild ride."
aquarius,2016-04-09,"The willful Sun conspires with your key planet Uranus today, cracking anything that has grown too brittle in your life. But the focus is not on the breaking of the egg; it's strictly about the emerging little chick. Don't bother trying to repair the problems in your life now. Instead, concentrate on the plethora of possibilities you will have once the shell is no longer holding you back."
pisces,2016-04-09,"If your personal finances are a bit shaky, you may have extra work to do today as you try to put things back together. However, you might impulsively spend more than you should on something you don't really need. Either way, keep a watchful eye on your cash flow because a stressful situation could grow out of hand very quickly if you don't pay attention. Thankfully, the suddenness of the Sun-Uranus conjunction in your 2nd House of Money is counterbalanced by the sensible Taurus Moon. As Thoreau wrote, ""I make myself rich by making my wants few."""
aries,2016-04-10,"There is an uncomfortable tension between what you say you will do and what you're actually able to finish today. If your goals are too ambitious now, you may grow annoyed with yourself and everyone in your life. It's no fun at all to realize you have fallen short of your own expectations. Nevertheless, adopting a more realistic approach could bring success, allowing you plenty of time to meet challenges as they appear."
taurus,2016-04-10,"You can make measurable progress today if you remain true to your values instead of reaching for arbitrary milestones throughout the day. You are more likely to overcome your own inertia if you're passionate about your goals. It's much easier to complete the tasks on your list -- one after another -- if they are part of a holistic plan instead of just isolated chores. For the best results, begin slowly and build momentum throughout the day. Your determination is your ticket to success."
gemini,2016-04-10,"Every little thing seems to magically fit into place today, but so much is happening that you can't assimilate all your experiences. You might feel that something isn't quite right, but assume it's just the ebb and flow of your emotions while the evocative Moon is back in your changeable sign. Allow your shifting moods to determine when to push ahead and when to withdraw. Don't be concerned if your progress is uneven; just enjoy your interactions with others when it feels right. For now, don't take life, or yourself, so seriously."
cancer,2016-04-10,"Your confidence grows by leaps and bounds now if you feel accepted by your peers. Thankfully, your high self-esteem currently enables you to expand your horizons because you're not afraid to participate in a debate about something you believe in. Just remember that you can disagree with others without feeling as if they are attacking you personally. It's fine to acknowledge your emotions as long as you keep them separate from the facts. A healthy dialogue strengthens your message and earns you respect."
leo,2016-04-10,"You're eager to laugh off an uncomfortable situation today because you assume your lighthearted attitude will advance your cause more than taking things too seriously. In fact, your best strategy is to adopt a more balanced approach now. Although there's no point in worrying about a previous mistake, assuming responsibility is more productive than pretending everything will turn out fine no matter what you do. To err is human; to forgive is divine."
virgo,2016-04-10,"You may be so flooded with incoming information now that you are a bit dazed and confused. You're drawn toward wanting lots of good data at your fingertips, but it's difficult to separate all the noise from what's valid. The more you attempt to get a handle on the facts, the less you seem to know. Save your analytical thinking for another day; instead, just take it all in and make your assessment tomorrow when your clarity returns. As Einstein wrote, ""Logic will get you from A to Z; imagination will get you everywhere."""
libra,2016-04-10,"Your plans seem to be unfolding on schedule today, but you run into trouble when you assume everything will continue to go your way. Although a relationship may be the source of an unexpected surprise, you're able to artfully roll with the incoming waves, even if they are disruptive. Just don't cling to an agenda that no longer makes sense; your emotional flexibility can transform a sudden change of plans into an exciting and joyful experience."
scorpio,2016-04-10,"Your life seems more convoluted when you try to follow through on previous plans. Luckily, you have plenty of energy to respond to whatever pops up today. Your can-do-it attitude might be annoying to others, but they are quick to trust you with a difficult task. Don't allow your confidence run amok or you could end up spreading your resources too thin. Give yourself enough time to do a job right instead of attempting to do everything all at once. Your performance demonstrates your commitment to integrity."
sagittarius,2016-04-10,"You're currently able to keep up with people who were previously running circles around you. However, you may question if this chase is a wise use of your time and energy. However, someone's judgments shouldn't prevent you from following your bliss now; it's fully acceptable to pursue pleasure even if you aren't very productive. Ultimately, the secret of being happy is accepting your place in life while also making the most out of every single day."
capricorn,2016-04-10,"You might naturally assume that relinquishing control could hinder your success, instead of helping you reach your goals. But demonstrating sensitivity to someone else's position works in your favor today, even if it means keeping some of your best ideas quiet for a while longer. Luckily, you can perform reliably once you get started, so set aside your concerns long enough to take a calculated risk. A relaxed approach to pursuing your passions may pay off more than you think."
aquarius,2016-04-10,"Allowing your friends to take the lead today could turn into a great relief for you. Your first reaction might be to challenge those who try to assume authority, but you will finally be able to relax if you let someone else be in charge. Happily, more playtime increases your self-esteem. A renewed sense of confidence brings fresh waves of energy and inspires you to expend the additional effort that can make the difference between failure and success."
pisces,2016-04-10,"You're like a fish that is stranded on dry land today. Although there's a lot of mental activity to feed your brain, you long for the emotionally nutritious waters of the sea. But there's no need to waste any time complaining as long as your intentions are clear. Be sincere as you assert yourself to get what you want. If your actions are consistent with your message, others will be more than willing to support you in your quest."
aries,2016-04-11,"You may wish you were somewhere else today, but you can still inspire others toward greater heights by simply using the words that roll off your tongue naturally. Your creativity abounds as you experiment with how to express what's playing out in your mind. But it's not enough to have an active fantasy life now, for your clever thoughts quickly fade back into the hazy dreams from where they came. Share your imaginative ideas without holding anything back. Dance like no one is watching while secretly hoping that your audience is impressed."
taurus,2016-04-11,"You could experience emotional discomfort today as you leave the certainty of a recent decision in the past. Although you were positive about your choice just a few days ago, you could start to question everything as circumstances unexpectedly shift. Let go of your stubborn desire to be steadfast; acting in a more flexible manner now enables you to successfully navigate through the changing landscape. Look for the cosmic signs to validate your direction."
gemini,2016-04-11,"You are identifying more with your feelings now, and they could pull you into confusing territory as the Moon's monthly visit to your sign activates your emotions. Even if you know exactly what you want today, it's still stressful if you can't figure out how to reach your goals. Thankfully, your unfulfilled desires won't weigh you down for long. Focus on your destination and the path will reveal itself just in the nick of time."
cancer,2016-04-11,"Memories are still lurking close to the surface  but you're not feeling very vulnerable today. Your greatest strength now is your ability to see things with an objective eye, which helps you understand the differences between the past and the present. It's essential to stay emotionally available, even if you're afraid of being hurt. Keep your feelings out in the open and communicate your fears to a trusted ally. The power of your worries will diminish after they are brought into the light."
leo,2016-04-11,"It's annoying if you can't have everything that you want now; nevertheless, your problems could vanish in thin air if you can fool yourself into believing that all is wonderful in your world. Unfortunately, denial won't bring happiness and ignorance should not be mistaken for bliss. Do whatever is necessary to obtain the facts of the matter. Only after you've captured a clear picture of what's really happening will you be ready to make the best decision. Objectivity is the lens of clarity."
virgo,2016-04-11,"After a couple of days of practical thinking and scrupulous behavior, you're ready to loosen your grip on the mundane world. A whole new wave of information is heading your way today, potentially changing how you handle relationships. Enjoy the images floating through your mind, even if getting lost in your fantasies is somewhat out of character for you. No immediate action is required now except to explore your imagination; you never know what dream might plant a seed for future use."
libra,2016-04-11,"Although your energy is a bit scattered today, you're still rather optimistic about your prospects. However, you could be unclear as to which future vision you are working toward. Your imagination conjures up vivid thoughts now, but your friends find it difficult to understand exactly what you are trying to achieve. Go ahead and let your colorful dreams inspire your actions, but keep your message to others as simple as possible."
scorpio,2016-04-11,"Shallow conversations are often irritating because you know there are more crucial subjects that need to be discussed. Unfortunately, people seem to be steering clear of the same real issues that attract you, and there is little you can do to change their focus today. Thankfully, you don't have to settle for less in the long run. In the meantime, practice patience; it's difficult to wait for others to catch up but it's even more difficult to regret missing the chance to connect one way or another."
sagittarius,2016-04-11,"You are at a turning point in a relationship with the Moon spinning her wheels in your 7th House of Companions. Although you want to push your agenda forward, it still may take a week or so for the momentum to build up steam. Erratic flashes of doubt snap you out of your optimistic state of mind. Although these unexpected visions can be annoying at first, they won't last if you keep your eye on the prize. Concentrate on your long-range plans and don't let the details pull you off track."
capricorn,2016-04-11,"You are riding a wave of creativity today, but something significant has changed and you can't put your finger on it. You may seem less demanding of yourself and others, but your flexibility alone doesn't necessarily help you feel more comfortable. Trust in your dreams now; subtle messages from your subconscious can lead you back to what is meaningful. Ultimately, you are confined only by the walls you build yourself."
aquarius,2016-04-11,"Asserting yourself may take more effort today than you're willing to expend, even if you know exactly what you want. But rather than coming right out and expressing what's on your mind, adopting a passive-aggressive approach could temporarily leave you feeling like a victim. Any negativity on your part is simply a wake-up call, reminding you it's time for an attitude adjustment. Going over the facts with someone you admire can help to alleviate your fears once and for all."
pisces,2016-04-11,"You tend to see only the best in everyone now, so resist the urge to make life-changing relationship decisions. Although intellectual Mercury is sending good vibrations your way today, you can easily misinterpret the message. Nevertheless, the discrepancy between your thoughts and your desires triggers stressful memories from the past. Remember only what you need to know and then bring yourself back to the joys of the present moment."
aries,2016-04-12,"Thinking about your independence is qualitatively different from actually expressing your freedom through action. Talking about your plan is one thing, but your recent behavior has more direct ramifications than a theoretical conversation. You're motivated to explore relationship options today, but scattering your intentions could leave you in a more precarious position than when you started. Be careful what you wish for; you might just get it."
taurus,2016-04-12,"It's best to address an uncomfortable emotional situation with a close friend today, even if you prefer to let it slide. However, you could come across more intense than intended, so temper your approach with an extra dose of compassion. Don't make things more complicated than they are by projecting your unresolved feelings onto the wrong person. Your chances of moving beyond the problem are better if you base your perceptions on objective reality rather than unsubstantiated fears."
gemini,2016-04-12,"You may be sitting on pins and needles as you try to manage a tricky situation today without overreacting. Acknowledging your resistance early in the game is helpful because you must delve deeper into your emotions, even if you don't want to go there. Continue to push against your discomfort now; there are important lessons to learn by sinking into your own hidden world and touching the magic of emotional transformation."
cancer,2016-04-12,"Although you might steer clear of large groups today, you're more comfortable when you're in the company of someone you trust. However, you may be even moodier now that the reflective Moon is back in your sensitive sign. Nevertheless, circumstances continue to draw you out of your shell. Revealing your feelings can strengthen a relationship as long as you don't go overboard. Sometimes knowing when to be quiet is just as important as having the courage to talk."
leo,2016-04-12,"Old fears that resurface from your subconscious mind can whittle away at your confidence today. But past experiences have a tendency to disappear, only to return to haunt you again, especially when something happens to remind you of a previous hurt. You can push through your current uncertainties, but you will need to operate on blind faith now, as scary as that may sound. Close your eyes, grit your teeth and reach for the stars."
virgo,2016-04-12,"You could spend too much time over-analyzing your feelings as you stress about what move to make  next in a developing relationship. At first, you're sure you're traveling on the right path, but soon you start second-guessing your wisdom. It's all rather confusing, since the closer you get to a final decision, the farther you seem from the solution. Once you recognize that there's no one absolute correct answer, you're freer to listen to your heart and act accordingly."
libra,2016-04-12,"Although it might appear as if people are pushing your buttons simply to get a reaction today, you prefer to sidestep around a potential conflict. Instead of struggling to escape from an uncomfortable situation, find the courage to directly participate in a constructive dialogue now. Obviously, you don't enjoy engaging in arguments, yet resolving the current tension feels much better than allowing it to continue to fester any longer. Start the conversational ball rolling and see who picks it up."
scorpio,2016-04-12,"You're so concerned about the influence you exert on others that you may withhold your emotions today. Although the Moon's visit to your 9th House of Big Ideas encourages you to go overboard as you think about the future, you might not be able to meet other people's expectations if you share all of your dreams. Spend some time on your own now so the noise of the outside world doesn't interfere with your desire to prioritize your goals. Cultivating a healthy sense of independence is your first step to success."
sagittarius,2016-04-12,"Your key planet Jupiter inspires you to focus your attention where you can be the most successful today. But even with this cosmic exuberance supporting your efforts, you still may feel as if you're traveling through tricky territory. Chances are you're moving too fast and might not even know how to apply the brakes. Simply ease up on the gas and reduce your speed if you want the good times to last. Coming in first doesn't necessarily mean you win the race."
capricorn,2016-04-12,"Your progress is uneven today and it's tempting to blame your frustration on others. It might even seem as if people offer you opportunities only to whisk them away before they come to fruition. Thankfully, you are making more headway now than you realize, so avoid judging your success by what you accomplish. Keep your eyes on the future and don't be deterred by anyone else's lack of follow-through. Never doubt that you are the master of your own destiny."
aquarius,2016-04-12,"These are tumultuous times and the busy pace seems to reach a frenzied pitch now. Straightforward actions should make your motives clear to others, but people still have a difficult time reading your intentions today, especially if you feel disconnected from what you are doing. Instead of brashly barging ahead, stop long enough to think about where you want to go before you end up in the wrong place."
pisces,2016-04-12,"You're in a long-term planning mode where you are more concerned with next week, next month and next year than you are with today. However, immediate action may be required of you to manage a minor crisis. Fortunately, your current positive attitude can easily disarm obstacles, enabling you to be effective in the present moment while still dreaming about the future. Exploratory fantasies encourage you to consider all options, even in the real world."
aries,2016-04-13,"Honoring your need for privacy is healthy today, even if you are accustomed to engaging in activities with your friends and associates. You independent Rams can benefit from working alone, especially when your patience grows thin because others can't keep up with you. But your current penchant for solitude might be more about recharging your emotional batteries with some rest and relaxation. A bit of solitude enables you to head back out revitalized, ready to conquer the world."
taurus,2016-04-13,"You're tentative about sharing your feelings today because you don't want to risk your hard-earned security. Unfortunately, keeping secrets is exhausting because you must monitor everything you say. But your unexpressed emotions give you away now, so face your fears and resist the temptation to go quiet. Be proactive in your interactions; participate in a meaningful dialogue by choice. There's no reason to wait for someone else to drag you into a conversation if you go there first."
gemini,2016-04-13,"The pace of your life seems to be slowing down, bringing you more time to integrate a recent change of heart. You may want to rethink your goals or even reevaluate your position on a professional matter. If something is unexpectedly tossed your way, do your best to catch it in stride. The trick is to mind your own business; any extra attention you put toward someone else's problems might only make matters worse. Realigning your priorities makes good sense now because you have plenty to do on your own."
cancer,2016-04-13,"Being certain about your feelings is nearly impossible because your moods quickly shift from moment to moment now that the Moon's back in your sign. You may go from pouring your heart out to a friend to withdrawing to the safety of your hidden cave. Avoid making any long-lasting decisions until your feelings settle back down. In the meantime, let your emotions flow naturally without trying to change them. Be truthful and gentle with everyone today, especially yourself."
leo,2016-04-13,"Although people seem to be looking directly at you, you still may feel as if you aren't being seen. You don't understand how they can miss the obvious as you hold your head high and carry out your assigned tasks, even when your heart is hurting. Thankfully, a humble disclosure to a trusted colleague might bring the recognition you seek. Take whatever time is necessary to process your feelings before you step back into the spotlight."
virgo,2016-04-13,"You're like a pendulum today, swinging back and forth between accepting the support your colleagues offer and fearfully pushing them away. Although you appreciate the camaraderie, you also need to know you can be self-sufficient. Try to soften your attitude, even if think you're overly dependent on others now. It's a sign of intelligence to openly embrace help when it is offered. There's no need to let pride stand in the way when someone only wants to see you shine."
libra,2016-04-13,"You might be swimming in rough emotional waters today, unless you can let go of the control you believe you need. Nevertheless, you're not in charge of anyone's feelings other than your own. Don't try to fix the situation by trying to make someone more comfortable; concentrate on your priorities instead. Once you've adjusted your attitude, then others may have the courage to do the same. Turn down the noise all around you and listen to the yearnings of your heart."
scorpio,2016-04-13,"You are content to explore your feelings in the privacy of your own space today. Your emotional security is a top priority now and you might not be satisfied until you feel completely safe and sound in your environment. Thankfully, you can journey nearly anywhere you desire within the wilds of your imagination. Just don't forget to demonstrate your colorful creativity while your muse is close at hand. Harriet Tubman said, ""Every great dream begins with a dreamer."""
sagittarius,2016-04-13,An expansion-contraction dilemma is developing now as your normally cavalier attitude assumes a more cautious stance today. But don't succumb to the pressures of social expectations. You can't please others if you don't acknowledge your own desires first. Chill out and give yourself permission to withdraw from the crowd if you really want some time alone. A little peace and quiet might be just what you need to reinvigorate your spirit.
capricorn,2016-04-13,"You may think you lack sufficient patience to hold someone's hand while they go through an emotional meltdown; however, it could be exactly what's required today. Alternatively, it might be you that's the needy one at this time -- making you even less tolerant with yourself than with another person. Either way, acknowledge that the expression of feelings doesn't always fit neatly into a schedule. Practicing flexibility enables you to stick with the process without being in such a hurry."
aquarius,2016-04-13,"Your lack of clarity makes it hard to confront your needs now and recognize how they differ from those of your peers. Your efforts at improving things might even seem to be a waste of time today. Although ignoring the situation isn't the best answer, gently creating additional space between you and others gives you room to honor your own feelings. Once you reestablish your center of gravity, you will be ready to reengage with a more positive attitude."
pisces,2016-04-13,"You may feel awkward when expressing your feelings at first, but you can work through your resistance as the day unfolds. The shy Cancer Moon might tempt you to run and hide today, but her current stay in your 5th House of Play prevents you from retreating too far. Thankfully, you can channel your energy into a variety of creative expressions, whether for work or for your own amusement. Ultimately, your dreams are the source of your greatest inspiration if you learn how to integrate them into your life."
aries,2016-04-14,"You may hit an emotional speed bump if you're moving too fast today. Even if your life is running smoothly, pay attention to potential problems before they create unnecessary trouble. Your enthusiasm could get the best of you if you're not careful. Remind yourself several times throughout the day that your high energy is likely to make people uncomfortable. Toning down your exuberance a notch allows you to lead with your heart while still acknowledging the needs of everyone else."
taurus,2016-04-14,"Enjoying the finer side of life without overdoing it isn't as easy as it sounds now. You're tempted to eat or drink more than necessary while mischievous Mercury activates Jupiter in your 5th House of Pleasure. Thankfully, you don't need to let your concerns about overconsumption prevent you from having a wonderful time. Go ahead and joyfully indulge in a bit of sensory pleasure, but just be sure not to push your limits too far. You can dance at the edge without going over it."
gemini,2016-04-14,"You're at the top of your game when it comes to demonstrating your sharp thinking today. Thankfully, you can put your best foot forward and then do a bit of your famous doubletalk to impress others. However, you could be too clever for your own good; the power of positive thinking only works if you don't push the envelope beyond social acceptability. Taking a calculated risk is a solid idea as long as you're ready to let go of your plans if they go awry. Humility is the true key to success."
cancer,2016-04-14,"You're an effective communicator today, even if you would prefer to withhold your emotions. You can manifest your dreams as long as you're willing to follow your intuition. Unfortunately, there's a delicate balance between your ideals and your achievements. Your romantic fantasies may also be realized, but you must give voice to your feelings or you won't get what you want. Fortune favors the bold."
leo,2016-04-14,"Letting your big feelings out into the open can be rather stressful, since your current needs might appear out of character for you. Still, it's nearly impossible to adjust your aspirations to what others are willing to support. Meeting someone halfway begins with listening rather than just telling people what you want. Finding a way to be emotionally flexible now improves your chances of spending a memorable day with those you love."
virgo,2016-04-14,"Love is in the air today, but relationship dynamics may stress you out, nonetheless. Normally, you are careful about respecting your limits, but you're tempted to overindulge now. Thankfully, everything tends to go your way as long as you aren't concerned with making these pleasures last. Tomorrow may not be as pleasant when you realize what you've done in the name of immediate gratification. A healthy dose of moderation makes more sense and won't detract from your fun."
libra,2016-04-14,"Going the extra mile to consciously perform random acts of kindness makes your day much more pleasurable. Your optimism encourages those around you even if you're just chatting with your friends today. Your spirit of generosity comes back to you in the form of greater freedom, a wider perspective and heightened creativity. Something special is ready to pop -- but only if you continue to express love and beauty in an altruistic way."
scorpio,2016-04-14,"Speak from your heart today while the planets maximize the positive influence of your words. Even if you have felt unforgiving in the past, it's time now to reassess the situation. Relationship issues are best tackled with a sensitive and supportive approach, but behind the serious talk is your desire to bask in the glory of love. Be extra sweet to someone you cherish and the positive repercussions will ripple back to you quickly."
sagittarius,2016-04-14,"You love to dream big and today your fantasies are over the top, enticing you away from a more practical approach. Your key planet Jupiter is overstimulated by sensual Venus, encouraging you to partake in one too many social activities. There is nothing wrong with indulging in the fun, but you cannot go overboard. Steer clear from jumping to conclusions before you think your vision all the way through to its logical conclusion."
capricorn,2016-04-14,"Your management skills are operating at peak efficiency, but you could suddenly become distracted and gloss over a few important details today. You can clearly see the big picture without even trying, yet it's nearly impossible to stay on track as all kinds of temptations test your legendary self-discipline. Let your responsibilities fall to the wayside now as you seek the pleasure in your life that may be long overdue."
aquarius,2016-04-14,"You long to be appreciated for your contributions today, yet your current routine probably sends you off in an entirely different direction than you imagined. However, this isn't the best time to trust your intuition because you're attracted to the easiest path instead of the smartest one. Unfortunately, your sense of proportion is slightly bent out of shape. It's less important to be recognized now than it is to feel good about your accomplishments. Real self-esteem can only come from within."
pisces,2016-04-14,"It's all too easy to become obsessed with the ideas presented to you by a friend or partner. You might even fall in love with someone who opens your mind and turns you on to a new philosophy as mental Mercury connects with expansive Jupiter in your 7th House of Companions. Opportunities for learning are knocking at your door, but they won't wait around forever. Enjoy each experience for what it offers in the moment, but don't ruin it by trying to make it last. As Buddha taught, all things are impermanent."
aries,2016-04-15,"It appears as if the cosmic weather is settling down, but don't get your hopes up for a permanent shift of energy. Although you may experience periods of calmer sailing today as the playful Leo Moon harmonizes with planets in your sign, it's challenging to know when to call it quits. Even if you're excited about the prospects for more action, be smart and catch your breath while you can. You could run into a wall later this evening if you overestimate your stamina. A patient and methodical approach serves you best."
taurus,2016-04-15,"You are all set to reveal your innermost desires today, but you have a tough time putting your feelings into words. Your fantasies seem real as nebulous Neptune influences romantic Venus. But don't give up on your dreams; your determination enables you to disclose something you might normally keep to yourself. You've been worrying about a secret long enough. Sharing it with a close friend may be the catalyst to allowing you to let go with a clear conscience."
gemini,2016-04-15,"Your thoughts don't matter more than what is in your heart today. Nevertheless, you may surprise yourself with how much you long to hear those magical words of acknowledgment from someone special. The simplest act of kindness means a lot to you now, especially if your insecurity has recently developed a life of its own. Ironically, it works both ways; expressing your affection helps you to navigate through this uncertain time. Remember, love is the music that helps to soothe the beast inside you."
cancer,2016-04-15,"You continue to single-mindedly concentrate on your career and are driven to figure out the purpose of your life. However, you're much easier for others to get along with today if you're in touch with your imagination because your fantasies are an important source of your happiness. Nevertheless, keeping your dreams alive is challenging when you're so distracted by all the possibilities at work. Creating balance between your inner and outer worlds makes it easier to thrive in both realms."
leo,2016-04-15,"You might not understand what people are trying to tell you today. And, if they are judging you too harshly, you probably won't even hear a word they say. You can turn the volume of your self-expression up so high while the Moon is in your active sign that you're not conscious of any incoming information at all. Focus on cultivating greater self-awareness and you will naturally become more considerate of others, too. Examining tough issues now is the key to evolving into a better version of yourself."
virgo,2016-04-15,"Pinpointing the source of the apparent negativity can be difficult now if someone seems to be working against you. Luckily, this uncomfortable situation won't last long and you should be able to resolve the problem without turning it into a major crisis. Rather than succumbing to fears and digging harder to uncover the facts, change the game completely by focusing on your best-case scenario. Your cheerful idealism goes much further toward dissipating the resistance now than a more combative strategy. As John Lennon sang, ""Give peace a chance."""
libra,2016-04-15,"You may be happily surprised by a close friend's response when you express your feelings today. But there's no need to accommodate people by saying what you believe they want to hear; just share what's in your heart exactly as you feel it. Even if you're concerned about the uncertainties ahead, let someone you trust know your inner process. Your personal disclosure can initiate a discussion that paves the way for increased intimacy and a greater sense of empowerment."
scorpio,2016-04-15,"You're hoping to propel your life in a new direction today. You may choose to focus your feelings on a single person or one particular situation as you obsess about a specific goal. Unfortunately, everything seems to unfold too slowly for your taste. It's critical to modify your expectations and let success arrive at its own natural rate, even if it seems delayed. Make use of the extra time on your hands to attend to more details and improve the weak link in your chain before moving into the unknown future."
sagittarius,2016-04-15,"You're ready to race ahead today, even if you're stuck in the starting gate. You may attempt to make the most of your precious time, but your patience has run out. Although you are eager to start living your adventure right now, you must be gentle with yourself. Your unresolved feelings might require more processing before you can push them forward again. Adjusting your attitude allows you to enjoy the delay and still reach your destination when the timing is right."
capricorn,2016-04-15,"You can overcome your self-imposed limitations by ignoring the facts for a while today. However, your current resistance stems from childhood fears that continue to impede your progress. Eventually, you may be asked to look at your old hurts with a fresh perspective that motivates you to keep moving forward without self-restraint. But don't go charging ahead just yet. For now, methodically take your journey a single step at a time until you know exactly where you want to go."
aquarius,2016-04-15,"Containing your enthusiasm is a challenge these days since you truly believe anything is possible. In fact, you're so excitable now that you might not be able to focus on the work in front of you. People may demand that you produce results and you don't particularly enjoy the pressure. But instead of overreacting, take a deep breath before you unconsciously push back too hard. Channeling your energy into a positive cause is the best revenge and sets a good example at the same time."
pisces,2016-04-15,"Finding the right starting point today can be tricky, making your day somewhat complicated to manage. It seems as if you're blowing around on the whimsical breezes of your imagination and you can't ground your thoughts. You might believe the best solution is to talk about your feelings. However, the more you share now, the less certain everything becomes. Instead, practice being quiet within your mind; your mental stillness is the catalyst that opens the door for positive change."
aries,2016-04-16,"You are inclined to participate in social activities today but it's smarter to take some time to think about your involvement in the wider context of your life. Curbing your enthusiasm helps you minimize complicated emotional entanglements but you might not be able to avoid getting hooked if you see positive potential, even in a challenging situation. Although you may end up having more fun if you stay low key this weekend, don't be too hard on yourself if you slip and act on your unrealistic optimism. Simply make the best of whatever happens by going with the flow."
taurus,2016-04-16,"Although you prefer to sail on smooth waters, you might purposefully stir up a few waves today if your emotions clash with someone else's. You could be drawn into an irresolvable disagreement if you think your needs are more important than the desires of others. There is a fine line between maintaining your integrity and just being plain stubborn. It's healthy to express what you want as long as you remember that you're not the only one with an agenda."
gemini,2016-04-16,"People seem unreasonably optimistic in their approach to life today. Although you don't want to appear overly negative, neither do you want to mislead others by blindly endorsing their plans. But they may grow annoyed if you decide to dig for too many details. Turning over every stone leads to trouble -- and you will find there are no quick and easy answers to your questions. Just be as authentic as possible when making choices and allow everyone else to do the same."
cancer,2016-04-16,"Some of the apparent tensions in your emotional life have abated, but you still may be uncertain about the direction you have chosen. You're attempting to stay between the limits of too little and too much, but avoiding extremes is not as easy as it looks. Don't be overly concerned today if you can't find the peace of mind you seek. Ironically, clarity will be within reach once you stop trying so hard to sort everything out. Too much looking can blind you from seeing the truth."
leo,2016-04-16,Freely demonstrating your emotions enables you to add your unique perspective to the ongoing discussion today. But you relentless Lions can be quite fixed in your opinions and your stubbornness could make everyone's day nearly unbearable now if you let it. There's no need to worry about changing your mind; what's crucial is that you are receptive to new information. You can be the hero of the day if you simply take the time to focus on others instead of yourself.
virgo,2016-04-16,"An unresolved relationship issue is on your mind and you're doing your best to put it all into perspective. Your diligence has earned you the right to feel good about your personal connections, but you may face another annoyance today as you try to find a balance between what you want and what you are willing to pay for it. Thankfully, no decision is required just yet. If you can peacefully live with this dilemma now, the uneasiness should dissipate over the next few days. Your heart holds the key to your happiness."
libra,2016-04-16,"Everything you do today seems to be totally amazing or simply not good enough, with very little in between. It's as if someone placed a distortion filter on the volume control of your senses. Now that you know what you want, people may tell you that you shouldn't ask for so much. But you don't think your expectations are out of line at all. Hang in there; there's nothing that needs to be resolved today. Things will begin to settle down as early as tomorrow if you let them."
scorpio,2016-04-16,"You may feel stuck as you attempt to separate your personal situation from the frustration and pain of the world. The important lesson buried here is simple: life doesn't always need to be an all-or-nothing proposition. You possess the incredible power to move boundaries. Even if you keep up with the news and passionately discuss current events with anyone who will listen, you still can receive great emotional pleasure from your one-on-one interactions. Think globally; enjoy locally."
sagittarius,2016-04-16,"Although you can describe your new plan with great passion today, it's not as easy to drill down to the key details. Opinionated Jupiter tricks you into believing that you're able to tell the difference between useful ideas and unrealistic fantasies. Your talent for justifying your desires challenges you to know your limits. Naturally, there's no harm in having fun as long as you don't set responsibilities aside in search of sensory fulfillment. Employing as much moderation as you can muster helps you establish your priorities for the rest of the weekend."
capricorn,2016-04-16,"You're in touch with the most practical issues in your life, even though circumstances seem to be pushing you toward inflationary thinking. Nevertheless, you're easily misdirected by the irresistible charms of someone special today, and this attraction could lead to major trouble if you're not careful. Listen to your emotions, but for now follow your logic instead of your heart. Let your moral compass be your guide and everything will be alright."
aquarius,2016-04-16,"You're weary of struggling to transform your best ideas into concrete form. Nevertheless, it's difficult to ignore your thoughts even if they seem to be on the outrageous side. Setting your goals too high ensures frustration today and could prompt you to give up prematurely. However, you might not push yourself to accomplish something extraordinary if you don't aim high enough. Finding that sweet spot in the middle is worth your persistence because your efforts won't go unrewarded."
pisces,2016-04-16,"A thick fog is settling in and you feel as if you're drifting without a map to guide you. Additionally, the emotional landscape continues to change while you explore your need for pleasure. Unfortunately, you don't seem to be able to get exactly what you want today. Although you are growing more aware of your desires, there's no quick route to satisfaction. At least, living in the present moment allows you to appreciate all your many blessings right now."
aries,2016-04-17,"You might not know how to best manage your powerful feelings today. Just when you thought you had everything under control, you are lured into new territory without time to prepare for your journey. But the evolving landscape wasn't on your radar and can throw you off guard. It's not necessary to act on every sudden whim now or you may be searching for your way back to familiar ground for a long time to come. Enjoy the view, but wait for the dust to settle before involving anyone else in your rapidly changing fantasies."
taurus,2016-04-17,It's likely that you could be surprised by the intensity of an emotional encounter today. Be prepared to reevaluate your current relationship goals even if you think you know where you stand. Stay open to reconsidering a recent choice and make any corrections that are necessary. But don't alter your course on a whim; take plenty of time to delve into any problems that arise. The way ahead is directly through the center but it may take more time than you expect to find middle ground.
gemini,2016-04-17,"You often try to avoid a stressful conversation by deftly switching the topic to one that's more palatable. But now a lingering question is driving you toward finding the answers you seek even if it makes others squirm. Thankfully, you can make use of powerful memories to get to the bottom of an unsolved riddle. But you may be so exhilarated when you finally uncover the truth that you make an impulsive decision. Prudently put all the puzzle pieces together first."
cancer,2016-04-17,"You could feel exhausted from all the emotional changes that seem to lead you around in circles today. It takes a concerted effort to ward off peer pressure now, especially if someone tries to involve you in mischief you wish to avoid. If you have any doubt at all, don't relinquish control for the sake of being a team player. Your  integrity is at stake, so be true to yourself no matter what anyone else says. Your strength of character is an inspiration to others."
leo,2016-04-17,"You can't help but wonder if you're heading in the wrong direction today, only to find your confidence soaring later this evening. Be willing to take a risk, even if you're not sure that the outcome will be what you expect. But don't make any significant decisions based on a fleeting temptation; your feelings are still in flux and it would be wise to wait until the mood swings begin to settle down before you commit to something you later regret. Once bitten, twice shy."
virgo,2016-04-17,"Although your life may be full of distractions now, your power of concentration is unwavering as your key planet Mercury forms a harmonizing trine with potent Pluto. Your perceptions are extremely sharp, but your imagination kicks in and beckons you to daydream about the future. It's great to explore your fantasies as long as you remember to distinguish what's real from what's not. Obstacles to your success disappear when you focus on the truth."
libra,2016-04-17,"Your recent need for excitement begins to gradually abate today. Nevertheless, you might grow bored with a previous decision and feel the irrepressible desire to stir things up. But change for the sake of change won't help, especially if people are less than cooperative. It's wiser to have a realistic goal in sight and channel your enthusiasm toward something specific in the future, instead of running away from your past."
scorpio,2016-04-17,"Although you might not know how to utilize the information you possess, at least there aren't any questions about the validity of your logic today. Mental Mercury's flowing trine to powerful Pluto turns your mind into a steel trap and there's no escaping from the truth. Be as practical in your approach as you can; having all the facts in order minimizes your chances of jumping to the wrong conclusion. Nevertheless, your natural intensity is amplified and could scare others away now. Lower your voice and moderate your message for the greatest impact."
sagittarius,2016-04-17,"Your world suddenly appears to be moving in slow motion, making it increasingly tough to meet your commitments. Your frustration grows as assertive Mars turns retrograde in your sign today. You might try to escape your current responsibilities by exploring the back roads of your imagination. However, this is not a day for idle daydreaming. Set aside your fantasies and focus on one practical step you can take in the present moment. Temporarily forget your long-term goals while you accomplish one simple task at a time."
capricorn,2016-04-17,"Following your natural rhythm is challenging now because so many interesting distractions entice you away from your chores. Nevertheless, establishing a gentle pace early in the day harnesses the powerful creativity that is currently at your disposal. Although you tend to be motivated by chasing ambitious goals, you'll be happier today if you pursue pleasure, not productivity. Let your inner child out to play and see what happens."
aquarius,2016-04-17,"It's smarter to keep everything light and easy today in spite of your sudden desire to delve into the unknown emotional realms. But you won't find happiness by playing the role of a detective. Trying to uncover the source of someone else's drama will lead you on a wild goose chase. You only need to be accountable for your response to external events; you don't have to fix them. Fortunately, you can achieve nearly anything you put your mind to now so choose your destination wisely."
pisces,2016-04-17,"You may grow discouraged if you don't feel up to tackling an important task now. Just remember your self-esteem is not solely dependent on whether or not you deliver on your promises. Your struggle is more about your idealism and the challenges you face when reality doesn't meet your lofty expectations. Happily, your confidence should return soon enough if you can keep your priorities straight. Don't undertake risky behavior just to prove your value. People appreciate you just the way you are."
aries,2016-04-18,"Emotional attachments in personal relationships often make you antsy, since you place such a high value on your independence. However, you may be ready to make a commitment today without experiencing your usual fear of being tied down. Perhaps a current relationship is different or maybe it's you that has changed. Then again, you could be misleading yourself and hurting someone else in the process. Let integrity guide your actions and know that time will reveal the secrets of your heart."
taurus,2016-04-18,"Intuitively, you want to slow down today and you would be wise to listen to your inner voice. You may also be tempted to overplay your hand since you're in tune with the current emotional buzz as romantic Venus hums steadily in your ear. There's no reason to withhold affection out of fear; you don't need to keep your guard up because you are afraid your desires will quickly pass. What you're experiencing now will have lasting positive impact if you concentrate your attention on your actions in the present moment rather than your expectations for the future."
gemini,2016-04-18,"Focusing on your work is impossible if an emotional attraction is too strong to ignore now. Honestly, you can't help yourself because there are several intriguing social opportunities that tempt you to blow off your previous obligations. Unfortunately, you could miss a wonderful opportunity if you spread yourself too thin. There's no way you can do everything, so pick and choose among your options carefully today and you won't have any regrets tomorrow."
cancer,2016-04-18,"You may feel an unsettled sensation in your belly today that just won't go away. Although you want to have faith in the accuracy of your perceptions, you still need to protect yourself from possible rejection. However, it's a waste of your time to seek additional corroboration; you must act on what you know to be true. The moment for expression is now; happiness can be yours if you simply acknowledge what's in your heart without expecting anyone else to take responsibility for your emotions."
leo,2016-04-18,"You can't logically explain how you know things that others are unable to perceive. Perhaps you believe that someone is trying to manipulate you today and you don't like it one bit. The most important thing is to stay calm no matter how irritated you feel on the inside. Pay attention to the current events in your world and respond to these external circumstances, rather than what is brought up by your own fears. Choose to bring more stability into your life by basing your decisions on love and then trusting the universe with the rest."
virgo,2016-04-18,"You honestly believe you know what your partner or friend is thinking today, but your intuition could raise concerns over unimportant details that won't matter in the long run. However, it's tricky to separate the real worries from the imagined, but the solution may ultimately be in the hands of sweet Venus. Trust what's in your heart and move resolutely toward your passion. In the final analysis, love will win out over fear."
libra,2016-04-18,"The cosmic love light is beaming your way today since your key planet Venus is the star of the show. Luckily, both of your feet are planted solidly on the ground. Even your most romantic schemes are practical now, making this a prime moment to channel your desires into tangible manifestations. Go ahead and take a risk by showing your vulnerability. Revealing what's behind your cool facade might be exactly what's needed to bump a significant relationship to the next level. Open your heart and let love in."
scorpio,2016-04-18,"Making your presence known in the outer world today is more important than focusing on the inner dimensions of life. It's not that your metaphysical journey is any less important; it's just that reality is offering you a chance to engage in a meaningful encounter that should not be ignored now. But don't waste your energy worrying about the wrong things. Just get busy and take care of the business at hand, even if it's the business of your heart."
sagittarius,2016-04-18,"You are often ready to jump in without considering what comes next, whether you're playing on the field of friendship or love. Thankfully, there's no need to invest your time in endless strategics, since your long-term goals are in harmony with your current actions. Nevertheless, you can move along your path more confidently by sharing your feelings and clarifying what is most important to you. Keeping your priorities in order now is your key to lasting satisfaction."
capricorn,2016-04-18,"The possibility of cultivating love is so real today that you can feel it in your bones when vivacious Venus gives karmic Saturn a sweet kiss. Since Venus symbolizes anything of value, including money, this alignment also enables you to make a deal that could bring great rewards. But don't let your limited expectations get in the way of unlimited potential, whether it's your finances or matters of the heart. Think big; anything can happen."
aquarius,2016-04-18,"Your visions for the future seem to be within reach now and you might not need to make too great of a sacrifice to obtain what you want. Nevertheless, it's still a good idea to reconsider your priorities one last time as resourceful Venus harmonizes with responsible Saturn in your 11th House of Long-Term Goals. Don't over-intellectualize your current good fortune; just be grateful for your progress while continuing to work hard to make your dreams come true."
pisces,2016-04-18,"You are optimistic about fulfilling your real-world obligations today as long as your work is aligned with your values. Although you're willing to meet your responsibilities, it's not healthy to ignore your own desires in the process. Setting yourself up in the role of a victim or martyr won't help anyone in the long run. Seek ways to express your compassion without giving away your power. Accommodating other people's expectations doesn't relieve you of the necessity to also take care of yourself; one doesn't preclude the other."
aries,2016-04-19,"Although you can make everything look easy, you're likely having a tough time expressing your needs today. It's doubly difficult if you can't even acknowledge what you want to yourself. In fact, your emotional denial could quickly transform easygoing relationship dynamics into a tangle of complications. Thankfully, your positive attitude helps you work through a tricky situation if you're willing to be vulnerable and explore your feelings. Where there's a will, there's a way."
taurus,2016-04-19,"Your unrelenting determination is usually a strength, but your obstinate resistance to the truth could escalate a trivial misunderstanding into a major conflict. Although your ruling planet Venus raises concerns today as she crosses paths with uncompromising Pluto, ultimately the choice is still yours. You can avoid an unpleasant situation by demonstrating your willingness to cooperate with others. But you can't just bury your feelings; you must change your attitude at the core. Internal transformation leads to external progress."
gemini,2016-04-19,"The intensity of your reactions makes you feel uncomfortable today, yet you might not understand the source of your agitation. However, pretending that everything is copacetic won't improve interpersonal dynamics because denial strengthens your emotions instead of dissipating them. Acknowledging your anxiety is a smarter strategy as long as you don't try to control the conversation. Simply confessing your discomfort to a supportive friend settles your nerves more than you expect."
cancer,2016-04-19,"Staying true to your feelings is no easy task today, especially if someone tries to persuade you to temper your position. Remaining open to a coworker's point of view is an admirable goal, but not at the risk of suppressing your own desires. Of course, a difference of opinions takes time to resolve, but avoiding conflict now comes with a cost. Although there's no need to overstate your cause, it pays to be clear about what you want right from the start. Transparency is your friend."
leo,2016-04-19,"A relationship with a coworker can grow complicated today because it's nearly impossible to maintain objectivity when your emotions are involved. You might believe the awkwardness will pass quickly, but apparently there are no simple solutions to the current predicament. Nevertheless, minimizing your desires won't work; you need to express them even if it temporarily upsets the applecart. Don't try to avoid the need for change. A small shift in your perspective may be all it takes to improve your overall attitude."
virgo,2016-04-19,"Making the right choices in an emotionally volatile relationship doesn't come easily today, even if you think you understand your partner's position. As carefully as you listen to each and every word, you still might not be able to grasp the true meaning of what's being said. Unfortunately, logic won't ride to your rescue now; you're better off responding from your heart without wasting time overanalyzing your feelings. Communication is a two-way street that demands respect at every corner."
libra,2016-04-19,"Someone's actions may seem too abrupt today, stirring up old feelings of abandonment. But your current sense of rejection might be more connected to your past than to the present moment. It's possible that others are just as emotionally overwhelmed and frustrated as you because they cannot easily express what's going on in their hearts either. Words are not to be trusted now; however, your behavior clearly tells your story. Take the high road and see who follows."
scorpio,2016-04-19,"Your reaction to changes at work may be darker and more intense than anyone prefers, but it's not your responsibility to make others comfortable by hiding your needs. Vulnerable Venus squares ruthless Pluto today, requiring you to face feelings that are buried in the depths of your subconscious. Express your emotions, but do it kindly and without blame. Magically, you are an inspiration when you remain true to your inner experience."
sagittarius,2016-04-19,"You might not consciously realize your feelings are coloring your perceptions today. Interactions with others are complicated by powerful emotions that make calm conversation impossible. Unfortunately, it's tougher to separate your personal needs from a situation that demands objectivity now. Diving directly into the complexities moves you closer to the truth and teaches you something meaningful about yourself in the process."
capricorn,2016-04-19,"There's no apparent straightforward path to your goals today. Nevertheless, your agenda is set in stone, and you're not interested in changing it to make others feel more secure. But your eagerness to accomplish something special prompts you to overlook what someone else wants now. Although pursuing your ambitions can bring great rewards, don't forget the importance of human connection. Make time to give those you love your shoulder to lean on in their time of need."
aquarius,2016-04-19,"An unresolved feeling lingers in your heart and it won't go away until you address it. Naturally, the most direct solution is to discuss your concerns with a trustworthy confidant. Although you're ready to spill the beans about a emotional problem, your casual tone might make it sound less important than it really is. Slow down to sink into your feelings now. You may be resistant at first, but the journey will be worthwhile in the end. Sometimes internal conflict is just a catalyst to make you smarter the next time around."
pisces,2016-04-19,"It feels as if you're at the end of your rope now because your words keep slipping away before you can finish expressing what's on your mind. Ironically, you know exactly what you want to say until you open your mouth. But even if you think you're falling short of an adequate explanation today, don't retreat until you give it your best shot. Initiating a conversation about your emotions is enough to get the ball rolling; surprisingly, there is more time than you think to get your message across."
aries,2016-04-20,"Obstacles seem to be popping up in your path and your plans might not turn out as expected today. A series of minor delays could prompt you to doubt your ability to reach your goals as assertive Mars backtracks through your 9th House of Future Vision. But don't look to anyone else for your answers, even if you're feeling insecure. Although your friends mean well, you will likely end up resenting them for telling you what to do. Your best bet is to forgive your own shortcomings and gracefully adapt to the rhythm of the cosmos."
taurus,2016-04-20,"Your confidence is growing by leaps and bounds and you will continue to gain strength in your own convictions day by day. But instead of rushing off to the next great thing, give yourself time over the weeks ahead to absorb your recent accomplishments. Developing a deeper sense of self-awareness isn't particularly fun because you Bulls would rather plow the fields than analyze your feelings about the past. However, there are more valuable lessons to be learned by sinking deeper into your current world now than by building a new one."
gemini,2016-04-20,"You may need to contend with an angry partner or coworker now that combative Mars is backpedaling in your 7th House of Relationships. But someone else's negative emotions become more problematic when you don't express your own feelings for the sake of convenience. If you are upfront about your needs, others might not have to lose their tempers trying to get you to talk. Be the bigger person and reveal your heart before anyone asks."
cancer,2016-04-20,"You may grow restless with your life these days because it seems like everything is about your job now. Naturally, there's more going on in your world but simply keeping up with all your obligations can drain your energy. Fortunately, the gentle Libra Moon encourages you to balance work with play. But don't try to make any big changes yet; maintaining your daily routine is enough. Nevertheless, keep an eye to the future and be ready to pare back your commitments when the opportunity knocks."
leo,2016-04-20,"Although you're known for your creative outlook on life, something is holding you back now. You possess the energy to follow through with your plans, but may be fearful that your ideas aren't good enough. This emphasis on self-analysis can wreak havoc on your outer world, causing you to read signals incorrectly or to judge a current situation based upon an old hurt. Instead of focusing on what could go wrong, use your willpower to imagine your ideal outcome and hold it active in your mind. The power of positive thinking is your friend."
virgo,2016-04-20,"Domestic responsibilities weigh heavily on your shoulders these days, possibly preventing you from embarking on a new course. Fortunately, you're not in a hurry; you want this change of direction in your life to be built on a solid foundation. However, waves of frustration can be overwhelming when you realize how much there is yet to be done. Just remember, the big shift is not going to happen overnight, so you may as well take care of your personal business. Sometimes, honoring your priorities means doing what you must before you do what you want."
libra,2016-04-20,"It may be discouraging when people get in the way of your progress because they don't really understand your intentions. However, exerting too much control over your own schedule can prove self-defeating now that action-hero Mars is back-stepping in your 3rd House of Immediate Environment. Don't waste energy trying to mobilize your coworkers. Slow down and let them come around on their own accord. As Tolstoy wrote, ""The two most powerful warriors are patience and time."""
scorpio,2016-04-20,"It's to your advantage to reconsider a budget that you thought would carry you comfortably through the rest of the year. Your traditional planetary ruler Mars is retrograde in your 2nd House of Money for the next couple of months, bringing up financial concerns. However, some of your worries might be based upon an irrational fear of not having enough, rather than on the actual bottom line. Never let the things you want make you forget the things you have. Prosperity is a state of mind."
sagittarius,2016-04-20,"It's important to exercise a little caution before saying yes to more than you can handle now. Your life is complicated by the fact that action-hero Mars is hanging out in your sign due to its retrograde motion, which can fuel your enthusiasm and drive you to take too much. But karmic Saturn is also in the picture, requiring you to pay the price for any bad decisions. Remember, it's a marathon, not a sprint; don't burn yourself out before you reach your destination."
capricorn,2016-04-20,"Although you are naturally driven to achieve success, there's an internal intrigue pulling you into the metaphysical realms now rather than the physical. Retrograde Mars is lurking in your 12th House of Spiritual Mystery, luring your attention toward otherworldly matters. Ambitious goals feel hollow now because you yearn for the deeper meaning that comes from within. Happiness doesn't reside in possessions; it resides in the soul."
aquarius,2016-04-20,"You are motivated to establish plans for your future, but you can get so hung up in the brilliance of your ideas now that you can't get your scheme off the ground. Additionally, with retrograde Mars setting up shop in your 11th House of Social Networks, you might wait for an invitation that never arrives. If there's a dream you wish to pursue, make it happen. Don't depend on others to pave your road to success. Do something today that your future self will thank you for down the road."
pisces,2016-04-20,"The notion of getting ahead in the real world captivates your attention today. Red-hot Mars is camped out in your 10th House of Career, making this a great time to drive steadily toward your professional goals. But its retrograde motion can bring about detours and delays, so avoid getting lost in self-criticism if you don't immediately get what you want. Instead of wearing yourself out for no reason, remember you are better served now by working smarter, not harder."
aries,2016-04-21,"You're motivated to resolve an unsettled relationship issue today, but the discussion might not go as smoothly as you wish. Nevertheless, burying your emotions isn't a viable strategy in the long run. Your good intentions aren't enough; you must also be willing to compromise to get what you want. Acknowledge the validity of the other person's feelings, and then negotiate to find common ground where you both can stand in comfort."
taurus,2016-04-21,"The tried-and-true method that enables you to finish your work on another day isn't sufficient now because of your unrelenting desire to surround yourself with beauty. It's not enough to just answer a lingering question or handle a nagging problem; the peace-seeking Libra Moon also wants the solution to be elegant. However, letting go of your unrealistic expectations might be necessary to finalize a plan that will be practical enough to work. Luckily, making a small sacrifice pays off sooner than you think in ways you can't imagine."
gemini,2016-04-21,"Grab an opportunity to do something special with children today if you are given the chance; or if that's not feasible, try unleashing your own inner child on the world. Either way, you can enjoy some playtime now that the Moon is prancing through your 5th House of Fun and Games. A spontaneous activity could turn your day into one that is delightful for everyone, even if it means throwing out previous plans. Joy trumps negativity, so spread it around wherever you go."
cancer,2016-04-21,"You may be feeling ambivalent about socializing with friends or relatives today. You look forward to kicking back and catching up with everyone, but you also worry that someone might pressure you into taking sides in an ongoing conflict. Spending a bit of time alone could be your best option since there's no need to justify your choices to anyone else. After you regroup, you can return in a much improved state of mind willing to help out where you can."
leo,2016-04-21,"You want to maintain some control over your schedule, but your long-term planning may fall apart when an unexpected obstacle appears in your path now. Instead of struggling to stick to your preset schedule today, respond with common sense and quick thinking rather than rigidity and panic. Take care of the most pressing issues first while allowing the less important ones to temporarily fall to the wayside. Setting priorities is useful as long as you are adaptable when change is required."
virgo,2016-04-21,"You find making financial decisions is painful today because there are no easy answers. Rationalizing your extravagance is a waste of energy now if you're longing for something outside of your budget. It really doesn't matter if your potential acquisition is a good deal; save your money and spend it another time when you're more certain about what you need. A cool and calm approach can help to stave off unnecessary stress when it comes time to pay the bills. When in doubt, err on the side of caution."
libra,2016-04-21,"Don't give in to someone else's pressure to choose one answer over another unless your position is absolutely clear to you. Your ambivalence might annoy others, but it may also be your greatest strength today. It's even harder to take sides because you can see an issue from both perspectives now that the reflective Moon is back in your sign. Keeping an open mind enables you to play the role of a shuttle diplomat, going back and forth until the best solution becomes apparent to both camps."
scorpio,2016-04-21,"Although you desperately want to understand the symbols of your subconscious mind, you could work yourself into a state of frustration if you assume that every image contains a hidden meaning. The Moon's current visit to your 12th House of Spirituality amplifies the significance of your dreams, but you may have trouble deciphering them into concrete interpretations. Ironically, excessive analysis detracts from experiencing the magic of myth, so trust in the mystery and let go."
sagittarius,2016-04-21,"You may feel disillusioned today if you share something of interest with your friends, only to receive their cold shoulders. But they might not be as negative as you assume because you could have set unattainable expectations before giving anyone a chance to respond. You'll earn more support if you involve others in the process than if you overstate your case with a dramatic show and tell. Start off slowly and build a solid foundation before adding more levels of complexity. Keep it simple for the best results."
capricorn,2016-04-21,"Your strong convictions about a current situation are better expressed today than kept quiet. There's no room for playing games; just let others know your opinion at the earliest opportunity. Managing hidden agendas isn't worth the effort when it's healthier to put everything out on the table. Nevertheless, overcoming someone's objections serves to strengthen your plan and define your character. Resistance may fade when everyone knows exactly where you stand."
aquarius,2016-04-21,"It may seem as if your friend or partner is maneuvering to earn credit for something that might not be deserved. Your annoyance could become an issue because you don't think that people are paying enough attention to your accomplishments today. Even if you believe you're completely objective, subtle biases sill arise from a temporary lack of support. Don't blame others for your hurt feelings now; work on improving your own game, instead. Success is the best revenge."
pisces,2016-04-21,"You have a rather low tolerance for anyone who promises the sky and then spends too much time on public relations, rather than just rolling up their sleeves and doing the work. You don't want to make judgments, but it becomes more challenging when someone doesn't hold up their end of the deal now. Unfortunately, openly criticizing others probably won't help the current situation. Take the high road today; bite your tongue and wait to see what tomorrow brings."
aries,2016-04-22,"In theory, interpersonal dynamics should be quite simple, but in practice everything is more complicated than you prefer. Today's Scorpio Full Moon floods your 8th House of Deep Sharing, requiring you to acknowledge facts and feelings that you previously swept under the rug. However, you can't rest until you have stirred up the complexity you secretly want. Thankfully, being aware of your unconscious motives can be enough to prevent things from going awry. Honesty starts by telling yourself the truth."
taurus,2016-04-22,"You may feel as if someone is testing you today as the Scorpio Full Moon stresses your 7th House of Partners. Thankfully, the current shift of energy helps to settle the relationship dynamics back down into a more manageable state of affairs. But first you must loosen your grip on all preconceived ideas and willingly move outside of your comfort zone. If you hesitate, you'll be pushed along anyhow, kicking and screaming. After you stop resisting and start to embrace change, you might just receive the support you need."
gemini,2016-04-22,"New responsibilities are piling up so fast that you might reach a breaking point today. Perhaps your daily routine has become more challenging to manage and you're just not willing to put up with the chaos any longer. The Scorpio Full Moon activates your 6th House of Work, indicating an unexpected change that could clear the air of frustration. Nevertheless, letting others know what you need is a good start, as long as you're not outrageous in your demands. Sometimes, establishing limits is the kindest thing you can do."
cancer,2016-04-22,"Glorifying your past won't help you solve your current problems now. Though your life may seem highly complicated these days, changing your schedule won't make any difference; instead, just show up with integrity in the present moment. It's your turn to acknowledge your eccentricity while the Scorpio Full Moon shakes up the energy of your 5th House of Self-Expression. Don't worry if you're not acting as weirdly as you feel. The best freedom is found in being yourself."
leo,2016-04-22,"You might think you're stretched emotionally as far as you can go now. Unfortunately, a quick resolution to the current tension isn't likely if professional and personal needs are pulling from opposite directions. Thankfully, profound change is in the mix as today's Scorpio Full Moon destabilizes your 4th House of Foundations. Riding out this sudden tidal shift successfully is more likely if you can juggle your career goals to make quality time for home and family."
virgo,2016-04-22,"Recognizing that change is on the horizon is easy. However, you cannot tell how your current plans will be affected -- and this makes you slightly uncomfortable. Falling back on your daily routines doesn't take enough pressure off the current situation now that the potent Scorpio Full Moon charges your 3rd House of Immediate Environment. You might need to bring up a sensitive subject, but your willingness to initiate a logical conversation is the catalyst for transformation. A proactive approach makes progress possible."
libra,2016-04-22,"Although Libras are sometimes known for their wishy-washy demeanor, you won't have a lot of trouble making up your mind today. You can't afford to buy into this weak generalization about your ambivalence. The incisive Scorpio Full Moon sheds light on your 2nd House of Personal Values, so take a position based upon what is important to you. There's no reason to compromise your integrity for the sake of temporary convenience. Speak now or forever hold your piece."
scorpio,2016-04-22,"Embracing your feelings can be overwhelming today, but it's easier if you cultivate your awareness to observe your emotional process. Pay attention to your reactions so you can learn from what's going on, rather than being blown around by the winds of circumstance. The Full Moon lights up your sign, heightening your sensitivity to the tumultuous push-pull of cosmic forces. Your best strategy is to practice being your own witness. Rather than acting on impulse now, hold steady in the storm; this too shall pass."
sagittarius,2016-04-22,"You may not fully comprehend everything that's happening now, but something wonderful is ready to unfold in your life. However, emotional and spiritual growth is often painful, especially with the unforgiving Scorpio Full Moon overwhelming your 12th House of Destiny. Unconscious motivations push you towards destinations that aren't yet obvious to you. If everything seems to be out of control, make a conscious decision to just roll with the waves of change. As spiritual teacher Vernon Howard wrote, ""Resistance to the disturbance is the disturbance."""
capricorn,2016-04-22,"So many individual choices seem up in the air today and there doesn't appear to be anything you can do to bring them back down to Earth. You want to take responsibility for your future dreams with the Scorpio Full Moon revitalizing your 11th House of Long-Term Goals. However, struggling with basic issues now is not a sign of failure. In fact, letting go at the right time could be an act of grace. Living more spontaneously is your key to making the most of every single moment."
aquarius,2016-04-22,"People seem overly dependent on you today, even if you don't fully accept that you can depend on yourself. It's not that you lack confidence; it's just that you think you're in over your head now and the pressure for putting things right can be emotionally debilitating. Thankfully, the relentless Scorpio Full Moon highlights your 10th House of Responsibility, urging you to be clear about your limits of time and resources. Once you establish a realistic scope of what's possible, get busy and deliver on your promises with a grateful heart."
pisces,2016-04-22,"Paradoxically, your imagination helps you see things others miss, yet this intuitive process can be a burden because it isn't always easy to explain. However, you must be painstakingly clear while describing your insights now so everyone understands the message -- even if your extrasensory perceptions are more colorful than the facts. The Scorpio Full Moon is like a beacon that guides your 9th House of Higher Truth, putting you directly in touch with your vision of the future. Your words light the way for others to follow."
aries,2016-04-23,"Getting your message across requires a considerable investment of time and energy. Nevertheless, nothing is more important now than ensuring your words are clearly understood. Conversations require careful listening to avoid confusion in financial matters, especially involving shared property. But you can miss the point and throw a negotiation into reverse gear if you are too impatient. Set aside your defensive tendencies; open your heart and your mind in order to make the best connection."
taurus,2016-04-23,"You may desire more than you receive from a friend or partner today, but don't assume that he or she knows your heart. Shy behavior won't help you realize your dreams, so take a chance and describe exactly what you want in detail. You might have already stated your needs more than once already, but the past is past. If you crave emotional satisfaction, it's appropriate to put in the extra effort now for your voice to be heard. The squeaky wheel gets the grease."
gemini,2016-04-23,"You can't decide whether to look forward to what's next in your life or to reevaluate what just happened. Circumstances may offer you the chance to take one more review of your recent past so you don't have to redo a task that you thought was finished. If you begin a new project, double-check the fine print to avoid further complications. Paying extra attention now can save you time and energy later. Ironically, sometimes the quickest route isn't the fastest."
cancer,2016-04-23,"It seems as if people want to play games when you need to be serious today; however, they grow contemplative when you are ready for fun. Your mental flexibility is necessary to adapt to the current frustrating conditions. Fortunately, you stand to learn more than you expect if you can make attitude adjustments on the fly. Knowing when to hold and when to fold is a clever skill that comes in handy now. Cultivating a sense of humor never hurts."
leo,2016-04-23,"The unwanted fallout from recent overindulgent behavior may create conflict at home today. But it's tempting to let your pride get the best of you and turn this minor problem into a personal issue. Push past your initial reaction and participate in the conversation as an active listener before angrily defending yourself. Practicing sensitivity, rather than hostility, can turn the situation around, bringing you and your family even closer together than before."
virgo,2016-04-23,"Your logic is very convincing today, but you could do more harm than good if others aren't ready to hear what you have to say. Luckily, your self-restraint helps you find just the right words at the right moment. However, it takes more than mere facts to make your point now. People want to feel heard and they won't budge until you let them know that you care about their opinions. Ultimately, taking the time to listen improves your chances of sharing your message."
libra,2016-04-23,"You peacemakers are given a wonderful opportunity to exercise your communication skills by building bridges between opposing sides of a conflict without getting run over in the process. But instead of saving the entire world, you may need to retreat to save your own skin if the stress becomes unbearable today. It's admirable to be of service, but you must fight to stay centered or there won't be any energy left over for when you need it the most."
scorpio,2016-04-23,"Powerful feelings are bubbling up toward the surface and they can flood over the top without much warning today. Obviously, putting yourself in an emotionally pressurized situation increases the likelihood of an explosion. Thankfully, you can reduce tension by focusing strictly on the facts and steering far away from needless drama. Sometimes the truth isn't as complicated as you think. The Dalai Lama advises, ""Be kind whenever possible. It is always possible."""
sagittarius,2016-04-23,"Your attention is pulled in multiple directions today, providing more stimulation than you need. Avoid the temptation to jump at every offer that comes your way just because they all sound like fun. Small distractions can lead to big complications that throw your entire day off track. Obviously, you don't have enough time to follow every interesting idea to its conclusion; choose only those that are of the highest priority to your heart."
capricorn,2016-04-23,"A supportive friend may encourage you to live out your dreams today while someone else you admire is more negative. But it's your life and ultimately you're the only one who decides which goals to pursue. Either way, it's not worth the effort to rationally debate a critic, since your idea either works for you or it doesn't. The advice you attract now could be more confusing than practical, so listen to your own heart as your primary source of guidance."
aquarius,2016-04-23,"A small dose of optimism is constructive as you attempt to overcome someone's resistance today. However, navigating the interpersonal dynamics is tricky because people may not be forthcoming with their thoughts. You aren't usually drawn into everyone else's dramas, but you might be more than willing to interfere now, especially if you think you can help. Nevertheless, it's smarter to play it cool, rather than potentially complicating the situation by pushing your way into unknown emotional territory."
pisces,2016-04-23,"It's a mixed blessing being naturally sensitive to subtleties that others can't even perceive. But trusting your intuitive feelings is recommended now, since your radar is so keenly attuned. However, it's not necessary to tell people what you're actually picking up today because they may not be open to your perspective, especially if they didn't ask for your opinion. Be careful to handle the situation delicately so that you don't needlessly ruffle anyone's feathers. Sometimes the truth is stranger than fiction."
aries,2016-04-24,"A rushing surge of confidence motivates you to overcome an obstacle that was blocking your way. Unfortunately, this new wave of optimism still may not produce results quickly enough for you. Nevertheless, patiently working toward your goals brings emotional satisfaction, even if you're not making much progress today. Although you're ready for something completely different, stay the course for a while longer to give yourself the best chance for success. Never underestimate the power of persistence."
taurus,2016-04-24,"You might be feeling uncomfortable now, and even a bit out of sorts. Although you are often determined to make the best of any situation, you lose interest in the dreams of your future if your fantasies aren't supported by the present circumstances. Explore every possibility, but don't confuse your thoughts with reality. Everything will take longer to manifest than you think, so don't worry about making final decisions yet. Believe it or not, time really is on your side."
gemini,2016-04-24,"Your point of view on a personal issue might be very different from someone close to you. Oddly enough, you're both likely working with the same set of information today. Don't get discouraged about this current disagreement; an honest discussion may still prove fruitful if you're willing to compromise. Thankfully, your flexible attitude can make you a winner. Your chances of getting what you want increase as long as you don't wave the white flag too soon."
cancer,2016-04-24,"You are harboring big ideas about what you plan to accomplish today, but it's crucial to be realistic or you'll end up disappointed in yourself. Unfortunately, your attention could be hijacked if you're caught up in a web of emotions. Thankfully, your life is not as extreme as it seems. Opening your heart and widening your perspective eases the relationship tension. Taking little steps with someone you love can create enough positive movement to give you the hope you need."
leo,2016-04-24,"Although this may seem like a perfect day to fall in love, an emotional interaction can become problematic unless your motives are clear. You are appreciative if a helpful person rides to your rescue or if a spiritual teaching offers you solace. Either way, your fantasies can transform into reality, but you must take the initiative by giving your dreams a creative nudge forward. Be daring and step out on a limb. If you don't make your move quickly, you'll never know what you might have missed."
virgo,2016-04-24,"It's natural for you Virgos to focus on the details of your current circumstances before creating a concrete plan. However, today's confident Sagittarius Moon encourages you to see everything in a holistic manner without having to resort to extreme measures. But you might work yourself into a state of anxiety as your mind jumps back and forth from the very big to the very little. If you are pulled off course, take a deep breath and recalibrate your center for the week ahead."
libra,2016-04-24,"There are so many things happening every which way you turn that each interaction is just another distraction. Fortunately, a variety of activities can also be a lot of fun now. Nevertheless, you may be a bit scattered today as the changeable Moon visits your 3rd House of Communication. Don't waste energy attempting to turn the noise of the day down to a manageable level. Instead, go along for the ride and enjoy yourself while the excitement lasts."
scorpio,2016-04-24,"You possess the necessary courage now to face issues that you have previously avoided. Fortunately, you can use today's optimistic Sagittarius Moon to improve your personal finances as she visits your 2nd House of Money. However, too much confidence can lead to a false sense of wellbeing, making a demanding problem seem less troublesome. Don't just ignore bad news by glossing over the details. Instead, fire up a bit of your famous Scorpio tenacity and confront your fears while the cosmos is working on your behalf."
sagittarius,2016-04-24,"Your shifting moods may get the best of you now that the evocative Moon is back in your sign, amplifying your feelings. However, you can also learn a very important lesson today if you are willing to stop running around and simply delve into your heart. You feel more at home philosophizing about your emotions; nevertheless, it's time to explore your passions without being overwhelmed by them. Sometimes you need to step off the logical grid to squeeze the most juice out of life."
capricorn,2016-04-24,"You are often the most reliable person around because you tend to keep your feet on the ground while calculating how to reach the mountain's summit. However, you may be looking for an escape route today as the intensity of your fantasies increases. There's no need to panic now, for you won't lose your sense of reality. Give yourself permission to sink into your most irrational dreams; you just might return with priceless wisdom that you can't learn by reading a book."
aquarius,2016-04-24,"Your positive attitude enables you to maintain a healthy perspective now as you gracefully manage most problems that surface. Optimism may abound, but it only takes you so far today. Although people seem to be supportive of your plans, you must put in the extra effort on your own. Nevertheless, do whatever you can to return the love, since you'll make more progress when you feel the team spirit. There's no time like the present; your current actions set the stage for the days ahead."
pisces,2016-04-24,"An acquaintance may approach you for advice or assistance today. Unfortunately, your plan might not go as you imagine, even when you are operating with the best of intentions. Listen carefully to what others want and don't promise more than you can deliver just to avoid conflict. The sooner you are honest about your limits, the better for everyone involved. Don't get hung up trying to resolve every difference; focus on your destination and you might be surprised by how quickly you arrive there."
aries,2016-04-25,"You might be the leader of the watercooler squad at work today since you can enjoy wasting time as long as you're having fun. But you are so quick to react now that you could say something that's not meant to be shared. Words slip out of your mouth before you even consider their impact. However, taking several deep breaths before speaking up won't negatively impact your popularity. In fact, pacing your delivery may even save you from an embarrassing blunder. If you can't say something nice, then don't say anything at all."
taurus,2016-04-25,"You appear to be putting in maximum effort on anything you take seriously today. However, you could simultaneously get lost in your daydreams, even if your double life isn't noticed by anyone else. Although others can't tell how far from reality your mind is meandering, they can see that your rich imagination adds something special to your practical ideas. Don't hesitate to share your creative point of view now, even if it seems crazy to you at first. Magic starts in the mind before working its way into the real world."
gemini,2016-04-25,"You may be at a turning point in a relationship because you must decide if you're going to take it to the next level or retreat to emotionally safer ground. Be careful because you could make a bad choice today if you let your hopes color your perceptions. Postpone any major decisions for a couple of days. Once your muddled thinking clears, you can choose your course of action with more confidence. Time has a wonderful way of showing you what really matters."
cancer,2016-04-25,"Comparing your idealistic dreams with where you currently are in your life can be quite the disconcerting exercise. The gap between your fantasies and reality may be so large now that you don't even know where to begin. Instead of setting yourself up for failure by aiming too high, try a more modest approach. Focusing on your recent progress is better than tearing yourself down with self-criticism. Starting your day with a few simple affirmations gives you the positive boost you need to fulfill your destiny."
leo,2016-04-25,"Although you might be basking in the light of admiration today, you could fool yourself into thinking that everyone is your friend. It's not that anyone is necessarily working against your efforts; it's just that people have their unique agendas and it's helpful to know where they diverge from yours. Nevertheless, don't waste your breathe trying to convince anyone your way is the only way. You won't set yourself up for disappointment if you can be open-minded to each person's offerings. Everyone has a special gift; your job is to discover it."
virgo,2016-04-25,"Staying on track may be quite the struggle today because you can see intriguing possibilities everywhere you look. Your current optimism leads you to believe a task will be easier than it is, although you still accept the fact that hard work is key in reaching your goals. Nevertheless, you are at a fork in the road and you might not know which way to go. You're probably missing some critical facts, making it wiser to pursue a more conservative route. Temporarily walking away from the fun and games leads you down the path to success."
libra,2016-04-25,"You're living out the part of a social butterfly today, flying from one fascinating conversation to the next. However, you don't have to avoid an awkward subject, even if it leads into unfamiliar territory. Although you might choose to circumvent the most passionate discussions for now, you can still clear the air by sharing what's on your mind. Sometimes it's the littlest things that get the conversation rolling. Start with something small and go from there."
scorpio,2016-04-25,"Although you might be sure of your current choices, it's still not a good idea to trust your senses today because they can lure you into a sense of complacency. Don't be lulled into a state of hypnotic acceptance. Even if you're imagining smooth sailing ahead, there may be storm clouds on the horizon and you're advised to batten down the hatches while the Sun is still shining. Ironically, a challenging patch of emotional weather might be enough of a wake-up call to act as a catalyst for positive change."
sagittarius,2016-04-25,"It isn't prudent to believe all the stories you tell now because you might have inadvertently altered the facts to support your current position. In fact, your past continually changes as your present attitude contracts and expands. Nevertheless, it's therapeutic to review your personal history as long as you understand you can't live fully in the here and now if you're clinging too tightly to memories. Letting go of the old makes room for the new."
capricorn,2016-04-25,"You may be intrigued by an unrealistic fantasy about a relationship now. However, your idealistic dreams can actually stand between you and happier days. Acknowledging your attachment to a particular outcome is necessary if you want to overcome your attraction to it. But there's no need to go to extremes and deny your preferences if you can maintain a healthy perspective. Giving yourself a quick reality check is your current prescription to achieving emotional satisfaction."
aquarius,2016-04-25,"Perhaps you really believe you have everything under control, but you may miss an important piece of the puzzle today. Fortunately, there's no need to fix anything yet if you make a wrong assumption. Don't move too quickly or you could stir up a hornets' nest that instigates an intense power struggle. Becoming aware of your mistakes is enough for now. Your relationships are in flux, so take time to see where things go before making your move. Sometimes there is more wisdom in waiting than in initiating action."
pisces,2016-04-25,"You are an avid dreamer by nature and today's Moon-Neptune aspect magnifies your wishful thinking. You can journey so far into the depths of your imagination that you lose track of the real world. An unexpected event may shock you back into awareness now, waking you from your contemplative state and confronting you with the truth. This blast of reality is a buzzkill at first, but it could be a blessing in disguise if you seize the opportunity in the storm."
aries,2016-04-26,"You may be feeling gleefully optimistic today, but reality will surely show its true colors sooner than you prefer. In the meantime, enjoy the opportunities for fun and games that come your way. You have a lot of leeway with respect to your schedule now as long as you don't sidestep your commitments. But you can't ignore your mortal limits and squeeze in too much activity or you will exhaust yourself in the process. Make sure to get plenty of sleep so you are ready to jump at a moment's notice when duty calls."
taurus,2016-04-26,"Sharing your feelings with your peers sounds like a good idea today, but your current work environment might not be as supportive as you wish. Instead of pursuing your personal interests now, draw out the strengths of others by asking the right questions. Remember, your success partly depends on the emotional well-being of those around you. Creating a friendly atmosphere enables everyone to have more fun while being more productive in the process."
gemini,2016-04-26,"Beware of people sharing pie-in-the-sky ideas today because they could distract you from your  work in the real world. You won't be content in the long run if you drop everything you are doing now just to dive into someone else's project. Don't expect anyone else to satisfy your need for diversion. Instead, do something on your own that allows you to experience the adrenaline rush you crave without straying too far from your prior commitments."
cancer,2016-04-26,"You wake up enthused by all the potential in your life, but you could slowly approach the edge of self-doubt as the day unfolds. You're probably optimistic through the afternoon, yet grow more somber later in the evening when the Moon takes up residence in pragmatic Capricorn. In the meantime, utilize your current confidence to tackle unfinished business while you still have a positive outlook. Ultimately, your accomplishments will speak for themselves."
leo,2016-04-26,"You could experience a fascinating attraction to someone special today and yearn to demonstrate your feelings with a dramatic gesture. But it might be difficult to act on your desires because you are concerned about breaking the rules of social etiquette. Although doing something adventurous with a romantic companion sounds wonderful, you may have to proceed slower than you prefer. Don't put unnecessary pressure on the situation; paradoxically, you'll make more progress as you let go of your expectations."
virgo,2016-04-26,"You might try a more direct approach when communicating your needs today, since you intuitively know you achieve better results when you let others know what you want. However, you could be overbearing if you're so enthusiastic about your goals that you forget about everyone else. Staying aware of your impact on others now helps you avoid the rough spots. Knowing when to change the topic is key to your relationship success."
libra,2016-04-26,"Too much action may have you running around in search of a quiet place to hide today, but you probably won't find much peace wherever you go. Unfortunately, the more you withdraw, the harder it is to escape from it all. But instead of working yourself up into a state of frustration, it's simpler to just accept the temporary chaos and save your retreat for another time. Changing your attitude magically improves your day."
scorpio,2016-04-26,"Your self-esteem is on the rise, but you must be careful not to let casual criticism send you into an emotional tailspin. You're willing to work hard for whatever you want, yet you may be more sensitive to other people's feedback now than you realize. In the final analysis, your obsession with excellence speaks louder than someone else's unconscious words. Keep your eye on your goal; believing in yourself is your secret to success."
sagittarius,2016-04-26,"Although your temperament may be a bit erratic today, your energy will settle down later in the evening. However, trying to control your changing moods might be nearly impossible because the Moon in your sign can overpower your most convincing logic. Your best strategy is to just let your emotions run their course before assuming that you really know what's going on in your heart. The truth is worth the wait even if it takes a while to arrive."
capricorn,2016-04-26,"You're entertaining a flood of cosmic ideas today, but they may be so grandiose that they don't make sense within the current situation. As sound as your strategy seems on the surface, your timing might be off. You could exhaust your energy trying to push a river up a hill. Take a few steps back and let events flow on their own until you can develop a new plan that works with the power of nature and not against it."
aquarius,2016-04-26,"Your friends are the source of lighthearted fun today, but their plans can be so enticing that you're distracted from your work. If you choose to go along with the group, remember that you still must meet your previous obligations. Even if you think you can get away with avoiding responsibility now, it's not in your best interest to simply run off in pursuit of pleasure. Luckily, you should be able to balance work and play if you don't go overboard on either end."
pisces,2016-04-26,"It's challenging to follow through on anything you start today because you tend to be so idealistic when you dream about the potential of your career objectives. However, you may feel quite constrained by the present circumstances once you start progressing toward your destination. Thankfully, you can make the most of any obstacles that appear in your path by using your frustration to fuel your drive. As Zig Zigler wrote, ""Sometimes adversity is what you need to face in order to become successful."""
aries,2016-04-27,"An overly self-critical assessment of your current career path could lead you to obsess about a recent situation at work. However, it's helpful to consider your part in creating the drama today. Unwanted responsibilities may land on your plate now, reminding you of what you are sacrificing to maintain the status quo. Suffering in silence isn't your style, so you won't be able to remain quiet for long. Get busy and start applying your efforts in a methodical manner before you lose the chance."
taurus,2016-04-27,"Although you're standing with both feet solidly planted on the ground, you still believe that nearly anything is possible today. However, you may run into more obstacles than you expect when you stretch your wings. Before your confidence turns into discouragement, remember that the current resistance makes you more determined than ever to accomplish your goals. If you really want to reach the top, hard work and persistence pave your way to success."
gemini,2016-04-27,"It's mind-boggling to contemplate all the possibilities that are in front of you today, but seem just beyond your grasp. Unfortunately, you can't pursue every opportunity that knocks at your door. But even with the limitations you face now, you still can find your way by narrowing your focus like a laser beam. Set one goal above all the others. Once you prioritize your intentions, your chances for reaching satisfaction greatly improve over the weeks ahead."
cancer,2016-04-27,"You're unsure of your next move because the normal relationship between cause and effect isn't very apparent now. Your specific actions don't seem to elicit the expected responses, making you hesitant to try again. But even if reality throws you a curve ball today, keeping your faith in the outcome is crucial. Continue to follow your heart no matter what anyone else says; you will likely reach your original goal, whether or not you're challenged by a few twists and turns of fate along your way."
leo,2016-04-27,"You're a champion at holding your position with an air of confidence, but you might not be as sure of yourself as others think. It's as if your need to be acknowledged for your performance is more important than anything else -- and you could feel disappointed if people don't give you the feedback you want. You may need to adjust your methodology in order to get a job done right. However, there's no reason to sacrifice your values in the process. You don't need others to believe in you when you believe in yourself."
virgo,2016-04-27,"Your practical approach to life is wholeheartedly supported by those around you. But the cosmic encouragement of the determined Taurus Sun and the ambitious Capricorn Moon won't last, so you better act now while success is likely. Aim for the most tangible results possible because this isn't time for pie-in-the-sky visions. Taking concrete steps allows you to make the most from the current potential. The opportunity for growth is yours for the taking if you are willing to rise to the challenge."
libra,2016-04-27,"Although there may be too much work to finish in one day, you still are given a wonderful opportunity to play catch up today. Don't panic; tasks have been stacking up gradually, so it could take some time to get to the bottom of your list. Meanwhile, the Moon's visit to your 4th House of Domestic Conditions offers you the support you need to focus on your current responsibilities. There's no reason to pretend you have everything under control. Accepting logistical help from family or friends is less a sign of weakness than of intelligence."
scorpio,2016-04-27,"Remain open-minded and make allowances for someone else's perspective today, even if you're convinced that you are on the right track. No matter how certain you are about your plan, self-righteous behavior isn't productive to a successful collaboration. Instead of alienating yourself from potential allies by assuming your position is superior, try to see things from a different point of view. The more you actively listen to others, the more they will rally to your cause."
sagittarius,2016-04-27,"Your energy level is hard to manage now, especially if you recently made promises you can't keep. It's disheartening if your progress isn't as consistent as you wish, but unexpected delays may actually be the universe's way of giving you another opportunity to reconsider your strategy. Aside from streamlining your plans, you can also improve your chances for success by eliminating activities that are extraneous to your current goals. Narrowly focusing your energy requires self-discipline, but the rewards are worth the effort in the end."
capricorn,2016-04-27,"You might not know how to honor your shifting feelings without threatening the integrity of the preexisting foundations. You seek enduring relationships, but don't want them to deteriorate into mechanically comfortable arrangements. Thankfully, there's no need to sacrifice your security now to reinvigorate a significant partnership. However, you still may be required to take a calculated risk and share your heart's desire to revitalize your emotional connection with someone you love."
aquarius,2016-04-27,"Serving others can be a meaningful spiritual practice, but sometimes selfless work has its limitations. You may derive considerable benefit by stepping back today and not working quite as hard to please everyone while the Moon is camped out in your 12th House of Privacy. However, favorable lunar aspects minimize your desire to become completely invisible; just strive for a healthy balance. Stay ahead of the curve by taking care of your emotional needs so you have even more to offer others."
pisces,2016-04-27,"Maintaining a high level of clarity in communication is possible to achieve if you only say what is absolutely necessary now. However, your most imaginative ideas may be lost if you keep your conversations succinct. Don't forget to honor your dreams, even if you want to be pragmatic in social interactions today. Wait until you can share your visions for the future with friends who might not be so judgmental when your thoughts wander. Knowing your audience is essential for your relationship success."
aries,2016-04-28,"Although you might like to dance defiantly at the edge of a cliff, there's no escaping the truth today. You can't keep up the illusion of competence while you feel as if you're running out of steam. Your most reliable strategy may include recharging your batteries, but rest and relaxation doesn't mean finding another distracting activity. Take time to gather your strength for the challenges ahead. You're only human; even superheroes need a day off now and then."
taurus,2016-04-28,"The intensity of interpersonal interactions may be overwhelming now, tempting you to retreat behind a protective wall. However, you won't like feeling so isolated if you choose to socially withdraw. Mercury's current retrograde in your pragmatic sign requires careful navigation through tricky territory. Ironically, you might overcompensate by taking on even more activities and wearing yourself out in the process. Seeking a more moderate path between the extreme of all or nothing is your best chance for happiness."
gemini,2016-04-28,"Digging beneath the surface and exploring spiritual mysteries can be an important part of your emotional waking now. Your key planet Mercury turns retrograde in your 12th House of Imagination today, challenging you to delve deeper into your fantasies. Thankfully, you won't likely lose yourself in delusional thinking, for your need to remain practical is compelling. Your current task is to give yourself enough freedom to wander through the rich symbolism of your subconscious without growing detached from reality."
cancer,2016-04-28,"There are unfinished social obligations to handle today. Your intent is to take care of as many previous commitments as possible and then move on. But nothing is as straightforward as you expect now because other people's agendas aren't yet on the table. Obviously, you can't make an informed decision until the facts are in front of you. Nevertheless, there's no need to force anything yet, for the missing information will come out into the open soon enough. In the meantime, maintaining an open mind makes your day one of enjoyment and not frustration."
leo,2016-04-28,"Reconciling your current course of action with what you now know is nearly impossible since logic suggests you would be wiser doing something else. But you're relentlessly determined to follow through on what you started, even if it makes your life more difficult for a while. Although your loyalty is legendary, it's still prudent to reevaluate your plan rather than blindly sticking to it, no matter what. There's no shame in admitting when you're wrong. Don't let an error in judgment stand in the way of your success."
virgo,2016-04-28,You have plenty of useful data at your fingertips but you might feel as if you need more specific information in order to make an educated decision about your future. Your key planet Mercury is in the spotlight today as it begins its retrograde cycle in your 9th House of Big Ideas. Don't try to put all the pieces into place yet. Pare back your thinking now and focus on one day at a time while you continue to make a plan for the next phase of your life.
libra,2016-04-28,"You may be forced to pull from hidden emotional reserves today, even if you didn't know they were available. Thankfully, you can find the strength you need, possibly surprising those who didn't think you had what it takes. Just remember, this isn't a one-shot deal; there are several weeks of hard work ahead of you and you won't be able to slack off until the job is actually done. As Drew Barrymore quipped, ""In the end, some of your greatest pains become your greatest strengths."""
scorpio,2016-04-28,"Your mental reactions are lightning-quick today, but they can be extremely misleading to others. People might assume your quick thinking on your feet actually reveals that you don't have a long-term plan in place. However, you know your destination now, even if you're unsure exactly how to get there. Don't worry about what to do next; just trust that each step will make sense in the moment as long as you're steadfast in your intention. Energy flows where attention goes."
sagittarius,2016-04-28,"Your daily routine might fall apart at the seams today as an unexpected opportunity shakes up your schedule at home. Instead of attempting to stubbornly stick to a previous agenda, you're clever enough to recreate your list of priorities for the day. Once you clearly demonstrate your willingness to bend with the changing winds, a stressful path will morph into a trail of accomplishment."
capricorn,2016-04-28,"You feel restrained by the mundane events of your life now, especially if you're waiting for something magical to occur. It's as if you expect the invisibility cloak to lift, enabling you to peer into the otherworldly realms of infinite possibilities. Although you can imagine events leaking into your world from other dimensions, there is no quick fix to the current obstacles blocking your way. But don't write off your dreams as a waste of time; they might just take longer to materialize than you wish. Your unrelenting belief is enough to make them real."
aquarius,2016-04-28,"You're being pushed up against the edge of your comfort zone and you wonder whether or not it's smart to push back or just surrender. But your dilemma isn't about doing the right thing; it's more about knowing when to call it quits. It may take a few weeks before you possess a clear enough perspective to make a final decision. In the meantime, just give yourself permission to change your mind whenever it's necessary. Explore all the alternatives while you have the chance."
pisces,2016-04-28,"Confusion sets in as you try to sort out your desires from your responsibilities today. Too much conflicting information makes it extremely difficult to choose one single path over all the others. Trusting your intuition could lead you to leaving your options open longer than you originally thought possible. But don't panic while trickster Mercury is turning retrograde. Let the moment pass without making an impulsive decision, for your current sense of urgency might be based more on fear than on reality."
aries,2016-04-29,"You're quite pleased when you can get along with everyone so easily, but you still must be careful that your self-confidence doesn't turn into arrogance today. You can become so focused on what you are saying that you inadvertently offend someone. People might even believe that you're intentionally pushing their buttons. Hopefully, your best friends understand your motives, but you could anger a coworker if your approach appears too forceful. Honestly, it takes little effort to keep the peace by simply softening your rhetoric."
taurus,2016-04-29,"You have a very specific agenda now and you won't likely waste any time when starting your work. Unfortunately, others might interpret your behavior as theatrical rather than practical today, which can be irritating to you. Even if you are disappointed that people don't appreciate your efforts, it's not in your best interest to try to convince anyone of your good intentions because you have more important things to do. Although it may take a while, your actions will ultimately speak for themselves."
gemini,2016-04-29,"You might run into some unexpected opposition today, no matter how self-assured you feel as you look to the future. However, facing resistance head-on isn't your best strategy now because your determination only piles more pressure onto a delicate situation. Thankfully, there's no need to let someone's negativity precipitate a crisis of self-doubt. Lighten up and do whatever is necessary to avoid confrontation; the sooner you move on, the sooner the disruptive energy settles down."
cancer,2016-04-29,"Behaving in a carefree manner today sounds like the course of least resistance, but you won't likely be flexible enough to make a big enough difference. Acting in an emotionally detached manner is challenging when you can see through someone's facade without even trying. But it isn't helpful to climb onto your soapbox and broadcast the truth as you perceive it because others probably won't hear your message anyhow. Although you may be fed up with the entire charade, it's still wiser to let the awkward moment pass without giving it unnecessary attention."
leo,2016-04-29,"Expressing your emotions in a forthright manner is tricky today, especially if you grow annoyed with a friend. You're tempted to find a scapegoat standing in your path who doesn't really deserve your wrath. Don't take your feelings out on the wrong person; this kind of unconscious behavior sours an otherwise sweet connection. Instead, gently vent your negativity without blaming anyone else. Engaging in vigorous physical exercise is one way to reduce your stress while removing others from your little drama."
virgo,2016-04-29,"You might get so carried away with your work today that you exhaust yourself before reaching your objectives. If you start a task that grows into a major project, be sure to set well-defined limits so you know when to call it quits. You don't need to prove anything now, even if you think others may judge you in a negative light. Simply give it your unrestrained best effort and then walk away with a clear conscience."
libra,2016-04-29,"You could unconsciously carry a chip on your shoulder today, especially if you have grown overconfident about your contributions at work. However, your larger-than-life attitude may stir up negativity from a close friend or partner. You might experience more than your fair share of discord if you hold on to the belief that your approach is superior to all others. Remember, there are many ways to view current events and yours is only one of them. Humility is your friend."
scorpio,2016-04-29,You may be so irritated with people who don't respect your boundaries that it becomes necessary to take a stand today. It doesn't matter that you understand on a logical level that being adaptable is the mature response. Your annoyance could still build until it morphs into anger because you're tired of always assuming that things will improve. Don't wait until it's too late and you lose your temper; express your displeasure while you still can communicate in a kind and rational manner. A spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down.
sagittarius,2016-04-29,"You're weary of doing everything the same old way today and yearn for the excitement of change. It's great to be innovative as long as your restlessness doesn't prompt you to add chaos to your life just because you are currently bored. Proceed with caution or you could manufacture a whole new set of problems before you know it. Although it might be contrary to your natural flair for the dramatic, making small adjustments to your normal routine is smarter than shaking up everything all at once."
capricorn,2016-04-29,"You have your own unique way of deciding what's most valuable now, and your unconventional priorities could generate a bit of static. It doesn't matter how serious you are about improving your life; people still might assume you're just acting eccentrically today. However, you probably sound more argumentative than you actually are, so be sure to temper any extreme opinions with a desire to maintain harmony. Thankfully, your common sense nudges you to stop and consider the impact of your words prior to alienating your closest allies."
aquarius,2016-04-29,"You might not be in total control of your energy today as your awareness swings back and forth between your head and your heart. It's often easier for you brainy Aquarians to be rational than emotional, but the reflective Moon's visit to your sign brings a variety of desires up to the surface now. Your wide mood swings may confuse others, so try to maintain a pragmatic middle-of-the-road approach by integrating your feelings with your thoughts. Finding your center is the key to restoring balance in your world."
pisces,2016-04-29,"Although you may believe your logical thinking will steer you in the right direction today, it's likely you will make assumptions based upon unconscious desires rather than solely on the facts. Whether you are right or wrong, stubbornly defending your position could escalate a minor disagreement into a larger conflict now. Listen carefully to the advice you receive instead of trying to win an argument. Once you realign your idealism with the truth, everything else will fall into place."
aries,2016-04-30,"It's critical to act responsibly rather than ignoring your commitments, even if there are other things ranking higher on your wish list. There aren't enough hours in the day to do everything that sounds enticing and fulfill all your obligations, too. Although you're eager to enjoy life this weekend, it's less painful to acknowledge the limitations of your schedule sooner than later. Delaying transient gratification to take care of business brings a deeper satisfaction now than a passing pleasure ever could."
taurus,2016-04-30,"You might not want to play all your marbles today and hope that others won't notice if you hold a few in reserve. Nevertheless, it's wiser to overcome your fear and show your hand, or you could miss out on a big opportunity. Instead of leaning on sheer determination to save you now, it's more useful to graciously adapt to the changing circumstances. Your willingness to compromise reveals more inner strength than digging in your heels and just saying no."
gemini,2016-04-30,"If you're running around in circles without accomplishing much today, you may need to stop and reevaluate your overall strategy. You might be reluctant to take a spoonful of reality as your medicine, especially if you think you already learned your lesson. Although you're probably not ready to change your ways forever, at least you're less inclined to run off and play until you finish your chores. Thankfully, practicing self-discipline enables you to meet your most important obligations, paving the way to guilt-free enjoyment later on."
cancer,2016-04-30,"Complicated family matters require your attention today, even if you prefer to be doing something else. Unfortunately, attempts to avoid a serious situation could make the problem worse. Don't be afraid to share your position with all those involved. You might be the one that needs to play the role of bad cop by taking a firm stand on what you know to be true. Although there is room for negotiation, everyone must know the score before a resolution can be found. Don't back down until you get your point across."
leo,2016-04-30,"Staying inspired is challenging when your attention is pulled in mundane directions by unavoidable responsibilities. Disappointment could hijack your day, dampening the fires of your creativity. It's nearly impossible to keep your spirits up if you're also constrained by a lack of time, money or energy. Don't cave in to your own insecurities; instead, hold fast to your vision of a best-case scenario and let it light your way. Hope anchors the soul."
virgo,2016-04-30,"A few big ideas about what you want to do may be enough to motivate you, but first you must handle a confusing situation in your immediate environment. Don't waste time fretting about the circumstances that currently restrict your choices. Just accept the fact that taking care of your commitments is a higher priority than running off in pursuit of your passions. There will be plenty of opportunities to chase your dreams, but only if you bite the bullet and do the responsible thing today."
libra,2016-04-30,"It's time to pay an emotional debt, especially if there are unresolved feelings lingering between you and a loved one. But don't wait until it's too late; you can work wonders and make up for lost time today if you put your mind to it. On the other hand, if your relationships are currently harmonious, you could reap the fruits of your recent hard work. Either way, you still must complete unfinished business before you move on -- and this won't likely happen overnight. Delays are only problematic if you think they will last forever."
scorpio,2016-04-30,"It seems unfair that someone else can take the day off while your responsibilities continue to pile up high enough to topple like a house of cards. Although you might be at a critical turning point now, nothing is to be gained by comparing your situation to anyone else's. You're being tested and are given an opportunity to demonstrate your competence under pressure today. This is your chance to shine; banish self-doubt and reestablish your self-esteem once and for all."
sagittarius,2016-04-30,"You have a general sense of your destination now, yet without a map you lack a plan to get there. The most obvious path seems to be blocked, but the good news is that the barriers are not permanent. It's just that your best ideas seem to run into another obstacle every time you take a step forward. Forget about making any progress  while you consolidate your recent gains. Surprisingly, the resistance will ease up once you stop pushing against the prevailing currents. Surrender to the universe's timetable instead of trying to make your own."
capricorn,2016-04-30,"People admire your stellar work ethic and envy your endurance that often enables you to reach your goals. However, your patience is being tried today as Venus is blocked by your key planet Saturn, delaying your efforts to achieve satisfaction. Naturally, you prefer to progress carefully toward your desired destination without stopping or slowing down. Nevertheless, the sooner you set aside an old agenda, the easier it will be to create a new one that is more relevant to your heart's current desires."
aquarius,2016-04-30,"It feels as if your friends are being overly critical of you today, and you probably think their judgments are unwarranted. In truth, others may be expecting too much from you, and you might rightly see them as an obstacle to your happiness. However, people are only protecting themselves from getting swept up in your next crazy idea, even if it is business as usual for you. Shake off  your discouragement and follow your bliss. Be bold, brave and brilliant."
pisces,2016-04-30,"Your closest friends and relatives might not understand how much you're struggling to live up to the promises you recently made. However, the pressure can be great enough to tempt you to walk away from your predicament -- but even that won't solve your problems for long. Thankfully, finding the ultimate solution may not even be necessary now. Simply do the best you can while letting everyone know your new schedule. Telling the truth is better than setting yourself up for failure later on."
aries,2016-05-01,"You can't make sense out of today's events because you fully expect reality to validate your fantasies. But believing in your dreams is challenging now if they're not supported by the most important people in your life. Nevertheless, it's not wise to give up on your best ideas. Although practicing patience is usually tricky for you Rams, suppressing your restlessness currently works in your favor. Continue to strive toward your goals and others will eventually appreciate your intentions when they see the results."
taurus,2016-05-01,"Maintaining your recently established boundaries can be tricky today because the fluidity of your relationships requires you to be adaptable. You might start the day with a straightforward agenda that becomes less relevant by the hour because sticking to it isolates you from others. But don't waste too much time trying to bend your schedule to make it work. Instead, set aside your previous plans and just follow your intuition. Save the rational approach for some other day when you have time to sort through all the options."
gemini,2016-05-01,"Your fantasies seem to be growing out of control today, but you can quickly regain a practical perspective once you understand that this confusing phase won't last forever. Don't be overly concerned about falling for an illusion; following the road to success will be easier than you realize. Rather than struggling to get your bearings now, enjoy the journey of your imagination while it lasts. As Eleanor Roosevelt wrote, ""The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams."""
cancer,2016-05-01,"Accurately describing your emotions to others may be nearly impossible today, yet your verbal block allows you to experience your feelings on a deeper level. Don't try so hard to be understood; there's nothing that requires you to justify your position to anyone else right now. However, it's not healthy to isolate yourself from those you love for too long. Even if you are unsure about accepting help from your friends now, being in their company will still lift your spirits."
leo,2016-05-01,"You may aspire to unlock the mystery of someone who appears to be a total enigma. But reducing everything to the facts won't help you uncover the elusive truth now, no matter how hard you try. Unfortunately, contradictory information rules the day, putting resolution even further out of reach. Instead of over-analyzing the data, step beyond the limits of logic and trust your instincts to guide you through these tricky times. Keep in mind that the truth isn't always obvious to the five senses."
virgo,2016-05-01,"Although you already received instructions for the day, you're still not clear about what to do next. Often, you are quite detail-oriented in your work, but it's a challenge to come up with a plan today that will put you back on track. Unfortunately, requesting assistance is a waste of time now because no one else can tell you what you need to know. Even if you're wrestling with your doubts, just jump on stage and get started; a pleasant surprise is waiting for you in the wings."
libra,2016-05-01,"An overactive imagination can fill in the silence today and turn your emotional insecurity into self-acceptance. But just following your train of thoughts isn't enough to bring you lasting satisfaction. It's one thing to enjoy pleasant fantasies as they waft through your awareness, but there's nothing to show for your mental meanderings at the end of the day. Narrowing your focus enables you to develop an inspiration into a concrete plan. Stick with one creative idea as long as you can; perseverance is your ticket to success."
scorpio,2016-05-01,"Life becomes curiouser and curiouser today as you grow restless with the mundane world. It's frustrating because there doesn't seem to be a logical solution in sight to managing your current schedule. Instead of working harder and putting extra effort into your chores, let go of your rational attempts to juggle all your activities. Magically, your intuition is freed once you acknowledge that there's more than meets the eye. Listen to your inner wisdom when it kicks in; thankfully, it will guide you safely back from your trip down the rabbit hole."
sagittarius,2016-05-01,"You're capable of seeing more horizon than most anyone, so it's no surprise when you want to widen the scope on someone else's plan and make it your own. Unfortunately, the larger your vision, the less you can rely on your common sense to fill in the details. Paradoxically, believing in the power of your imagination works to your advantage because reality seems to cooperate with your dreams now. Your passion is the secret ingredient to a successful collaboration."
capricorn,2016-05-01,"You don't like letting go of control, but you might actually feel a sense of relief today if you stop pretending that you're in charge of the whole show. Thankfully, your dreams are magical enough to distract you for a while, even if they're not based on reality. But you don't have to worry about being practical now, as long as you continue to fulfill your commitments to others. Although you may be resistant at first, give yourself a little vacation from the daily stress and allow your imagination to roam."
aquarius,2016-05-01,"A friend may grow confused with your sudden change in attitude, triggering you to feel less sure of yourself. Although you're often comfortable with your emotional detachment, the Moon's shift into compassionate Pisces increases your moodiness and the urgency to resolve a relationship dilemma. Don't bother trying to figure out the dynamics; simply roll with the incoming waves and wait to see where the currents carry you. Choose your next move after your clarity returns and not a moment sooner."
pisces,2016-05-01,"You can surprise your coworkers with your high level of productivity today if you're able to involve your imagination in the process. But frustration could get the best of you if you must perform boring and repetitive tasks that don't leave any room for your creative touch. Happily, there will be plenty of time for more artistic pursuits later. Handle your responsibilities with efficient speed and impress everyone with your competence. Work now, play later."
aries,2016-05-02,"You might believe anything is possible if you put your mind to it today, but you still could run into resistance if you get your hopes too high. Your confidence is usually an asset, but you're not necessarily working with a clear read on reality now. Although the present circumstances may not be very complicated, you're better off if you handle each issue as it arises or it can create problems in the future. Balancing your fantasies with a healthy dose of common sense allows you to regain control of the day."
taurus,2016-05-02,"If everything seems too good to be true today, it probably is. Nevertheless, you might have to work your way through a significant roadblock before you can proceed. Karmic Saturn is waiting to teach you a lesson if you overextend your reach. Fortunately, you will end up in a much better position for another round of growth that's right around the next corner. Your best bet is to keep it simple; amazing things happen when you put your priorities in order."
gemini,2016-05-02,"Running after satisfaction is a complicated endeavor if your partner's desires differ from yours. You may think it's necessary to set aside your dreams in order to win the affection of a loved one today. However, suppressing your emotions isn't a good idea because resentment could rear its ugly head. Let your partner know what's troubling you and exactly what you need to make things right. Absolute honesty is the only path to successful conflict management."
cancer,2016-05-02,"You're driven by your thoughts today, even if you know that your fantasies are out of reach. Unfortunately, you could quickly work yourself into a state of anxiety if you concentrate on what you lack, rather than utilizing what you currently have. However, you gain control over your future when you temporarily set aside unrealistic goals. Instead of wasting time with pie-in-the-sky dreaming, find happiness in each step along the way. As Gandhi wrote, ""Satisfaction lies in the effort, not in the attainment. Full effort is full victory."""
leo,2016-05-02,"Projecting your idealistic hopes on a complex relationship today limits how people can respond to you. This emotional dynamic, in turn, distorts your perception of others. Thankfully, you aren't driven to realign each and every one of your fantasies with the true story. Nevertheless, reconnecting with someone special might bring up an uncomfortable issue, but you will emerge richer in spirit if you face it without putting your expectations in the way of reality."
virgo,2016-05-02,"A simple interaction can morph into an extremely complicated one today; however, the process may unfold very differently than you expect. It's not easy to let go of your personal agenda when you feel as if you have a lot at stake. Nevertheless, the spiritual Pisces Moon's visit to your 7th House of Relationships overwhelms you with the power of compassion. Fortunately, empathizing with someone else's position sets the stage for compromise. Opening your mind to others clears the air and enables everyone to move on with a lighter heart."
libra,2016-05-02,"You are quite hopeful today, raising the bar in love and setting your heart up for disappointment. But you may grow irritated if someone isn't delivering the goods that you desire, especially if you assumed your partner would respond to you in a romantic manner. There is no point in shifting blame to anyone else if your fantasies are not realized; instead, adapt to the new conditions and change your assumptions accordingly. Don't expect to receive anything you're unwilling to give."
scorpio,2016-05-02,"Finding emotional satisfaction is an uphill battle today as your idealistic faith in a relationship leads you to expect the impossible. Nevertheless, the Moon's dance in your romantic 5th House of Fun and Games bring your dreams to life. Unfortunately, everything quickly grows murky if you mix up your facts with fiction. If you're confused, remind yourself that your desires are likely different from what's actually happening. Go ahead and follow your heart; just don't stray too far from reality in the process."
sagittarius,2016-05-02,"You are often restless at work and in love as you imagine greener pastures on the other side of the fence. In fact, you may want to experience some quiet time away from the maddening crowds today. The Moon's presence in your 4th House of Home and Family might not be sufficient to completely take your mind off the greater world of possibilities. Although you like the idea of withdrawing socially now, you are not eager to isolate yourself or alienate others. Happily, acknowledging that your current dilemma may not be immediately resolved enables you to enjoy your day for what it is."
capricorn,2016-05-02,"Letting go of your worldly ambitions sounds easy now, while clinging to them too tightly can create more discouragement than happiness. Fortunately, there's no reason to set new goals yet, and putting them on the back burner for a couple of days could be a smarter move than you think. Give yourself a break from the rat race, especially if it allows you to reconnect with someone on a deeper emotional level. Step back to experience more meaningful pleasures; the real purpose of life is to live it."
aquarius,2016-05-02,"Discerning your daydreams from reality requires more effort now than it's worth. Although everything appears topsy-turvy, doing nothing seems to confuse you even further. The more you struggle to figure out the truth, the more complicated it gets. Suspending your disbelief -- as you do when you're watching a movie -- enables you to turn frustration into magic. Throw away the self-judgment and enjoy playing in the realms of imagination today. You can put everything back into proper perspective tomorrow when you have the time and energy."
pisces,2016-05-02,"Your misinterpretation of events might convince you that you won't get what you want from a relationship today. But this frustrating message from the cosmos may originate from your attitude rather than the actual situation. Paradoxically, practicing patience can transform your current dissatisfaction into a more meaningful kind of love. Don't be in such a hurry; playing the waiting game works in your favor. When the time is right-- and you'll know when it is -- make your move without further hesitation."
aries,2016-05-03,"Your recent hard work might be due for a reward with a larger paycheck or a sweet promotion. Fortuitous Jupiter trines the Sun in your 2nd House of Money, hopefully bringing you the recognition you deserve. But you may face disappointment if you expect good news right away. Although your anticipation level is high, retrograde season could still get the best of you. Don't push your luck too far; instead, just show up with your best possible attitude and see what happens. Thankfully, spontaneity is one of your closest allies."
taurus,2016-05-03,"You can turn new ideas into practical plans quite easily today because your common sense is working overtime. You are often satisfied with maintaining the status quo, but you want to step beyond your regular routine and experience life to the fullest. Thankfully, there's no need to set aside your basic philosophical approach to simple living. It's just that you now possess a wonderful opportunity to build on the foundation of what you already know. Feel free to broaden your horizons while still keeping your feet on the beaten path."
gemini,2016-05-03,"It pays to reach a little farther today while the planets are busy working on your behalf. You're already thinking about the future while the Moon is moving through your 11th House of Long-Term Goals. Meanwhile, the sensible Taurus Sun's harmonious trine to auspicious Jupiter enables you to balance optimism with realism. There is enough cosmic magic to empower you to pursue your dreams. Nevertheless, you still must push past whatever stands between you and success. Believe in yourself and the sky is the limit."
cancer,2016-05-03,"Leaning on your friends and associates for companionship today creates special moments to share your hopes and dreams with them. But don't be overly concerned about falling short of your goals, for jolly Jupiter's trine to the Sun in your 11th House of Groups suggests that social networking is as important as career success. Instead, use this time to strengthen your relationships without any sense of guilt. Ultimately, reestablishing your place amongst your peers enables you to be an integral part of your tribe."
leo,2016-05-03,"Steady growth feels restraining if you want to move at your own pace, which might be faster than everyone else's. However, the Sun's trine to jovial Jupiter in your 2nd House of Income allows you to obtain much-needed resources from your boss and your workmates as you bolt ahead of the pack. There isn't any reason to slow down now; explore new territory without worrying about the usual resistance. Your positive attitude is a little thing that makes a huge difference."
virgo,2016-05-03,"New ideas are flowing into your imagination now, but you must be in the right frame of mind to receive them. You may already be in touch with a variety of alternative plans, but the Sun's trine to philosophical Jupiter in your sign can blast the doors of awareness wide open today. Thankfully, this current growth spurt won't likely feel like hard work or cause you any additional stress. Expanding your thinking is more fun than you might expect."
libra,2016-05-03,"An emotional breakthrough is possible today if you examine your feelings from a broader perspective before the upcoming changes impact your relationships. Letting go of fixed ideas isn't always easy to do, but today's Sun-Jupiter trine may seem like a free ticket to the destination of your choice. Nevertheless, it's still up to you to use it. Take a risk or you might stay stuck in your current situation, wishing that you didn't let this chance pass you by. Think big and then follow through with confidence and persistence."
scorpio,2016-05-03,"Your relationships feed your creativity now, especially if you listen carefully to others as they share their brilliant ideas. However, inspiration doesn't just happen on its own; you must breathe it into life. Put on your thinking cap and be diligent about maximizing your cleverness potential. Once you begin your current masterpiece, stick with it, even if your certainty wavers or your muse slips away. You are closer to success than you realize if only you believe."
sagittarius,2016-05-03,"You may be pleasantly surprised by all the fantastic support you receive at work today. However, assistance arrives in funny ways and you could miss it if you are looking too hard in a different direction. Nevertheless, you have a wonderful opportunity now to improve the quality of your everyday life if you can get past your own resistance to change. The choice is yours; be courageous and let others nurture your current growth. Everything is easier with a little help from your friends."
capricorn,2016-05-03,"The importance of having fun cannot be overstated because you're highly creative today if you're free to play while you work. But there's no reason to impose arbitrary limits on what you can do. Even if you don't reach an unattainable goal now, you will still progress further along your path. Extending yourself as much as you can improves your chances of making the most of the current opportunities. Just be sure to find pleasure in whatever you choose to do. Passion fuels your success."
aquarius,2016-05-03,"Your dreams are a significant source of inspiration, yet you need to exercise a bit of caution today. It's easy to get lost within your own mind, but auspicious Jupiter is so radiant now that you might not even realize if something is amiss. Fortunately, you have the power to direct your thoughts away from outrageous fantasies and turn them into profound visualizations that can change your life for the better. Channel your creativity into your work."
pisces,2016-05-03,"Your recent efforts may come to fruition today, but not necessarily in the ways you expect. You are more content with your life now and might stop to bask in the awareness of a job well done. Be careful or your blind optimism will lead to laziness, since this isn't the time to relax yet. Reveling in your current accomplishments could be counterproductive if they are only part of a larger goal. Don't let the next steps in your progress slip further behind schedule just because you're feeling complacent. Continue to strike while the iron is hot."
aries,2016-05-04,"You may be offered a new deal that emphasizes the extraordinary potential of an unexpected opportunity. You can't rely on previous assumptions since the rules of the game are changing as it's being played. You might think that everything you imagine will unfold according to your plans but overconfidence is not your friend. Nevertheless, acting on your good intentions enables you to learn an important lesson from the obstacles you now face."
taurus,2016-05-04,"You're at another turning point in your life, but everything could seem more significant than it actually is. Although it still may take several months to see real progress on your long-term goals, your current choices are instrumental in setting your new direction. Don't worry if you can't bundle all your desires into one major goal today. Just allow your daydreams to flow without analysis. As Albert Einstein wrote, ""The true sign of intelligence is not knowledge but imagination."""
gemini,2016-05-04,"You're bouncing around from one amazing distraction to another, but you are afraid that others might perceive you as being flighty and unreliable. Unfortunately, your innate restlessness increases if you limit your self-expression by trying to finish every single thing you start. Luckily, you can complete projects soon enough; just enjoy your high spirits now, even if you're secretly worrying that you're just wasting your time and energy. Your passion for life is contagious."
cancer,2016-05-04,"It seems as if someone is pushing you to go faster than your comfort level. Fortunately, you are enthusiastic about the prospects of where your work is leading, even if the current instability triggers a familiar fear of change. Don't let old memories get in the way of new opportunities. Thankfully, you won't need to sacrifice too much security in order to keep up with how quickly your life is progressing. Letting go of the past empowers you to embrace the future."
leo,2016-05-04,"An authority figure may grant you the freedom of choice today. You are being offered a clean start, but you still must take the initiative in order to follow your dreams. The path you choose requires time to manifest, but you are given a chance to set your intentions. Don't wait; take action now. Even if some of the details are not in order yet, you can put the pieces together along the way. Seize the day and don't look back."
virgo,2016-05-04,"You might be uncomfortably aware that something significant is missing from your life. Describing your feelings is challenging now, but you realize that it's time to release your old assumptions about what you can and can't do. You may feel as if you're caught up in a big wave of uncertainty. However, if you try to plant your feet in the ground and resist, you could end up regretting that you missed an opportunity of a lifetime. Trust the process and let go."
libra,2016-05-04,"Excessive drama isn't typically your cup of tea. Nevertheless, someone could rock your world by sharing surprising news, an unusual opportunity or an innovative idea today. However, it's not wise to jump too quickly. Instead, exercising cautious optimism is prudent since anything that enters your life now looks better than it really is. Nevertheless, if you don't jeopardize your current stability, you could find yourself embarking on a major journey."
scorpio,2016-05-04,"Making minor improvements to your lifestyle by introducing new habits into your daily routine can have lasting positive impact. Fortunately, it's easier than you expect to move past old emotional patterns that previously prevented you from taking the next step on your path. However, there's no room for halfway measures today. You know exactly what you must do now, so for the sake of your health don't delay any longer."
sagittarius,2016-05-04,"Although incoming waves of nostalgia remind you to gently let go of the past, you have a rather narrow window of time in which to launch yourself into the future. Luckily, you're not likely to turn down an invitation that courts adventure, so set your sights on a distant galaxy, buckle up and prepare for lift-off. Just don't allow your confidence grow into arrogance because you're still likely to encounter a little turbulence along the way. Enjoy the ride, bumps and all."
capricorn,2016-05-04,"This is your chance to reinvent your life by remembering your personal history and then rewriting your story with a new ending. Creating a different perspective enables you to envision a radically different future. However, your desire to break out of your current rut might stress you out because of the lack of security it will bring. Don't be too hard on yourself if you need more time to put your ducks in order before making your move. It's helpful to revisit the past as long as you remember to focus on the present."
aquarius,2016-05-04,"You can't avoid the realization that your life is gradually transforming, although the pace of events in your personal world seems accelerated today. Even if you're not keeping up with everything, there's no immediate need for worry; at least, the new routine looks like it could be a lot of fun. However, if you experience a glimmer of self-doubt, remember that he who hesitates is lost. Say yes to change and the rest of the puzzle will slowly fall into place."
pisces,2016-05-04,"Expressing a sigh of relief is appropriate today as the pressure to get ahead at work temporarily eases. Just keep in mind that your current phase of expansion isn't over; it's just on a short holiday. In the meantime, continue to move a project along at your own speed by taking a good idea and developing it further. You might be tempted to start immediately, but impulsive actions won't create lasting results. Confucius says, ""The man who moves a mountain begins by carrying away small stones."""
aries,2016-05-05,"You may not even notice how reckless your behavior is today while the self-directed Aries Moon triggers action before thought. You might inadvertently step on someone's toes as warrior Mars aspects reckless Uranus. Unfortunately, your unpremeditated response can lead to trouble if your instinctive reaction is off the mark. Take the time to play out all the alternatives in your mind before hitching your wagon to the best one."
taurus,2016-05-05,"Opening your heart to your unexpressed desires is the healthiest strategy now, but you may find it difficult to distinguish your fickle attractions from what's absolutely critical to your happiness. Making separate lists for your needs and your wishes helps prioritize the possibilities ahead. Sorting through your choices is the first step toward self-empowerment. Taking responsibility for your future enables you to make better decisions in the long run."
gemini,2016-05-05,"You can't stop the unceasing chatter from reaching your ears, even if the words don't offer any viable solutions. Irrepressible Mars is rattling your 7th House of Others, spurring you to initiate controversial conversations by rapidly firing your thoughts into a stream of consciousness. However, the wild emotional waters morph into a gently meandering river later in the day. Your sense of urgency might fade but your convictions remain. There's no reason to procrastinate; never put off until tomorrow what you can do today."
cancer,2016-05-05,"No one will realize how lost you are feeling if you project your strong and silent side today. Your thoughts run around in circles like hamsters on a wheel in pursuit of an invisible reward, making it difficult to decipher the current events. Your natural inclination is to keep your insecurities quiet rather than acknowledging any confusion. Although you're correct to believe you should only share business matters on a need-to-know basis, discussing your fears with a trusted friend can help alleviate your stress."
leo,2016-05-05,"You might go to extreme measures to finish a significant project today, but it appears it will take longer than you first expected. You're tempted to blame someone else for the delay, but the current obstacles are most likely in your path because of you. Listen simultaneously to the wise encouragement and the fearful restraint of the universe. Moderate your pace while you still can solve the problems in front of you."
virgo,2016-05-05,"Instead of needlessly worrying about everything you want to accomplish, you are more interested in simply avoiding stress now. Knock off your biggest tasks early in the day since you could become less motivated after the Moon enters mellow Taurus. Even if you believe that maintaining the status quo makes the most sense, you might just be rationalizing your current resistance to change. Adopting a flexible attitude may lead to a sweet surprise as the day unfolds."
libra,2016-05-05,"You don't appreciate being put on the spot, especially if you're on your own territory. You might choose to display your annoyance today because you can't help but see matters from multiple points of view. Nevertheless, pursuing the course of least resistance is your smartest response for now. Thankfully, you can turn nearly any performance into a successful one. Keep your personal opinions private until you are sure your audience is on the same page."
scorpio,2016-05-05,"You might exhaust your energy today by jumping through the same mental hoops again and again. However, you believe your reaction will work each time you respond in the same manner as before. Unfortunately, you could easily end up wasting limited resources by relying on old linear tactics. You may be happily surprised by the outcome if you adopt a radically different approach now. Taking the road less traveled makes all the difference in the world."
sagittarius,2016-05-05,"It appears as if you're quickly running out of time, so stop dilly-dallying and start to sort things out with a new plan of action. But don't fret if there are still miscellaneous details to uncover. Unfortunately, you might lose your chance by waiting until you have all your ducks in a row. You can fill in more missing pieces over the weeks ahead. Take full advantage of the enterprising Aries Moon before it settles into placid Taurus this afternoon. Welcome the opportunities with open arms while you can."
capricorn,2016-05-05,"You can't rush anything now, even if you want to create something constructive for your future. Luckily, you will intuitively know when the energy is right to make your move. Remember, your mental preparation is a key ingredient in your current enterprise. You're being tested today, so narrow your vision and limit your concentration solely to accomplishing your goals. Monitor your own progress and gently nudge yourself back on track if you're lured off course for any reason. Ambition is your friend."
aquarius,2016-05-05,"Reconnecting with people from your past makes for happy memories in the present. However, you might also waste precious energy doing something that is not critical to your long-term goals. It's wise to rein in any loose ends early on today or you could lose control of your schedule before you know it. Fewer distractions now make it easier to find the personal satisfaction and professional success that you seek."
pisces,2016-05-05,"You're enthusiastic about moving ahead with a collaborative project today. But you're so anxious to get started that you might try to invent something special on your own. Thankfully, you may receive kudos for your current efforts and gain enough recognition to make your new venture worthwhile. However, it's still crucial to exercise caution because you could become so enamored with your performance that you forget others can make important contributions, too. The synergy of working together is a winning formula for success."
aries,2016-05-06,"Rather than impulsively modifying your direction to increase your chances of success, apply the stabilizing potential of today's earthy Taurus New Moon in your 2nd House of Self-Worth. There's no need to change your destination if you believe in yourself, for altering your plans only distracts you from what you need to be doing now. Instead, rethink your strategy and then reallocate your resources so you can gain efficiency on your current journey. As Gandhi said, ""Action expresses priorities."""
taurus,2016-05-06,"A convergence of unrelated circumstances requires you to decide what comes next in your life. But don't limit your options by focusing on a recent setback; wipe the slate clean so you aren't constricted by yesterday's plans. The Taurus New Moon activates your 1st House of Self, enabling you to express a higher level of self-determination over the weeks ahead if you are willing to make a decision today. However, choosing which road to take at this junction isn't enough; you must also commit to giving one hundred percent until you accomplish your goal."
gemini,2016-05-06,"An apparently trivial choice made today could have profound consequences that are not yet obvious. In fact, every move you make may be more important in the long run than you realize because the Taurus New Moon galvanizes your 12th House of Destiny. Although you're tempted to keep everything light and easy, it's wiser to stop and contemplate the ramifications of your actions before going too far. If you're unsure of your direction, refrain from making any changes until you gain clarity. Doing nothing at all is better than doing something you quickly regret."
cancer,2016-05-06,"Although you might not be able to avoid your responsibilities, you don't need to waste time micromanaging a project at work today. Instead, acknowledge the Taurus New Moon's impact on your 11th House of Long-Term Goals by leaving time in your day to plan for your future. Don't be afraid to be bold in your thinking, for your current ideas are more pragmatic than you realize. As Theodore Roosevelt said, ""Keep your eyes on the stars and your feet on the ground."""
leo,2016-05-06,"A methodical approach to managing your resources enables you to advance at work rather than getting caught up in idealistic dreams. The Taurus New Moon empowers your 10th House of Career, inspiring you to successfully accomplish a project that you begin today. Even if you don't actually initiate action on a new venture now, at least evaluate your options and devise a strategy that will carry you forward. Without a well-considered plan, a goal is simply an idle wish."
virgo,2016-05-06,"If you're contemplating enrolling in a program to expand your career horizons, the Taurus New Moon's presence in your 9th House of Higher Education could nudge you further along that line of thinking. However, if your idea of personal growth doesn't involve the classroom, you might consider taking a working vacation that allows you to travel and widen your perspective in other ways. An open mind allows you to explore the world with open eyes."
libra,2016-05-06,"You derive great meaning from relationships of all types. However, you're currently attracted to interactions that lead you into unexplored interpersonal realms as the Taurus New Moon emphasizes your 8th House of Deep Sharing. Although the cosmos is reminding you that a joint venture might offer more advantages than going off on your own, there are pros and cons to giving up your autonomy. Nevertheless, the right partner could offer the ways and means for you to reach your goal. Making a smart alliance now is certainly in your best interest as long as your intentions are noble."
scorpio,2016-05-06,Letting go of a hurtful memory enables you to see beyond your previously limited point of view. You have an opportunity to redefine your frame of reference if you're willing to reveal your vulnerability to someone trustworthy. Your emotional IQ is boosted by your common sense as the earthy Taurus New Moon mobilizes your 7th House of Relationships. It doesn't matter what your plans are for the future; you can still benefit from a mutually supportive friendship if you set aside your fears and entertain the possibilities of a solid connection.
sagittarius,2016-05-06,"You're ready to say yes to a new project today but only if it meets your particular conditions. Rather than being motivated by high ideals, the Taurus New Moon's occurrence in your 6th House of Work reflects a more pragmatic approach to your job. It's not that you lack vision; it's just that you're more concerned now with completing one task before beginning something else. Keep it simple until you can see how much time you need to allocate to your previous commitments."
capricorn,2016-05-06,"You are entering a highly creative phase where the possibilities are only limited by what you believe. Although the Taurus New Moon falls in your 5th House of Spontaneity, several retrograde planets suggest you could be in for some trouble if you impulsively run off in an entirely new direction. However, it makes sense to push ahead on a project as long as you are harnessing enthusiasm that has been building for some time. Change the plan and not the goal."
aquarius,2016-05-06,"It's time to set a stake in the ground that can be used as a cornerstone for the foundation you are busy constructing. Although there will be a fair share of obstacles ahead, creating consistency in your life is crucial now as the Taurus New Moon feeds your 4th House of Security. Ultimately, building on what you have already gained is possible as long as you feel emotionally safe. However, your future will be more uncertain if you are anxious about your present vulnerability. Stability is more important to success than brilliance when push comes to shove."
pisces,2016-05-06,"Although you may be an idealist by nature, it's time to temporarily put your dreams away and face the music in the mundane world. The uncomplicated Taurus New Moon fuels your 3rd House of Communication, encouraging you to stick to the basic facts in all interactions. Demand the simple truth now and give people the same in return. But don't worry about your current lack of imagination; it will return on its own accord. Oddly enough, you can experience a satisfying peace of mind when you accept reality as it is."
aries,2016-05-07,"You're invincible now, or so you think, believing that your skills enable you to overcome nearly any obstacle that comes between you and your goals. Nevertheless, you must process a darker energy today as you wrestle with the temptation to place your needs before everyone else's. Selfish actions could backfire on you if you strive excessively for too much personal satisfaction at the expense of others. Using your superpowers for the greater good brings happiness to all."
taurus,2016-05-07,"Moving your energy -- both physically and emotionally -- is just what the doctor ordered. Make a commitment to propel yourself into motion if you feel stuck today. You might be highly motivated, yet still unsure how to find the right path. Although your strategy could be incomplete, don't wait until you figure it out. Shift into first gear; once you're making progress, the details will fall into place without much effort on your part."
gemini,2016-05-07,"Even those people who usually admire your cool and casual style want more depth and intensity from you now. This magnetic attraction to a deeper experience comes at a perfect time, since you're bored with clever one-liners and shallow connections. You're captivated by powerful Pluto and won't be distracted from the real magic that's behind the curtain. Luckily, others come to your aid because their needs match yours. Engaging in a collaborative process today enables you to cultivate an insightful perspective."
cancer,2016-05-07,"Although a major crisis continues to brew beneath the surface, you're certain about the actions you need to take now. High drama reaches a breaking point today as the evocative Moon tensely opposes combative Mars. Even if you decide to keep some of your feelings to yourself, it's still wise to exert your will while you have the chance to create positive change. Thankfully, you don't need to play all your cards in order to have a winning hand."
leo,2016-05-07,"Reaching a decision today is more complicated than you expect, for one solution doesn't address the wide array of needs that are now being expressed. Someone might request your emotional support, but you're tempted to decline in an effort to handle your own affairs. Just be certain you are acting for the greater good of all involved when establishing your priorities. Although extra effort is necessary on your part, you have the ingenuity and determination to come up with the answers."
virgo,2016-05-07,"You possess an unrelenting desire to make deeply-rooted changes in your life now. However, your current interest has little to do with your regular daily routine. Instead, you are passionate about redirecting your entire trajectory, including transforming your personal needs and those of others in your immediate environment. But don't act unilaterally today. Taking everyone's feelings into consideration will produce the most profound changes."
libra,2016-05-07,"Something can happen that suddenly alters the direction of the path you're on. Your epiphany may not be a total life-changer, but your newfound awareness opens the possibility to make a serious shift that you've been putting off for too long. However, minimizing your experience invites unwanted surprises. You will run into less resistance if you act authentically with the very same level of intensity that you're feeling now. As Galileo wrote, ""Passion is the genesis of genius."""
scorpio,2016-05-07,"Although you might encounter obstacles created by other people's fears or even your own secretive nature, you can clear the way of negativity now. The radiant Sun harmonizes with your key planet Pluto today, revealing an easier path to express your innermost thoughts and feelings. Be fierce; relentlessly focus on the truth while opening your heart as wide as possible. You may be pleasantly surprised where this emotional journey takes you. Stay patient and trust the process."
sagittarius,2016-05-07,"You dream of soaring unrestrained through the galaxy at warp speed. However, your more cautious side is still worrying about what you might need to leave behind now. Your current sentimentality isn't your typical reaction, but it's a good idea to give full power to any feelings of uncertainty you may be experiencing. The sooner you acknowledge your fear, the faster you can resume your cosmic adventure. However, believing in yourself is required before the booster rockets fire."
capricorn,2016-05-07,"A battle within overflows into the outer world today, whether or not you're ready for the extra drama. You're confronted by other people's feelings and you begin to see how they might alter your direction. Reconsider your plans once again as an homage to Mercury retrograde; this time include the feedback you receive in your new strategy. Not only will you gain the respect of those who matter, you'll also be able to make fundamental changes that move you closer to your goals."
aquarius,2016-05-07,"Your current dilemma involves the pull between wanting to be spontaneous and the need to withhold your feelings. You want to say exactly what's on your mind today, but might worry that you could offend someone if you speak the truth. Ultimately, you're driven toward self-expression, but not without first experiencing a fair share of stress. Your best friends want the real you, not a watered-down version that is diluted to maintain social acceptance. Follow your heart and don't look back."
pisces,2016-05-07,"You are swimming in very wild waters now -- waters so deep that sunlight can't reach you. The bright colors have faded into darker shades of gray. But don't get distracted by the otherworldly nature; it comes along with the territory. You have powerful work to do, so face your fears and shine your inner light into the darkness. Slowly return to the surface only when you are ready to reengage. Happily, your friends will be waiting for you with open arms."
aries,2016-05-08,"Your spontaneity can work against you when you rush off to the next activity before you finish the current one. Fortunately, you understand the advantage of moving methodically today and you're able to see a task through to the end. Nevertheless, your restlessness is still a problem if the pace falls behind your expectations. Demonstrate your maturity by accepting delays as part of the process. Personal satisfaction will be your reward if you stick with the job at hand, even if you would prefer to be doing something new."
taurus,2016-05-08,You're in touch with the strength of your own convictions today and are positive you can handle anything that might test your resolve. But feeling confident isn't enough to guarantee your success; you must be willing to reconsider your basic assumptions even if it means going back to the drawing board. Restarting a project now allows you to build a more solid foundation that can support whatever comes next. Make your move before this window of opportunity closes or you may regret it later on.
gemini,2016-05-08,"You might believe that it's more efficient to limit interpersonal communication to the safe realms of rational thinking while steering clear of illogical emotions. However, it's difficult to hide your feelings now that the moody Moon is back in your sign. But taking an objective approach won't enable you to cleverly charm your way around the hot spots in your path. Slow down and review a full range of alternative strategies before choosing a course of action. Ask your heart to point you in the right direction."
cancer,2016-05-08,"You are silly one moment yet serious the next as you remember some of the profound emotional transitions you've experienced over the last few years. You're finally ready to move on, but still may be overly sensitive to your past if there are leftover feelings weighing heavily on your heart. Revisiting childhood memories unlocks the key to resolving an old issue. Reframing your own history in a healthier light frees you to do something brilliant in the present moment."
leo,2016-05-08,"Interpersonal interactions could run into a few unexpected snags today. A recent disappointment might seem like a big deal, but Mercury retrograde in your 10th House of Public Life tells a slightly different story. You are being given time to review the details that led to the present predicament and to examine how the blockages are symbolic of your own feelings now. Awareness is power; once you fully understand your role in creating the current drama you can steadily push on through to the other side."
virgo,2016-05-08,"It seems as if the public spotlight has found you now, but you might prefer to hide from view, anyhow. You're more likely to withdraw socially in order to manage your new responsibilities. If control issues are part of your problem you may try to proceed as a solo act, but your ambitious strategy could backfire today. Acknowledge that you need to be a part of a larger group, tribe or family. You don't have to do everything on your own; a sense of community is integral to your success."
libra,2016-05-08,"You take your philosophy of life quite seriously now and may need to make choices that put you in an emotionally vulnerable position. Although there are many beautiful people in your life, you might wish that they would join you on your spiritual quest. However, there's nothing wrong with having lots of acquaintances as long as you don't let your fears stand in the way of transforming a casual relationship into something more meaningful. Live by the Golden Rule and be the kind of friend you wish you had."
scorpio,2016-05-08,"You don't know whether to tell someone how you feel or let your concerns pass without saying anything at all. It's useful to examine what your past patterns have to do with your current eagerness to help others -- even if they haven't asked for it. Compassion is a lovely gift, but codependency is not a viable path to happiness. Your job isn't to fix anyone else; just work on being the best possible version of you."
sagittarius,2016-05-08,"Stand up and spread your wings; it's time to claim your power. However, if you find yourself entangled in an unexpected struggle for control now, step back and take responsibility only for what is yours. You don't have to win an argument today because the price can be too great. Turn a challenge into an opportunity to learn something about yourself as you handle the resistance with courage and grace."
capricorn,2016-05-08,"The weekend brings relaxation for many people, but not so much for you ambitious Goats. You are buzzing like a worker bee with the Moon's presence in your 6th House of Service. There are just too many separate things that demand your attention around the hive today. It might even feel like a day of judgment and, of course, you want it called in your favor. Apply yourself diligently but avoid self-criticism. Continue to work as hard as possible while remembering that you're in it for the long haul. Rome wasn't built in a day."
aquarius,2016-05-08,"It might appear as if your relationship life is improving, but you're still fearful of losing control and crashing into a wall. Try not to doubt your ability to succeed if you must clean up a mess that originated from a simple miscommunication. An unnecessary conflict with a loved one can gobble up valuable time if you take it as a sign of defeat. But you should be able to accomplish whatever is necessary once you realize that the current events are clues about the work you have yet to do when it comes to love."
pisces,2016-05-08,"This weekend is optimal for cooling off your emotions and reevaluating what you want from your closest relationships. You may be more analytical than usual now and less emotionally attached to the outcome. It's not that you are ready to throw in the towel; it's just that you're able to see the futility of trying to change someone else's feelings. The only thing you can control is the honesty of your own response which, hopefully, inspires others to follow your example."
aries,2016-05-09,"Your feelings are intrinsically connected with the central purpose in your life and you can impact others deeply now as long as you stay true to yourself. However, people won't necessarily agree with your position even if you're willing to discuss your differences. In fact, you could be so in tune with your intentions today that there's no need to talk about it any further once you share your perspective. Your disclosure is like planting a seed that requires time to germinate without additional interference. Water your garden and watch it grow."
taurus,2016-05-09,"You're quite animated today, but people may not fully understand your intensity. In your eagerness to make your point you could oversimplify your presentation, which can create problems if others take your words at face value. Be careful, since a small misunderstanding about a missing fact might turn a simple discussion upside down. Let the conversation flow organically and don't try to push the process. It's much easier to prevent the conflict beforehand than to untangle it once it begins."
gemini,2016-05-09,"In theory, you should be unbeatable today when your words align with your intentions. However, conversations grow complicated if your message is garbled as interactive Mercury disappears into the Sun's intense radiance. You could be thinking clearly, but your thoughts are highly subjective now that the Moon is activating your sign. It's admirable to have faith in your convictions but don't try to use logic to convince anyone else of the validity of your point of view. Focus on your creative pursuits and let others draw their own conclusions when they're ready."
cancer,2016-05-09,"You are swimming in deeper waters these days and possess an opportunity to enrich your relationships if you have the courage to sink into the emotional depths. Paradoxically, your life might feel one dimensional now as the retrograde Mercury-Sun conjunction grinds your thoughts to a temporary standstill. It's futile to rely on your brain to figure out the dynamics of passion. Your friends may want to drag you into their dramas; however, the call is yours. Don't join in unless you think you can make a positive difference."
leo,2016-05-09,"You're still trying to find a comfortable middle ground before you make a difficult decision, but it's tough if there are important emotional issues at stake. Your brain overflows with sensible ideas while the Sun aligns with cerebral Mercury today, prompting you to initiate action immediately. Trust your logic instead of waiting to receive approval from anyone else. Sometimes your head knows what your heart has yet to learn."
virgo,2016-05-09,"You may be fantasizing about an exotic adventure that will take you far from the mundane world. Pulling out all the stops in your imagination enables you to dream about your future without holding back. Visualize buying an airline ticket and heading off into the great wide open with a carefree heart. It might be challenging to transform your thoughts into reality now, but anything is possible as long as you keep the faith and take your journey one step at a time."
libra,2016-05-09,"Push past your tendency to keep everything light and easy. Creative juices are flowing in your imagination today, yet you must be willing to embark on a quest to get the rewards. You want to do what's right, but you might be challenged to figure out exactly what that means. Although it's fine to discuss your plans with someone you trust, saying too much now could disperse the energy prematurely. Share your ideas but only on a need to know basis; this time around less turns out to be better than more."
scorpio,2016-05-09,"You might catch glimpses of the mysteries that are usually unreachable and unknowable while the doors to other dimensions are unlocked today. However, it's likely that someone will ruffle your feathers by attempting to pull you into the mundane world. Fortunately, you are the captain of your own ship. Stand up for your rights, but don't back yourself into a corner in the process. Start from the assumption that others have your best interests at heart and work for a swift resolution. Don't waste time with trivial pursuits when you hold the keys to the cosmos."
sagittarius,2016-05-09,"It's back to the daily grind for you today. You may prefer daydreaming about an upcoming trip, escaping into an adventure novel or getting lost in a good movie, but there are important things that you must do, instead. Unfortunately, your work prevents you from broadening your horizons and moving beyond your immediate obligations now. But don't just chain yourself to the desk; as a compromise, step outside and get some fresh air if you need to clear your head first."
capricorn,2016-05-09,"Someone may be trying to emotionally manipulate you, but it's nearly impossible to tell who is behind this alleged plot. Thankfully, you might find a reward that you weren't even looking for now if you're willing to let go of control and just paddle along with the flow. The pleasant surprise for everyone is what happens when you become more spontaneous in your behavior. Don't bother looking for instructions today; just listen to your inner voice and do what comes naturally."
aquarius,2016-05-09,You could be called upon to perform some kind of care taking duties for someone close to you. Perhaps a family member or an elderly neighbor is in need of your support. Don't shut anyone out even if you think you are incapable of offering assistance today. Keep the communication channels wide open so everyone still feels connected. Explore both the personal and humanitarian aspects of your life to restore a healthy balance to your world.
pisces,2016-05-09,"Previous uncertainty transforms into a practical vision of how you want your future to play out, and you are ready to make a serious effort to manifest it according to your plan. But the signs of change could pass unnoticed if you're not paying close attention. Unfortunately, your desire to reach your destination may not be enough to guarantee success. Consider relaxing your timetable or revising your itinerary. Flexibility is your secret weapon; don't be afraid to use it."
aries,2016-05-10,Standing right on the edge of familiarity with one foot in new territory is oddly reassuring for you pioneering Rams. You are in love with the idea of doing something for the first time and are ready to expand your agenda at work now. An exciting venture captures your attention and you're feeling optimistic about the future. Be as adventurous as you wish. Step outside of your self-created constraints of negativity and reach for the stars.
taurus,2016-05-10,"The simple act of experiencing pleasure takes on magical proportions today and makes you feel like all is well in the world. You might see loveliness everywhere you go while your key planet Venus receives a nod of approval from lucky Jupiter, filling you with a sense of contentment. But be on guard, for the temptation of laziness often lurks nearby when times are sweet. Do whatever it takes to overcome the inertia of inaction because opportunities are knocking loudly at your door and you're the only one who can answer."
gemini,2016-05-10,"Everyone you encounter seems to offer the possibility of a good time today. Thankfully, there is an easy flow of energy between you and your coworkers, but you also want to play a major part in any social activities that are brewing. If nothing exciting is on your calendar, then create an event by inviting a few friends to lunch. Try to start your celebration early before your mood shifts later in the afternoon. By nightfall, your easygoing attitude may transform into a desire for more intense emotional communication. Acknowledging your changeability is key to your happiness."
cancer,2016-05-10,"Your nurturing magic is meant for more than just taking care of everyone else today, even if you're only rewarded for being extra sweet on the job. Take responsibility for your own emotional needs by spending time with a loved one. Going out with a close friend or sharing a romantic meal with a partner might be just what you need to reignite the flame of intimacy in a relationship. If nothing else, at least treat yourself to something special. Being nice to yourself is a signal to the rest of the world to do the same."
leo,2016-05-10,"You feel as if you're on center stage, ready to give a million-dollar performance. Happily, the combination of your talent and enthusiasm is appreciated by your friends. In fact, they like you enough to applaud and ask for more, whether or not you're up for doing an encore. Although the positive feedback energizes you, it's absolutely critical to know when to stop. If you push the envelope too far, you could ruin a magical moment. Leaving your audience wanting more is the mark of a true entertainer."
virgo,2016-05-10,"Taking care of unfinished business sounds like a necessary task today, but you may grow restless while trying to follow through with your plans. Your intentions are honorable, but distractions abound and it's tempting now to pick a path that leads to fleeting pleasure instead of a sense of accomplishment. Sharing your heart with a friend can spark a delightful dialogue, but you might regret your decision if you don't also meet your obligations at work."
libra,2016-05-10,"Your trajectory is on the rise now that charming Venus trines propitious Jupiter, triggering the reflective Moon in your 10th House of Career. It's time to receive recognition from your peers -- and maybe even a raise from your boss. No matter what happens, keep your heart open to generous Jupiter's good fortune. Just don't forget about your duties and obligations as you pursue the next alluring experience. If you handle practical matters first, you can continue to work and play with great success."
scorpio,2016-05-10,"You might not have to try very hard for recognition, money or romance to beat a path to your door today. Of course, it's helpful if you're enjoying your work because your ongoing attachment to your daily routine is what pays the bills and feeds your heart. If you no longer gain pleasure from your current regimen now, figure out a way to bring the missing magic back into your life. Do what you love and the rewards will follow."
sagittarius,2016-05-10,"Your fiery charisma attracts professional opportunities today, but could also court pleasure as beautiful Venus harmonizes with buoyant Jupiter. Romance may find you, even if you're not looking now. Consciously give yourself permission to expect more without worrying about possible failure. If a love interest doesn't work out successfully, then seek other ways to express your creativity. But don't let your enthusiasm run amok, for indulgent behavior can land you in a heap of trouble. Moderation is the secret to your sweet success."
capricorn,2016-05-10,"Although today is a workday for many, you're more interested in searching for enjoyment now than anything else. You might discover fascinating ideas that motivate you to reconsider your priorities. You are genuinely more affectionate as you express your appreciation to others. It's okay to break the rules and indulge in something outrageous simply for the pleasure it brings. You can put yourself back on the straight and narrow path tomorrow after you've had your share of fun."
aquarius,2016-05-10,"You are busy reevaluating your list of the necessary ingredients for personal fulfillment at work. After much contemplation, you're ready to try again now that you're back on top of your game. However wonderful everything seems today, don't fret if you end up having to try one more time. Don't fake confidence if you're unsure of your destination. Expressing your vulnerability increases your lovability while also improving your chances of happiness."
pisces,2016-05-10,"Blue skies and endless horizons tempt you to believe that everything is blissful today; however, your optimistic conclusions might lure you down a dangerous path. Honor your concerns instead of just glossing over them on your search for the next priceless treasure. Be wise and examine the pitfalls of pursuing pleasure over choosing the responsible route. Fortunately, amazing experiences are yours for the asking as long as you maintain your balance in the real world."
aries,2016-05-11,"You may feel as if you're not getting enough sleep these days but you're probably still raring to go. The Moon's early morning square to electric Uranus wires your nervous system today, but your body might not be so quick to follow your brain. You could push yourself too hard now, so watch your physical energy level for signs of exhaustion before piling more on your busy schedule. Set priorities and focus on one thing at a time so you have something positive to show for your efforts at the end of the day."
taurus,2016-05-11,"You continue to wait for the best moment to express something that's been on your mind. Your current frustration might provoke you to start a difficult conversation now even if the timing isn't ideal. However, people will lose interest if you allow your words to wander aimlessly. Keep your message short and sweet. Reassure everyone that you aren't looking for a fast answer; you simply want to be heard and acknowledged. Sometimes a little appreciation from a coworker is all you need to lift your spirits."
gemini,2016-05-11,"Starting a new project requires laying the groundwork, yet you don't seem able to move beyond the preparation stage. There are so many choices in front of you now that it's nearly impossible to pick just one mission. In fact, you thought your plan was infallible until you began to reconsider all the unexplored options. In order to narrow your field of vision, rein in your ambitions for the next few weeks and then reevaluate your long-term goals. Focusing on your immediate needs positively impacts your future."
cancer,2016-05-11,"Your thoughts may double back on themselves today, making you doubt your recent decisions. The reflective Moon forms several uncomfortable aspects while finishing up her monthly visit to your cautious sign. You prefer to contain your emotions now, and even people close to you might not realize the magnitude of your unsettled moods. Nevertheless, avoiding your truth isn't healthy in the long run. If you decide to keep your feelings private, at least stay conscious of them. Exercising self-awareness is the key to thriving rather than just surviving."
leo,2016-05-11,"Someone at work might place unspoken demands on you today and you're unsure of the best way to respond. You know that you are clever enough to dance around the edge of the unknown, but you quickly realize that your logic won't help you regain control of your day. Attempting to guess the motives of others only brings frustration now. Practicing the fine art of emotional detachment helps to alleviate the current pressure. Be courageous and initiate an honest dialogue if you want to know the truth."
virgo,2016-05-11,"You aren't sure how to establish new objectives at work today because you're being pulled in two different directions at once. Furthermore, separating the useful information from those facts that only support your position can be a challenging endeavor. Evaluating all your choices is a daunting task if you believe a long-term decision is required now. Thankfully, you have more time than you realize to sort out your next move. Slow down and smell the flowers while you have the chance."
libra,2016-05-11,"You like the idea of picking up the pace, but reality might be more of an obstacle course than a race track. You're missing the bounce to your step as Saturn pesters your ruling planet Venus, giving you one reason after another why you still must wait for the green light. Nevertheless, it's still beneficial to dream about your ideal future without worrying about whether or not it's actually possible. Today's fantasies can grow into tomorrow's reality with a little luck and a lot of work."
scorpio,2016-05-11,"Other people's expectations may conflict with your personal needs today. Unfortunately, you could become disillusioned if you don't see a simple way to get your basic needs met. Denial is not an option; your unconscious desires will only grow in volume if you don't monitor your feelings as they develop. Naturally, digging deep is a significant part of being a passionate Scorpio. Thankfully, stepping into the shadows to explore emotional issues from a logical perspective produces positive results."
sagittarius,2016-05-11,"Staying serious throughout the day challenges you high-spirited Archers, even if there are important obligations to fulfill. Nevertheless, it seems as if your best of intentions are not enough to keep you on the straight and narrow track. Although stern Saturn is quite demanding as it slowly moves through your sign, pleasure-seeking Venus is currently playing her own game of fortune. Stop fighting the inevitable; instead of limiting your activities to the material world, let go for a while and see where the cosmic detours take you."
capricorn,2016-05-11,"People seem extra needy today, amplifying your anxiety and prompting you to protect yourself from unnecessary emotional entanglements. The Moon is finishing up her monthly business in your 7th House of Others today, highlighting how you respond in a relationship rather than what you might do on your own. Unfortunately, everything could quickly grow more complicated if you attempt to take the lead now. Love is more interesting if you're willing to step out of the spotlight for a while and play a supporting role, instead."
aquarius,2016-05-11,"You may consider staying home today, even if your real-world responsibilities are calling. Your friends and coworkers might assume that your current desire for solitude is a sign that something's wrong, but they couldn't be further off target. Taking time for personal matters is a powerful way to get in touch with beautiful Venus in your 4th House of Roots. Don't worry about what others think; your emotional security is the foundation of your future growth."
pisces,2016-05-11,"Awkward planetary positions distract you from meeting your commitments today. You are likely to aspire to ambitious goals since Saturn is holding ground for an extended stay in your 10th House of Status; however, opportunities for play outweigh the rewards for hard work as the day progresses. It's smarter now to set aside your previous plans and simply make up new ones as you go along. Spontaneous bursts of creativity and random acts of compassion bring more joy into your life than anything else."
aries,2016-05-12,"You are motivated to say exactly what's on your mind now. However, you must pick your topics of discussion carefully because your words might stir up more controversy than you wish. You won't be satisfied to tow the party line today, yet you still appear to have ideas that are intelligent and sensible. Be clear and stick to the point; others will listen to you even if they don't agree with your opinion. Keep all communication channels open to maximize positive growth."
taurus,2016-05-12,"Although sometimes you may be accused of avoiding the toughest questions, no such possibility exists now. You're eager to discover more meaning and you want others to follow your lead today. But even if everyone understands what brings you closer to your truth, it could lure them further away from theirs. Don't expect people to endorse your ideas by joining your cause; just make certain that it's valid for you before you act on your beliefs. Seek answers from within."
gemini,2016-05-12,You are averse to making a major decision today and yet you know what your preference would be if you were forced to share it. Don't let anyone coerce you into talking before you are fully ready or you might end up resenting whoever tries to control the situation. A kind word and a smile are enough to keep the peace for now. How much to reveal and when to reveal it is solely your choice alone.
cancer,2016-05-12,"You aren't necessarily feeling as lighthearted as you appear today, but others won't realize it unless they push you to say something you don't actually believe. Fortunately, your support is not up for grabs to the highest bidder. In fact, you might not be willing to acquiesce to someone else's expectations right now; you just want to continue doing the best job you can without making any further promises about the future. Sometimes pulling into your shell is the best defense."
leo,2016-05-12,"An innocent conversation could take an unexpected turn and lead you into the shadows today, where you can see previously hidden areas of your consciousness. New ideas rise into awareness, inspiring you to do something about them; nevertheless, it might be wiser to simply observe your feelings now while waiting to act until a later time. Keep in mind that your decision to remain silent adds to your current air of mystery, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Exploring your dreams is more productive on your own."
virgo,2016-05-12,"You sound quite opinionated about many subjects today, yet you might not be all that interested in sharing your most personal feelings. It's not that you are emotionally detached from your words; it's just this is more of an intellectual exercise now than something of integral importance to you. But you still could get caught up in needing to be right while Mercury is occupying your 9th House of Higher Truth. Nevertheless, backing down from an indefensible position is a true sign of wisdom."
libra,2016-05-12,"There is a sharp edge to your tongue today as incisive Mercury forms a smooth connection with suspicious Pluto. Your words can cut to the bone and your message could inadvertently do damage before you even realize what happened. It's one thing to take a swipe at an opponent intentionally; however, it doesn't feel good if you accidentally hurt a friend. Thankfully, taking a compassionate approach right from the start enables you to spread love and light rather than fear and darkness."
scorpio,2016-05-12,"You long for some quality downtime today because you've been running on overdrive for a while. Although the pace has begun to wear on your nerves, you are able to rejuvenate your energy by keeping your emotions private. There's no need to tell all your secrets, even if you are feeling extroverted now. Don't give away too much of your time; you gain more power by taking care of yourself. Clear your schedule to recharge your batteries and regenerate your vitality before it's too late."
sagittarius,2016-05-12,"It's time to undertake a project that requires a serious amount of mental fortitude since you have the skills to concentrate until the job is done. Luckily, your ability to muster support from friends makes everything run smoother now. Although the potential for fun is always looming near the horizon, don't be distracted until you accomplish something tangible. Dig in your heels and complete as much work as you can today. Determination is your friend."
capricorn,2016-05-12,"You feel as if you have been on an emotional roller coaster and it may finally be time to end the ride today. But you must be creative in your approach when you stand up to those who complicate your life with their expectations. Don't blame anyone else for your extreme emotions now; if you do, you'll just go around again and again in the same conversation. Instead, accept responsibility for your part in the recent drama and be ready to move on once and for all."
aquarius,2016-05-12,"You may be surprised by the intensity of your own feelings now that relentless Pluto trines Mercury in your 4th House of Roots. You assume that you understand the current situation only to discover that everything isn't as you believed. Fortunately, you can think on your feet and are quite capable of quickly regaining your balance when a surprise comes your way. But don't dwell on the past; once things are stable again, let go of any residual negativity you might be carrying for no reason. Creativity abounds when you stay in the present moment."
pisces,2016-05-12,"Rather than looking for comfort from the members of your tribe, you're more interested in having them infuse more meaning into your life. There's a part of you that won't be satisfied until you've turned your support network on its ear now that Mercury is pushing Pluto's buttons in your 11th House of Friends. But most people might not be proactive enough for you until you do something radical that catches them off balance. Fortunately, once you shine your light, others will be more likely to follow."
aries,2016-05-13,"A whole new level of reality is available if you tune into the previously unseen world that exists beyond the obvious distractions. Although you may be itching to move on to your next experience, you'll miss the magic if you acquiesce to the latest flashy temptation. Don't let the noise lure you away from your heart. Even if you are fearful of what you may discover, pushing through your uncertainty brings love closer to you now. The only way you can find peace is by facing the truth."
taurus,2016-05-13,"You are not satisfied with a simple solution to your unfulfilled needs. You want more now and are willing to run an obstacle course for your reward. Ironically, your non-negotiable desires, coupled with your unflappable determination, could actually lead you to the goodies you seek if you know when to ease up on the gas. Unfortunately, placing too much pressure on someone might stir up a hornet's nest instead of creating a love nest. Surprisingly, expressing your feelings in a flexible and gentle manner offers the best chance for finding happiness."
gemini,2016-05-13,"You have a rare opportunity to deepen a relationship now by using your wit and charm. But employing humor to sidestep your inconvenient feelings will only add anxiety to the day. The key to your satisfaction is making people more comfortable with the emotional intensity. Nevertheless, it's a tricky balancing act; if you are too easygoing, you might lose the potential potency of the moment. However, holding firmly to your agenda while modifying your approach could be an unbeatable combination."
cancer,2016-05-13,"Bringing your feelings into the discussion at the right time leads to a successful power play at work while earning you a new wave of respect. Nevertheless, you must tread lightly because your friends and allies might resist your plan if you arouse their anger. Unfortunately, you may end up wasting valuable resources dealing with an unnecessary drama if you push your luck. Thankfully, sharing control is not as complicated as it sounds and is a great way to strengthen your support network."
leo,2016-05-13,"Playful flirting can suddenly turn serious today, so don't send out the invitation unless you are ready to give one hundred percent to your romantic gestures. On the other hand, revitalizing a long-term relationship might be more rewarding than starting up a new one. Just exercise caution; you won't be able to cool the passion down as quickly as you fired it up if the feelings grow hot. It's fantastic if both of you are on the same page, but don't trifle with anyone's heart if you're not."
virgo,2016-05-13,"Unexpressed feelings intensify relationships in unforeseeable ways today. You might try to avoid the uncertainty of emotional conflict, but the outcome could be more fruitful than you expect. A power struggle may come out of nowhere, especially if family memories are triggered by current circumstances. Keep in mind that your fears are more problematic than what's actually occurring now. Taking a risk and sharing your concerns with someone special can result in a memorable experience."
libra,2016-05-13,"A casual interaction with a coworker can be enough to lift your spirits now. Potent Pluto and your key planet Venus join in a marriage between power and beauty today, emphasizing the best parts of any type of relationship. Unfortunately, lasting pleasure won't come without sincere intentions and hard work; desire is simply not enough. Be brave and reveal your feelings to start the ball rolling in the right direction. Opening your heart inspires others to do the same."
scorpio,2016-05-13,"Disclosing your feelings is less of a struggle now if you acquiesce and go along for an emotional ride, no matter where it takes you. Your key planet Pluto is on the receiving end of a delectable kiss from romantic Venus, motivating you to take a nominal risk in love without being overly attached to the outcome. However, everyone seems to be concentrating on a different agenda. Rise to the occasion by shifting your focus from personal satisfaction to global compassion. Choosing the high road expands your heart."
sagittarius,2016-05-13,"You are graced with a natural ability to shine your love light into the darkness, creating a more meaningful experience without appearing overly serious. Still, there are weighty matters on your mind and you should take them to heart today. Luckily, your thoughtful actions now will begin to resolve the emotional tensions that have plagued the past few weeks. Adopting an I-can-do-it attitude is the first step toward lightening your load."
capricorn,2016-05-13,"Although passionate feelings about your relationships intensify today, you might be reluctant to share your likes and dislikes with your friends. Unfortunately, your inner resistance to expressing your needs may reveal that you're not ready to open up to someone special. Even if you prefer to be the strong and silent type, showing your vulnerability can be a sign of courage when you telegraph your availability. Take a chance now and make sure your message comes from your heart."
aquarius,2016-05-13,"Confining a professional relationship to strictly business is an understandable tactic, but an unexpected opportunity to share your feelings is intriguing, nonetheless. Of course, it's absolutely crucial to respect appropriate boundaries, but you still can let the other person know what's occurring in your inner world if they seem sincerely interested. Establishing a genuine heart connection reinforces the bonds of friendship and cultivates an atmosphere of teamwork."
pisces,2016-05-13,"Your fascination with a piece of jewelry, furniture, clothing or artwork might tempt you to make a significant purchase today. A burning desire in your heart enchants you with the idea of owning something beautiful, leading you to compulsive behavior now, whether or not you actually acquire anything. Keep in mind that this attraction could simply be a reflection of your growing sense of self-worth. Acknowledging the substantial value you bring to the people you love is worth more than anything money can buy."
aries,2016-05-14,"There's unfinished projects everywhere you look and you're growing concerned that you're not making sufficient progress on any of them. In fact, you may feel as if you're just running around in circles as long as you try to do everything at once. Instead, choose one single task and stay on it until you are done. Only then will it be time to pick another item on your to-do list. Although you might not work your way through every chore today, at least you'll be satisfied with your accomplishments."
taurus,2016-05-14,"Your creative genie has escaped from its bottle, yet you still may encounter unexpected resistance as you begin a new project. Generally speaking, taking decisive action is tricky business when so many planets are in retrograde motion, but you might not be able to delay your choice. Being well-informed is your secret weapon. Your new direction can prove to be fruitful, as long as your head isn't in the clouds. The more practical you are in your approach now, the more you will have to show for your talent."
gemini,2016-05-14,"Buried feelings, though invisible to others, may follow you around today and color your attitude, making it more difficult to focus on your endeavors. Fortunately, you can consciously choose to dig into thoughts that aren't specifically related to your current responsibilities, even if you choose not to tell anyone about your inner dialogue now. Monitoring your own psychological process helps you successfully cope with nearly any stress you experience. Knowing the difference between what you can and cannot control gives you peace of mind."
cancer,2016-05-14,"It might seem as if someone is picking on you today, or perhaps, somehow having fun at your expense. On one hand, it's possible that you're being overly sensitive. On the other hand, there's no reason to simply remain quiet if you feel like a victim. Express any hurt you may be harboring so that your voice is heard, but then let go of any lingering resentment and move on. There's nothing to be gained now by clinging to the past when the future is so bright."
leo,2016-05-14,A recent decision involving your career plans comes under reconsideration one more time today. But reassessing your situation isn't enough; you need to take concrete action to solidify your position. It's not that your current choices are set in stone. It's just that you can't afford to expend too much energy retracing your footsteps by going over the same ground again and again. Standing up for what's most important to you now prevents trouble down the road.
virgo,2016-05-14,"You think you know exactly what you want one minute and then question your feelings just a few moments later. The inconsistency of your desires can be like a thorn in your side while the evocative Moon is back in your sign. Avoid growing frustrated if you can't make up your mind. Postponing your final answer a few more days is actually the best choice for now. Play through the possibilities in your imagination one more time, instead."
libra,2016-05-14,"Recent financial issues are returning for another round of analysis before you can launch a new venture. Complex partnerships are a lucrative playing field now for investing in your future, but you need time to tie up the loose ends from the past. You want to retreat to a quiet place so you have space to think, but a reflective break is a luxury you might have to forgo today. Even if you are being pushed to declare your position, don't compromise your core values for the sake of expediency."
scorpio,2016-05-14,"If your true intention is to help your friends, then resist the temptation to criticize them now. People might not be amenable to your unsolicited advice no matter how gently you deliver your message, even if you just want to offer some constructive comments. Setting the stage for a showdown is a dangerous move. If you sense any tension in the air today, keep your thoughts to yourself for a few days until the energy settles down. Show your support by simply listening to the dreams of others with an open mind and a closed mouth."
sagittarius,2016-05-14,"You're destined to become a hero today if you stay focused on fulfilling your commitments. Although you're not seeking the spotlight, you're receiving more attention than you prefer now, prompting you to resist any additional obligations tossed your way. Instead of automatically rejecting new responsibilities, find a middle path so you can still save the day and tend to your personal needs at the very same time."
capricorn,2016-05-14,"Your social life seems to be building in momentum now, but having fun isn't enough; you're also interested in using your personal connections to get ahead professionally. The good news is that you are able to combine work with play more readily these days. Don't turn down an invitation just because it sounds boring; you never know who you could meet or what might happen. Synchronicity is the language of the stars."
aquarius,2016-05-14,"You may receive unsolicited support from someone in power today, but your uncertainty could prompt you to politely decline the assistance. You might be so unsure of someone's intentions now that they appear insincere even when they are well-intended. However, it's possible that the only negativity is your own. Limitations appear to fall away when you believe in your dreams. Trusting in yourself is the first step to trusting anyone else. The universe will show up with magic if you're open to it."
pisces,2016-05-14,"Your interactions with friends can be the source of great clarity today. However, you might prefer to cling to your diaphanous dreams instead of narrowing your vision in order to make it real. It could very well be to your advantage to take the advice that's given and concentrate on the details necessary to reach your goals. The cues you receive from others now are crucial factors in the decisions you make over the next few days. Remaining open to an unbiased opinion is never a bad idea as long as you don't surrender control."
aries,2016-05-15,"You may underestimate the time required to finish your chores today, but your poor judgment won't necessarily ruin your day. In fact, everything could magically fall into place if you just keep pushing ahead, even if you overlook some of the details. Nevertheless, there's no free lunch; you won't feel the satisfaction of a job well done unless you do the work. It's up to you to find a sustainable balance between concentrating on every minute task and visualizing the overall scope of your day."
taurus,2016-05-15,"You're exceedingly thorough when managing your calendar today because you don't want to miss out on any of the good times ahead. However, participating in recreational activities may require more planning than you think. But there's no reason to tie up your schedule worrying about trivia. If you can't see the forest for the trees, you won't be able to respond to the unexpected changes that crop up along the way. A judicial mix of preparation and flexibility allows you to make the most of your day."
gemini,2016-05-15,"It's advisable to take the high road when responding to a stressful situation today, especially if you encounter unexpected resistance from your friends or family. It may be necessary to justify your actions, even if you prefer to let them speak for you now. However, if you want the support of others, be clear about your intentions and avoid succumbing to self-doubt. Visualizing your destination improves your chances for success. Thankfully, the people who know you best will come around in time."
cancer,2016-05-15,"You wish you were planning a quick little getaway but chores are tugging at you with a sense of urgency. Throwing a temper tantrum won't help you obtain what you want, but neither will a passive-aggressive response. Luckily, showing up with a positive attitude and a willingness to go the extra mile works in your favor now. You'll be surprised at how easily you can fulfill your commitment if you concentrate only on your most pressing obligations, one at a time. Focus on the present and the future will take care of itself."
leo,2016-05-15,"Although you could be worried about financial difficulties that limit your spending, the pressure might suddenly lighten today. You may receive an unexpected cash windfall or discover there's one less bill to pay. Just don't ignore the bottom line if you are swept up in a wave of optimism. Take all variables into consideration now and make your fiscal decisions based on rational choices rather than emotional preferences."
virgo,2016-05-15,"As much as you want to be able to count on others, you may need to rely on your own survival skills today. It's not that people won't be around to help; it's just that your closest friends seem a bit unpredictable now -- and they could actually disappear without giving much warning. Fortunately, you won't be frustrated if you simply recognize the work in front of you and get on with your day. Assume that you're on your own; it's all the better if someone else jumps in. Find a way to get your chores done with or without assistance. Real progress waits for no one."
libra,2016-05-15,"You may feel as if you're on edge these days because satisfaction seems close enough to grasp, but it stays just out of reach. It's like a storm is building on the horizon but the rain doesn't come. Ironically, it's your desire for resolution that creates the tension. Instead of concocting a better plan or battening down the hatches, enjoy the smooth sailing today while it lasts. You will be better prepared for the week ahead with a day of rest and relaxation under your belt."
scorpio,2016-05-15,"Making plans is tricky because people might not follow through on their promises. For example, your day might turn chaotic if someone lets you down at the last minute. However, all is not lost; in fact, a sudden change of direction could be the best thing that ever happened. No matter how you react, don't infuse your negative emotions into external dynamics. Once you're freed from an uncertain agenda, you can restructure your day anyway you choose. The best part of today's story is that satisfaction is yours when you rely on yourself."
sagittarius,2016-05-15,"You don't want to take responsibility for anyone else because you believe you've earned a day off. However, the tables are turned when you realize that being in charge enables you to steer events to your liking. Much to your surprise, assuming a leadership role now requires very little extra effort on your part. Happily, when you make decisions based on your personal preferences today, they work out in everyone's favor. Don't hold back; step up to the plate while the planets are smiling in your direction."
capricorn,2016-05-15,"Participating in social events is challenging today because you feel like there's too much going on in your life. You want to be an integral part of your extended family or community, but you could take yourself so seriously now that you become wrapped up in your own personal story. Nevertheless, don't isolate yourself from those who love you; the support you offer to others returns to benefit you in the long run."
aquarius,2016-05-15,"Discussing your feelings isn't all that comfortable for you heady Aquarians. But your practical concerns outweigh your personal preferences today, encouraging you to address a long-overdue issue. Thankfully, you can perform a balancing act with one foot on the ground while the other one explores the uncertain realm of emotions. Unfortunately, a productive discussion becomes unlikely the longer you delay. Do it now; sometimes later becomes never."
pisces,2016-05-15,"A relationship dilemma that has been dangling from a giant pendulum swings in your favor today. Although it's normal for your emotions to change over time, it seems as if they are finally about to settle down. However, it's a mistake to think everything is as good as it appears now. Nevertheless, there's no reason to go looking for trouble. Enjoying the pleasantries is healing for your heart. Happiness can be yours if you live in acceptance rather than expectation."
aries,2016-05-16,"You see yourself in a mirror no matter where you look today. Once the Moon enters relationship-oriented Libra, every interaction with someone seems to point you back to your own thoughts and feelings that you know all too well. However, you can't help but wonder if you are missing information that could help you break out of your current rut. Thankfully, you're likely on the right track now, so allow time for your ideas to develop without acting too soon. As Willie Nelson says, ""The early bird gets the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese."""
taurus,2016-05-16,"There's a lot to do at work and you can't wait to get started. Unfortunately, there may be pesky unresolved issues about a recent event, preventing you from moving on to more enjoyable tasks. Think of today as a transitional phase; there's no need to jump into your current obligations all at once. You'll do better in the long run if you take the time to process your feelings first. Mastering patience empowers you to master everything else."
gemini,2016-05-16,"It's wonderful how quickly your interpersonal landscape can shift when you accept that which you cannot change. It might seem as if you were recently trying to outrun an oncoming storm and now the sky is finally free of clouds. Although some conflicts may not disappear overnight, your laid-back attitude makes it easier to enjoy what the present moment has in store. Even if you don't have time to do something just for the fun of it, take a few minutes to meditate and visualize a pleasurable experience. Your fantasy could come true when you least expect it."
cancer,2016-05-16,"Although the intensity of a conflict at work may diminish today, it doesn't disappear completely. Your tried-and-true tactic of withdrawing from an unpleasant situation goes a long way to minimize the emotional pressure. Unfortunately, your retreat doesn't fix the underlying issue. Naturally, if you're only on the periphery of someone else's argument, disengaging is the most sensible thing to do. However, abandoning a conversation isn't advisable if you're one of the active participants. Follow your moral compass and persist with the process until resolution is in sight."
leo,2016-05-16,"Unavoidable work commitments complicate your pursuit of pleasure today. Although the current obstacles may be real, it helps to recognize that your attitude can have a profoundly positive impact on the course of events. Unfortunately, widening your perspective is not as simple as it sounds, even if you try to maintain objectivity. Persevering in the face of your own resistance is necessary so taking consistent baby steps is your best strategy. Confucius said, ""It doesn't matter how slowly you go as long as you don't give up."""
virgo,2016-05-16,"You continue to face delays and must still overcome more challenges while so many planets are stuck languishing in retrograde. And although your trials may not be quite over, at least you see opportunities on the horizon to make progress again. You can hear the future calling, but it's still necessary to achieve stability in the present moment before initiating the next phase of your personal development. Don't hurry; success doesn't happen overnight."
libra,2016-05-16,"You probably feel much more optimistic today, even if you're weary from relationship struggles. But you don't want your hope for good times ahead to distract you from the work that needs to be done now. You may be concerned that your emotional vulnerability will lead to further disappointment, but you're also happily anticipating the potential of major breakthroughs. Get ready to make your move when the time is right, since you can't count on anyone else to know what's in your heart."
scorpio,2016-05-16,"It may seem as if an ongoing interpersonal conflict is finally subsiding now, but minor trouble spots continue to flare up for a while. Fortunately, you can rely on flights of fancy to weave fragments of fantasies into a new vision for the next chapter of your life. Don't worry if your current dreams aren't very realistic; there is still plenty of time to come up with a more concrete action plan after your creativity runs its course. As Albert Einstein said, ""Logic will get you from A to B. Imagination will take you everywhere."""
sagittarius,2016-05-16,"You are anchored to reality today through your professional relationships and your social connections. Normally, your natural ability to envision the future can pull you away from the practical aspects of the here and now. However, common sense prevails now because your friends won't let you drift too far away. Allow time to dream, but don't forget to return to Earth. Remember, the mighty oak was once a little nut who held its ground."
capricorn,2016-05-16,"You're quite clear about your objectives today, but you might not be sure how to reach them. Part of your problem is that people may appear to be working against you if you are too ambitious in the pursuit of your success. Avoid confrontation; open conflict won't help you in the present moment. Instead, keep your eyes on your destination and continue to aim in that direction, even if your progress is limited. Your perseverance will carry you a long way if you can minimize distractions and maximize your focus."
aquarius,2016-05-16,"Your life continues to feel like a roller coaster ride, yet you're aware that the potential for positive change is increasing day by day. Your anticipation grows as the future approaches, but you're not sure what will happen next. Ironically, if you try to fill in too many details too soon, you could end up delaying your progress. Rather than obsessing about what's around the bend, concentrate on the here and now where your immediate efforts produce the most lasting impact. Anything is possible when your priorities are in order."
pisces,2016-05-16,"It warms your heart if someone you admire is advising you to reach for your dreams. The support of a friend or coworker might be the tipping point if you're sitting on the fence, waiting for a sign. Unfortunately, rash actions won't likely take you where you want to go today. It makes more sense to use other people's encouragement to improve your plans without executing them just yet. Give yourself a few more days and then reevaluate your goals. Time has a wonderful way of revealing what really matters."
aries,2016-05-17,"Maintaining a cool and calm attitude can be a challenge today, especially if you already know what you want. Regardless, your feelings continue to intensify throughout the day, making cooperation with others at work less likely. Although the graceful Libra Moon urges you to establish equilibrium in all your relationships, it's doubtful that you will be able to hold onto a dispassionate point of view. Letting go of your previous expectations creates room for something new and exciting to enter your life."
taurus,2016-05-17,"Although you foresee big changes unfolding at work, your smartest strategy is to simply do your job today without getting caught up in uncertain possibilities. The Moon's monthly visit to your 6th House of Daily Routine signals a return to normalcy, but you might be worried that the current peace and quiet won't last. It's impossible to know how everything will play out in the long run, so concentrate on keeping your life as stable as you can for now and forget about the rest. The future will arrive soon enough on its own."
gemini,2016-05-17,"Conflicting emotions may tug at you until you begin to feel a knot in the pit of your stomach today. On one hand, you can clearly see the positive benefits of pursuing a friendship or a romantic connection with someone you admire. But on the other hand, it's much less complicated to keep your feelings quiet to avoid the possibility of rejection. Instead of getting lost in endless analysis and worrying about your next relationship move, listen to your instincts now. Ultimately, following your heart is your best choice as long as you remember to bring your common sense with you."
cancer,2016-05-17,"It seems like someone is trying to convince you to do something that benefits others more than you. However, your resistance to making concrete plans now might appear selfish to your peers, even if you believe you're pursuing an honorable course of action. Don't be afraid to stand up for your convictions. Even if your choice is an unpopular one, you will gain respect for being honest instead of just trying to please everyone. One of the truest tests of integrity is its blunt refusal to be compromised."
leo,2016-05-17,"Your creative prowess is readily apparent at work today, emboldening you to share your plans. Although your coworkers might make unreasonable demands on your schedule, your personal ambitions require a fair amount of time and effort. However, you aren't required to put on a show for anyone else just to demonstrate that you're capable of doing your job. Instead of setting your agenda aside, make a commitment to prioritize your goals. Determination and follow-through are the not-so-secret ingredients in your current recipe for success."
virgo,2016-05-17,"You might think your practical approach to financial matters is a well-balanced one, but you could be easily misled by your own ideals now. Even if clouds are gathering to obscure your vision, you can still visualize a bright blue sky in your mind's eye. Normally, positive thinking works in your favor, but it's crucial to acknowledge reality as it is today and not as you wish it to be. Facing the truth places you in a position of power."
libra,2016-05-17,"Although you're fully capable of understanding both sides of a complex disagreement, people might see you as more ambivalent today than you are in reality. You may have an accurate perspective of other people's motives, yet you recognize the practical wisdom in keeping your opinions to yourself until everyone has a chance to speak. An honest dialogue is necessary to clear the air before you tell others exactly what you think. Conversation is food for the soul."
scorpio,2016-05-17,"Your imagination is running wild today, but you seem so pragmatic that no one would ever guess what's going behind your smile. Thankfully, you can hide your fantasies without much effort but keeping your secrets grows more challenging later in the day. Ultimately, your actions reveal your true feelings, especially if you are tired of pretending everything is fine. Telling the truth, little by little, is wiser now than blurting it out all at once. Sometimes the smallest step in the right direction ends up being the biggest step of your life."
sagittarius,2016-05-17,"Share your plans with your closest supporters before it becomes too complicated to say anything at all. You know exactly where you want the conversation to go and might manipulate the circumstances at work to push your agenda forward. It's relatively easy to just convey an abstract idea to a friend. However, conflicting intentions become entangled if you are overly attached to your goal. Remaining open to whatever happens today offers you more options; but don't be so eager to compromise that you sacrifice your self-esteem in the process."
capricorn,2016-05-17,"You are highly strategic in your planning because your professional objectives are well-defined and you are prepared to do whatever it takes now to fulfill your destiny. Unfortunately, nothing is as simple as it seems at first glance; you must balance your own needs with the wishes of those you love. Don't just assume that your unspoken dreams are identical to anyone else's. Continue to clarify your ambitions and work steadily toward success. Clear communication keeps you on the same page."
aquarius,2016-05-17,"You clearly comprehend the measurable benefits of your current plan and the possible pitfalls of a faulty execution. Unfortunately, positive thinking grows elusive as the plot thickens and people realize how important your goals are to you now. Nothing is gained by backing down just because you're worried about what others think. Your unrelenting persistence is the best guarantee of your success. Don't stop believing in your dreams just because someone else lacks imagination."
pisces,2016-05-17,"Your stellar presentation enables everyone to witness your determination today, yet you have more simmering beneath the surface than meets the eye. Even if a powerful friend accuses you of trying to impress others, the truth is that you're just pushing to accomplish as much as you can while you feel so inspired. Although everything seems quite intense now, you actually have enough time to put your life in order before the current window of opportunity closes."
aries,2016-05-18,"There's no need to any work harder today than is necessary or you could overdo it and exhaust yourself in the process. The gentle Libra Moon suggests that relying on grace is more effective now than brute force. No matter what, forget about your ambitions for a while and let your senses be your guide. Flow with the emotional tides, instead of struggling against them. Creativity, rather than productivity, is the business of the day."
taurus,2016-05-18,"Your nerves wear thin today as every little event highlights how far you have to travel before reaching your goal. Unfortunately, anyone who seems impractical just adds to your annoyance. Thankfully, the socially astute Libra Moon's presence in your 6th House of Employment enables you to detach from your emotions by practicing diplomacy at work. Ultimately, you must be as flexible as possible, for there are many approaches to accomplishing the same task. Give others the same benefit of the doubt that you want for yourself."
gemini,2016-05-18,"You are juggling contradictory desires today and may find it difficult to settle on any one particular avenue of expression. You can be quite adept when it comes to skillfully managing conflicting emotions. However, interactions with others might still be confusing if you try to hide your feelings. There's no justification for keeping secrets now; surprisingly, your inner angst will fade once your true intentions are out in the open. Honesty really is the best policy when it comes to matters of the heart."
cancer,2016-05-18,"Staying home sounds like a great idea today, especially while the Libra Moon unwinds in your inner-directed 4th House of Roots. But even if you can't take the day off, find ways to make your work environment feel a bit cozier. Little things like wearing comfortable clothes, packing your favorite lunch and adding personal touches around your office can make a big difference. Increasing the emotional security factor wherever you are now empowers you to take necessary risks and move toward your goals with greater confidence."
leo,2016-05-18,"You have colorful stories to tell today and are eager to listen to the tales that others want to share, too. The sociable Libra Moon is visiting your 3rd House of Communication, amplifying the simple joy you feel while conversing with a chatty friend. However, the current key to your happiness is sharing the spotlight. Playing the game of life is a team sport now in which everyone wins together or no one wins at all."
virgo,2016-05-18,"Spend a little money to improve your self-image because showing your best side enables you to take on the world. Purchasing something that makes you feel attractive is sensible while the lovely Libra Moon is traveling through your 2nd House of Self-Worth. Although attention to your looks might seem like a superficial indulgence, you're likely to be more confident on every level when you see yourself in a flattering light. Just remember that appearances make first impressions, but it's your actions that matter most in the long run."
libra,2016-05-18,"Your natural ability to put people at ease works best when you take the time to understand their concerns. Happily, the kind Libra Moon reflects her gracious light on your relationships today, increasing your sensitivity to those you love. Nevertheless, be careful of becoming so sympathetic to everyone else's emotions that you lose sight of your own needs. Balance your compassion for others with a healthy dose of respect for yourself."
scorpio,2016-05-18,"An issue of trust may be unnecessarily highlighted today, especially if you're concerned that someone is withholding information from you. There are those who have complete and total faith in you and are more than willing to share their deepest secrets. But others might talk about you behind your back and there's nothing you can do about it. Nevertheless, you still have a choice; consider the source of what you learn now and only spend your time with those who deserve your loyalty. Never waste your feelings on people who don't value your heart."
sagittarius,2016-05-18,"You are often content to hang out and listen to your friends when they share their dreams with you. However, so many people may vie for your attention now that it's nearly impossible to attend to your obligations. Although you might hear lots of ideas and promises today that aren't grounded in reality, it's not your job to shatter anyone's illusions. Instead, help others focus on the most practical elements that will benefit their career. Ironically, rather than wasting time in endless chatter, you can set the best example by excusing yourself to get back to work."
capricorn,2016-05-18,"Collaborating on a project isn't easy if others don't work hard enough to live up to your high standards. Further complicating matters, everyone seems overly sensitive and might require more reassurance now than you're willing to give. Interacting as politely as possible enables you to navigate your way through these tricky dynamics without creating collateral damage. Thankfully, you can earn admiration for your patience if you put kindness first."
aquarius,2016-05-18,"You may be in your visionary mode these days because you have more ideas about the future now than information about the present. The Libra Moon's presence in your 9th House of Distant Horizons encourages you to connect with other big thinkers and share thoughts about how to create a better world. Your current dreams might not support your practical needs, but they empower you to imagine the magical possibilities that inspire you and everyone else."
pisces,2016-05-18,"Being overly concerned about other people's reactions can prevent you from saying what's on your mind today. But don't be afraid to consciously shake up a cautious companion with the truth about your feelings now. Your disclosure won't end a conversation; in fact, it might actually be an entry point for a deeper and more productive discussion. The first step is the hardest one, but you can't go wrong if you speak from your heart."
aries,2016-05-19,"You might not be able to say no today because you are strongly motivated by your dreams. You're convinced that it's fair to give everyone the same chances that you want for yourself. But your desire to inspire others isn't limited to the value of any single idea; rather, you want your friends and acquaintances to succeed on their own merits. Err on the side of generosity and you can't go wrong."
taurus,2016-05-19,"It's natural to think in rational terms about your life now because there are five planets transiting sensible earth signs. However, it helps to consider philosophical arguments while mental Mercury receives metaphysical messages from Jupiter. Your reasoning is probably quite sound, but there's no need to be combative if others are pushing your buttons. Take everything in stride, even if your plans encounter resistance from someone who thinks they know what's best for you. Luckily, you don't have to prove anything to anyone but yourself."
gemini,2016-05-19,"You may seem to be somewhat ambivalent today about the potential of a particular romance. Although you could easily pursue a fantastic opportunity that would deepen a current connection, you must be honest when making decisions about the direction of your relationship. While weighing the pros and cons, make sure to listen to your heart. However, don't compromise your integrity for the sake of a passing pleasure."
cancer,2016-05-19,"You're already anticipating some quiet time over the weekend because you're so busy today. Pressing tasks that are still left over from last week require your unwavering commitment now. Luckily, you can avoid being overwhelmed by methodically prioritizing your chores. Don't try to accomplish everything in a single day or you could feel discouraged when you fall short of your expectations. Create reachable goals to measure your progress along the way. Success breeds success."
leo,2016-05-19,"Your perceptions are sharper today and your emotions are more intense. Your reactions are so obvious that attempting to hide your feelings is an exercise in futility. Nevertheless, what you say now is less important than how you say it. Go ahead and share what is in your heart, but stay calm, cool and collected in the process. The stakes in a significant relationship are still rising, so don't get so caught up in any one moment that you lose sight of the larger picture."
virgo,2016-05-19,"You might not seem like your regular cautious self these days because you're so eager to share your thoughts without filtering them first. You prefer to get your ideas all out on the table even if you know there could be negative consequences. Unfortunately; a torrent of unedited words can be disruptive to your progress. The simple winds of fate are blowing strong, so you may as well wait and see where they are going to take you before you invest too much energy into one dream."
libra,2016-05-19,"You don't appear to have much control over your schedule today because unplanned disruptions continue to catch you off guard. Questioning your ability to do a good job may be unavoidable, but there's no time to waste wallowing in negativity or self-doubt. Accepting what you can't change frees up time to focus your intentions where they can do the most to further your goals. Energy flows where attention goes."
scorpio,2016-05-19,"You are confronted with endings and beginnings today, as the reflective Moon returns for her monthly visit to your transformational sign. Once started, the magical process of metamorphosis is powerful enough to overcome most natural resistance. There is no need for discouragement now. The next cycle may still require a few days to take shape, so don't expect too much change too soon. Everything will unfold on time if you let the universe do its job and you keep believing in your dreams."
sagittarius,2016-05-19,"There are several areas of your life undergoing transitions these days, making it nearly impossible to pick just one specific topic to talk about. However, you must dig into your past and look deep into your soul as you search for the map that will guide you into the future. There's no urgency to tell anyone about your inner journey today; it's yours alone and you get to choose how much you want to share. Those who don't understand your silence will never understand your words."
capricorn,2016-05-19,"Although the weekend is just around the corner, your focus is still on your role in the outer world. Unfortunately, you might wish that you didn't have to deal with so many responsibilities because you are craving some personal space where you can decompress. Your desire for solitude grows into more of an issue today, making it prudent to get your work done as soon as possible. Once you satisfy your obligations, you are free to do as you wish."
aquarius,2016-05-19,"You can tell that something has changed, yet you can't quite put your finger on what it is. You may sound like a detective as you search for the missing facts today, but your questioning could turn into an obsession that distracts you from other activities. There's nothing wrong with feeling your way through the unfamiliar realms of the new emotional landscape. You don't need to have all the answers right now as long as you continue your pursuit of the truth."
pisces,2016-05-19,"You imagine doing something adventurous today, but you still may be preoccupied with your immediate responsibilities. Nevertheless, you're tempted to walk away from your chores because there are so many other things that sound better than what you're currently doing. Remember, the weekend is still far away, so get back to work. Fulfilling your promises before the day is over frees you to play with a clear conscience."
aries,2016-05-20,"You are transmitting more energy than a quasar today, but it may be impossible to sustain the power for more than a short burst each time. The breezy Gemini Sun is flying through your 3rd House of Communication, fueling your words with irrepressible excitement. Although you might be handed an unexpected opportunity to launch off in a new direction, it's nearly impossible to make progress while retrograde Mars thwarts your forward movement. Your life is full of possibilities now, yet pursuing too many goals diminishes your chances of succeeding at any of them."
taurus,2016-05-20,"Catching glimpses of your future leaves you feeling more annoyed that your plans are moving so slowly. Nevertheless, you must attend to more practical matters now that the Sun is lighting up your 2nd House of Money. Spend time organizing your finances and making your immediate surroundings more pleasant. Don't be lazy and slip back into your old habits when you should be working to perfect your game, instead. A methodical approach to self-improvement leads to the growth you desire."
gemini,2016-05-20,"Your personal radiance is undeniable throughout your astrological birthday month. Make optimum use of the intellectual Gemini Sun as its rays warm your 1st House of Self, filling you with confidence about your future. Your heightened curiosity is an asset now, so don't hesitate to ask others for their opinions. But remember that seeking advice is only half of the equation. You must listen with an open mind to gain something valuable from this exercise. Your best friends make the hard times easier and the good times even better."
cancer,2016-05-20,"You need to complete projects you began over the winter rather than starting new ones as the Gemini Sun marches through your 12th House of Endings this month. Forget about the regular calendar; your astrological year is coming to a close and you must do everything possible to prepare for your next steps as summer approaches. But don't let a sudden burst of energy today lure you into believing that you can just make a mad dash to the finish line. Determination, not destiny, will make the difference between failure and success."
leo,2016-05-20,"Your crazy social calendar is strong evidence that your presence is in high demand this time of year. The Sun's presence in your 11th House of Social Networking encourages you to take on a more prominent role within a group. Rather than working on your own now, it's more fun to collaborate with like-minded folks. Put your personal issues in order quickly so that you can be the best team player possible. Individually you are but one drop; joining in a cause with others creates an ocean."
virgo,2016-05-20,"You are becoming painfully aware of the strict self-discipline needed to keep the lights shining on your career path. The clever Gemini Sun is busy in your 10th House of Vocation this month and although you may be in the spotlight, something about all the attention might feel awkward. Rethink your goals and your limitations; decide what you're willing to forego in turn for financial security and professional success. The important thing is to be ready at any moment to sacrifice who you are for who you could become."
libra,2016-05-20,"You are given a chance now to explore worlds that lure you beyond your current hopes and dreams. The Sun naturally harmonizes with your sign as it travels through airy Gemini and your 9th House of Journeys. Entertain new ideas that expand your mind, even if you don't actually pack your bags and take a trip. Studying metaphysics, philosophy or religion enriches your personal wealth of knowledge. The day you stop learning is the day you grow old."
scorpio,2016-05-20,"You are fascinated by investigating whatever lies beneath the surface and uncovering the mysteries of the dark side of the Moon. However, the Sun is wending its way through your 8th House of Deep Sharing now, triggering your basic issues of intimacy. Self-discovery is encouraged by self-inquiry. Using language enables you to start the process, but you must access your feelings to get to the real stuff. Vulnerability is the key to opening the door of your heart."
sagittarius,2016-05-20,"You may be overly sensitive to the cosmic tides these days; progress is too slow for your taste now that Mars and Saturn are backpedaling in your sign. However, the emphasis could be on someone else while the Gemini Sun sheds light on your 7th House of Partnerships, setting up a dilemma between your internal and external worlds. Consider ways to express your own needs while still honoring the most significant relationships in your life. Being true to yourself doesn't mean that you must ignore everyone else."
capricorn,2016-05-20,"This is not a time to travel alone even if you're a rugged individualist. The four-week journey of the Sun through your 6th House of Logistics emphasizes the regular routine of your daily life. Face the light of awareness, even if it forces you to blink twice and rethink your assumptions. Whether you're currently in a happy relationship or motivated to start a new one, just make sure that you don't lose track of your own dreams in the process."
aquarius,2016-05-20,"Depending upon the intensity of your struggle for self-expression, you will likely notice your load lightening during the weeks ahead. Although you must apply your thinking to earthly matters, the cerebral Gemini Sun's dance through your 5th House of Creativity does most of the work now. Keep in mind the month will also bring its share of serious issues into the light, so enjoy the current sparks of playful interaction as the opportunities arise."
pisces,2016-05-20,"A distracting stream of noise prevents you from attending to more personal issues while the chatty Gemini Sun visits your 4th House of Family. Unfortunately, all that verbal interaction can be exhausting now, since you Fish prefer swimming in the watery realm of emotions. Suddenly, you have more information than you need or want. If you are overwhelmed by too much data, heed the signs and retreat into the quiet stillness of nature or the safety of your own nest. Sometimes it takes courage to know when enough is enough."
aries,2016-05-21,"It's wonderful to be so positive about your current activities but you must be careful today so you don't blow through your resources. Often, your waves of excitement can come and go quickly, tempting you to spontaneously expend your energy while it lasts. However, the expansive Sagittarius Full Moon brightens your 9th House of Future Vision, inviting you into new territory and requiring you to sustain a higher level of intensity for an extended period of time. Don't burn all your fuel just because your stamina seems endless; practicing patience and persistence increases your chances for success."
taurus,2016-05-21,"Responding to changes in interpersonal dynamics is especially exhausting when the enthusiastic Sagittarius Full Moon overwhelms your 8th House of Intimacy and Transformation. Typically, you prefer a more methodical approach to navigating through your life. Unfortunately, there's no time to waste now, so muster up your courage and find a way to flow with the current energy. Don't take your fear out on someone else; resistance truly is futile. You may be in for a great surprise when you realize how quickly you can adapt once you completely let go."
gemini,2016-05-21,"No extra coffee for you this morning; your life is already popping and you have a better chance of enjoying the high-frequency buzz if you remember to set healthy limits. Nevertheless, you're sorely tempted to say yes to the next invitation because everything sounds fantastic while the Sagittarius Full Moon expands the energy of your 7th House of Others. Unfortunately, each avenue of exploration leads to a world full of possible distractions. Be selective or you'll end up facing the music at the end of the day when you realize all the things you didn't accomplish."
cancer,2016-05-21,"Avoiding your normal routine enables you to take a risk today when impulsive Mars ignites the Sagittarius Full Moon in your 6th House of Work. Thankfully, your common sense will most likely prevail before you climb too far out on a limb. If you go after your heart's desire, don't be afraid of falling short of your professional goals. And don't be hard on yourself if you must let an opportunity slip by now, because more chances are already on the way. The current situation is a practice run for amazing possibilities just ahead."
leo,2016-05-21,"You know what you must do now and you're okay about doing it, even if it means you must put your creative self on the line. Still, you may be left with a tight feeling in the pit of your stomach because something is out of balance. Although the extroverted Sagittarius Full Moon emboldens your 5th House of Self-Expression, you might not be able to initiate action. Even if you are extremely busy, make time for contemplation so you don't lose touch with whatever is most important to you. Your current bout with self-doubt ends when you listen to your heart."
virgo,2016-05-21,"Absorbing so much new information in a short amount of time can be quite the dilemma. You prefer incoming data to arrive at a regulated pace, allowing you to efficiently process each bit of news and then manage what's next. Unfortunately, you could be deprived of this luxury now if you can't slow the energy down. Fortunately, the philosophical Sagittarius Full Moon illuminates your 4th House of Roots, helping you get back to the basics. Set priorities and focus on your work today while leaving the logical analysis for the future."
libra,2016-05-21,"You may wish to minimize the unpredictability and chaos people bring into your life while the boisterous Sagittarius Full Moon lights up your 3rd House of Immediate Environment. Although others might seem too high-strung now for your easygoing style, you will still likely miss the exhilaration once you retreat. Thankfully, recognizing your ambiguity helps to relieve your current frustration. Ultimately, you start enjoying life more when you stop trying to control all the variables and concentrate on counting your blessings."
scorpio,2016-05-21,"You don't feel threatened by an emotionally intense interaction that's lurking in the shadows. The Sagittarius Full Moon joins warrior Mars to strengthen your 2nd House of Self-Esteem, helping you understand the connection between communication and intimacy. But someone else's avoidance of an issue is enough to make you want to scream now. The more you try to bring up the subject, the worse it gets. Rise above your current personal agenda and save the talk for another day when others are more willing to meet you halfway."
sagittarius,2016-05-21,"Kicking back to relax seems nearly impossible today because you don't want to miss anything while you're taking a break. Combative Mars joins the Full Moon in your sign, heightening your concerns that someone could gain a competitive edge if you retreat to rest. On the other hand, you don't have enough energy to do battle with anyone over a minor difference. Stop trying to second-guess what you should or shouldn't do. Nothing is so urgent that it can't wait until tomorrow."
capricorn,2016-05-21,"You have a compelling story to tell today, but finding the right person to listen is a real challenge while the Sagittarius Full Moon activates your 12th House of Privacy. You are understandably resistant to opening up your heart to just anyone; it needs to be someone who supports your dreams. But your current words may elicit an unexpected reaction that derails your original agenda. Nevertheless, you might be happily surprised by your discovery if you're insistent enough to follow a conversation wherever it leads."
aquarius,2016-05-21,"Your progressive plans require the participation of others, but it could get messy trying to convince them to join your cause. It's hard to understand why anyone would resist the possibility of creating a memorable event, but your idea of a good time isn't necessarily the same as everyone else's now. Ironically, the Sagittarius Full Moon shines in your 11th House of Social Networking, indicating you could find more emotional fulfillment if you spend less time trying to be the ringleader and more time supporting the dreams of your friends."
pisces,2016-05-21,"You may seem like a mother hen today as you try to protect your friends and family by gathering them under your wings. The idealistic Sagittarius Full Moon impassions your 10th House of Public Responsibility, enticing you to let your own responsibilities slide while you help another person who needs your assistance. Remember, even performing compassionate deeds has its limits. Creating healthy boundaries is necessary when you care so much."
aries,2016-05-22,"There's plenty on your plate this week, yet you already see that everything could take longer than planned. Fortunately, it's possible to make your life easier by setting priorities today so you can utilize your time more efficiently. You're in a feisty mood while your ruling planet Mars opposes the Sun, but you might not have anywhere to direct your energy. You want to have your way and aren't interested in waiting any longer. Steering clear of petty ego disputes is your most reliable path to success."
taurus,2016-05-22,"Everyone seems to have precise ideas of where you should focus your attention. Normally, you would be happy to do what's expected of you to keep things copacetic, but not today. You're less interested in other people's goals than you are in your own. However, you'll have more fun now if you let yourself be swept up in someone else's agenda. And there will be enough time later on to attend to your personal needs. A little bit of compromise at the right moment eases the tension. Meet others halfway and anything can happen."
gemini,2016-05-22,"You have been operating on overdrive ever since Mercury went into retrograde motion three weeks ago. Now, as the trickster finally turns direct, you're ready to take some time off before you run out of steam. Although there may be signs that you can slow down ahead, you can't call it quits just yet. Don't take your frustration out on anyone else; getting into an argument will only waste your precious energy. If you're feeling depleted today, sneak away to recuperate for a while before jumping back into the race."
cancer,2016-05-22,"People are pushing you to do more than you can today, but you're resigned to give them what they request because you don't want to let anyone down. Nevertheless, it's crucial to defend your right to say no if you're feeling overextended. You may have to express your anger in order to hold your ground, but there's no reason to get drawn into conflicts that aren't directly concerned with establishing your boundaries. Taking care of your needs is just as important as nurturing anyone else. When you respect your limits, others will do the same."
leo,2016-05-22,"Recent discussions with a loved one have brought you back down to earth, but they haven't squelched your dreams. Regardless of what anyone says, there's no harm in entertaining fantasies as long as you're not trying to escape from the real world. If you find yourself embroiled in an argument over the practicality of your ideas, don't try to justify them. No one can control your thoughts unless you let them. Exploring the far reaches of your imagination is your own little secret. Don't say a word; smile and leave everyone guessing."
virgo,2016-05-22,"You might think you must make a decision right away, but an impulsive choice now leads to nothing but trouble. However, Mercury's direct turn excites your nervous system and fires up your adrenals, giving you an irrepressible feeling of urgency. Luckily, there is more time to consider all your options before you must act; believe it or not, everything is happening right on schedule. Nevertheless, ambitious goals make for outstanding achievements."
libra,2016-05-22,"Someone may not be totally honest with you now and could even be secretly working against your honorable intentions. But don't lash out if you think a friend isn't being loyal; just take whatever you learn in stride. Making people feel guilty only wastes your time and complicates your relationships. Be grateful you discovered the truth today, for what you don't know can cause more damage than you think. Although watching your back is prudent considering the current circumstances, giving others the benefit of the doubt is an admirable exercise of compassion."
scorpio,2016-05-22,"Unexpressed negativity is stressful to manage today, especially if your anger or fear has nowhere to go. You might not know what's motivating you now or how deep your emotions run. Jumping into a little disagreement can escalate it into a major argument. Although you could justify taking a stand, your pride is seducing you into believing full engagement will resolve your differences. However, a current conflict is more likely to abate when you focus on your inner work rather than trying to fix someone else."
sagittarius,2016-05-22,"Keeping your feet on the ground is crucial today while confronting disharmony in a relationship dynamic. You want to stay true to your ideals while also honoring someone else's path. You may be reluctant to set aside your dreams, even if prior commitments restrain you on a short leash. Let your moral compass be your guide but don't get discouraged; sometimes it's challenging to balance the vagaries of your heart with other people's realities. Your gentle persistence is your ticket to success."
capricorn,2016-05-22,"You are so impatient today that it's crucial to stay in touch with your inner parent to minimize the chance of doing something foolish. However, you could complicate things by scattering your energy or losing your temper with someone who seems to be blocking your freedom. If you find yourself itching to be somewhere else, remember that there will be time later to navigate into new territory. For now, be consistent and stay on your path without making any sudden changes in direction."
aquarius,2016-05-22,"Your problem-solving skills may be tested today because you can't just think your way through the current obstacle course. Trust what you feel in your heart now instead of relying on your conceptual prowess to solve a current dilemma. Nevertheless, you won't be satisfied until you get to the truth of the matter, so you need to do some in-depth research and ask some tough questions. Don't worry if others don't understand your actions; if something seems important to you, then check it out. Ultimately, you're the director of your own movie and the star of the show."
pisces,2016-05-22,"You need to make a choice that restricts your progress at home or at work because you just can't do everything. Thankfully, there is a simple solution to your predicament, but it requires you to reframe your assumptions. Mercury turns direct today, reminding you to fix every little problem that popped up over the past few weeks. But don't buy into this illusion of urgency. You can do it all once you realize your deadlines are more fluid than you thought. In the final analysis, it's not about having more time; it's about making time for things that matter."
aries,2016-05-23,"It's hard to understand how quickly a complex situation can resolve into a much simpler one. You might conclude that you're out of the woods today, but don't trick yourself into believing you're home free just because you want to ignore your current obligations. Temporary relief may partially result from an improvement of circumstances, but denial could also contribute to your positive state of mind. Keep in mind that avoiding an awkward emotional roadblock feels good for a while, but it's surely not the same thing as finding a lasting solution."
taurus,2016-05-23,"You typically are in touch with your world because you naturally trust your senses. Although you can convince yourself to stay where you are by rationalizing your decision with facts, you still secretly believe your intuition will reveal a path to your future. Ultimately, centering your awareness in your heart empowers you with additional information as long as you don't waste energy talking about it. Opening your mind increases the odds of making your dreams come true."
gemini,2016-05-23,"You're afraid that your feelings will trigger a negative response so you might attempt to hide them from someone close to you. However, this reserved behavior doesn't mean you are antisocial today. Paradoxically, your witty banter and funny stories distract others from the messy truth. Even if you're smart enough to fool everyone else, be careful about going so far that you also fool yourself. What you choose to disclose is up to you; just make sure to draw the line of integrity before it's too late."
cancer,2016-05-23,"Your vision is panoramic today, but you run into trouble when trying to create a step-by-step map for executing your plan. Your work associates are eager to place their trust in you because you seem as if your feet are planted solidly in the ground. Unfortunately, you might not be as confident now as you appear; nevertheless, be honest and let others know that the details are still missing from your strategy. It's more rewarding to be real than to sound as if you have all the answers when you don't. Collaborating with your peers enhances your chances for success."
leo,2016-05-23,"Although you are set on following the guidance of your moral compass now, you're still itching to speak bluntly about something that bothers you. Luckily, you can ward off negativity by concentrating on spiritual beliefs, rather than falling victim to your own passions. But the power of positive thinking alone isn't enough to permanently put things back in order. Follow up with decisive actions or your good intentions will be for naught."
virgo,2016-05-23,"You are committed to resolving a conflict now, but the specifics of the situation are not as important as you may think. However, an information overload could send you into a mental tailspin because you want to focus on the larger picture, instead. In fact, these dynamics are familiar because you often feel challenged to let go of the details. Thankfully, taking the time to relax or meditate allows you to put your worries into a healthier perspective."
libra,2016-05-23,"You wake up with unrealistic hopes about accomplishing your goals today; unfortunately, you may be overly optimistic in your expectations. Your current obsession with completing your chores is complicated by a louder-than-usual creative buzz that you don't want to lose. Naturally, you prefer the notion of an artsy-crafty kind of day, but you might just have to fulfill your responsibilities now before you follow your muse."
scorpio,2016-05-23,"It's essential to adhere to the highest level of integrity today or you won't be able to persuade others to go along with your plans. It's as if every person has a slightly different idea about the best way for you to reach your goals. However, no one seems to listen to your thoughts now. Although their disinterest can be a cause for your concern, staying focused on your final destination enables your peers to join in with their support once they see that you're making measurable progress. Your true allies will reveal themselves when you need them most."
sagittarius,2016-05-23,"Your willingness to adapt to the changing circumstances is an asset today, yet your flexibility is not a weakness. In fact, you may become quite stubborn in the defense of your performance if someone at work pushes you too hard. Don't let your pride tempt you to tell others what to do. Instead, inspire everyone to find his or her own unique path. Live by a variation of the Golden Rule and give people the same freedom of choice that you expect in return."
capricorn,2016-05-23,"Overcoming a fear that can be traced back to your childhood is hard work; but reality is now offering you a special opportunity to learn how to deepen your trust in those mysteries that are beyond your five senses. The diaphanous veil that hangs between the metaphysical worlds of thought and the physical world of things has grown thinner. You may even see visions when your eyes are closed. Usually you do best when relying strictly on the facts. However, you will give an amazing performance if you embrace your imagination, too."
aquarius,2016-05-23,"Strange ideas may pop into your awareness today, but they arrive in symbolic form rather than in words. Unfortunately, you might be required to step outside of your comfort zone to decipher the messages. Pay attention to your friends and associates for clues to help you crack the code, even if they seem to have nothing relevant to say. You must listen with every cell of your body to hear what's going on beneath the surface. Recognizing the restrictions of language enables you to see unrealized potential no matter where you look."
pisces,2016-05-23,You're cruising along on automatic pilot today as you express a simple desire to take care of others. But your revelation is not limited to a verbal disclosure on your part; it's more about how you live your life as a human. You aren't motivated by discussing your altruistic intentions now. Stop analyzing every doubt that floats through your brain. Initiate action before you talk yourself out of a perfectly fine strategy. Shine your light while you still have a chance.
aries,2016-05-24,"Communication grows more significant now and the best way to deal with the extra pressure is to manage your time wisely. Your friends take center stage and you want to bond with them by exploring a variety of interests. There are phone calls to return, places to go and people to see. Plus, there's that screenplay you've been dreaming about writing for years. The truth is your goals need a serious realignment. Set clear boundaries and make room for quiet self-reflection or you will get lost in all the noise."
taurus,2016-05-24,"Your self-confidence is on the rise and your enthusiasm is contagious. Although it's good news when your key planet Venus moves into your 2nd House of Values -- where she stays for the next three weeks -- trouble can arise if you ignore a lingering problem. Thankfully, shifting your focus to a wider perspective enables you to circumvent a difficult situation. Rather than worrying about your personal security, considering other people's wishes brings more emotional fulfillment. You are an integral part of a community and everyone's needs are interrelated."
gemini,2016-05-24,"You can be disarmingly charming and even an outrageous flirt when the mood strikes you. Now that cosmic-vixen Venus is visiting your sign for the next three weeks social interactions are in the spotlight, making this a time of great fun and games. Unfortunately, a Venus-Mars opposition will continue to expose buried issues even if you're living in a state of denial. There is no free lunch; emotional vulnerability accompanies the relationship dance. Happily, the benefits are satisfying if you're willing to engage with your heart and soul."
cancer,2016-05-24,"You like to rely on the absolute certainty of emotional support, and sometimes find yourself nostalgically craving the security you lost somewhere along the way. However, your subconscious drives are pulling you off the main roads now, making everything appear more magical even if you're not sure of what comes next. Enjoy the current side trip without fighting the inevitable. This little detour could turn into a journey of self-discovery if you let the universe take the wheel."
leo,2016-05-24,"Love can come knocking at your door now, yet it could be unrecognizable if you are too rigid in your expectations. Whether it's a romance or a friendship, there's no need to waste any energy wishing it to be something that it's not. Soak in whatever appreciation or admiration is offered, but don't get too caught up in thinking about what you deserve. If you can't honor the gifts that others bring to the table, they will likely lose interest and leave. Accept what is, let go of what was, and have faith in what will be."
virgo,2016-05-24,"You might suddenly feel a resurgence of your desire for success at work. You are more interested in how others view you in the outer world now that Venus is performing her magic in your 10th House of Public Status. However, you may have trouble meeting the expectations of others as your good intentions stir up more resistance than cooperation. Nevertheless, victory is yours if you're willing to do what you Virgos do best: pay attention to the day-to-day details regardless of the interference that comes from anyone else."
libra,2016-05-24,"You're painting a very rosy picture about your personal life while the Moon plays in your 5th House of Love and Children. But it's all too easy to turn an insignificant event into an overblown affair now that your key planet Venus is traveling through your 9th House of Big Ideas. Although you are easily distracted these days, keep bringing your feelings back to the immediate situation and deal with the reality of what's on your plate. Acting on your desires with confidence improves your chances to turn a romantic fantasy into something real."
scorpio,2016-05-24,"When you get close to someone you love, you yearn to merge your worlds without restraint. But today's dilemma involves the irrepressible tension between your desire to dig deep and a current penchant for lighthearted fun. It's easy to be distracted by one person after another while Venus is in flirtatious Gemini, yet it's challenging to discern if anyone is worthy of your undivided attention. Thankfully, there is no pressing need to make a decision immediately. It may be best to experiment with ambivalence now by letting your feelings ride with the wind."
sagittarius,2016-05-24,"The focus is shifting from desiring complex emotional entanglements to needing simplicity. All types of relationships are emphasized now that cosmic-butterfly Venus is flitting around in your 7th House of Partnerships. But even if you have a lot of responsibilities piling up, you're ready to let some of them slide to hang out with a friend. However, you can't just run out on your promises or your spontaneity will come back to haunt you. There is no elevator to success; you must take the stairs."
capricorn,2016-05-24,"You are uncharacteristically ready to let go of ambitions that don't inspire your soul, but you're not quite prepared to take the next step yet. Unfortunately, your natural resistance to the complications of diversity can limit your options now before you even consider them. Remember, external factors contain crucial information, so don't shut out the influx of data even if it seems overwhelming. Friendly Venus in scattered Gemini might be more annoying than attractive as she pulls your attention in too many directions. Starve your distractions and feed your dreams."
aquarius,2016-05-24,"Your friends may tempt you to act irresponsibly today, but irrational behavior isn't your friend. Your feelings are tickled into awareness yet you don't want to share them while the Moon is venturing through your 12th House of Privacy. Thankfully, Vivacious Venus helps you commandeer your fair share of fun while she sparkles in your 5th House of Spontaneity. Tom Robbins was speaking to you when he wrote, ""It's never too late to have a happy childhood."""
pisces,2016-05-24,"You can't help but be frustrated if familial duties require you to readjust your schedule today, for this requirement can remind you of a previous time when you were not in control. Responsibilities may prevent you from doing those things you prefer to do. But loving Venus is just beginning a three-week visit to your 4th House of Domesticity, drawing your attention away from the public eye. Luckily, you can strengthen your emotional foundation by attending to your current relationships without holding onto negativity from the past."
aries,2016-05-25,"Although everything at work appears to start out innocently enough today, trouble arises when you become so confident that you stop listening to the advice of anyone else. Thankfully, you can improve the direction of your day by taking everything you hear into consideration. Instead of brushing aside others who don't agree with your strategy, incorporate their ideas into your own even if it means questioning your original plan. As George Bernard Shaw wrote, ""Those who cannot change their minds cannot change anything."""
taurus,2016-05-25,"A powerful wind is blowing at your back now, filling the sails of your intentions and driving you into the future. Fortunately, your pragmatic approach to life prevents you from getting lost in idle fantasies and unrealistic dreams. But you may run into resistance from someone who thinks you are glossing over potential problems. It might seem less stressful to drop your plan in the name of compromise. However, sticking to your ideas is your best strategy even if you must navigate through troubled waters to reach your destination."
gemini,2016-05-25,"You're a champion at stepping around emotional sinkholes because you would rather keep things friendly and lighthearted. However, the Moon's conjunction with intense Pluto occurs in your 8th House of Deep Sharing, making it difficult to postpone a serious conversation with someone close to you. Don't worry if the process makes you feel uncomfortable; it's not all fun and games when a caterpillar evolves into a butterfly. Nevertheless, the wonderful outcome justifies the challenging transformation."
cancer,2016-05-25,"You're not afraid to maintain your fixed position today, even if someone tries to exert their authority to change your mind. Normally, you might choose to retreat in order to avoid a power struggle. However, you could surprise others with the fierceness of your reaction now. In fact, people may get more than they bargained for if they attempt to manipulate your feelings. Standing up for yourself can be hard work, but the results are worth the battles you encounter along the way."
leo,2016-05-25,"It's futile for your coworkers to argue with you today because you're determined to stick to your original plan no matter what they say. You are inspired by the simplicity of your strategy and, thankfully, have the words at your disposal to make your point. However, an associate may startle you by taking you to task about something you missed. Instead of covering up your mistake, embrace what you learn and modify your course of action accordingly. Your willingness to change for a good reason is a sign of strength, not a weakness."
virgo,2016-05-25,"The muse is with you today while the evocative Moon cozies up to evolutionary Pluto in your 5th House of Self-Expression. You feel as if nothing can hold you back or pull you off course. However, a curveball later in the day may shock you into realizing that everything isn't as transparent as you originally thought. Don't just throw your hands up in the air in despair. All your previous work will eventually make sense if you stick with your process and see where it takes you. Never second-guess the magic of creativity."
libra,2016-05-25,"Issues from the past might come back to haunt you today, but they're only problematic if you're unwilling to face them. In fact, dancing with the ghosts of your personal history can be surprisingly empowering and oddly liberating. Retelling an old story in a new light enables you to capitalize on the very same things that once restrained you. Dig into the origins of your current feelings, even if they make you feel vulnerable. As the psychologist Carl Jung wrote, ""I am not what happened to me. I am what I choose to become."""
scorpio,2016-05-25,"Your words have a profound impact today on those who hear them. The perceptive Moon-Pluto conjunction Pluto occurs in your 3rd House of Communication, influencing your interactions with others. However, people could be overwhelmed by your current intensity, causing them to withdraw suddenly without notice. Or, they might respond with a verbal attack that seems to come out of nowhere. In either case, the message is to tone down your rhetoric. What you say is as valid as ever; how you say it determines whether or not you make your point."
sagittarius,2016-05-25,"Working with your peers should be a piece of cake today because they genuinely appreciate your good ideas. However, your uneven progress makes it difficult for people to match your rhythm. Your coworkers are uncertain of your next move because your bursts of energy are mixed with periods of inactivity. Fortunately, you still can accomplish a lot because everyone wants to reach the same goal. If you want to benefit from the collaboration available to you now, slow down and try to maintain a constant pace that others can follow."
capricorn,2016-05-25,"Your certainty is unflappable today. You know what you're doing and where you are going; your coworkers must either support you or get out of your way. Your non-negotiable attitude sounds like a good idea in theory, but in practice leaves only a small margin of opportunity for others to volunteer their talents. Soften your approach if you want others to share in your success; your gentleness shows your strength now more than anything else."
aquarius,2016-05-25,"You are so strongly opinionated now that you might believe it's wise to keep your feelings to yourself, especially when your changing moods are so extreme. The Moon's powerful conjunction with passionate Pluto in your 12th House of Secrets enables you to hide your reaction to potentially explosive words. Unfolding your truth gradually is the most reliable path to simplifying complicated dynamics. As Sigmund Freud wrote, ""Unexpressed emotions will never die."""
pisces,2016-05-25,"Your intuition is on fire today and you are driven to make sure that everyone around you shares in your vision. However, explaining yourself in great detail won't muster the support you seek. In fact, even your most dependable allies may grow weary of your long and rambling monologue. Don't wait for someone's eyes to glaze over before you stop talking because by then it will be too late. Be concise; say what you mean and move on."
aries,2016-05-26,"You are eager to bolt fearlessly into the future without waiting for the red light to turn green. However, the Moon's presence in your 11th House of Long-Term Goals isn't enough to make everything work in your favor now. The real challenge is to maintain your high level of passion without impetuously disregarding the rules of the road. Although Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""Nothing great was ever achieved without enthusiasm,"" the trick is to channel your excitement into something productive."
taurus,2016-05-26,"You may seize an opportunity to earn some extra cash, achieve recognition for your work or simply make progress on a continuing project. However, it won't be a straightforward path today, even with sound logic and a solid plan on your side. Thankfully, there are no surprises now; any obstacles you encounter only remind you of what you already know. Keep one eye on your wallet and the other on your watch. Cleverly managing your resources is the key to your success."
gemini,2016-05-26,"Although your brain is busy generating big ideas these days, someone is likely to rain on your parade. Naturally, you prefer receiving encouragement from your friends and coworkers rather than criticism. However, taking the time to understand the constructive feedback means the difference between failure and success now. Don't let your pride get in the way of recognizing the truth. Most people can hear, but only a few truly listen."
cancer,2016-05-26,"Interpersonal dynamics are more complicated today, leading you to wonder whether this is the right time to sprint to the finish line. But it's unlikely that you can reach your destination on your own once the Moon settles into your 8th House of Shared Resources. You just want to call it a day, close up shop and head home. However, this is a critical moment that is testing your determination. Instead of bailing when times get tough, make a commitment to deepen those relationships which you know are part of your current journey."
leo,2016-05-26,"People seem a bit weirder than normal today, making it difficult to know who to trust with your future. Although you can see great potential in the creative visions of others, you're not ready to set aside your own needs and desires for the sake of someone else's. The more narrowly you focus now, the better your chances are to manifest your dreams. As Buddha said, ""The mind is everything; what you think you become."""
virgo,2016-05-26,"You might approach your regular tasks in a unique manner today, but you may not succeed even if your ideas are quite innovative. Resistance to your course of action isn't necessarily obvious now; it could come from hidden pockets of old family dynamics or current interpersonal tension. Thankfully, your positive attitude is sufficient to keep your plans afloat, even in the face of negativity. As cartoonist Matthew Inman writes, ""It's okay to color outside of the lines as long as it's beautiful."""
libra,2016-05-26,"It's disarmingly easy to stand on your soapbox and declare your intentions today because you assume that others will rush to join your cause. Unfortunately, even your closest friends may take some convincing to see your point of view. But there is no excuse for wasting your time or anyone else's. Fortunately, proper preparation enables you to deliver your message as succinctly as possible. Plenty of people dream of success, but others work hard to achieve it."
scorpio,2016-05-26,"Not only do your friends encourage you to pursue your brilliant ideas, but they are sensible enough to step out of your way if they can't be of immediate help. Nevertheless, it could be frustrating if there isn't the time or money needed to complete the tasks that are on your agenda now. There's no reason to be overly secretive about the obstacles you face while trying to reach your goals. As fairy-tale author Aesop wrote, ""Do not attempt to hide things which cannot be hidden."""
sagittarius,2016-05-26,"The light at the end of the tunnel appears bigger and brighter now as you approach it. However, there is a paradox at play; it seems the closer you get to your career goal, the longer it takes to get there. Optimistic Jupiter is beaming energy into your 10th House of Status, empowering you to spread your wings. But meanwhile, sobering Saturn in your 1st House of Self is setting up roadblocks in your path. Thankfully, you can make steady progress if you're willing to claim your power by remaining true to your values."
capricorn,2016-05-26,"Your appearance is misleading today, especially if you consciously go out of your way to camouflage your ambitious nature. Everyone thinks you are being uncharacteristically nonchalant about your future, but they couldn't be further from the truth. Nevertheless, stern Saturn's current posturing in your 12th House of Invisibility allows you to charm everyone by neatly burying your inner authority in your imagination where others can't see it. As author Aldous Huxley wrote, ""Facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored."""
aquarius,2016-05-26,"You possess a storehouse of personal power today. Unfortunately, your peers seem to be overly harsh in their judgment of your work. You can spend so much energy responding to the current criticism that you exhaust yourself before completing all the items on your agenda. Fortunately, the Moon's current visit to your conceptual sign enables you to remain emotionally detached. Engaging with others by sharing what's in your heart only becomes a problem when you become so attached to the outcome that you can't let go."
pisces,2016-05-26,"You are quite serious about getting ahead in your career now as you plot your way up the proverbial ladder of success. However, you can't deny that it's more enjoyable to hang out with a friend or lover who encourages you to consider other avenues of satisfaction, too. Just as you settle into a productive groove, you might feel as if you're being distracted from your work by your own drive for pleasure. But this isn't about choosing one path over the other; find a way to integrate Jupiter's expansive nature with Saturn's need for achievement. Do what makes you happy and be with those who make you smile."
aries,2016-05-27,"It's like you walked through a revolving door and have stepped out into a parallel universe. Relationship dynamics feel very familiar, as if you were here once before. Paradoxically, an emotional transformation that occurred in the beginning of the year is resurfacing and demanding your attention now. Fortunately, you have a chance to revisit these changes and solidify those that serve you best. Reflect only long enough to get your bearings before proceeding onto your next adventure. As Tom Petty sings, ""It's okay to look back, but it's best not to stare."""
taurus,2016-05-27,"A partnership that endures the tests of time is worth its weight in gold to you Bulls who crave consistency. As the pace of change began to speed up in the last couple of months, you may have nostalgically longed for a return to a simpler life. Although familiar interpersonal patterns are drawing you back into the past, you might need to navigate your way through a period of heightened complexity prior to finding the serenity you seek. Avoid making any impulsive moves out of frustration; it will take time to get what you want."
gemini,2016-05-27,"You don't mind playing games at work in order to stay in touch with your support network. However, sometimes office politics grow so complicated that even you can't figure out which strategy makes the most sense. You might have thought you were out of the deep water and riding a trajectory that will carry you to the heights of success. Instead, you may need to jump back in the fray now even if you're unsure you are up for the job. Push past your uncertainty; be determined about your goals and flexible about your methods."
cancer,2016-05-27,"Perhaps you started a creative path early in the year, only to put it on the back burner when your attention was required elsewhere. No doubt you're busy trying to keep up with your current responsibilities. You are being handed a chance to revisit the project you left behind as a reward for your hard work. Don't waste energy trying to figure out how a simple twist of fate brought you to this moment. Make a daily habit of following your dream until you see where it leads."
leo,2016-05-27,"You enjoyed a certain amount of freedom from domestic responsibilities over the past couple of months. However, family matters are once again calling and you must respond accordingly. Don't begrudge anyone else just because you would rather be pursuing your own goals rather than serving others. Nevertheless, the depth of feeling that can arise from taking care of the ones you love is enough to bring joy to your heart. There's no need to obsess about your long-term success when the real magic is very close to home."
virgo,2016-05-27,"Everything seems to be more urgent today and you might not be able to sustain the faster pace. In fact, you could be running from one small crisis to the next without making progress on your list of things to do. Oddly enough, you're still optimistic about catching up and getting ahead of the game. Thankfully, you possess the ability to create emotional distance in order to be analytical without bias. However, there's no reason to change your approach; good intentions plus hard work will lead to success soon enough."
libra,2016-05-27,"A new perspective on your finances enables you to revisit decisions you made earlier this year. Although parts of your strategy may have unfolded exactly according to your plan, you couldn't possibly anticipate every challenge that would need to be overcome. Fortunately, you are blessed with a second chance now to incorporate what you learned over the past few months. But don't wait; this kind of opportunity comes rarely and will pass quickly whether or not you take advantage of it."
scorpio,2016-05-27,"It may have seem as if last year's challenges were behind you but recent events suggest that there are still a few remaining ghosts to put to rest. Don't worry; this is not a permanent return to the past. You have made more headway than you realize on your path to achieve your long-term goals. It's just that you won't be free to manifest your dreams until you tie up as many loose ends as you can. Thankfully, you are receiving an energetic boost from the cosmos; act now while the force is with you."
sagittarius,2016-05-27,"You might feel as if circumstances are out of control and your attempts to manage them are restraining your forward progress. Naturally, you don't like covering old ground again; your imperative is to move full speed ahead. However, something very special awaits your discovery if you have enough courage to investigate the shadows that trail along behind you. Exploring buried emotions may temporarily derail your momentum but ignoring them could be catastrophic. The greatest treasures are those invisible to the eye but felt by the heart."
capricorn,2016-05-27,"Sometimes you think that social engagements are merely distractions that deter you from accomplishing your goals. However, the story is more complicated now as you find yourself spending more time with people who can actually increase your efficiency along the way. Nevertheless, it's a fine line that must be monitored on an ongoing basis. Don't be afraid to establish clear limits if you are pulled too far off track. Navigating that movable boundary between self-interest and group participation is tricky, but worth the extra effort in the long run."
aquarius,2016-05-27,"Although a recent conflict with an authority figure might be resolved on the surface, a deeper battle continues out of sight. Your position on the matter is quite clear to you, but others may not share your perspective. Instead of wasting time trying to prove you're right, look within yourself to discover your role in perpetuating this struggle. Avoid your natural tendency to intellectualize the dilemma or analyze the dynamics. As Johnny Depp said, ""People cry, but not because they are weak. It's because they've been strong for too long."""
pisces,2016-05-27,"It's time to resurrect a discarded dream that inspired you back in the beginning of this year. But perhaps you were subsequently required to redirect your focus to more mundane matters. Upon reconsideration, it turns out that your previous plans might not be as unrealistic as you once thought. There is no need for action today, but it is crucial to start the process of refining your vision. An adventure awaits; the sooner you commit to making it happen, the sooner your journey will begin."
aries,2016-05-28,"You love the idea of socializing with your friends yet you may discover that their interests are vastly different from yours today. At first, you're ready to head out on your own instead of modifying your plans for the sake of harmony. Nevertheless, it's smarter to soften your stance and consider acquiescing to the needs of others. However, your peace of mind is temporary, even if you enjoy the buzz of the crowd. Sufi mystic Omar Khayyam wrote, ""The thoughtful soul to solitude retires."""
taurus,2016-05-28,"Although the process of realization takes a while, it begins to dawn on you that you don't have to handle your regular load of responsibilities today. You still may spend time thinking about moneymaking opportunities, but you grow less concerned with material success throughout the day. Instead of trying to get ahead of the pack, your focus shifts to simply expressing yourself as freely as possible. Although you could get off to a false start, your attitude improves when you accept that it's more important to be true to your heart than to continue old habits that no longer serve you well."
gemini,2016-05-28,"You can talk your way around nearly anything as long as you aren't swept up in a rising tide of emotions. But once you become attached to a certain outcome, you can't see the myriad of possibilities that are right in front of your face. Don't settle for the path of least resistance now; you need to stand up and fight for what's rightfully yours. On one hand, you must be resolute when it comes to getting what you need. On the other hand, compromising with others makes your path easier to walk. The challenge is to find the sweet spot between honoring your heart and meeting the expectations of everyone else."
cancer,2016-05-28,"You may feel like a Crab out of water until the Moon floats into fishy Pisces later in the day. However, you're not interested in being limited by the synchronized swimming of all the other fish in the school. You're craving something entirely new and different without really caring if you're out of step with everyone else. Ultimately, following your own rhythm is exhilarating and brings you more pleasure now than you might imagine."
leo,2016-05-28,"Friends and relatives seem to be pushing your buttons today, and it's almost as if they're doing it on purpose. However, upon closer examination it becomes readily apparent that the real issue lies within you and not anyone else. Stop fighting against the prevailing winds; your life grows simpler when you are wise enough to discern the difference between those things that can and cannot be changed. Taking the high road shows your strength of character."
virgo,2016-05-28,"Everyone seems to think that you will continue marching to your own drummer and they assume you aren't interested in conforming to the consensus of the group. Although you might ruffle some feathers with your eclectic behavior today, there is an admirable precision to your actions. Your tendency is to explain your strategy in great detail, but all that talk won't help your case now. Instead, proceed with your original plans; your success is your best publicity."
libra,2016-05-28,"Sometimes saying no to a social invitation is essential for your emotional well-being, especially if there are specific things you wish to accomplish. Instead of falling into the trap of getting lost in someone else's agenda today, decide early in the day what you want to achieve and commit to making it happen. The feeling of deep satisfaction you will derive from following through with your plan will leave you smiling for days."
scorpio,2016-05-28,"A flurry of events shifts the spotlight to your relationship with your outer world. Although you may be content running errands and crossing things off your list now, you secretly long for a break in all the action. Thankfully, you'll get your chance later today if you're willing to prioritize your tasks so you can spend some time in quiet contemplation. Reconnecting with your inner world will bring you peace of mind and the wisdom to overcome any challenge."
sagittarius,2016-05-28,"Relationship tension is slowly building as you try to balance your needs with the desires of others. It's frustrating when your personal goals conflict with the wishes of someone you love. Rather than trying to smooth over the rough spots today, speak from the heart about the things that matter most to you. However, you must also take the time to listen to someone else's story, too. Although you may end up at a stalemate, compassion overcomes the emotional distance created by fear or ignorance. Agreeing to disagree is a viable option."
capricorn,2016-05-28,"You might feel as if you're being pulled in several different directions at once. Unfortunately, you don't do well when there is no concrete plan in place. Even if someone is annoyed at your need for a detailed schedule, map out your day the best you can. Nevertheless, circumstances could change and your evening may still take you down an unexpected path. Finding that middle road between rigidity and chaos leads to a memorable experience."
aquarius,2016-05-28,"Making up your mind is not the easiest thing to do today. In fact, you might surprise everyone with how quickly you can change your stripes. However, any uncertainty you experience during the day could vanish in an instant when the lightning strikes and you see the ultimate truth. This kind of ""aha"" experience can be a profound moment, but avoid trying to explain your epiphany to everyone else. Mere words can't convey the magic of serendipity."
pisces,2016-05-28,"It may seem as if your weekend is being hijacked because you have so much work to do this morning. Thankfully, your busyness will pay off sooner than you expect if you are strategic with your schedule. However, you need to take charge in order to make something special happen. Although you might not feel ready to relax until nighttime, the high level of mental and social stimulation acts as a tonic for your soul."
aries,2016-05-29,"Your imagination may be running unchecked today, enabling you to express yourself creatively in ways that are usually beyond your grasp. Others are duly impressed with your silver-tongued soliloquies and charismatic charm while you secretly struggle over every word you say. Don't spend too much energy in your current search for perfection or you might lose your connection with the muse that's inspiring your efforts. Channeling the messages of the cosmos is only possible when you get out of your own way."
taurus,2016-05-29,"You might spend some of the day lost in a utopian dream of social harmony. However, the confusing Moon-Neptune conjunction colors your perspective now, leading you to believe that everything is in order when it is not. You could inadvertently be the catalyst that tips the scales and sets change into motion today. Don't worry if you feel as if you're in limbo since it will likely take over a week to get your feet back on the ground. In the meantime, embracing the unknown keeps you in the game."
gemini,2016-05-29,"An awkward cloud of disillusionment may follow you today, preventing you from seeing the love that's all around you. Although the tension in the air is palpable, your clever wit and social finesse can cover any negativity so thoroughly that others don't even know it's there. The problem is that everything will come out in the open sooner or later, and it grows more troublesome the longer you wait. Share what's on your mind, even if you don't know where the conversation will lead. Standing in your truth is better than living a lie."
cancer,2016-05-29,"There are so many thoughts flowing through your mind today that it's nearly impossible to jump into the rushing stream of consciousness and reveal your inner process. Instead of setting yourself up for frustration, take a bit of quiet time away from the pressure of interaction. Contemplating the unanswerable questions of the day need not be a struggle unless you mistakenly believe that you must come up with the right answers. Paradoxically, it is your search for truth that creates reality."
leo,2016-05-29,"You could easily misjudge someone's intentions today if you jump to erroneous conclusions based upon your wishes. Rather than assuming you know what other people are feeling now, employ the radical strategy of actually asking them. Pay close attention to what you hear because the most important stuff is happening in the spaces between the words -- and will be all too easy to miss. Nevertheless, you can hear the music in the silence if you simply take the time to listen."
virgo,2016-05-29,"You want real solutions to the uncertainties you face in relationships now. Unfortunately, people won't be pinned down by your need to know; they will remain elusive no matter how hard you push for a commitment. Ironically, you have a better chance of finding emotional satisfaction if you allow others to drift in and out of their fantasies without making anyone feel guilty. Focus on your own dreams and let sleeping dogs lie."
libra,2016-05-29,"You may have plenty of chores lined up for today, but it's impossible to get much done if you don't know where to start. Creating a list of things to do is easy but trying to set priorities is enough to drive you crazy, especially if you feel overwhelmed by all the details. Nevertheless, there is much to gain if you can figure out a way to express your imagination without having it disrupt your day. Integrating your visions into your everyday life offers you a workable path toward manifest your dream."
scorpio,2016-05-29,"Relationship dynamics feel like tight ropes today as you precariously balance in the middle. On one hand, opportunities seem to exist but only if you focus on one specific outcome. On the other hand, your fantasies of love could lure you into a world of pipe dreams. Where you go from here is your choice, but you may not have to go anywhere at all just yet. Decisions must be made eventually but the less you struggle in the meantime, the better."
sagittarius,2016-05-29,"It sounds like a broken record these days, but a bit of self-discipline goes a long way to keep you on track. There are so many interesting people in your life that it would be all too easy to forget about your responsibilities while you pursue pleasurable activities. Nevertheless, as attractive as someone's offer might seem, the transient satisfaction will dissipate so quickly it will make your head spin. Hold out for the real deal; your dance with destiny is well worth the wait."
capricorn,2016-05-29,"It is the best of times and it is the worst of times. Never before have there been such amazing technological tools at your disposal. However, the human experiment seems to be failing in so many places. Although you feel a deep connection to these extremes, you can't fix everything. The same is true in your personal life; rather than looking back with a critical eye, look ahead and focus on something tangible you can do that will produce an immediate positive impact."
aquarius,2016-05-29,"You're a futurist at heart, but you can't seem to find your way out of the past. Your values are being tested as long as you're in a relationship that appears to contradict one of your core beliefs. Instead of berating yourself for falling short of your own expectations or blaming anyone else, set new goals and concentrate on achieving them. But don't expect success overnight; real change cannot be rushed."
pisces,2016-05-29,"People seeking your wise counsel may see you in a very different light than you see yourself. They might even put you on a pedestal in the role of a spiritual teacher or guru. In contrast, you secretly worry that you've lost your way and have little to offer others. You could grow frustrated if you attempt to eliminate your current confusion. Fortunately, you don't have to do anything today to resolve these two different perspectives. Just continue to show up as honestly as you can without trying to prove anything to anyone. Your faith shines through your sincerity."
aries,2016-05-30,"Although you need the rest, you might find it challenging to step away from your regular grind today. Unfinished business takes precedence over anything else because deadlines are drawing near. Nevertheless, carving out some time for friends and family is a good idea, whether or not there are more chores still to be done. Balancing work with play requires astute time management. Luckily, it will be easy to play catch-up after the Moon shifts into enthusiastic Aries, giving you a much-needed jolt of energy."
taurus,2016-05-30,"Your day unfolds on a dual track, prompting you to straddle the boundary between two worlds. On one hand, you thrive on conversing with anyone who is willing to explore difficult topics that shake the foundations of your thinking. On the other hand, your patience is wearing thin and you want to steer clear of heavy discussions so you can kick back and relax. Don't try to sacrifice one path for the other. Do your best to play at both ends of the spectrum until the dilemma resolves on its own."
gemini,2016-05-30,"You might see yourself as the leader of the pack, but you're more than willing to relinquish the responsibility to nearly anyone who will take it today. The notion of being the boss is quite different than the practical side of acting in a leadership position. Nevertheless, you can intuitively figure out the dynamics of a situation very quickly and create a game plan almost instantaneously. But thankfully, you know that your strategy is only one of many now, and you're just as happy if you are free to pursue your own dreams."
cancer,2016-05-30,"You're able to soar in your imagination when you feel emotionally secure amongst friends and family. You truly believe that you can be anything you wish and go anywhere your heart desires. It's especially satisfying to open your heart now and reveal some of the items on your secret bucket list. You don't even need to justify your choices, because you already know who is on your team. Thankfully, you can count on your loved ones to lift your spirits and support your dreams."
leo,2016-05-30,"A day of socializing sounds just about perfect to you playful Lions. However, you're so excited that you could try to squeeze too much fun into your schedule. Allowing yourself time to linger at an event improves your chances of meeting someone special today. You might even begin a new friendship that eventually turns into a business relationship or romantic interest. You can't lose if you surround yourself with good people and partake in the give and take of a friendly conversation."
virgo,2016-05-30,"No one seems to want to assume responsibility for making any decisions today. Unfortunately, a social event may come dangerously close to falling apart because everyone expects someone else to take charge. Normally, this kind of evasive behavior would make your skin crawl; but you just look at the situation now and shrug your shoulders. It's not that you don't care; it's just that you have faith in the group process and believe that everything will work out in due time."
libra,2016-05-30,"Your generous spirit is inspirational to all those you encounter today. Although you might not be as detail-oriented as others prefer, you're wholeheartedly committed to creating a memorable experience for your audience. Additionally, you may believe that it's your duty to do whatever you can in order to keep everyone in your world working and playing in harmony. Others appreciate how you go the extra mile now as long as you know when to stop."
scorpio,2016-05-30,"You see the need for significant adjustments to your daily schedule and you're confident you can make the necessary changes once you put your mind to it. Unfortunately, advanced planning isn't an antidote when the twists and turns of the day defy logic. Just make sure to choose your company carefully because connecting with people who appreciate your ideas makes you feel more optimistic about your future. Ultimately, the only limits that stand in your way are the ones that exist in your mind."
sagittarius,2016-05-30,You may be unsure of your recent decisions but don't want everyone to know about your loss of confidence today. You're concerned that your current bout with self-doubt might unnecessarily worry others or damage your reputation. It could be helpful to retreat to a safe place and rethink your options. But don't exclude those you love; overcome your fear of vulnerability by confiding in a trustworthy companion. Discussing your feelings with the right person might be all you need to put things back in proper perspective.
capricorn,2016-05-30,"It's surprisingly easy for you to shift into a more social mode today, especially if there are festivities on your calendar. But even in the midst of hanging out with your best friends, your thoughts keep returning to unfinished business. Thankfully, you don't need to dwell on your responsibilities now; your right to relax is well-earned and there's no reason to harbor guilt about enjoying the present moment. You are in charge of your feelings, so choose happiness while you can."
aquarius,2016-05-30,"You're up for nearly anything today and are quick to abandon your agenda to join in on the fun. Happily, floating through a day of social activities takes your mind off your mundane problems. However, you grow bored of talking about subjects that don't touch your soul or stimulate your creativity. Rather than shutting down so you don't rock the boat, bring up a topic that excites you to the core. Use your fantasies to fuel the group dynamic; your spark can become a flame that ignites the world."
pisces,2016-05-30,"Your soulful approach to the day enables you to find transcendent beauty in everyone and spiritual meaning in everything. An activity as simple as catching up on family matters deepens emotional bonds between you and those you love. There's no need to pursue intense metaphysical conversations at the edge of the universe now when you have everything you need in your immediate environment. The more you celebrate your life, the more there is in life to celebrate."
aries,2016-05-31,"A well-thought-out plan could advance your agenda when it comes to scheduling your time for the next few days. However, your natural tendency to act before you think is heightened now that the Moon is camped out in your spontaneous sign. Thankfully, your conscious intentions can override an unproductive habit. Be careful about jumping to erroneous conclusions; do your necessary homework so you don't overlook any important information. Unseen details are the difference between failure and success."
taurus,2016-05-31,"A peaceful easy feeling is nothing to complain about unless you're so mellow today that you miss an opportunity to share a moneymaking idea with your peers. In fact, your complacency could tempt you to relax rather than applying yourself to achieve a real goal. Taking a little time off can be quite invigorating in the long run, but might send the wrong message to a watchful audience. Thankfully, it's not an all-or-nothing proposition, making this a perfect time to practice the fine art of balancing work with play."
gemini,2016-05-31,"You are ready to launch into the future right now, and there isn't much that can stand in your way. The pioneering Aries Moon energizes your 11th House of Friends and Wishes, encouraging you to think about where you are going and how to get there. Unfortunately, life is more complicated than ever, making it tricky to get all your ducks in a row prior to moving ahead. Luckily, once the major pieces are in order, everything else should fall into place."
cancer,2016-05-31,"You're capable of giving a special kind of nurturing love and you're ready to take it public today. You wish you had the power to protect everyone at work and shield them from the stresses of the day. But your desire to safeguard others is only useful if your assistance is requested. Don't go meddling in people's affairs, especially if there are messy emotional dynamics to clean up in your own life. Be caring but not overbearing."
leo,2016-05-31,"Sometimes your inner child won't be denied when it wants to come out and play. In fact, you're dying to stir up a bit of mischief today in search of adventure, but a little voice in the back of your head prevents you from swinging into action. Thankfully, Saturn is protecting you by offering a sensible perspective now and, hopefully, you're wise enough to listen. The most obvious sign of maturity is being able to defer gratification until the time is right."
virgo,2016-05-31,"The communication gods are working on your behalf now, facilitating conversations with interesting people. Your words are like arrows to the hearts of others; your ideas are compelling and your delivery is true to aim. Nevertheless, you're afraid of saying too much which leads you to silence rather than talk. Extreme all-or-nothing reactions might upset those closest to you and leave you exhausted in the process. There is a middle-of-the-road path to follow if you can find it. But don't wait; he who hesitates is lost."
libra,2016-05-31,"Someone might be annoying today because they won't stop pestering you. You want options; they want results. Meanwhile, you would prefer sitting back and contemplating all the possibilities without committing to one course of action. Your frustration grows as external demands increase, prompting you to make a choice before you're ready. Unfortunately, your good intentions could backfire unless you honor your process. Don't rush anything; trust yourself before anyone else."
scorpio,2016-05-31,"You may be less concerned with doing the right thing today than you are with getting your work done prior to a set deadline. You're usually not one to take any shortcuts because your integrity is your prime directive. You think you're willing to pay the price and sacrifice quality for convenience now, but it still might not be such a smart idea. Don't downplay your high standards; enduring self-esteem is worth much more than a fleeting moment of satisfaction or approval."
sagittarius,2016-05-31,"You can count on your own efforts with a higher degree of reliability than assuming someone else will come through for you today. In fact, your coworkers might seem too busy to lend you a hand. And, even if others agree to help you now, they are easily distracted by their personal agendas. Meanwhile, your creative instincts are strong, inspiring you to strike out on your own. Dream up a solution, make a plan, and stick with it until you reach your desired destination."
capricorn,2016-05-31,"Oddly enough, your enterprising instincts may not be apparent to everyone else yet. However, there's plenty of creative ideas germinating within the privacy of your mind. But there's no need to share your newest inspiration with anyone until you are ready. In the meantime, focus on your most innovative thoughts and continue to polish them until they shine. There is no way to predict the  reactions of others, so wait until you feel you're standing on stable ground before taking the next step."
aquarius,2016-05-31,"Moving into the future is exciting when you see potential for positive growth everywhere you look. You hold a tiny seed in your hand yet it appears to you as a beautiful flower. However, manifesting your dreams takes blood, sweat and tears. Don't be impatient; amazing things can happen when you allow a tree to bear fruit on its schedule and not yours."
pisces,2016-05-31,"Going the extra mile today does more than demonstrate your commitment to success -- it actually sets the tone for the rest of the week. Rather than drifting through the day and responding to events as they happen, set clear objectives and make an ambitious action plan. Following a preset agenda enables you to accomplish more than you ever thought possible. According to Oprah Winfrey, ""Luck is a matter of preparation meeting opportunity."""
aries,2016-06-01,"You're not worried about facing a little opposition today; in fact, you're looking forward to it. There's nothing like the heat of battle to get the adrenaline flowing for a combative Aries. Exercising self-restraint on your part is highly unlikely when the Moon collides with explosive Uranus in your sign. However, you may be fighting imaginary windmills in the absence of a real enemy. It's best to sit this round out and see how you feel tomorrow before stirring up a hornet's nest for no reason at all."
taurus,2016-06-01,"You may question your own values today, especially if you encounter someone who shocks you with an entirely new perspective on your life. At first, you might be quite resistant to such a different approach, but the more you hear, the more intriguing it becomes. Since you're not one to change your mind easily, it's rather disquieting to entertain the notion that your faulty assumptions are obstacles to your success. Thankfully, there's no need for finality yet. Keep an open mind and see where this line of thinking leads."
gemini,2016-06-01,"It's disconcerting when the winds of fate shift directions without notice. Although you're aware of the abrupt change, you're not willing to trust your senses just yet. Additionally, you wonder if your situation is stabilizing or if this is just another cosmic whim. Instead of panicking because you don't know what to do, stay conscious of the present moment without trying to solidify your plans. As Eckhart Tolle writes, ""When you become comfortable with uncertainty, infinite possibilities open up in your life."""
cancer,2016-06-01,"Your sudden reversal on a previous decision could surprise others at work today, but your behavior isn't nearly as shocking as it seems. It is becoming increasingly obvious that your path is not leading you into the future you desired. It's as if old dreams found new life, causing you to obsess about them. But bluntly announcing your plans may be unnecessarily dramatic and counterproductive. Letting others in on your process along the way is more inclusive than simply issuing a final decree. Sharing is caring."
leo,2016-06-01,"You're quite sure that you're on the road to success no matter how many times you alter your course today. However, there may be a touch of denial that fuels your brash confidence. Instead of waiting until circumstances wear you down, demonstrate your strength by revealing your uncertainty to your allies. There is a fine line between inspiration and delusion; entertain all possibilities while you dance at this edge of reality."
virgo,2016-06-01,"You take pride in your ability to analyze the facts and astutely discern which information is most useful. However, you can't rely on your favorite tools today if you open your toolbox and they're nowhere to be found. It's alleged that Albert Einstein once wrote on a blackboard, ""Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted counts."" As the Sun squares surreal Neptune now, it's your turn to step beyond the measurable world and find meaning in that which exists only in the realms of imagination."
libra,2016-06-01,"Relationships may be the source of angst today because people seem to care more about their own agendas than the good of all. Sometimes it's necessary to reestablish your priorities and put your needs at the top of the list. However, you just want others to stop and consider the impact of their behavior before it's too late. Unfortunately, assuming a holier-than-thou position fosters anger rather than cooperation. Share your frustration without blaming anyone else; taking the moral high ground now requires an extra dose of finesse."
scorpio,2016-06-01,"Mixed signals from coworkers cast long shadows, making it difficult to see the truth in a clear light. You might not be able to keep up with all the changes on the job while the Moon conspires with unpredictable Uranus in your 6th House of Work. You may even feel as if the whole world's gone mad. You're willing to let go of your preconceived agenda today, but you can't figure out what to replace it with. Your current mission is to practice patience, for a new level of stability will emerge out of the chaos if you surrender control."
sagittarius,2016-06-01,"You are genuinely surprised when you realize that you read the current situation incorrectly. Abe Lincoln said, ""If you look for the bad in people expecting to find it, you surely will."" But your desire to see the best in others could prompt you to make assumptions that turn out to be false. Your coworkers might envy your ability to convert your positive thoughts into something concrete. However, blind optimism will only land you into hot water. An overdue reality check may be just what you need to put your feet back on the ground."
capricorn,2016-06-01,"Unlike some of your peers, you grow uneasy when everything starts coming up roses. It's not that you're a pessimist; you prefer being called a realist. Nevertheless, it seems as if you're walking a tightrope now as you balance the pros and cons of your current trajectory with an abyss of uncertainty on either side. The stress is created by your fear of the fall; however, the danger exists only within your imagination. Instead of worrying about what could go wrong, focus on what will go right."
aquarius,2016-06-01,"You might capitalize on unexpected changes today because your razor-sharp mind appears to have a direct connection with your lightning-fast tongue. But just because you can out talk nearly anyone doesn't mean that you're speaking the truth. Unfortunately, you are so convincing now that you'll believe whatever you say right along with everyone else. Monitor your words before they create more problems than they solve. Promise less and deliver more."
pisces,2016-06-01,"People find you nearly impossible to read today because your words and your actions don't seem to match. It's not that you're being duplicitous; it's just that your inner life is richer and more complex now than anyone can imagine, and they can't solve the enigma of you. Fortunately, you don't need to explain yourself. Dwelling in the realms of paradoxical mysteries seems like home to you, even if others don't understand. The less you reveal, the more they will wonder."
aries,2016-06-02,"You can be extremely persuasive when you tell someone that you are ready to change your ways. In fact, you are so convincing that you might even believe it yourself. But no matter how good your intentions are today, your follow through will be lacking unless you are willing to be honest when talking about what you want. Although Oscar Wilde wrote, ""The truth is rarely pure and simple,"" denying it does not change the facts. Transparency is a show of strength."
taurus,2016-06-02,"It's one thing when love is in the air yet quite another when it precipitates down to earth. There is a practical side to your unfulfilled dreams now that motivates you to make them come true. Although achieving satisfaction may be more challenging than you prefer, don't trivialize the power of your romantic fantasies. The act of reaching for what you want is the first step toward manifestation. Nothing ventured, nothing gained."
gemini,2016-06-02,"You're not interested in revealing too much about your personal needs today. You might think it's easier to get exactly what you want by winning someone over with your silver tongue and twinkling eyes than sharing what's in your heart. However, you can create a situation that will lead to disappointment unless you're truthful about your feelings from the start. Demonstrate your emotional maturity by discussing the inconsistencies in your desires, even if it's not what others expect to hear. Build your relationships on solid ground rather than shifting sands if you want them to last."
cancer,2016-06-02,"Obviously, you expect your friends to be reliable, offering you sensible feedback and advice you can trust. But it's nearly impossible to know who really has your back because too many people respond by smiling and nodding yes, without really understanding your dilemma. Unfortunately, you might just have to take a risk today because there's no way to tell in advance who will step up to the plate and engage in a real heart-to-heart interaction. If your conversation hits a dead end, retreat and try again. One day you will look back and be glad you didn't give up."
leo,2016-06-02,"You think your goals are within reach today, but you encounter more complications than you expect. Your mind wanders easily now, challenging you to finish anything you start. Additionally, everyone else's activities seem more interesting, tempting you to explore everything except what's on your own plate. You're not going to squelch your imagination; the more you try, the stronger it grows. Instead, encouraging your creativity by scheduling short breaks is revitalizing, enabling you to return to work focused and ready to take on the world."
virgo,2016-06-02,"You might waste precious time today trying to clean up a recent misunderstanding. Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that you'll untangle the mess simply by giving it your undivided attention. Your desires are coloring your perceptions now, making it difficult to find the truth. Don't be quick to put the blame on someone else since you probably share the responsibility for the current confusion. Take a few steps back from any troubling situation. Giving yourself a little breathing room enables you to reengage with a fresh perspective."
libra,2016-06-02,"The relationship dance you must do today is challenging because the music seems to change without warning. Just as your communication settles into a natural rhythm, the tempo switches and leaves you feeling awkward. However, you can maintain your grace and navigate your way through this tricky territory if you follow rather than lead. You can still accomplish your goals as long as you don't fall into the trap of trying to take total control."
scorpio,2016-06-02,"Whatever you believe could actually manifest today. Although this sounds like good news, you may not be happy with the results. For example, if you think that someone is being too stubborn, they might just live up to your expectations -- and it won't be easy to pinpoint your role in creating this reality. Fortunately, you can prevent your day from spinning out of control by remaining adaptable to the needs of others. A sign of intelligence is the ability to respond to change without missing a step."
sagittarius,2016-06-02,"You may need to play the role of a heavyweight today because people don't seem to be holding up their end of the deal. You prefer encouraging others to follow their bliss rather than authoritatively telling them what they can't do. Nevertheless, it's crucial to realize that pie-in-the-sky thinking won't accomplish much unless it's backed up with a practical plan and hard work. Don't forget that it's more effective to lead from the front of the pack than from behind."
capricorn,2016-06-02,"Your fantasies are like hot air balloons now, each one lifting you far above reality and into the colorful realms of your imagination. No matter how much you want to lose yourself in your daydreams, you have an ambitious agenda and will not be swayed from your course. Thankfully, you can let most of the distractions float away without you; you won't miss them once they are gone. Remember, today's determination leads to tomorrow's success."
aquarius,2016-06-02,"You can imagine all the best parts of being in love today. In fact, your brain has become a fantasy generator that doesn't have an off switch. Although this creative outlet can be a lot of fun, it may lead you into trouble if you cross the line. Thankfully, you understand that some thoughts are better kept to yourself. Nevertheless, there are appropriate times and places to share your dreams with someone special. Real vulnerability builds bridges to stronger relationships."
pisces,2016-06-02,"Relationships grow overwhelming when powerful emotions bend reality out of shape. Sometimes there is a fine line between flights of fancy and the messy truth of love. Fortunately, you have experience at finding your way around the mists of illusion; however, it can be both wonderful and confusing if your romantic fantasies are mirrored back to you by another person. Life holds special magic for those who dare to dream."
aries,2016-06-03,"You can amaze people with your never-ending stream of good ideas, but sometimes your execution is less than impressive. You are now faced with a daunting task as unforgiving Saturn requires you to solidify your long-term plans or walk away from them. If you know in your heart that you should proceed today, concentrate all of your energy on making your dreams come true. This is not a decision to be made lightly; the consequences of your current actions will resound for a long time to come."
taurus,2016-06-03,"Working as part of a team is complicated enough, even when everyone is on the same page. The complexity of group interactions is more challenging when people have different goals in mind. You can't just continue pretending that there is true collaboration until you review and refine your mutual objectives. Disagreement is not a problem unless it's ignored. Keep in mind that strength comes from diversity, so find common ground and push on from there."
gemini,2016-06-03,"It's nearly impossible to pin you down because you like to keep your options open. Although you may see amazing possibilities everywhere you look today, others might need more structure in order to continue working with you. Don't overreact by running off to pursue your own interests, since you will accomplish much more through the process of collaboration. Narrow your focus, make a commitment and be thankful that your support network is in place."
cancer,2016-06-03,"It might seem as if your life is opening up like a flower and your vision of the future holds more promise than ever. Unfortunately, your best ideas could fade into oblivion if you're unwilling to adhere to a tight schedule. Your fantasies have inspired you long enough and you must give them form now or let them go. As Napoleon Hill wrote, ""A goal is a dream with a deadline."""
leo,2016-06-03,"As much as you enjoy participating in a group effort, you still need to set consistent boundaries in order to be successful. Ironically, you'll be able to contribute more in the long run if you know when to say no. Spreading yourself too thin won't help anyone, especially yourself. Finishing one task before starting another garners respect from your peers and is beneficial for all involved. Even the most generous people have their limits."
virgo,2016-06-03,"It takes less effort to shine in the workplace now than it does to look good at home. But no matter how challenging personal relationships are at this time, they offer more potential for your development than anything else. Don't try to escape from a discussion about a sensitive topic even if you're unsure of its purpose. Oddly enough, when you have the courage to confront your fears with someone you love, you will also experience positive changes in the rest of your life."
libra,2016-06-03,"There are many times when sitting on the fence serves you well, but ambiguity has no place in your world at this time. Although you might be uncertain about where your current path will lead, you must make a decision, nonetheless. Visualize an ideal future and imagine that you are already on your way. Choosing one direction now starts the ball rolling even if you change your mind later on. Modifications will be easier once you're in motion. As Albert Einstein quipped, ""Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance, you must keep moving."""
scorpio,2016-06-03,"You might go along with the group consensus today in order to maintain the peace. However, you could do more harm than good if you agree with others without regard to your own needs. Although an argument is not fun in the moment, it clears the air of unspoken emotional tension. It's crucial to stay true to your values now, even if they differ from everyone else's. Thankfully, it's not hard to make a choice when you know where you stand."
sagittarius,2016-06-03,"You may be the biggest obstacle in your path these days, yet overcoming your own shortcomings is probably easier than you think. Instead of focusing on your ultimate destination, pull back into the present moment and handle each crisis as it arises. Harboring big hopes for the future can be quite inspiring, yet inflated dreams are a recipe for disappointment now. There's nothing wrong with expecting miracles as long as you remember to balance them with a healthy dose of pragmatism."
capricorn,2016-06-03,"Although you're the champion of making plans that lead to success, it's tricky to give structure to an unformed vision. Nevertheless, you're driven to crystallize your dreams because you're afraid they will vanish if you don't make them real now. Unfortunately, too much organization can kill the organic process of creativity. Rein in your fantasies enough to work with them, but not so much that they die in the process."
aquarius,2016-06-03,"You think you're pretty clever now as you expound one brilliant idea after another. Unfortunately, your coworkers don't necessarily share in your enthusiasm. Much to your surprise they are judgmental of your idealism, demanding that you be more practical in your thinking. Don't just throw your hands up in despair and relinquish your dreams. Instead, temper your creativity enough to satisfy your critics, for they could be your most loyal supporters in the end."
pisces,2016-06-03,"Plato wrote, ""The harder you work, the luckier you get."" In fact, your current blood, sweat and tears create profound positive influence on your career objectives. Your hopes and dreams were necessary to bring you to this moment, but now you must take the bull by its horns and wrestle your best ideas into existence. Although the going may be tough, it's just reality's way to push you past the limitations and onto the road of success."
aries,2016-06-04,"The truth seems so self-limiting that you could change your mind in an instant for a chance to escape. The airy Gemini New Moon falls in your 3rd House of Communication, allowing your thoughts to fly on nearly any breeze that comes along. Unfortunately, your basic perceptions of reality may be compromised now, especially if you see a way to make life easier for yourself. Nevertheless, shortcuts are not advised; ultimately choosing one path and staying on it until you reach your destination is the most reliable route to success."
taurus,2016-06-04,"Releasing old ideas about generating income creates room for newer and better ones. The multitasking Gemini New Moon occurs in your 2nd House of Finances, encouraging innovative thinking that allows moneymaking strategies to take root. However, the presence of idealistic Neptune and realistic Saturn requires you to weed impractical dreams and schemes from your garden of prosperity. Keeping it simple and following through with responsible behavior is rewarded by the fruits of your labor."
gemini,2016-06-04,"Although your life may be settling into a steady rhythm, be prepared to revise your plans on a moment's notice. Thankfully, you know better than to hold onto your past while the restless Gemini New Moon pushes the restart button in your 1st House of Self. But patience is not your strong suit and you could grow anxious if change doesn't happen right away. Don't allow frustration to get the best of you. Letting go of excess baggage leaves room for happiness in the future."
cancer,2016-06-04,"Your dreams are luring you away from your social time today. You're tempted to seek out quiet places where you can contemplate the meaning of life. Although the inquisitive Gemini New Moon disappears into your 12th House of Escapism, you won't be able to ignore your daily activities. Figuring out where you fit into the larger scheme of things should be at the top of your list. Eliminate distractions and focus on your ideal future instead of allowing yourself to be pulled in several directions."
leo,2016-06-04,"Just when you thought you had a clear view of the future the restless Gemini New Moon shakes up your 11th House of Long-Term Goals, motivating you to create new friendships that reflect your current interests. Don't hesitate to let go of old expectations that seem to have lost their relevance. Look beyond the current moment to see the boundless potential. Wipe your slate clean so you can make up a new story. Put your faith in your dreams rather than in the limitations of reality."
virgo,2016-06-04,"Office politics might seem more complicated these days, motivating you to think about creating new relationship patterns on the job. However, it's nearly impossible to make up your mind while the whimsical Gemini New Moon activates your 10th House of Public Responsibility. Although you want to manifest long-term career changes, your thoughts may be racing too fast for your own good. Nevertheless, reevaluating your professional goals should be a top priority now. Slow down so the elusive resolution you're chasing can catch up to you."
libra,2016-06-04,"Your brain is buzzing with so many outrageous ideas today, you wonder if any of them are actually worthy of your exploration. Nevertheless, the adaptable Gemini New Moon soars through your 9th House of Distant Horizons, instilling you with fresh hope for your future. You can't decide whether to take a risk and share your plans now or to keep them to yourself. Don't get lost in endless analysis when the choice is simple. If your current strategy is realistic, it will have lasting value in your personal life."
scorpio,2016-06-04,"You're known for your decisive nature, but forcing a resolution to an emotional matter won't provide the relief you need today. You may experience uncharacteristic confusion about a significant relationship as the changeable Gemini New Moon seeks expression in your 8th House of Deep Sharing. This New Moon's tense square with otherworldly Neptune tempts you with fantasies that fly in the face of facts. Fortunately, this alignment also encourages compassion that salves old wounds. As Mother Theresa said, ""If we really want to love, we must learn how to forgive."""
sagittarius,2016-06-04,Relationships seem unstable while the dualistic Gemini New Moon directs its focus on your 7th House of Others. But tough aspects to this New Moon might weaken your connection with a partner if you can't discern fantasies from reality. Take your time before choosing a new direction because most ideas will sound better now than they actually are. Employing cautious optimism is wiser than letting your blind faith run amok.
capricorn,2016-06-04,"The pleasure you receive from your personal life now can distract you from your current obligations. Nevertheless, the scattered Gemini New Moon rocks your 6th House of Daily Routine, motivating you to analyze a variety of potential courses of action available to you. Unfortunately, a never-ending flow of daydreams could exhaust you mentally while a long list of chores remains untouched. Too much thinking creates problems today; get out of your head and into your life."
aquarius,2016-06-04,"All the pieces are in place for you to make a clean break from your past. The adaptable Gemini New Moon rattles your 5th House of Spontaneity, illuminating the difference between your future ambitions and how you want to enjoy the present moment. As long as you stay aware of the opposite forces during this exciting yet disruptive time, everything just might turn out copacetic. As the Grateful Dead sang, ""When life looks like Easy Street, there is danger at your door."""
pisces,2016-06-04,"Focusing on the here and now is complicated when you can see so far into the future. Nevertheless, the logical Gemini New Moon digs into your 4th House of Roots, empowering you to carefully plant the seeds of your intentions. Meanwhile, spacey Neptune blurs your boundaries, inspires your dreams and also sows confusion on the home front. Solid ground shakes like tectonic plates if you commit to more than you can handle. Taking small steps is the fastest way to get to your destination without getting lost."
aries,2016-06-05,"Although Sundays may be a day of rest for some, you might have a difficult time finding the off switch today. Nevertheless, you believe that you have earned a quick escape as a reward for all that you've been through recently. Unfortunately, the universe isn't giving out free passes just because you think you deserve one. Accepting your busy schedule isn't as bad as it sounds at first; your productivity will soar once you get into the flow."
taurus,2016-06-05,"You are tired of juggling so many separate parts of your life. You long for quieter days when there was sufficient time to relax. A short coffee break, a quick run to the store or even a walk in the park is not enough now to satisfy your needs. You crave a longer period of time to fully restore your energy. But don't give up; a dream vacation might still be in the picture sooner than you think. In the meantime, steal a few moments for revitalization whenever you get the chance and don't skimp on your sleep."
gemini,2016-06-05,"Your feelings are all over the map today, challenging others to keep up with your mood changes. However, you're busy trying to maintain balance while your inner world is bending you out of shape. You might not have a lot of sympathy for those whose emotional stability seems to require more reassurance than you can muster. You can't fix anyone else's problems, especially when yours need attention. You may not be prepared to be a therapist for your friend, but a hug could be enough to do the trick."
cancer,2016-06-05,"Your mind may be racing as you worry about all you must do today while you're still operating on weekend time. You wish you could spend the day doing as little as possible since you need the rest. It seems unfair that you can't just let everything slide for a bit longer. Unfortunately, instant karma is lurking nearby, ready to teach you a lesson if you don't hunker down and deliver on your promises. Channeling your angst into your work earns you a break without guilt."
leo,2016-06-05,"Although your list of new things to do may be shorter today, you could be overwhelmed with cleaning up from yesterday's change of direction. Accept the fact that a recent event is like water under a bridge. There's no going back to redo a critical interaction; instead you must take this moment as a starting point and move toward the future. Fortunately, you don't have to let someone's negativity rain on your parade of creativity. It may be slower going than you prefer, but your persistence will lead to measurable progress."
virgo,2016-06-05,"You want to be in charge of the action today but you could be short on confidence even if you're long on ideas. In fact, you might envision so many wonderful things to do that you can't pick just one. Ironically, your inability to commit to a single path is likely the source of your self-doubt. Fortunately, rectifying the situation is pretty straightforward; make a choice and live with it. Once you're on track, you'll be surprised at how quickly others follow."
libra,2016-06-05,"Your struggles are finally winding down and you can see the proverbial light at the end of the tunnel today. Your recent uncertainty might vanish so quickly that you don't even notice it's departure. It's as if someone flipped the switch and now you know the truth. Oddly enough, your little epiphany might pull you in a totally unexpected direction. But don't worry about what others think; what's important is that you're finally off and running."
scorpio,2016-06-05,"Your desires run deeper than most people realize, and bringing them up to the surface requires a significant amount of energy today. Thankfully, your closest friends appreciate your willingness to share your inner process with them. However, it's nearly impossible to make sense out of your own feelings when they defy your ability to express them verbally. The more words you use now, the less true they are to your heart. Your eyes are the windows to your soul; meaningful silence is better than meaningless chatter."
sagittarius,2016-06-05,"You might not accomplish your goals today because you're so easily distracted by everyone's dramas. Naturally, your friends are appreciative of your undivided attention as they unfold their stories. But your avid curiosity is not just about your concern for others. As long as you're listening to someone else's narrative, you don't have to face your own dilemmas. Actually, balancing your social participation with your personal agenda creates the satisfaction you seek."
capricorn,2016-06-05,"You are done with always being the responsible one. In fact, you might turn your day upside down now by suddenly changing your plans and leaving others in the lurch. It's not that your new agenda is more awesome than your old one; it's just that you feel the need to shake up your Sunday routine so you can take control of your own destiny. Unfortunately, you may end up cutting off your nose to spite your face. Check your motives; what you do today is ultimately less important than why you're doing it."
aquarius,2016-06-05,"Gonzo journalist, Hunter S. Thompson must have been thinking about you when he wrote, ""When the going gets weird, the weird turn pro."" You may naturally excel at eccentricity, but today you might even surprise yourself with your outlandish fantasies. You're obsessed with escaping from the status quo and the more radical your plan now, the better it sounds. Unfortunately, it's possible to take a brilliant idea so far out that it loses its value. Nevertheless, real genius consciously acknowledges the limits before stepping beyond them."
pisces,2016-06-05,"Everybody else's ideas sound so creative today that you might think yours are not worth mentioning at all. But comparing your thoughts to someone else's is not an all-or-nothing situation; you can follow your own bliss while still being enamored with someone else's scheme. However, you'll never know what's possible unless you take a chance and put your plan into motion. For now, life is not an either/or choice, for you can have it both ways if you're willing to keep an open mind."
aries,2016-06-06,"Returning to work has its pros and cons today because people are so pleasant that all you want to do is chat with them. It seems too good to be true, but the promise of love is everywhere you look. Although your imagination is a powerful part of the equation now, there is no reason your fantasies must remain unrealized. Instead of setting someone on a pedestal, acknowledge the magic of connection as it occurs between equals. Relationships cannot grow without honest communication and mutual respect."
taurus,2016-06-06,"You could emerge a champion in nearly any type of financial negotiation today. Closing a deal that's in your favor seems easier when everyone is so amenable to your perspective. However, you still must be cautious when it comes to your expenditures. Your optimism is not a permission slip to buy anything that strikes your fancy. As Will Rogers quipped, 
The quickest way to double your money is to fold it over and put it back in your pocket."
gemini,2016-06-06,"You can do nothing wrong today, or so it seems. You are a people magnet that attracts one lovely social interaction after another. In fact, you could while away the hours in endless conversation, without having anything to show for all your fun at the end of the day. Unfortunately, there is more to life than just engaging in friendly chitchat. There's no need to curtail pleasurable activities as long as you leave enough time to pursue something of substance."
cancer,2016-06-06,"You are an unsolvable puzzle today because others can't read your emotions, even if you're wearing them close to the surface. However, it's apparent from your behavior that you're not saying what's really on your mind. Fortunately, it's not your responsibility to communicate everything you feel all the time. In fact, sometimes words just dissipate the energy prematurely. Your current job is to maximize your experience by staying aware of your changing moods whether or not you choose to share them with anyone else."
leo,2016-06-06,"It's not like you to withdraw from social interactions, but you may want privacy in order to lick your wounds today. People can easily misunderstand you because they think your positive nature means you have rhino skin. However, you're more sensitive now that the moody Cancer Moon has slipped into your 12th House of Invisibility. Nevertheless, you're unhappy when you're feeling emotionally isolated. Give others a chance to see the real you; honesty is a critical key to creating meaningful relationships."
virgo,2016-06-06,"You may be experiencing an approach-avoidance conflict about whether or not you want to participate in a group activity. You seek out pleasant distractions with people you like but you wonder if this is the best use of your time, even if you can fit a social outing into your busy schedule. It's important to acknowledge the part of you that would rather steal some quiet time to dream about your future rather than acting frivolously in the present. Do what you must, but remember that happiness is always here and now."
libra,2016-06-06,"Your people-pleasing skills are more apparent now than ever as charming Venus dances with the Sun in your 9th House of Philosophy. Your objectivity is your greatest strength and inspires you to help others see their current situation from a more logical perspective. However, it's still tempting to steer a conversation toward your preferred outcome today. Unfortunately, your bias detracts from your neutrality and weakens your effectiveness. Acknowledge your feelings, but maintain your balance by always reestablishing your center."
scorpio,2016-06-06,"You want to get away from it all today, but you're not willing to sacrifice your emotional security in the process. It may be safer to talk about your fantasies of taking a life-changing journey than to go anywhere at all. Nevertheless, you can't deny your deep craving for adventure now and the sooner you acknowledge your current restlessness, the sooner you can integrate it into your life. The biggest risk is letting your dreams fade away without doing anything at all."
sagittarius,2016-06-06,"It might feel as if you're running through an obstacle course today with intriguing people placed strategically, whose only goal is to distract you from your tasks. It's all too easy to fall into another fascinating discussion about an interesting subject. However, the hidden cost is revealed when you realize you're not progressing toward your goals. Fortunately, you can create an invisible shield around you to ward off energy that could lead you astray. It's simple; when you focus on your destination with unwavering intention, no one will get in your way."
capricorn,2016-06-06,"Naturally, you don't want to hurt anyone's feelings. But everyone seems so sensitive today that you are afraid of generating unnecessary static by just saying what's on your mind. Ironically, the more careful you are in your delivery, the less effective you now are in making your point. In fact, you could use so many words in your attempt to be diplomatic that the impact of your message is lost. Being kind is admirable, but not if you sacrifice the truth in the process."
aquarius,2016-06-06,"Creating clear boundaries can be tricky business today because you seem to have the right words to say in any situation. Your easygoing nature attracts others to interact with you. However, you have work to do on your own and want enough time to do your job well. Nevertheless, cutting off a pleasant conversation isn't as easy as it might sound. This dilemma is an opportunity to demonstrate your unwavering willpower. Step up to the plate and let others know what's on your mind before it's too late."
pisces,2016-06-06,"The tides have shifted and refreshing waters are flowing into your world, stimulating your creativity and awakening your heart. Although you might be inclined to keep your thoughts to yourself, it's more productive to share your exhilaration with those you love. There's no reason to ramble endlessly about the subtle nuances of your feelings; just speak your truth succinctly and let your message settle in gradually. Sometimes silence is louder than words."
aries,2016-06-07,Sometimes people depend on you to take care of business because they know that you will quickly assess a situation and figure out what needs to be done. But you might not be willing to drop your immediate plans today in order to make someone else's dreams come true. With a little finesse you can minimize your involvement without creating a conflict in the process. Don't turn this dilemma into a power struggle when a little diplomacy will serve you well.
taurus,2016-06-07,"Your heart is set on following its own course today, yet it seems as if one thing after another impedes your progress. No doubt, people truly want to help you achieve your goals, but their good intentions might create trouble when you realize how different your work styles are. Instead of placating others by going along with their wishes, stick to your original agenda. In order to say yes to your own priorities, you must be willing to say no to someone else."
gemini,2016-06-07,"Although your careful analysis of the current situation leads you to one conclusion, your instincts tell you something else. Facts and figures can be misleading because they don't take your feelings into consideration. Those closest to you might be shocked at first when they realize you're playing by your own rules. Don't be too distracted by the resistance your actions seem to precipitate if others question your decision. Ultimately, your conduct is the best proof of your character."
cancer,2016-06-07,"Everyone seems overly concerned about your well-being today. Normally, all this fuss would make you feel loved, but now you wish that others would practice a bit of self-restraint because it seems as if they are interfering in your life rather than helping. Don't feed into anyone's negativity now or you'll only make matters worse. Instead, thank people for their concern without acting in a defensive manner. Conflict can only occur if you choose to participate in it."
leo,2016-06-07,"You don't appreciate people who poke and prod at you until you respond, especially when you wish they would just leave you alone. Your calendar is already overbooked and there's no time to waste fending off unnecessary distractions. However, that which you resist will only grow stronger and more irritating today. Being clear from the start prevents a gulf of misunderstanding from widening between you and others. There's nothing wrong with putting a ""Do Not Disturb"" sign on your door if you need some peace and quiet."
virgo,2016-06-07,"You may be overly self-protective today if someone's behavior make you second-guess a recent choice. In fact, you could withdraw so suddenly that your actions seem out of place to those close to you. However, your heightened sensitivity can become your greatest strength if you don't overreact out of fear. There's no sensible reason to make a permanent decision based on a temporary emotion. Sitting quietly with your uncertainty allows it to morph into a concrete plan for the future."
libra,2016-06-07,"Recent events seem to be out of alignment with your long-term goals, making you wonder whether or not you're traveling on the right track. Although you might be overly cautious today, your logic is sound and your conclusions are valid. Nevertheless, it's not wise to shake everything up just yet. Continue to weigh the pros and cons of taking a new path until you explore all your options. In the meantime, remember that fear is your enemy and change is your friend."
scorpio,2016-06-07,"There's nothing casual in the way you engage with reality. However, sometimes it's necessary to set your intense passions aside so you can come up for air and catch your breath. Fortunately, you have an opportunity to retreat and cultivate a healthier perspective on a complicated relationship. But don't step back too far or you could send the wrong message to someone you love. Extreme emotional reactions may be the course of least resistance while striving for balance is a more difficult path that leads to success."
sagittarius,2016-06-07,"Although it appears as if external circumstances are pulling you off course today, your biggest problem can be seen in a mirror. You might not realize how your attitude of superiority is slowing you down, but emotional baggage becomes heavier the longer you carry it. If your values are in conflict with someone else's, stop trying to persuade them that your position is the right one. Instead, let go of your attachment to people who drain your enthusiasm. Look to yourself for inspiration now; when you believe in what you're doing, your faith will be reflected by those around you."
capricorn,2016-06-07,"You may want to make a run for it today, but your sense of duty prevents you from doing something you might soon regret. Nevertheless, settling into a familiar old routine is not advisable, since your frustration will grow until it erupts. Fortunately, sharing your concerns with a friend eases your mind. But don't make the mistake of thinking that you need a final answer; simply talking about your dilemma helps you find your way while you continue to grapple with a long-term solution. In the words of Ralph Waldo Emmerson, ""Life is a journey, not a destination."""
aquarius,2016-06-07,"Your creativity demands expression today, but you are unsure of the best way to do it. It may be as simple as relying on a talent, whether it be drawing, writing, or making music. However, sharing your love is also a meaningful path to self-realization. Thankfully, you don't need to surrender your identity now to reveal your feelings. Your spirit soars if you have the courage to follow your heart."
pisces,2016-06-07,"Spending quiet time at home might sound like a perfect way to unwind, but responsibilities in the real world prevent you from escaping today. Rather than being discouraged because you have to work, put all your effort into meeting your obligations. The satisfaction you gain from doing what's right makes it all worthwhile. Luckily, the frosting on the cake is the peace you find later in the evening when you finally experience the solitude you wanted all along."
aries,2016-06-08,"Although you may be a bit disconnected from your feelings this morning, the flame of enthusiasm is burning brightly in your heart. Your spirit quickly gains altitude and soars over the mundane annoyances that could bring you down if you let them. But you're so eager to get started that you might initiate action before you have everything in order. You will still arrive at your destination even if you delay your first step. Just don't take your eye off the prize until you achieve your goal."
taurus,2016-06-08,"Someone's criticism could raise issues of self-doubt today, but you're determined to overcome them. Rather than speaking up right away, you might withdraw into your own internal world at the first blush of insecurity. Looking within for spiritual strength is a great idea as long as you express your feelings once your feet are back on solid ground. Nearly anything is possible now if you're willing to believe in its existence with every fiber of your being."
gemini,2016-06-08,"You're acutely aware of the strong emotional bonds between you and your friends today, challenging you to remain objective in your interactions. Unfortunately, basing your decisions on your attractions and desires is not nearly as stable as sticking to logic. No matter what you choose, observe how your perspective shifts throughout the day. Your feelings continue to change, but the facts do not."
cancer,2016-06-08,"Your personal possessions give you a sense of security today and you relish in the certainty of their accessibility. But holding on to an abundance of mementos is like carrying extra weight and only slows your growth. Hoarding tools you no longer use makes it more difficult to find the ones necessary to complete a task. But don't get rid of anything just to please someone else now. When you act from the core of your beliefs, others are more likely to stick with you through thick and thin."
leo,2016-06-08,"Nearly everything you say and do becomes a scene in your movie today with you shining in the leading role. Your impassioned receptivity enables you to  intuitively connect with your audience. But you can be so focused on others now that the generous Leo Moon allows your inner voice to be drowned out by everyone else's. Nevertheless, you still crave your time in the spotlight. In the final analysis, you agree with Shakespeare when he wrote, ""All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players."""
virgo,2016-06-08,"You believe you're open to changing your plans today as long as you remain in control of the agenda. But you might not see what's coming around the bend because you're concentrating on completing a current task. Rather than practicing flexibility, your immediate reaction is to contract so you're not pulled off center. Unfortunately, this defensive tactic won't work. Instead of responding like a boxer by blocking and parrying, think like an aikido master who receives an incoming attack as an opportunity to work with the energy. Don't deflect the unknown; engage it."
libra,2016-06-08,"Your natural ability to gracefully interact with others serves you well today as you work to strengthen your network of supporters. Thankfully, your friends and associates are quite receptive to your overtures now and are more than willing to work or play with you. But don't take anyone's participation for granted, for you might not be the main attraction in everyone else's life. Nevertheless, you can make a real difference in the world if you step beyond your regular limits and try."
scorpio,2016-06-08,"You respond quite favorably to people who are nurturing toward you today. Rather than putting up walls and acting in a defensive manner, you're reminded of how nice it is when you feel loved and cherished. However, you might be so eager to show your appreciation that you shift your priorities to meet someone else's expectations. Nevertheless, you will be more successful in the long run if you stay true to your nature. Opening your heart is the best gift you can give in return."
sagittarius,2016-06-08,"Your world view is strongly colored by your emotions today. You'll jump on someone's bandwagon if your passion is stirred by their opinions, whether they are based upon fact or not. Your attitude is of the utmost importance as you look  ahead to your future. There is no time to entertain doubts when your destiny is calling; think big and do whatever it takes to reach your goals. If you believe in your dreams, others will do the same."
capricorn,2016-06-08,"You need to be able to compartmentalize your personal preferences today when making decisions that can affect someone else. In fact, you may be called upon to manage shared assets or even take responsibility for other people at home or in the community now. In any case, your behavior sets the tone as you lead by example. Rehearsal is over; your show is about to begin and everyone is anticipating your impressive performance with baited breath."
aquarius,2016-06-08,"Although you're often uncomfortable with the messiness of human emotion, you're oddly drawn to those who openly express their needs to you today. Perhaps, your uncharacteristic magnetism with demonstrative people fills the gap left by your intellectual approach. You're eager to improve your understanding of your own subjective reactions, so observing the likes and dislikes of someone else becomes part of your research. But don't use your current curiosity to avoid your true feelings. Life without passion is like peanut butter without jelly."
pisces,2016-06-08,"Sticking to a rigid schedule is nearly impossible today. You're more likely to change your behavior based upon what you're feeling in the moment. Once minute, you could be so excited about a current project that you're ready to tackle any obstacle. But your productivity falters if you feel sad or dejected. Honestly, your life is too unpredictable now to live and die by the clock. Accordingly, it's more important than ever to do what you love and keep looking up."
aries,2016-06-09,"You may feel as if you're personally under attack when someone criticizes your beliefs. But verbally aggressive behavior doesn't sit right with you and you could be quick to strike back. Unfortunately, it's possible that your entire premise is wrong now; others might actually be more supportive than you think. They are likely motivated by the desire to help you rather than bring you down, but you must let them. Build bridges instead of walls if you want to cultivate harmony."
taurus,2016-06-09,You are quite direct when sharing what's on your mind today. Your thoughts are grounded in the truth but your unrelenting insistence could put others off. You may be surprised when your words run into a roadblock rather than an open highway if you rub someone the wrong way. Bring it down a notch before you are accused of overselling your agenda. Just remember the old adage about catching more flies with honey than with vinegar and you'll be fine.
gemini,2016-06-09,"There are differing schools of thought at work today and they all sound overly complicated in their various approaches. Although you truly believe your way is the most straightforward, you might still need to acquiesce in the name of cooperation now. You will be your own worst enemy as long as you remain self-righteous about your path. Act wisely and compromise for the best results."
cancer,2016-06-09,"Your friends appreciate your ability to express your thoughts today, but you may get lost in your own ideas if they're not built on a solid foundation. Nevertheless, you could put on such a dramatic show that everyone thinks you did a great job. However, you know where you fell short of your well-rehearsed presentation. Don't cry over spilt milk; just clean it up as quickly as you can and jump back into the fray while the odds are in your favor."
leo,2016-06-09,"The bigger your soapbox is today, the less people will pay attention to your words. The taller the mountaintop from which you are preaching, the more your declaration will fall onto deaf ears. Don't overestimate the importance of communication now, even if it's one of the most important tools in your toolbox. Nevertheless, without decisive action to reinforce your message, your ideas won't materialize into anything tangible. The proof is in the pudding."
virgo,2016-06-09,"People aren't sure what you're really trying to say today, even if you think you're being crystal clear. Part of the problem is that your priorities are changing and you're already moving far into the future in your mind. It's frustrating because finding the right words to bring someone into your new frame of reference seems nearly impossible. Don't waste your energy stressing about the gulf between you and others. Your focus on the present moment will return in a few days, allowing for a reunion with those you temporarily left behind."
libra,2016-06-09,"You are defying everyone's primary assumption about the ambiguous nature of your sign by stepping up to the plate today and making brave decisions regarding your future. Your mind is like a virtual reality generator now; whatever you think actually manifests right before your eyes. But acting too impulsively will come back to haunt you, so avoid any spur of-the-moment choices that could jeopardize your previous achievements. Focus on creating the most positive impact and your success will be inevitable."
scorpio,2016-06-09,"Feeling as if you're being pulled into someone's tractor beam is disturbing, especially if you have an agenda of your own. However, you might be sucked into a conversation that doesn't even concern you - and your lack of boundaries could prevent you from reaching your own goals. You may be so emotional today that you cry for absolutely no obvious reason at all. Don't hold back your tears since they can wash away the cares of your soul."
sagittarius,2016-06-09,"You're operating with a hidden agenda today and you don't want others to know what you're up to yet. But once you start talking, you become so excited with your work that you might forget your secret is worth defending. In fact, you could blurt out your theory before you can support your conclusion. Remember, you only get to make a first impression once, so keep things under wraps until you're ready to take center stage."
capricorn,2016-06-09,"You want to approach a job in a very creative manner today, but others don't know what to make of your unusual behavior. They might even attempt to prevent you from carrying out your tasks in such a radical style. But moderating your position now won't help you in the long run. It's been said that a compromise is an agreement where both parties get what neither of them wanted. Instead, dig in your heels and ward off all those who would dampen your enthusiasm. Defend your right to color outside of the lines."
aquarius,2016-06-09,"You're not making as much progress at work as you expected and this realization could hit you hard today. You had big plans and high hopes, yet you must face the facts now and consider adjusting your overall trajectory. But reacting too quickly can make matters worse. Don't change direction; just accept that the cosmos is operating on its own time schedule and not yours. There are many detours on the road to success."
pisces,2016-06-09,"You can talk about your plans for the day in such a manner that it sounds like you're fully informed about all the contingencies. However, upon closer analysis, it's apparent that there are viable possibilities that you have not considered at all. Luckily, time is on your side because a final decision isn't necessary for a while yet. In the meantime, don't let your emotions run amok just because everything you want is on the other side of fear."
aries,2016-06-10,"You know exactly how to skillfully employ your charm to get what you want. But you're playing with fire today that's more powerful than you realize. You could inadvertently stir up someone's emotions in a way you aren't prepared to handle. Going out of your way to be extra sensitive to the needs of others may seem unnecessary, but it might make the difference between wasting energy in endless conversation and accomplishing exactly what you intended."
taurus,2016-06-10,"Your plans may be solid, but someone could shake your confidence by calling your underlying values into question. Defending your beliefs is probably a thankless task today because your words won't be able to win a clash of perspectives. In fact, talk is cheap and only disperses your limited energy. Instead, stay focused on reaching your destination now. If you want to reexamine your principles, do it on your own terms when you are good and ready."
gemini,2016-06-10,"You have one foot firmly planted on terra firma today, while the other one has slipped into another dimension. Accordingly, you might feel as if you're precariously dancing on the edge. Nevertheless, you can dazzle your friends and associates with your ability to juggle multiple realities without actually being in two places at once. But don't push your luck; you're not invincible. Acknowledging your human limitations is a wise place to start. Vulnerability is the secret to your success."
cancer,2016-06-10,Your metaphysical beliefs could create awkward tension with others today. Either they don't understand your ideas or they just want to convert you to their way of thinking. But you're not interested in debating the mysteries of the universe since you're feeling rather protective about your spiritual pursuits now. You're under no obligation to talk to anyone about your private affairs unless you feel so inclined. Claim your power by setting your boundaries and sticking to them.
leo,2016-06-10,"It seems as if the pressure to make decisions is beginning to ease. People are less demanding now or, perhaps, your mental clarity has returned. Either way, your emotions are more manageable, allowing you to get along better with your co-workers today. But there are still complicated dynamics that make long-term collaboration unlikely. Don't push to resolve that which remains elusive. You will be happily surprised if you simply let the unspoken conflicts dissipate on their own. Time has a funny way of working things out."
virgo,2016-06-10,"You want everyone to know how intelligent you are and how much value you can bring to the table. But your ideas may be moving so fast that you can't catch a single one of them, sending you into a tailspin of self-doubt. However, if you visualize the act of throwing your distracting thoughts into the trash, they will begin to leave you alone. The answer to your dilemma isn't about impressing anyone else; it's simply about filtering out the unnecessary noise so you can think with a clear head."
libra,2016-06-10,"The cosmic weather has shifted without warning; decisions that seemed so easy to make yesterday are as daunting today as scaling Mount Everest. Nevertheless, your internal guidance system is functioning better than you realize. Don't worry if your logic isn't operating on full power now. There's no need to force your answer since choices are being made for you by the winds of fate. Thankfully, the universe has its benevolent hand in influencing your future if you remain open to change."
scorpio,2016-06-10,"You possess an uncanny ability to attract wealth, power and love now. However, you seem to have a magical, non-stick coating that shields you from the emotional dramas that can accompany intense relationships. Be sure you know what you're asking for today, since you could very well have your wish fulfilled. Nevertheless, there is no success unless you're willing to keep a smile in your heart and commit to the hard work necessary to ensure transformation."
sagittarius,2016-06-10,"Your recent contributions on the job might garner you some special attention now. In turn, this appreciation spurs you on to achieve even more. You feel as if your sincere efforts demonstrate your desire to be a valuable team player. However, you also might find it challenging to trust the positive feedback. But this is an opportunity to openly engage with others on an equal playing field. Living by the Golden Rule sets a fine example for everyone else to follow."
capricorn,2016-06-10,"You could be trying to do one-too-many things at work today. In fact, you might be spinning in so many directions now that you don't know which way is up. Simplicity is your friend while logic reminds you to take one step at a time. Pare back the items on your itinerary as you exercise your right to say no. Imagine how happy you will be when you actually have the time to complete those tasks which must be done. Eliminating the extraneous enables you to reclaim control of your life."
aquarius,2016-06-10,"You see beauty everywhere you look today and are intuitively aware of the wonderful potential in all those you meet. One might say you are a Pollyanna now, but the truth is you're a pragmatist with a visionary imagination. Possibilities abound because you perceive them as real, and you can create a path toward manifestation. Don't let anyone talk you out of your dreams; follow your creative spirit until you find yourself at the end of the rainbow."
pisces,2016-06-10,"You are much more comfortable today when you're surrounded by your family and friends. In fact, you might shy away from crowds now, favoring one-on-one encounters and unstructured time in small groups. You're particularly sensitive to criticism because negative thinking brings you down hard and fast. Managing your immediate environment is the most efficient way to ensure your peace of mind and the safety of your heart."
aries,2016-06-11,"It might seem as if you're out of step with the rest of the world today. However, you're not really sure if you want to put in the effort required to reestablish a rhythm that is in sync with those around you. Even if you attempt to meet reality halfway, there still could be awkward moments when you feel that you just don't fit in. Thankfully, you can shift the energy by accepting the dynamics as a passing phase. Remember, your current situation is not your final destination and how you rise to the challenge is part of the course."
taurus,2016-06-11,"Expressing your opinion again and again in an attempt to get others to support you just doesn't make sense. You are aware that you're repeating yourself, and can't comprehend why your message isn't sinking in. It's quite likely that people simply need time to assimilate your words and there's no way for you to speed up the process. Being more obstinate won't help your cause but a calculated retreat gives everyone a little room to breathe."
gemini,2016-06-11,"Although you thought you knew where a conversation was going, you might find yourself in the midst of an uncomfortable debate with no clue how you got there. There's nothing wrong with holding a position different from someone else; however, it becomes problematic when you believe that your point of view is the only correct one. Instead of trying to untangle the cause of a current predicament, acknowledge the richness of diversity. There are many ways to look at the same thing and accepting multiple perspectives demonstrates your strength of character."
cancer,2016-06-11,"There's so much going on in your mind now that it's difficult to express the various streams of thought coherently. In fact, your logic could be running on multiple levels simultaneously, challenging you to put your ideas into words. You may be familiar with feeling isolated at times, but it's relatively easy to bridge the communication gap now. Instead of trying to reveal everything all at once, just pick one simple concept and say something about it. Your personal disclosure will naturally get the ball rolling, prompting the conversation that previously seemed impossible."
leo,2016-06-11,"It's tempting to tell your friends exactly what you think today, especially if you believe they are trying to control your life. In fact, you have little patience for anyone's coercive behavior. However, you could react so quickly that you speak your mind before you even know your own thoughts. Don't be a victim of your impatience now; impulsive actions lead to big trouble. Considering the consequences of your words before they are spoken saves the day."
virgo,2016-06-11,"Although you could be unequivocal about your own feelings today, others have a much harder time reading your energy now. You appear to be sitting on the fence, holding multiple positions and unwilling to make a choice. Paradoxically, it might be their confusion that prevents them from appreciating your single-mindedness. Don't try to convince anyone of the power of your laser-like focus; let people change their minds once they see the proof in real life."
libra,2016-06-11,"There are several different ways to reach your goal today and you hope to take the easiest route to your destination. Unfortunately, your emotional life may be more complicated than the actual logistics. Your feelings for close friends and family might not match up with your high expectations. Thankfully, responding to events as they happen prevents a messy situation from getting worse. Living in the moment can be challenging now but is well worth the effort."
scorpio,2016-06-11,"You are in your element today as mystery and intrigue take center stage. However, your insatiable curiosity might require more mental bandwidth than you have available. Nevertheless, it's those things you work the hardest for that will reward you the most now. But there doesn't seem to be a lot of middle ground for you to stand on; either you don't care about a subject or you want to know everything. Both extremes are problematic. If you stop looking at life through a black and white lens, you will be able to see all the colors of the rainbow."
sagittarius,2016-06-11,"People in your life seem so lovely today that you're tempted to place them up on a pedestal. You might not even notice their true identity if you are working with a preconceived notion of who they are. Unfortunately, you could admire someone so much that he or she ends up disappointing you by falling short of your vision. Thankfully, the solution is as easy as changing your mind. Although high expectations feed frustration, you can hope for the best while planning for the worst."
capricorn,2016-06-11,"You are quite optimistic about completing everything that's on your to-do list today. You may be so enthusiastic that you write down each task without regard for how long it will take to execute. Don't wait until you run into major snafus later in the day; instead, fill in your schedule and assign a realistic block of time for each chore. If you don't finish one item within the allotted time, move on to the next. You might be left with cleanup work to do later tonight or tomorrow, but this disciplined strategy will enable you to get more done than you ever imagined."
aquarius,2016-06-11,"Your creativity sizzles today as you tackle one exciting enterprise after another. You love the variety of activity as you finish one project and then gleefully start the next. However, people may try to co-opt your efforts by requesting your assistance on something completely unrelated to your goals. Don't set aside your original plans in order to participate in someone else's pet project. You will be in a better place to help others once you see your own progress take flight."
pisces,2016-06-11,"You can't decide whether to keep your feelings to yourself or to give others a piece of your mind. Although you have a lot to say today, you're not sure that your message will be received in the spirit it is intended. The problem is your runaway optimism can overpower your critical thinking and awkwardly lead you into a labyrinth of emotional dynamics. All you need now is a hand to hold and a heart to understand your dreams."
aries,2016-06-12,"You can visualize a straight path in front of you when it comes to reaching your goals today. However, forks in the road begin to appear as the day progresses until there are so many choices you don't know which direction to turn. Somewhere along the line you'll need to let go of your original itinerary. Thankfully, you enjoy the multitude of distractions and don't really care where you end up as long as you're not bored along the way. Happiness is a journey, not a destination."
taurus,2016-06-12,"You are a bit disoriented today as your decisiveness fades and is replaced with a question mark. It's as if every road you travel suddenly comes to an end in the middle of nowhere. Although this uncertainty stimulates the flow of adrenaline, you nostalgically long for familiar ground. Instead of trying to firm up reality, accept the fact that there are times when you simply cannot see around the bend. Rather than fixating on a particular goal now, enjoy the moment by dancing with the unknown."
gemini,2016-06-12,"Although the pace of your life has already picked up in the past couple of weeks, you better hang onto your hat since you haven't seen anything yet. Interactive Mercury's shift into your sign now creates a quickening that will last all month. It's as if you are white-water canoeing and there is no way to avoid the rapids. Clinging to the shoreline is not a viable strategy, so paddle into the middle and go with the flow. There's no substitute for the exhilaration you feel when you are in touch with the intensity of the present moment."
cancer,2016-06-12,"It appears as if the last vestiges of social stability are being peeled away today, freeing you to create new dreams that will lead you into the future. Whether or not your relationship dynamics change with the shifting tide, there is little to prevent you from pursuing fantasies that are a departure from your current reality. Although the mind can go anywhere, it remains to be seen what direction your life will take in the days ahead. Keep your options wide open until you know what your heart wants."
leo,2016-06-12,"You may feel overly restricted by social commitments today, prompting you to hatch an escape plan. There's no time to develop a strategy; you need to act right away if you're going to reclaim your schedule. Thankfully, you're capable of thinking outside of the box, inspiring you to reinvent your day. Instead of limiting your focus to the present moment, extend your planning to include the next few weeks. Just remember your choices have wider ramifications than your current activities because you are also setting the stage for the next act in your play."
virgo,2016-06-12,"There are conflicting paths to follow now as your personal needs lead you one way and other people's expectations pull another. Normally, you would analyze the current situation until you were able to make a choice as to which direction makes the most sense. However, you're quite content to pursue a dual track today without feeling any conflict at all. Relish the luxury of operating in two realities simultaneously until you are stretched too thin. But don't rush the flow of events; trust your instincts to know when the time is right to make your move."
libra,2016-06-12,"You are coming to the end of an emotional cycle and are eagerly anticipating moving into new territory now. However, there may be plenty of work to finish before you are freed from the past. In the meantime, savor the fleeting glimpses of your destiny as it appears in bits and pieces. There's not much time left to wrap up loose ends, so get busy while you still have the chance. The future awaits your arrival with open arms."
scorpio,2016-06-12,"The gift of gab is yours today, allowing you to talk about your feelings in ways that are normally uncomfortable. Instead of being consumed by your passions now, you can stand back far enough to gain a wider perspective. Your current emotional detachment is a refreshing change of pace for you and your immediate circle of friends and family. Take a risk and share what's on your mind, even if it's not what others might expect from you. The response you receive from those who really matter touches your heart."
sagittarius,2016-06-12,"Although you feel particularly nurturing toward friends and relatives today, your actions might not support your desires. In fact, you could come across as cool and detached rather than warm and fuzzy. However, your affection isn't necessarily expressed by sheltering others from the world. Instead, you prefer to encourage people to engage the potential of life as an exhilarating adventure. Don't just push those you love out of the nest; explaining your intentions helps them understand how much you care."
capricorn,2016-06-12,"You are the most confident about your future when you have a concrete plan in hand. You like to work with well-established priorities and an ambitious strategy to reach your goals. However, previous commitments limit your choices now and you're ready to do something about it in order to free yourself from the restraints. Nevertheless, an impulsive reaction to frustration won't further your cause. Take your time in the course of preparation so you're ready to fly once all your ducks are in order."
aquarius,2016-06-12,"You are enthusiastic about your ability to alter your life's direction, even if there's not much you can do about it today. It may feel as if your mind is free but your hands are tied. Instead of fighting against the limitations imposed by your current schedule, accept whatever challenges you encounter in stride. Use this time to visualize the changes around the next corner. Employing your imagination to create an environment more aligned with your heart improves your chances for manifesting your dreams."
pisces,2016-06-12,"Relationship dynamics can be a conundrum today because you long for security while simultaneously needing your independence. Happily, it's possible to have the best of both worlds. But you might be better off following the course of least resistance until there's a solid foundation in place. Starting a conversation from an emotionally neutral position minimizes the likelihood of conflict. Talking about your desires objectively enables others to do the same. Establishing common ground is the first step toward harmony."
aries,2016-06-13,"Romantic fantasies offer magical worlds of escape today, but it may be impossible to make these dreams come true. There's nothing wrong with letting your imagination run wild as long as it is not cause for disappointment when someone falls short of your expectations. It's tempting to assume that others are willing to play their parts in fulfilling your needs before you even ask what they want. Nevertheless, real love is possible only when you move beyond a selfish perspective to give rather than receive."
taurus,2016-06-13,"Something is amiss today as if people can't hear you when you tell them what you need. You might remain flexible to a point but someone's resistance to meeting you halfway causes you to emotionally withdraw. However, you're able to still find satisfaction if you don't over-personalize the reactions of others. Process your hurt feelings and then reengage in the relationship dance without presuming anyone else is responsible for your emotions. You can't necessarily control your thoughts but you can choose how you respond to them."
gemini,2016-06-13,"You are a regular chatterbox today, yet your words may act as a smokescreen to hide your feelings. Unfortunately, your close friend or partner might be less expressive than you prefer, provoking you to doubt their love. However, your fear of abandonment has more to do with you than anyone else now. Stop talking long enough to experience your state of mind beneath the silence. Confronting your own shortcomings is the first step to reestablishing the intimacy you are afraid of losing. Lead with an open heart and see who follows."
cancer,2016-06-13,"Your heart connection with someone else may be more spiritual than physical today. Instead of imagining what you might receive from a relationship in the future, consider how your current actions create the potential for growth. Exploring what you can learn from your partner is more important now than achieving emotional satisfaction. Although your physical needs shouldn't be ignored, it helps to put them in proper perspective. Feed your soul and everything else will fall into place."
leo,2016-06-13,"Sometimes it's difficult to maintain personal boundaries in social relationships, yet they are the glue that keeps the community -- at home and at work -- together. Your feelings are flowing through new territory now and it's challenging to know how much to share and how much to keep to yourself. Unfortunately, you can't use logic to analyze the current dynamics when everything is in flux. The truth is you won't go wrong if you listen to your intuition."
virgo,2016-06-13,"Love is particularly confusing when you can't get a clear read on others. However, you could be projecting an aspect of yourself that you think you're seeing in a close friend, workmate or partner. Don't trust your senses now, for they will lead you down a garden path. Instead, create an emotional roadmap by sharing your feelings and listening to the feedback you receive. Even the most complicated relationship will surrender its uncertainty if you engage in sincere communication with an open mind."
libra,2016-06-13,"You're wearing your emotions on your sleeve today but others still might not know your true feelings. Thankfully, you are able to project an accurate representation of your current internal process. However, the otherworldly nature of your desires makes it difficult for anyone else to understand what you want. Nevertheless, one thing is for sure: the real magic begins when you set aside the obvious differences and step beyond the apparent limitations between other people and yourself."
scorpio,2016-06-13,"You may feel as if you're all dressed up with nowhere to go, or perhaps your emotions are extra volatile now and there is no safe place where they can be expressed. Although a trustworthy friend is willing to hear the latest version of your story, you're afraid of creating problems for someone else if you say too much. Thankfully, you're capable of monitoring your words even if it requires extra vigilance today. Silence isn't always a sign of avoidance; sometimes it's a sign of exemplary self-control."
sagittarius,2016-06-13,"You want to bridge the gulf between you and someone you love, but interpersonal dynamics are tangled up with the past. You often suffer the negative consequences of spilling more beans than actually fit in the can. But the opposite may be true today if you don't say enough for others to fully grasp your feelings. A solid relationship is built on good communication, but just using words to fill up the empty space won't do the trick. Your disclosure must connect with your emotions to convey what's in your heart."
capricorn,2016-06-13,"You could be surprised at how much positive feedback you receive at work today. It's not that you don't deserve the accolades; it's just that they are unexpected. However, your need for recognition may be insatiable because of insecurities from the past that you carry into the present situation. Don't let your self-esteem depend on what others say. Instead, measure your worth by the quality of your work. As Eleanor Roosevelt said, ""No one can make you feel inferior without your consent."""
aquarius,2016-06-13,"Although you are highly motivated to achieve extraordinary results at work today, your follow-through may be sorely lacking. Part of the problem is finding a healthy balance between seeking personal pleasure and pursuing success in your chosen profession. Unfortunately, you can't do it all. There aren't enough hours in the day; something has to give. Since emotional satisfaction is transitory now, it's wise to concentrate on building your career. Computer scientist Alan Kay said, ""The best way to predict the future is to create it."""
pisces,2016-06-13,"Sometimes you push people away when you really want to be closer to them. But you are so protective of your feelings today that you might go out of your way to talk about everything else, instead. You hope that no one will notice the boundaries placed around your heart. However, a casual question from the right person could be enough to trigger your emotions and cause your walls to tumble down. Ironically, you may be relieved once the truth is out in the open because intimacy can develop when you're no longer hiding behind a mask."
aries,2016-06-14,"Second-guessing reality is rather pointless today; although you know that change is in the air, you have no idea what will happen in advance. A casual discussion could unexpectedly turn into an intense power struggle as someone tries to manipulate your thinking. But even the most surprising detour won't rattle your cage now. Thankfully, it isn't that hard to hold your own as long as you continue to stand on moral high ground."
taurus,2016-06-14,"Unfortunately, interpersonal relationship dynamics can destabilize your work environment now. Your objective approach enables you to see both sides of a conflict, prompting you to avoid a confrontation while someone else continues to annoy you. But sooner or later you are pushed too far, driving you to lose your temper over an issue that is trivial in the long run. It's nearly impossible to glean a clear perspective when you are in the middle of the mess."
gemini,2016-06-14,"It's easier to talk to a friend about a delicate issue today because a current disagreement won't negatively impact the loyalty you possess for one another. In fact, gaining awareness of your mutual diversity can strengthen a relationship and create the glue that holds it together. Nevertheless, you can't get your work done if you're spending too much time involved in unnecessary conflict. A strong friendship needs an argument every now and then to clear the air and test its stability."
cancer,2016-06-14,"You are at a pivotal point in your life and today's decisions set your path into the future. Cosmic forces are encouraging you to initiate significant changes so you can incorporate more free time into your daily routine. However, you're so impatient now that you can't wait for the big shift. But hiding your head in the sand isn't a viable course of action either. The good news is that once you make up your mind the universe conspires to grant your wish."
leo,2016-06-14,"It's nearly impossible to ignore your peers while their antics entice you to temporarily skip out on your obligations in search of fun. But no decisions are made lightly today, even if you choose to run off and join the circus. Weigh all your options carefully before picking one path. Don't be afraid of making a wrong choice. Good decisions come from experience, and experience comes from bad decisions. Failure is success in progress."
virgo,2016-06-14,"Your fair-minded approach to making fiscal decisions is prudent because it prevents your emotions from muddying the waters. However, you must decide how to invest your time and money so you don't squander your resources. As Ben Franklin wrote, ""A penny saved is a penny earned."" Whatever you do, stay on top of your finances now. Leaving something so important up to anyone else is never a wise strategy. Common sense counts."
libra,2016-06-14,"It's one of those days when you could live up to your zodiacal reputation; you can see different paths stretching from this moment into the future but you can't figure out which one is most advantageous. Obviously, delaying your choice can be detrimental if it leads you to miss a special opportunity. Nevertheless, this tactic allows you to continue to review all the alternatives until one of them stands out as the obvious winner. As Wayne Dyer wrote, ""You are not stuck where you are unless you decide to be."""
scorpio,2016-06-14,"You're not afraid to bring up sensitive issues because you know that talking about them leads to more informed choices. However, your willingness to engage in a discussion may actually be a diversionary tactic that enables you to let the moment pass without doing anything at all. Remember, the decisions you make now determine your destiny. But talk is cheap; this magical moment is maximized only when you take immediate action."
sagittarius,2016-06-14,"It appears that your friends are not supportive of your new plan today, yet they eventually turn out to be quite encouraging of nearly any crazy idea you can conceive. Thankfully, they do not want to see you settle back into a boring routine that leads nowhere. Although the road may be rocky at first, it will smooth out once you get rolling. You must make a choice to take a chance for your life to ever change."
capricorn,2016-06-14,You're not one to switch horses midstream unless you see no other way to get across. This may be one of those rare times when radically altering your plans while you're in the middle of the river is easier than sticking to your original course. Don't worry about your slow progress; it will take a bit of time to regain your previous speed. A brave soul recognizes the error of his ways.
aquarius,2016-06-14,"You're up for nearly anything today and the most unconventional ideas sound the best. You aren't interested in choosing the safest route when the sky is the limit, since you might feel as if you're protected by a benevolent universe at this time. In fact, you're eager to trade in your current stability for a healthy dose of exhilaration. Nevertheless, the adrenaline rush will not last long. Thankfully, the changes you make now will."
pisces,2016-06-14,"Emotional instability and spiritual uncertainty do not inspire you to feel safe. In fact, your anxiety could escalate today when the rug is pulled out from beneath your feet. Nevertheless, you are not in any danger of falling. Your imagination is working overtime to create colorful fantasies and you've temporarily lost your capacity to separate the truth from your illusions. This emotional rollercoaster is a wild and wonderful ride. Hop on now before it's too late."
aries,2016-06-15,"Revealing a deep dark secret from your past to someone you love seems like a wonderful idea today until you open your mouth to speak. Your intention is to create a deeper level of trust, but your words might have the opposite effect now. Although you are not responsible for anyone else's reaction to your disclosure, some things may be better left unsaid. Consider your motives before you start to talk. If your actions are truly for the good of the relationship, then it's probably wise to proceed. If not, pick a topic that is healing rather than hurtful."
taurus,2016-06-15,"You may feel as if you're bumping up against a wall when someone opposes your plans today. What bothers you most is that the objections seem more emotional than logical, and you don't know how to respond. Stop and take a few breaths before going any further. Paradoxically, your best offense might be a temporary retreat, giving the other person time to reconsider their position. If your idea makes sense, you will be able to move ahead once the resistance begins to fade. In the final analysis, this delay is actually an opportunity in the making."
gemini,2016-06-15,"A recent setback might have slowed you down, but now you have a possible solution in mind. You're eager to change direction on your project today, only to lose steam later in the day and wonder if you're even on the right track. Don't let self-doubt prevent you from testing your strategy in the real world even if someone's lingering negativity is still problematic. Strength comes from overcoming the things you once thought to be insurmountable."
cancer,2016-06-15,"You might want to pack your bags and head home, but your persistence at work could pay off sooner than you expect. The strength of your convictions is not in question; however, you prefer to defy authority through passive aggression rather than open conflict. Thankfully, life is not an either/or proposition. You may not have to do battle at all if you firmly hold your goal in sight without faltering. The shortest path to success is not talking about your plans. As Amelia Earhart said, ""The most effective way to do it, is to do it."""
leo,2016-06-15,"Although you might not know how your plans will come together today, you sense that miraculously somehow they will. Your firm belief in your own ability to save the day is your greatest strength now, yet it can be wasted unless you do something about it. Unfortunately, there may be additional people involved in your dreams, but you can't rely on them at this time. Continue striving to achieve your goals; others will join your cause once they see you mean business."
virgo,2016-06-15,"People are thrilled to work with you today because you appear to be so flexible in your approach to getting things accomplished. However, they may be in for a surprise when they realize how set in your ways you actually are now. Adapting to someone else's style makes sense sometimes, but obstinately sticking to your plan is currently essential to reach your goals. Don't compromise for the sake of political expediency. Determination trumps destiny now."
libra,2016-06-15,"Interactions with others test your core beliefs today as you attempt to find common ground and establish mutual long-term goals. Unfortunately, you may be persuaded to give in too quickly so you can maintain peace and harmony. However, you might not be able to control your anger later if you don't speak up for your values now. Succinctly state your non-negotiable standards and go from there. Do what is right, not what is easy."
scorpio,2016-06-15,"You are standing in your power today which could make others quite uncomfortable. Most people do not want to experience your emotional intensity, especially if it interferes with their progress at work. Nevertheless, it's not in your best interest to hide your feelings so someone else can avoid a sensitive issue. Naturally, it pays to be kind in your delivery, but honesty is still the best policy. Tell it like it is and let the chips fall as they may."
sagittarius,2016-06-15,"Your coworkers might be so sweet to you today that you don't trust anything they say. However, they may be speaking the truth, even if you are clinging to failures that belong in the past. Although a certain amount of skepticism is healthy, it doesn't have to be the main focus of your current strategy. If someone with a joyful attitude waltzes into your life, dance with him or her until the music stops. Beautiful things happen now when you distance yourself from the shadows of negativity."
capricorn,2016-06-15,"It's easy to be annoyed with someone whose scattered approach at work distracts you from your regular routine. You like to jump in and help if people need it, but not when they are wasting time while expecting you to bail them out. The political dynamics on the job are quite delicate now and need to be sorted with care. Taking the time to talk with a colleague who isn't carrying their weight could be a catalyst that turns a difficult moment into a positive one. Two-way communication is the key to personal and career success."
aquarius,2016-06-15,"It doesn't matter how charming you seem to everyone else today, you might be unsure of your own self-worth. You could accomplish great things yet still feel empty if you suffer from low self-esteem. Rather than expecting others to provide you with the missing ingredient in your life, search for it within your own heart. You may be quite surprised when you realize lingering emotions tied to a past failure are blocking you from experiencing satisfaction in the present. Sometimes a moment of introspection can drastically change your life."
pisces,2016-06-15,"You may be quite chatty today even if you have little of substance to say. Fortunately, you don't want to engage just anyone; you need to feel emotionally safe while interacting with another person, whether or not you're discussing something important. But filling the silence with your endless rambling is not fulfilling for anyone, including you. Don't wait until you tire of your own voice. Everything in your life is a reflection of your little decisions in each moment. Making different choices produces different results."
aries,2016-06-16,"You're not happy if someone doubts your integrity today because you have better things to do than to defend your reputation. However, the Moon and Mars are empowering your 8th House of Deep Sharing, allowing you to strengthen a business or personal relationship if you're willing to lay all your cards on the table. You dislike feeling vulnerable, but growth does not occur if you're busy building walls. Take a risk and dismantle the barriers between you and others. Once you reestablish mutual respect, there is no limit to what teamwork can accomplish."
taurus,2016-06-16,"Relationships built on strong foundations can weather the emotional shifts that come with time. However, it may be tempting to skirt around the edges of honest communication in order to avoid conflict. Unfortunately, choosing the easy way out today is an invitation to more fundamental problems down the road. Bringing unresolved issues out into the open requires courage but it also gives you a chance to seek solutions. There's no getting around it; you must do the hard work if you want partnerships to last."
gemini,2016-06-16,"You might believe that time is running out and you will miss an awesome opportunity if you don't share your ideas with your colleagues or your boss today. In fact, this line of thinking contains a seed of truth as Venus and the Sun are both near the end of their respective journeys through your communicative sign. As awkward as it seems now, it will be even more difficult to start a conversation in a few days. Strike while the iron is hot or live with a tinge of regret."
cancer,2016-06-16,"Conflict arises when the gulf between fulfilling your current responsibilities and pursuing your fantasies about the future grows so wide that resolution seems impossible. Fortunately, you're able to live in two worlds today, with one foot on the path to success and the other one on a stairway to heaven. Luckily, the urgency to make your dreams come true today is in your head; time is on your side when your imagination aligns with reality."
leo,2016-06-16,"Although you may still lack a concrete master plan to get ahead at work, you're growing weary of flying by the seat of your pants. Take some time today to write down your goals, and then add a few sentences about accomplishing each of your various objectives. Don't worry if all the disparate ideas are not flowing into one overarching proposal. Focusing on the minute particulars will eventually lead you to your destination. Even a journey of a thousand miles is accomplished step by step."
virgo,2016-06-16,"You can talk a good game today, but execution might be more of a challenge. Three planets in chatty Gemini are busy wheeling and dealing in your 10th House of Career, enabling you to dazzle your coworkers with lots of words that fit together into a cohesive strategy. Unfortunately, there is a great difference between theory and practice, and you may be long on theory now and short on practice. Nevertheless, you need to navigate your way through tricky terrain with the confidence of a professional. There is no instruction manual; you must learn as you go."
libra,2016-06-16,"An unexpected bout of jealousy could hijack your day if you're not getting what you want, especially when someone around you seems to have everything. You might be more attached to the material world while the Moon and Mars in obsessive Scorpio are running the show in your 2nd House of Personal Resources. Unfortunately, the acquisition of more possessions is a dead-end path. Happiness is attainable when you realize that lasting riches are only found through spiritual pursuit."
scorpio,2016-06-16,"You're not interested in talking about how you can improve your life today; you prefer taking direct action now and then evaluating the consequences in real time. Although sometimes it's tempting to be sidetracked by lighthearted interactions, you want the fastest route to the jugular vein of meaning while the evocative Moon and speedy Mars are conspiring in your passionate sign. Life is very short and there is no time for meaningless distractions."
sagittarius,2016-06-16,"People seem to be unrealistically demanding of your time today, prompting you to seek solace away from the public eye. You may be quite frustrated with everyone tugging at you in different directions because you know that you can't fulfill all of their expectations and still honor your own needs. Although going off to be a hermit is not your typical response, a mini-retreat will do you good now. Honestly, it's not the worst thing for others to learn that they don't always have to depend on you to raise their spirits."
capricorn,2016-06-16,"Performing a solo act is not your first choice today. Although sharing the camaraderie of working toward a common goal with others is critical to your happiness now, it's not the only reason you want to be part of a successful team. You fully understand the power of collaboration and the strength that comes with numbers. Since you are so ambitious, it's smarter to bring colleagues in to support your efforts. The lifting power of many wings can achieve twice the distance of any bird flying alone."
aquarius,2016-06-16,"Your creative spirit fuels your ability to express yourself authentically today. However, you're not willing to walk out on a previous commitment or leave a promise unfulfilled if others are counting on you. Accordingly, you might need to save the spontaneity for another time when there is more flexibility in your schedule. In the meantime, consciously let your inner child out to play for short bursts of time throughout the day. Ultimately, success is a triumph of imagination."
pisces,2016-06-16,"Just when you thought you knew what was going on, reality gets slippery. A relationship that was going through a stressful phase suddenly appears better. Stress on the home front dissipates; however, if everything suddenly seems perfect, rest assured it's not. Nevertheless, don't go digging for trouble because you'll surely find it. Instead, accept the improvements for what they are and save your energy for when you will need it in the future. As the Buddhist master Thich Nhat Hanh said, ""The present moment is the only moment available to us, and it is the door to all moments."""
aries,2016-06-17,"You are impatiently waiting for the starting gate to open, yet continue to stand there once the race begins. You cherish the idea of rushing out ahead of the pack but, ironically, make no move to turn your dream into reality. Needless to say, you could work yourself into a state of frustration unless you snap out of your dazed-and-confused mindset. This is not the time to harbor grandiose schemes of world domination. Just take one step forward and then another; you will be crossing the finish line before you know it."
taurus,2016-06-17,"You may find out who your real friends are today as their actions allow you to see them in a new light. You might even discover that people have taken advantage of your trust. However, you have an opportunity to transform your disappointment into a realistic foundation for relationships built on truth rather than illusion. Keep in mind that you don't need allies who support your delusions. A true friendship is built on love and honesty even when it hurts."
gemini,2016-06-17,"As strange as it sounds, a crisis in self-confidence might be the best thing that could happen to you today. If you're concerned that your life path isn't taking you where you want to go, stop blindly barreling forward just because the momentum is on your side. Instead of identifying with your current job, think about what might bring additional meaning to your existence. You don't need to do anything yet that would dramatically impact your daily routine; just re-visioning your trajectory is enough for now. The road to enlightenment is always under construction."
cancer,2016-06-17,"You are confronted by a situation at work today that makes you realize your day-to-day responsibilities are preventing you from manifesting your dreams. Performing your job well brings a certain level of satisfaction, along with the stability of a regular paycheck. Unfortunately, it's not enough. Don't make the mistake of trying to finalize a course of action now; instead, seek what Zen Buddhists call ""Beginner's Mind."" Your path will become more obvious when you accept the fact that you don't have all the answers -- and never will."
leo,2016-06-17,"Clouds of uncertainty appear on your horizon and you might feel as if you're lost in a fog. If an intimate relationship is adding to the confusion, you may need to step back far enough to regain a healthy perspective. It's easy to misread someone's intentions when you're overly attached to the outcome. Take your emotional cues from others now rather than pushing your own agenda. Wait and see where the energy leads before making any long-term decisions. Patience is your friend."
virgo,2016-06-17,"Family responsibilities could take all the fun out of a relationship now, but balancing your fantasies with reality is advantageous in the long run. Avoid shifting blame onto a close friend or partner just because you don't possess the freedom you want. However, burying your feelings isn't a viable option today because unexpressed concerns will likely turn into resentment. Although you're traveling through unfamiliar emotional territory, there is great potential for growth if you're willing to peel away the illusions until the truth is revealed."
libra,2016-06-17,"You may feel as if you're floundering at work and you're not sure how to proceed today. It might even seem as if your boss doesn't understand you or that someone is actually resisting your contribution. The problem isn't in what's being said; to the contrary, it's the hidden agenda that's the sticking point now. Unfortunately, you can't take decisive action until you have all the facts. It's time to play the role of a detective and start asking questions that can lead you to the answers you need."
scorpio,2016-06-17,"Disillusionment can act as an unexpected wake-up call that offers you the potential to get real. Your imagination has inspired you to paint beautiful fantasies about people and places in your life. These dreams motivated you to make changes, pursue relationships and follow your heart. Now it's time to shed the illusions and work with whatever is left. Instead of mourning the loss, celebrate living in the truth. To paraphrase Lao Tzu, ""When you let go of what you were, you become what you might be."""
sagittarius,2016-06-17,"Knowing who to trust is challenging these days because it seems as if someone very close to you is subtly working against your best interests. Ironically, their resistance may be a reflection of your uncertainty about your own inner changes. Don't fall into the trap of pushing people away just because they no longer understand you. Instead of defending your integrity, seek mutual understanding by listening with an open mind to the concerns of others. As George Bernard Shaw wrote, ""The single biggest problem in communication is the illusion that it has taken place."""
capricorn,2016-06-17,"It's unsettling to discover that you made choices in your life based upon an incorrect assumption. On one hand, you may be angry if someone inadvertently misled you or purposefully deceived you. On the other hand, you have a fresh set of facts now that empower you to make new choices in the present moment. Move on with hope instead of looking back with regret. The future is yours to create."
aquarius,2016-06-17,"Your relationship with the material world is undergoing transformation and holding onto your old values will slow your spiritual growth. However, a lack of attention to managing the practical side of your finances leads to complications. Don't take any unnecessary risks with money now because hidden facts that could change everything have yet to come out into the open. Stay on your current course until your new goals become clear. As the Dalai Lama has said, ""No material object, however beautiful, can make us feel loved."""
pisces,2016-06-17,"It's all too easy to be so compassionate these days that you let down your walls, only to be overwhelmed with someone else's pain. Obviously, helping others in need is a worthy cause and motivates you to live your life in a loving manner. However, someone may take advantage of your kindness now in a way that could harden your softheartedness if you let it. Just remember, it has been said that every charitable act moves you one step closer to heaven."
aries,2016-06-18,"Your reactions may be so strong and swift today that your behavior is rather shocking. Of course, those who know you best realize that your bark is worse than your bite. However, most people won't know what to think if you disregard accepted social protocols and bluntly speak your truth. Thankfully, you can save yourself from having to clean up a mess later if you simply step outside of your limited point of view now. Walking a mile in someone else's shoes will change your perspective forever."
taurus,2016-06-18,"People like to rely on your consistency because they trust that you will show up day in and day out without much variance in your moods. Unfortunately, they may be in for a rude awakening today as you choose to flex your metaphysical muscles in your current quest for independence. You're not interested in altering your game plan now just to placate someone else. Nevertheless, a strategy based on shock and awe is not the smartest way to win friends and influence people. A touch of kindness works wonders."
gemini,2016-06-18,"You are like a Chatty Cathy that has no off switch today. Once you start talking, no one will be able to get you to stop. Fortunately, you are driven to communicate some very subtle laws of nature; your thinking is innovative now, but you're trying to squeeze too much information through a narrow verbal filter. Instead of hearing the sound of your own voice, practice listening to the stillness. Meaningful silence communicates more than meaningless words."
cancer,2016-06-18,"You're highly perceptive today, but you don't necessarily want to share your thoughts with anyone else. Although you have a lot to say, you're more intrigued by the potential pleasures and benefits of meditation. But there's a fine line now between walking a contemplative path and revealing your secrets. However, you are the only one who can decide how much is enough. Although you may be free to choose, you're not necessarily free from the consequences of your choices."
leo,2016-06-18,"Your opinions may be controversial but that won't stop you from talking about them today. However, you might fervently believe your position is fixed, only to change your mind just a few minutes later. Don't be so sure that you know exactly what's going down now in the arena of interpersonal relationships. The more certain you are in your presentation, the less you likely know. Stop worrying about other people's business; channel your passion into your art."
virgo,2016-06-18,"You may strut around today as if you are in total control of your surroundings. Nevertheless, unexpected events continue to catch you off guard throughout the day. Seemingly random occurrences are like the many-headed Hydra conquered by Hercules. Every time you step up and solve a problem, two more appear in its place. Eventually, you realize that a change in strategy is required. Instead of reacting to each crisis after it manifests, consider the underlying causes and deal with them proactively. It pays to work smarter not harder if you want to maintain your sanity."
libra,2016-06-18,"It seems as if the whole world has gone mad and you can't even depend on those people who normally come through for you with flying colors. Something is different now but you don't know what has changed. Perhaps your heightened sense of urgency is worrisome to others, prompting them to withdraw. Talking about your frustration won't help your cause today; sometimes communication is not the answer. Don't say anything unless it improves upon the existing silence. In the meantime, if you want to achieve success go out and get it on your own."
scorpio,2016-06-18,"The poet Edna St. Vincent Millay wrote, ""It's not true that life is one damn thing after another; it's one damn thing over and over."" You believe that your current message is simple and your words are clear; however, there is still an unexpected break in the chain of communication. You might even feel like you're talking to a wall today. Unfortunately, you have been at this juncture before. But the ways of the universe are mysterious and you can't always see immediate results from your actions. Success might be just around the corner if you're willing to wait."
sagittarius,2016-06-18,"Everyone has a different idea about what you could accomplish today, but your notion is the one that counts in the end. However, you don't live in a vacuum and must take other people's ideas into consideration before you selfishly follow your heart. But the world does not solely consist of black and white; there are many shades of gray in between the extremes. Solicit feedback from those you trust, but remember that a decision about your future must ultimately come from within."
capricorn,2016-06-18,"You might believe that your current problems would simply vanish into thin air if only you had a concrete plan for the weekend. Although you have amazing organizational skills, it's tricky to put them to use today because there are multiple paths in front of you and you can't decide which one is yours. Keeping all possibilities alive as long as possible could seem counterproductive, but it improves your chances to achieve satisfaction. Spontaneity is key to your happiness."
aquarius,2016-06-18,"You're like a wide-eyed kid with a Rubik's cube today. You know there is a solution to the puzzle and you're confident in your ability to figure it out. However, you don't have a clue where to begin. Unfortunately, things will only get worse if you jump in and just randomly move pieces around. Instead, let your brain do the work. When you recognize a pattern, test it out in reality. Starting small and building from there is your best strategy for ultimately deciphering the great secrets of the universe."
pisces,2016-06-18,"You may be wrapped up in your own world today, searching for ways to break out of habitual patterns. Logic suggests that you should begin with small steps but incremental modifications don't excite you now; you long to experience everything all at once. However, you can't fix external dynamics until you start changing your mind. Einstein wrote, ""No problem can be solved from the same level of consciousness that created it."""
aries,2016-06-19,"You have little patience for anyone who can't keep up with you today. It's not that you mean to be rude, but you can appear as if you don't care what others are going through. After all, your directness is legendary; you're already off to the next thing once you're done in your mind. However, your timing may be off now, along with your assessment of how much energy to apply toward reaching your goals. Sometimes, the quality of your relationships takes precedence over anything you achieve in the name of success."
taurus,2016-06-19,"People may push you too hard today as they try to convince you to join forces with them. However, like your cousin the Ox, you will not respond positively to someone's brand of persuasion. In fact, others will realize the futility of their ways once you dig your hooves into the ground. Nevertheless, demonstrating your power of persistence can be quite convincing as long as you don't let your resistance for change get the best of you."
gemini,2016-06-19,You're not known for your desire to retreat from social interactions but there's been so much noise in your life recently that you're longing for a well-deserved break. There's nothing wrong with just saying no and staying home for a change. Expending extra energy to justify your motives won't accomplish anything at all. Simply let people know that you need some time to recharge your emotional batteries so you can take on the world again next week.
cancer,2016-06-19,"Ambition is admirable but you have so many things on your schedule today that you can't do it all. However, too many commitments on your calendar block your creativity and prevent you from making the best use of your time. Open up your schedule by canceling non-essential appointments. Remaining flexible today is your key to success. A willow tree gains strengths from being able to bend; imagine what adapting to change can do for you."
leo,2016-06-19,"You expect to be in charge of your own space today, but your authority may be challenged on the home front. Unfortunately, you could jeopardize your chance to run the show if you let arrogance overshadow practicality. Establishing clear boundaries helps you navigate the uncertainties of interpersonal dynamics. Nevertheless, setting pride aside enables you to share power without acquiescing on those things that matter."
virgo,2016-06-19,"Minor conflicts with people who are close to you won't create lasting rifts, but they could be irritating enough to sour your day. Oddly enough, others don't seem to be as worked up about your disagreements as you are today. In fact, your aggressive stance now might be the primary factor in the arguments that appear to be started by everyone else. When you realize that competition is unnecessary, people around you suddenly become more cooperative."
libra,2016-06-19,"You are willing to work very hard today in order to achieve your goals, but your efforts may not be very consistent. Unfortunately, running hot and cold now is not nearly as effective as maintaining a constant temperature. Nevertheless, once you make up your mind, you can move mountains, change the course of rivers or even modify your work habits. According to an old Chinese proverb, it's wise to ""be not afraid of going slowly; be afraid only of standing still."""
scorpio,2016-06-19,"You don't like losing your temper because it requires so much energy to reclaim your center. However, you may create conflict where there is none today in order to assert your power. Unfortunately, aggressive behavior will not garner any support; in fact, people might distance themselves from you if your actions are of questionable intent. Thankfully, you can earn respect and even admiration by curbing your current urge to escalate a minor drama into a major crisis."
sagittarius,2016-06-19,"You may be hesitant to show all your cards today, especially if you're grappling with a sudden loss of confidence. You might even choose to work alone now to hide your current struggle from others. However, your brilliance shines for brief moments like a flash of lightning that is gone as quickly as it appears. Nevertheless, total isolation isn't the healthiest strategy for rebuilding your self-esteem. Instead, seek out a friend who will stand by you through thick and thin. Remember, self-doubt kills more dreams than failure ever will."
capricorn,2016-06-19,"Accepting your peers as they are can be an uphill battle today, especially if they promise one thing and do something else. People might assume that you are rigid in your thinking, but you can adapt to change as well as anyone. But you don't appreciate it when someone tells you a story just because they think it's what you want to hear. You don't demand perfection from your friends, but you do require loyalty and honesty. The truth may sting for a little while, but a lie leaves a scar."
aquarius,2016-06-19,"You want to be king of the hill today and will work extra hard to demonstrate your dominance. However, those who know you well might see through the bravado that you are using to cover a deeper insecurity. Thankfully, an unplanned conversation can sink beneath all the superficiality and bring a hidden truth into the light. Psychologist Dr. Brene Brown wrote, ""Vulnerability is the birthplace of innovation, creativity and change."""
pisces,2016-06-19,"The strength of your convictions is so compelling now that you can't separate yourself from your conclusions. You are all fired up today and ready to turn your passionate beliefs into decisive action. This lack of perspective can create sudden discord and it's nearly impossible to discern your role in encouraging a clash of ideas. Just because you're given an opportunity to get angry, doesn't mean you have to take it."
aries,2016-06-20,"There are plenty of amazing ideas floating around in your head today, yet selecting one and sticking with it is a real challenge. The visionary Sagittarius Full Moon lights up your 9th House of Adventure, inspiring scintillating thoughts of exotic travel. Unfortunately, you can't just pick up and go wherever you please now. The reality of this situation finally sinks in, requiring you to leave your idealistic fantasies behind. Nevertheless, dreams can come true and it can happen to you when you're wild at heart."
taurus,2016-06-20,"You might hope that a casual relationship deepens today as the Sagittarius Full Moon shines in your 8th House of Intimacy. However, as much as you attempt to change the topic of discussion, it continues to cycle back around to clever banter that avoids emotional intensity. There are strong cosmic forces at play now that lift your spirits and infuse your heart with optimism, whether or not it's warranted. Nothing good will come from forcing a conversation that grows further and further out of reach. Paradoxically, you still might achieve better results at catching someone's eye once you stop trying so hard."
gemini,2016-06-20,"A recent change in relationship dynamics continues to impact your life in unexpected ways. Although you're free to explore the meaning of life with a philosophical companion, the Sagittarius Full Moon's presence in your 7th House of Others can bring another partnership into sharper focus. However, the real breakthroughs won't come from focusing on the light; hidden treasures are buried in the darkness, and it's up to you to uncover them."
cancer,2016-06-20,"You may be clinging to old patterns at work, yet the planets are calling you to break out of your shell and move boldly into your future. The creative energy of the Sagittarius Full Moon infuses your 6th House of Self-Improvement, making this an ideal time to organize the tools in your toolbox while brushing up on your technique. Instead of stressing about where your current path leads, simply do your best in every moment to improve your chances of finding satisfaction."
leo,2016-06-20,"You are thrilled at the prospect of performing for your home team today. However, you may experience trouble as you arrange all the pieces and discover that they don't fit together so perfectly. Nevertheless, the philosophical Sagittarius Full Moon is reflecting energy in your 5th House of Self-Expression, reminding you to remain authentic in all of your words and deeds. Wisdom is knowing which road is the right one; integrity is taking it."
virgo,2016-06-20,"Your mind is soaring high into the atmosphere today, but the trick is to bring it back down with a graceful landing. You might prefer to leave some of your loftier ideas in the abstract realms of thought. Nevertheless, you can't resist the chance to manifest your dreams while the inspirational Sagittarius Full Moon stirs the energy in your 4th House of Foundations. Your branches can reach the stars only if your roots sink deeply into the earth."
libra,2016-06-20,"You're not very happy when you're sent back to the drawing board to re-create your plan for the future. Your previous draft contained many excellent ideas, but they were not woven into a cohesive tapestry. In order to move forward you must assimilate the wisdom of the Sagittarius Full Moon as it stimulates your 3rd House of Learning. There are snippets of information that you lost along the way; don't miss this opportunity to expand your perspective by carefully thinking things through once again from the start."
scorpio,2016-06-20,"You may doubt your ability to perform your job up to acceptable standards today. However, it turns out that your critical eye is sharper than anyone else's. Others think you are doing an amazing job, while all you see are your mistakes. Fortunately, you can use the uplifting Sagittarius Full Moon to boost the energy of your 2nd House of Self-Worth. Focusing on your accomplishments rather than your failures elevates your self-esteem and improves your future chances for success."
sagittarius,2016-06-20,"Maintaining objectivity is no small feat as you try to untangle sticky relationship dynamics. Although the reflective Sagittarius Full Moon illuminates your 1st House of Self, you still must balance your emotional needs with those of others. Unfortunately, you're not happy about the restrictions someone is placing on you. You may be tempted to rebel but that isn't the most practical course. Instead, radically changing your attitude enables you to grow within the confines of the status quo."
capricorn,2016-06-20,"In theory, you know how important it is to get along with others. However, in practice, you may want to act like an ostrich and bury your head in the sand, letting the noise of the world go by. The inspirational Sagittarius Full Moon sinks into your 12th House of Spiritual Mystery, empowering you to think great thoughts within the privacy of your mind. Others might miss the significance of your current mental meanderings, and you don't have to reveal your secrets unless there's a good reason. Thankfully, your imagination is your wonderland."
aquarius,2016-06-20,"You have high hopes about participating in a group effort today. You understand that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, and you prefer to experience this dynamic directly. Although the Sagittarius Full Moon rocks your 11th House of Social Networking, you mustn't lose sight of your individual needs and your unique contribution to the cause. In a perfect world, teamwork divides the tasks while multiplying the success."
pisces,2016-06-20,"You are quite responsive to the needs of others now and want to do everything within your reach to help those you love and respect. The Sagittarius Full Moon is pulling the strings in your 10th House of Authority, leaving little room for anyone else to take control. But even your best-laid plans can fall apart if you spread yourself too thin. The real secret to success is in deciding what is most important and leaving the rest for another day."
aries,2016-06-21,"You wish you could recapture your lost innocence, but yesterday's lofty ideas have transformed into today's heavy workload. It's not that you're overwhelmed with all the logistics; in fact, you're eager to get started. It's just that you grow increasingly pragmatic about the limitations of your time as the day wears on. Instead of adhering to your I-can-do-everything attitude, set yourself up for success by adjusting your goals to align with reality."
taurus,2016-06-21,"You're riding a wave of productive energy now, yet it's up to you to make the most of the momentum. You might be able to breeze through the day without breaking a sweat, but kicking back is not a wise use of the current cosmic conditions. Instead of waiting until a crisis motivates you to take action, set ambitious goals and make a sincere commitment to reach them. Going the extra mile today determines your future success."
gemini,2016-06-21,"You lighthearted Twins are known to be champions at avoiding discussions about difficult issues. You can make it look like you're diving into the topic, only to smoothly waltz around the edge of an emotional abyss. However, you're driven to dig deeper today in order to process intense feelings that are impeding your progress. Sometimes you need to head directly into the center of the storm in order to reach your destination."
cancer,2016-06-21,"People won't be able to push you around today just because they have good intentions. Friends might claim that they are trying to help you, even if you believe they're overstepping your boundaries. You may need to be very firm when you tell others to back off. There's no need to be afraid of an intense encounter now, especially since it's your right to make decisions for yourself. As author Anne Lamott wrote, ""No. is a complete sentence."""
leo,2016-06-21,"There is little room for negotiation today when it comes to managing your schedule. You know what you need to do at work to finish your assignments and you're not in the mood to waste time with anyone who stands in your way now. Use every potential distraction as fuel to hone your concentration. Remember the words of Winston Churchill who said, ""You will never reach your destination if you stop and throw stones at every dog that barks."""
virgo,2016-06-21,"You possess the power to create great change today, yet it's up to you to decide where to focus your energy. Your actions impact others in a profound manner, especially if you are actively involved in a social cause. You seem to be a magnet for positive transformation, even in the realm of personal relationships. However, you will be more effective now if you widen your perspective and work for the good of many rather than your own individual interests. John F. Kennedy said, ""To whom much is given, much is required."""
libra,2016-06-21,"Your sense of loyalty to your parents or siblings can create stress if your social life pulls you in a different direction. The proverb, ""blood is thicker than water"" holds special meaning for you today. Even in the midst of disagreement, family relationships have more weight than those with friends and coworkers. Although you might be pushed to make a decision, in the final analysis there's really no conflict. When you are guided by your moral compass all the little things fall into place."
scorpio,2016-06-21,"Your unwavering integrity is like a bright light that shines on those who know you well. Your closest friends appreciate how seriously you listen to their problems and the wisdom you share with them. Although you may often be a rock of stability in someone else's life, sometimes you're the one who needs a shoulder to lean on. Psychologist Bren Brown says, ""What makes you vulnerable makes you beautiful."" Don't hold back from those you love; show your strength by revealing your truth, even if you're not perfect."
sagittarius,2016-06-21,"You may be unusually cautious around others today, revealing your feelings only on a need-to-know basis. However, your personal values give you a stronger sense of purpose now that can be inspirational to your peers. Rather than carefully skirting around a discussion of your core beliefs, bring them out into the open for everyone to examine. Whether or not someone shares your perspective, they will respect your actions even more once they see that they are aligned with your heart."
capricorn,2016-06-21,"You're not a pushover just because your actions can appear so magnanimous now. You are willing to go the extra mile to help someone in need until your motives are brought into question. But it's unlikely that anyone would pick a fight with you today because your body language is clearly saying, ""Don't mess with me."" Nevertheless, refrain from overreacting because your need to protect your heart could inadvertently precipitate the very same conflict you wish to avoid. There are no winners when egos engage in battle."
aquarius,2016-06-21,"You're not interested in meaningless social encounters today; you would prefer to withdraw from the crowd and focus on your goals. In fact, you might see other people as potential distractions now rather than possible partners. You have plenty to accomplish and believe you're better off doing it alone, whether it's true or not. As long as you don't hurt anyone's feelings, a bit of solitude is good for your soul."
pisces,2016-06-21,"Your friends have your back today and may bail you out in ways that you don't expect. Thankfully, it's unlikely you will even need to ask for help now; it just seems to magically arrive out of the blue in the nick of time. Nevertheless, it's not a good idea to idly stand around waiting for assistance from the universe. You are much more likely to get lucky if you work hard and answer the door when opportunity knocks."
aries,2016-06-22,"A good idea will turn into an unworkable plan unless you exercise a healthy dose of  self-restraint along the way. You might be able to justify expanding the size and scope of your vision by ignoring the feedback you receive from your colleagues. However, a rude awakening is no fun at all when you realize you overstepped the practical limitations of your time. Thankfully, you can avoid trouble later in the day by scaling down everyone's expectations before things get out of hand. Put unrealistic goals on the backburner for now. Promise less, deliver more."
taurus,2016-06-22,"You grow anxious when circumstances shift too quickly. You prefer to move through change at your own pace and only after you are ready. Unfortunately, you might find yourself in over your head when a simple thought that you share with someone in the morning evolves into a major initiative by the afternoon. Naturally, you can't take your words back, so you must figure out a way to rise to the occasion. You'll never know what is possible unless you try."
gemini,2016-06-22,"You can talk circles around everyone today without actually saying anything of substance. It's just that your mind is zipping along so fast now that you don't consider the consequences of your words before you move on to the next great idea. Fortunately, the calculating Capricorn Moon is standing in the wings to help you follow through on an innovative breakthrough if you're willing to slow down. It's easy to impress others with your erratic brilliance now, but it's essential that you consciously choose to focus on one concept long enough to make it last."
cancer,2016-06-22,"It might feel as if people are encouraging you one moment and then just a few minutes later telling you that your dreams are unrealistic. You're not sure whether to run with a current idea or shift your attention to something entirely different. Try not to lose your optimism in the face of criticism. Working methodically to cultivate a plan will bring more rewards than scattering your energy over a wide range of possibilities. When you stick to your original thoughts, they have an opportunity to take root and grow."
leo,2016-06-22,"You possess a keen ability to connect the dots as you mix and mingle with people in your network today. Coworkers bring a variety of agendas, but you're able to synthesize them in a way that motivates everyone to work together. In a more social environment, your friends may have conflicting preferences about an upcoming activity, yet your sharp perceptions can see through the differences and bring the group back to center. In either case, there's no room for sloppy thinking on your part. It has been said that if you chase two rabbits, both will escape."
virgo,2016-06-22,"Self-discipline is your friend; without it you are likely to flounder about today. But circumstances test your resolve as rational Mercury is distracted by exorbitant Jupiter. The big question is whether or not you can maintain your focus in spite of your desire to fit as much as possible into your day. It may be helpful to rely on a system and to establish ground rules early in the game. If you set limits and work within them, there's no end to what you can accomplish."
libra,2016-06-22,"Your plans for an upcoming vacation may not be solidified yet, but that won't stop you from sharing them with anyone who will listen. Unfortunately, your next great adventure might seem more tangible to you than it does to everyone else. There is no reason to involve others in your process yet. Not only do you avoid negative feedback by keeping your thoughts quiet, your silence enables you to develop your vision further before bringing anything out into the open. Instead of setting yourself up for disappointment today, minimize your stress by saying less."
scorpio,2016-06-22,"Your penchant for delving into the mysteries of the universe can hijack your schedule today. You are intrigued by what you cannot see; you want to explore everyone's motives and may initiate discussions in order to satisfy your curiosity. However, it's crucial to be aware of the boundaries that others establish for their own emotional safety. Too many questions on your part could make someone feel insecure enough that they suddenly shut down. Employing a dash of diplomacy allows the conversation to continue in a non-threatening way."
sagittarius,2016-06-22,"You're cruising for an argument today, but not because you like the idea of conflict. You are attracted to the dance of dialogue as you exercise your wit and charm. But interactions with intelligent people are not meant to be limited to clever superficiality. The trick is to go deep and engage others in meaningful conversations about your favorite subjects. But choosing the right person for this metaphysical tango is essential. As Winnie the Pooh said, ""As soon as I saw you, I knew an adventure was going to happen."""
capricorn,2016-06-22,"Although your brain is processing information as fast as everyone else, you have an uncanny ability to structure your thoughts in an orderly manner. You can walk into nearly any situation and quickly discern the facts--spoken and unspoken. Just make sure you use your intellectual skills to improve upon the current dynamics rather than being critical or dismissive. Intuitively, you know how to put the pieces together and are willing to assume a leadership position. When the going gets tough, the tough get going."
aquarius,2016-06-22,"Your mind is seeking puzzles to solve today and the more complex the scenario, the more determined you are to figure it all out. Unfortunately, there may be responsibilities on your shoulders that prevent you from pursuing the satisfaction of intellectual distraction. However, you will excel at whatever you must do for work if you find a way to enjoy yourself in the process. Impossible only means that you haven't yet found the solution."
pisces,2016-06-22,"Your ambitious attitude seems to be reflected by friends today as they encourage you to take your ideas to the next level. But their positive feedback has a shadow side that could prompt you to overlook an obvious problem and plow ahead without regard for the facts. Unfortunately, making decisions based upon your fantasies alone will only lead to disillusionment. Don't fall victim to blind optimism; remember, you are seeing reality through a magnifying lens now. Too many disappointments are usually a sign of too many expectations."
aries,2016-06-23,"Too much spontaneity might not work in your favor when explaining complex ideas today. You could trip over your own words in your eagerness to present your perspective to others. Fortunately, a small amount of preparation puts your thoughts in order, giving you the structure you need to make your point. Don't be afraid of committing to a specific plan; ironically, working within a rigid framework will free you to be more creative than you can imagine."
taurus,2016-06-23,"You may be pushed to follow through with your commitment today if you recently promised to help someone reach his or her dreams. Unfortunately, the situation at work has changed and you must be more practical now than you had hoped. Normally, you're a paragon of simplicity; you say what you're going to do and then you do it in a straightforward manner. However, progress appears to be a crooked path. Don't give up, even if everything takes much longer than you expect. In the final analysis, your unwavering determination is your greatest asset."
gemini,2016-06-23,"Your thoughts are wandering all over the place today and your coworkers might think that you've lost your bearings. However, nothing could be further from the truth. You know where you're going; you're just not sure how to get there. Fortunately, you're willing and able to navigate on the fly. There's no need to wait until you have a plan in place before you start to talk. Take anyone along who is willing to travel with you but don't try to recruit those who have a different agenda."
cancer,2016-06-23,"Your perceptions are very sharp today but you don't necessarily want to express your point of view. You may attempt to hold out by guarding your secrets with a stony silence. Meanwhile, powerful people continue to request, even demand, that you reveal what you know. Eventually, your resistance begins to fade, leaving you with a good feeling about participating in the group process. The idea of helping others outweighs your need to fly beneath the radar."
leo,2016-06-23,"Interpersonal dynamics on the job seem to grow more convoluted day by day. Just when you think you've figured everything out, another problem pops up like a carnival game of Whack-a-Mole. Try as you might, you can't keep up with all the changes. Nevertheless, walking away is not an option. Continue to react to each crisis as calmly as possible, but take this as a gentle reminder that you are human and do not possess super-hero powers. Successful people make mistakes but they never quit."
virgo,2016-06-23,"You may be sending mixed messages at work today without being aware of it. Perhaps you are trying to keep your options open while others are looking to you for a succinct answer. But you're being pulled simultaneously in two different directions now, and it is driving you crazy. Although your powers of rational analysis often function effortlessly, logic fails you if it can't resolve your dilemma. Trust your intuition not your intellect for the best results."
libra,2016-06-23,"You believe that adopting a philosophical approach to life will help you shake up your old routine and empower you to embark on a new course. However, people around you are less interested in your conceptual thinking now than they are in seeing solutions in real time. But it's not realistic to think you can completely avoid communication today. Instead of talking about the unrealized potential of the future, concentrate on small actions in the present moment that will positively impact the world around you."
scorpio,2016-06-23,"Your thinking process is quite circuitous and could even be devious now as you strive to reach your goals. You're intrigued by people's reactions to your ideas, but they won't always share their private thoughts with you. The harder you push others to reveal what's on their minds today, the thicker they will build their walls of armor. Don't force your potential supporters further underground; take a few steps back and give everyone plenty of room to breathe."
sagittarius,2016-06-23,"People around you are so chatty today that it begins to grate on your nerves. Ironically, you're often the one who can be so talkative that others request your silence. Nevertheless, the tables are turned now and you might not be very diplomatic in your search for peace and quiet. It doesn't cost anything to be nice; a little kindness on your part soothes everyone's ruffled feathers. A taste of your own medicine is good for you every once in a while."
capricorn,2016-06-23,"You are apt to use your persuasive communication skills at work today in order to move closer to achieving your long-term goals. Unfortunately, your interactions with others are stressful now because your current objectives could run into a conflict of interest with theirs. Cut yourself some slack and seek ways to nurture your spirit, rather than relentlessly aiming at the summit. Sometimes you need to let down your guard and let the good times roll. Adapting to change leads to success."
aquarius,2016-06-23,"You express your creativity so subtly today that people in your immediate environment could easily misread your energy. Others may see you as  self-protective now and slightly withdrawn. But you are actually eager to demonstrate your emotional availability to someone you trust, even if this type of vulnerability normally makes your skin crawl. Finding safe ways to share your feelings is a win-win endeavor for everyone involved."
pisces,2016-06-23,"You might not be in the mood to be the star of the show now. Fortunately, you can use this time constructively to quietly work behind the scenes and build up the confidence of those around you. People will respect your dedication even more if you are unwavering in your drive to do your best while remaining out of the spotlight. There's no need to shout your feelings from the rooftop; you'll receive the recognition you deserve when you least expect it."
aries,2016-06-24,"Somehow you intuitively know what your friends and associates are thinking today and you want to use your newfound awareness to nurture them. However, you could get ahead of yourself by jumping to an incorrect conclusion, only to realize that you're alienating the very same people you want to help. Fortunately, you can easily avoid complications by taking the time to check out your assumptions before acting on them. Your intentions are only as good as your actions."
taurus,2016-06-24,"People seem to have fixed opinions about what you should be doing at work today, but you are unable to please everyone at this time. The problem is exacerbated by conflicts of interest since whatever you choose to do will be at odds with someone's expectations. Instead of hiding your dilemma, share it whenever possible. Others won't judge you as harshly if they understand how your attention is being drawn in several different directions now. As is often the case, clear communication is the secret to your success."
gemini,2016-06-24,"You may be suffering from an acute case of wanderlust today, and it seems as if nothing short of an airplane ticket will soothe your soul. However, upon further analysis it becomes obvious that your real goal is not to explore someplace new; it's to find a cure for your overwhelming boredom. Instead of heading out of town, add excitement into your regular routine. Go out of your way to meet new people or do something you've never done before. Remember, your life won't improve by chance now; it gets better by change."
cancer,2016-06-24,"Concealing your feelings is a coping mechanism that often works for you in uncomfortable situations. Sometimes, you might do nearly anything to avoid the possibility of rejection or embarrassment. However, your reactions are so strong today that there is little chance of hiding them. Thankfully, your emotions exert less power over you once they are out on the table. When you open the door to your heart, you broaden your horizons and strengthen your relationships."
leo,2016-06-24,"It's a mixed blessing when your closest relationships are infused with an extra shot of passion. It's all too easy to escalate a minor disagreement into a major battle. Unfortunately, a bitter conflict now will produce two losers. The only way to win an argument today is to avoid it. There are better tactics than fighting to resolve your differences. Demonstrate your generosity of spirit by turning the other cheek. Shift your frame of reference by transforming a confrontation into a collaboration."
virgo,2016-06-24,"Reconciling your thoughts with your feelings can be tricky today, especially if your workload is heavy. Your response to the pressures of the day is to reveal as little as possible in an attempt to prevent your unstable emotions from hijacking your plans for the day. Fortunately, holding your cards close to the chest not only prevents others from seeing your weakness; it also increases your concentration and improves the quality of your game."
libra,2016-06-24,"You wish you could take your coworkers under your wings today, but your overprotective reflexes might hinder rather than promote progress. You may believe that it's best to keep your emotions out of the picture so they don't interfere with your objectivity when it comes to your job. However, you're less effective when you're worrying about which secrets to hide. Let your heart act as your compass, but give everyone else the room they need to grow on their own."
scorpio,2016-06-24,"Although you're normally quite content to keep your own company, you may not want to be alone today. In fact, if you're not careful you could even become overly possessive when it comes to someone else's time. However, your social network grows less stable when you lean on others to define your emotional security. Your unrelenting intensity might even push those away that you wish to draw closer. You have the best chance of being supported by a friend if you're straightforward about your needs from the start."
sagittarius,2016-06-24,"Of course, you think you're being fair-minded in your assessment of others, but your perceptions are colored by your desires today. There's nothing wrong with knowing what you want, but it's necessary to develop enough self-awareness so you can separate your emotional needs from objective reality. Fortunately, interpersonal interactions are quite compelling now because you're not interested in keeping things shallow. Be like Gandhi who said, ""I crave a love so deep the ocean would be jealous."""
capricorn,2016-06-24,"You want to be surrounded by your favorite things today, but creature comforts won't bring you the satisfaction you crave. There is more to life than simply fulfilling your material needs. Your true value as a human being is not measured by the amount of your possessions or the size of your bank account. In the final analysis, your relationships bring you more joy than anything else. Take a risk and open your heart. You can't reach great heights unless you're willing to experience great depths."
aquarius,2016-06-24,"You are quite demanding of others today, but that's only because you hold yourself to such high standards. Your focus on the logistics makes it difficult to relax now because there's always another detail begging for your attention. Nevertheless, your productivity could surpass your expectations as long as you set clear priorities and stick to them. Leading by example carries more weight than any ultimatum ever could."
pisces,2016-06-24,"You may be on a spiritual quest now, but you have no inclination to share your metaphysical discoveries with anyone else. In fact, your inner world remains totally invisible to others today; they are not even aware of your personal search for meaning. But your current journey is not a pursuit built on intellectual curiosity. You can feel your hunger for something deeper in every cell of your body. As Sufi poet Rumi wrote, ""It's your road, and yours alone. Others may walk it with you but no one can walk it for you."""
aries,2016-06-25,"You may surprise those closest to you by expressing your desire to disappear into the shadows now. You don't feel very ambitious and you prefer spending more time daydreaming than interacting with others. The lack of wind in your sails might be disconcerting at first, but you finally get the cosmic message and realize that it's okay to just drift in your imagination for a while. Thankfully, today's dreams can become tomorrow's reality."
taurus,2016-06-25,"You're highly sensitized to the needs of others today, but you still might put your agenda ahead of everyone else's. You may be clinging to an unrealistic fantasy and refuse to let it go even when you're confronted by the facts. However, playing the avoidance game in the face of the truth is not a sensible strategy. If you have chosen your friends wisely, there's no reason to deny what they say now. Your willingness to change makes you a hero in someone else's eyes."
gemini,2016-06-25,"You don't mind performing on center stage today, especially if your act reveals another side of your personality. You can often juggle words effortlessly to misdirect someone's attention while your mischievous antics distract others from the not-so-obvious truth. However, you have an opportunity to give people a rare glimpse into a part of yourself that you normally keep hidden. No one else is holding you back; the resistance you must overcome now is your own."
cancer,2016-06-25,"Your philosophical approach can be rather detached from your feelings today. It's all too easy to base your opinions on unsubstantiated beliefs rather than a solid foundation of facts. If you find yourself doggedly arguing against someone else's point of view, step back and check the validity of your information. Conversations will likely go in a positive direction if you remember to verify your assumptions. Listening as much as you talk offers you a better chance of finding common ground."
leo,2016-06-25,"You may be misleading yourself today, without even realizing that you're the source of your own confusion. Normally, exploring the margins of reality can reveal the truth. However, moving out of the three-dimensional world is not advised since there's no straightforward way to integrate extrasensory experiences now. Although you might hit a few speedbumps, you'll be able to continue on your journey without too much delay. Instead of searching for meaning in every distraction, follow the map directly to your destination."
virgo,2016-06-25,"Trusting people can be quite a challenge, especially if a close friend is behaving in an unusual manner today. It's not that folks are unreliable now; it's just that they seem more emotionally distant because their attention is on other matters. But trying to rein others in is a mistake; they will only resist by showing you their stubborn sides, instead. A smarter strategy is to concentrate on your own path rather than anyone else's. Remember, unwavering determination is one of the essential ingredients of success."
libra,2016-06-25,"There is plenty to do today, but you could easily blow off your regular responsibilities in order to pursue more pleasurable activities. Unfortunately, you might declare a premature ending to a friendly encounter because you know you should get back to work. Acknowledge the breath-like process of inhalation and exhalation in your daily routine. Expand and contract as the situation changes instead of making any sudden moves. Thankfully, balance is not something you find, it's something you create."
scorpio,2016-06-25,"You are driven by your imagination today and see no obstacles on your path to making your dreams come true. However, the harsh reality of a lack of time or money can change your trajectory rather unexpectedly. Fortunately, even a cash shortage won't prevent you from reaching your goals if you budget your resources carefully before you start. The sooner you eliminate extraneous activities and expenses, the quicker you will be able to get your bearings and plot a new course."
sagittarius,2016-06-25,"You might not be able to control what's happening on the home front today. Part of the problem is you're likely to misinterpret the facts. Ironically, you can observe the exact same circumstances as someone else, yet tell an entirely different story. Rather than assuming everyone should be on the same page now, celebrate the diversity of the human spirit. Addressing family matters is easier when you approach them with an open mind and a loving heart."
capricorn,2016-06-25,"People seem so nice today that you have trouble believing your own perceptions. However, you can read between the lines and hear between the words if you try. Fortunately, learning to trust your intuition helps you to navigate the murky waters of emotional dynamics. If you make sure to start off with the truth, you will arrive at your desired destination on time. Honesty is the key to integrity in relationships."
aquarius,2016-06-25,"Seeing yourself clearly is nearly impossible today and your self-esteem could suffer unless you stop to acknowledge your conflicting emotions. You might feel as if you don't fit in with your social group now, whether it's family or friends. This sense of isolation may be the catalyst that sends you down a spiral of self-doubt. However, focusing on what you can do for others quickly restores your confidence. When your attention is directed outward, rather than inward, there's no limit to what you can accomplish."
pisces,2016-06-25,"Somehow you intuitively know what your friends and associates are thinking today and you want to use your newfound awareness to nurture them. However, you could get ahead of yourself by jumping to an incorrect conclusion, only to realize that you're alienating the very same people you want to help. Fortunately, you can easily avoid complications by taking the time to check out your assumptions before acting on them. Your intentions are only as good as your actions."
aries,2016-06-26,"You know that realizing your long-term dreams is possible if you consistently work toward manifesting them. However, putting your beliefs into action isn't always a simple task. Your key planet Mars is nearing the end of its retrograde cycle, prompting you to focus on recent setbacks rather than successes. If you want to improve your life now, there is no room for self-doubt. Keep your ambitious goals in sight and relentlessly push ahead without looking back. If you don't allow for the possibility of failure, you're more likely to succeed."
taurus,2016-06-26,"It might seem as if your friends aren't interested in your pet project or favorite social cause. But don't write them off too quickly, because they could turn out to be your most ardent supporters over time. People may agree with your underlying objective, while differing with your methods. Unfortunately, you probably won't have much luck convincing anyone to join your parade. Instead, strike up the band and start marching on your own. Others will fall into step once they see you're on the move."
gemini,2016-06-26,"Containing your erratic energy requires a superhuman effort today. Fortunately, you can do nearly anything you put your mind to now as long as the end result is supported by your core beliefs. However, once you decide whether you are in or out, you still need to apply yourself diligently to your goals. A lackadaisical attitude won't work in your favor; your commitment must be one hundred percent. Success comes when you release your fears and embrace the future."
cancer,2016-06-26,"A molehill can suddenly transform into a mountain if you don't get what you want today. Although you might only experience a short delay, your growing concerns could be the source of your defeat. Thankfully, the cosmos will align on your behalf if you're willing to accept its help. However, a positive attitude alone is not a guarantee for happiness. Your goals must take the needs of others into consideration, too. You are more likely to feel like a winner now if everyone benefits from your success."
leo,2016-06-26,"You are not afraid of turning everything upside down now in order to break out of the status quo. However, you realize that you're not in this predicament alone and your ability to improve your life is entwined with the lives of others who share your values. Nevertheless, there will still be points of contention between you and your loved ones. Don't let petty differences stand in the way of progress. The glue that holds you together is stronger than the fears that could tear you apart."
virgo,2016-06-26,"You can't deliver a new message in the same old way. In fact, you must step outside the realms of predictability in order to shock your audience awake. However, there is a fine line between being unconventional enough to grab everyone's attention and so outrageous that no one listens to your speech. Fortunately, you possess the power of persuasion now and can convince others to see the world from your unique point of view. Keep your directive short and sweet if you want others to rally to your cause."
libra,2016-06-26,"It's scary to tell others what you want if you're not sure that they share your desires. You might be afraid of being judged or rejected for your personal preferences when you actually need the support of your friends and family now. It's never fun to worry about whether or not you will be loved unconditionally. Luckily, people will likely accept you along with your proclivities, even if they don't share similar tastes. The power of positive change is on your side; but you must take an emotional risk even if it increases your vulnerability in the process."
scorpio,2016-06-26,"Intense waves of change are flowing in your direction now, empowering you to influence the future. Even the tiniest actions can generate very significant consequences, yet suspicious Pluto doesn't take kindly to the selfish use of its powerful energy. Thankfully, auspicious Jupiter is in the mix, reminding you that there will be rewards waiting for you if you include everyone in your plans. However, cooperating with others is only half the story; you must actively work for their best interests in order to make the most of this cosmic momentum."
sagittarius,2016-06-26,"Sometimes your magnanimous approach to life can seem too idealistic for others to support. However, your same big ideas are currently grounded in very practical ways that lead to concrete improvements at home or at work. But this level of profound change doesn't occur overnight, even as evolutionary Pluto trines your key planet Jupiter today. You can't judge the success of your efforts by the progress you make now. Set your goals and stick with them; life is a journey, not a race."
capricorn,2016-06-26,"You are normally driven by your ambitions, but your desire for emotional security becomes more important than anything else today. Unfortunately, stability might be lacking in your relationship world now. Nevertheless, you have all the tools you need in order to transform your life. Establishing priorities, organizing your resources and creating specific goals will set the stage for the work ahead. Instead of focusing on a current failure, concentrate on your future success."
aquarius,2016-06-26,"There's a tremendous amount of change occurring deep within your subconscious now. You might notice your dreams are more intense but probably haven't given it much thought. Nevertheless, tectonic plates are shifting within your imagination, creating metaphysical earthquakes and releasing a tremendous amount of energy. You stand to benefit from this inner turmoil, especially if you can quiet your mind enough to get in touch with your own power. Don't be greedy and save it for your personal gain. As Anne Frank wrote, ""No one has ever become poor by giving."""
pisces,2016-06-26,"It takes quite a bit of contemplation today to choose which of your friends and relatives are worthy of your trust. Everyone seems to have a bright idea now, but you can't say yes to every opportunity that shows up at your door. You must limit your choices or you will just scatter your energy without accomplishing anything. However, developing a working relationship with the right person can take your life in an entirely new direction. Don't rush your decision; you will live with its consequences for a long time to come."
aries,2016-06-27,"The speed at which you react today creates a thrill a minute. Even if you already are living life at full throttle, you believe you can somehow fit more into it. Nevertheless, others might not be aware of the emotional intensity behind your eyes. Whether you're soaring on the wings of fantasy or plotting to take over the world, everyone else just thinks it's business as usual. But bringing others along on your adventure is probably a waste of your precious time now. Seize the moment or live with regret."
taurus,2016-06-27,"Turning a romantic vision into reality might seem like too much work today. Instead, you are content to experience potential love as a sweet fantasy without trying to make it real. However, the extra effort it takes to give substance to your feelings is more than worthwhile when magical Neptune trines sensual Venus. Some things are better left in metaphysical realms but, thankfully, the cosmos is conspiring to manifest your sweetest dreams now if you don't offer any resistance. All you have to do is open your heart."
gemini,2016-06-27,"Wearing rose-colored glasses today enables you to look beyond the current circumstances and see an amazing array of possibilities. Although you must be careful about confusing your professional aspirations with improbable fantasies, it is your unfettered vision that reveals the true potential of the present moment. Instead of focusing on all the sensible reasons to maintain the status quo, concentrate on seeing your future in the rainbow light of perfection. Whatever you can imagine in your mind's eye becomes the fuel to achieve your dreams."
cancer,2016-06-27,"You are standing at the confluence of two mighty rivers today. Beautiful Venus inspires the waters of your imagination to flow freely now, while the proactive Aries Moon delivers the energy you need to make your dreams come true. Although you might be hesitant to push away from the security of the shore, you can't manifest your destiny if you are afraid of a little turbulence. The currents are strong and will carry you steadily into the future if you have the courage to trust the process of change."
leo,2016-06-27,"You are making your way through a field of illusions today as your desires prompt you to react before thinking through all of your options. Unfortunately, you are seeing the world as you would like it to be, rather than how it actually is now. Nevertheless, there may be rich treasures buried in your imagination, but be careful not to confuse them with reality. Take the necessary time to create a concrete plan that gets you from point A to point B on a map. The universe is more than ready to show you miracles if you practice patience and put your faith into action."
virgo,2016-06-27,"Regardless of recent setbacks, you believe that anything is possible now. Fortunately, this positive thinking is not just based on blind optimism. Whatever you begin today has the potential to turn out even better than your expectations. As you know, you can't just assume that your future will be rosy; you must also be willing to work hard to make it happen. Nevertheless, your unshakeable belief in your dreams is a necessary key to manifesting your success as you envision it within your imagination."
libra,2016-06-27,"It's no fun to feel as if others are pushing you to take action when you aren't ready yet. Nevertheless, you know more than anyone that a moment of patience is a small price to pay for making the right decision. Don't be afraid to establish clear boundaries with someone whose insistence makes you uncomfortable. Your inner guidance will not steer you wrong if you create the space to contemplate the quiet wisdom behind the external noise. Silence is your friend."
scorpio,2016-06-27,"Although you're willing to jump in and do your part at work, you might prefer to spend time pursuing pleasure more than anything else today. A dreamy Venus-Neptune trine lures you away from your mundane responsibilities and into the misty realms of fantasy. Thankfully, slipping off into your imagination fuels your real-world activities with a burst of creative energy. Fulfilling your earthly obligations is a piece of cake now if you balance them with your mental meanderings."
sagittarius,2016-06-27,"Your metaphysical interests take you on a trip down a rabbit hole, even if others are depending on you in more practical ways. Nevertheless, you are driven to explore your visions rather than crossing things off your list of unfinished chores. Luckily, your spiritual pursuits won't prevent you from delivering on your promises now. In fact, you are an inspiration to everyone when you stay in touch with your inner world. Acting with integrity and humility is a sign of a true leader."
capricorn,2016-06-27,"It's wonderful if a special person in your life is extra affectionate toward you today. Even if you are facing relationship challenges, you have a rare opportunity to set a conflict aside in order to heal a rift. Although your intentions are loving, you could overreact so dramatically that your intensity is too much for others to handle. Nevertheless, the potential for emotional connection is strong if you can rein in your excitement. Enjoy the magic but just remember that making permanent decisions on temporary feelings is unwise."
aquarius,2016-06-27,"Your willingness to express your desires is the secret to a memorable day. But you must remember to temper your tone to match the situation or you could inadvertently offend others. In fact, a gentle approach now can overcome the resistance you might encounter at another time. However, over-intellectualizing your feelings takes the magic out of a special moment. You don't have to share everything that's in your heart; at some point in a conversation, your silence may say more than words."
pisces,2016-06-27,"You can experience a deeper level of beauty everywhere you look today, even if there's nothing new in your world. Somehow, the same old things are infused with a special glow that inspires you to be a better person. However, it's not that anything in your environment has changed; it's you that is different now. It might come as a surprise when you realize the love that's all around you is emanating from your heart. Life is a reflection of what you allow yourself to see."
aries,2016-06-28,"You're not afraid to let others know exactly what you think today. However, you could come on so strong that you don't even allow someone else to speak. But the energy imbalance won't last long if the other person's annoyance turns to anger. You might find yourself engaged in a battle that has less to do with what you said than how you delivered the message. Fortunately, you can sidestep conflict now by giving others the same common courtesy you would expect from them."
taurus,2016-06-28,"What begins as a casual conversation can quickly turn into a heated debate today. Although you know exactly what needs to be said to make your point, you might become so upset that nothing comes out of your mouth at all. Ironically, this argument could be won by what you don't say. The only sensible response may be to declare the conversation over and let it go. Rather than agreeing to disagree, sometimes it's better to just smile and be quiet."
gemini,2016-06-28,"A difference in fundamental values could create an awkward rift between you and others at work today. Unfortunately, it's difficult to tell in advance whether honest communication will bridge the gulf or only make matters worse. One thing is for certain: impulsive responses based upon emotions rather than facts will not lead anywhere productive. Instead of trying so hard to make your point, put your effort toward attempting to understand why someone could reach a different conclusion. In the words of Gandhi, ""Honest disagreement is often a good sign of progress."""
cancer,2016-06-28,"Although confrontation is rarely your cup of tea, your immediate reaction is to stand up for the underdog if someone tries to railroad their opinion over everyone else's today. Throwing caution to the wind is admirable if your cause is worthwhile. Nevertheless, you will be more effective if you reflect on what you want to say before your emotions hijack your logic. A few seconds of patience during a moment of anger can save you from unnecessary regret."
leo,2016-06-28,"You can be so confident your plan is the best one that you don't even listen to what anyone else has to offer today. Unfortunately, this level of certainty will only stir up bad feelings in your coworkers. It's not prudent to provoke dissension within the ranks of your associates now. Acknowledging the wide variety of solutions to a problem creates an environment that fosters teamwork. The synergy of many minds cooperating harmoniously is more effective than individuals working in isolation."
virgo,2016-06-28,"You may feel conflicted about working closely with someone who constantly pushes your emotional buttons today. On one hand, you recognize that you actually accomplish more when experiencing this high level of intensity. But on the other hand, you grow anxious when you're pulled outside of your normal comfort zone. Don't be complacent and settle for mediocrity when you have the opportunity to conquer your fears. The person who is a thorn in your side now can be your greatest teacher."
libra,2016-06-28,"An interaction with a close friend or coworker might grow too emotional for your liking today. However tempting, retreating into your shell does not work to your advantage because others could take your silence as a vote of confidence. Running away from confrontation only increases the distance from the solution. If you're not happy with someone else's behavior now, do the responsible thing and let them know."
scorpio,2016-06-28,"You are at the end of your rope and could feel as if you have nowhere to go. You might even consider putting a risky plan into motion if you feel there is nothing to lose. Nevertheless, exercising caution is advised because your current sense of desperation will soon fade into the past. President John Quincy Adams wrote, ""Patience and perseverance have a magical effect before which difficulties disappear and obstacles vanish."""
sagittarius,2016-06-28,"You want to express whatever is in your heart today without worrying about the reactions of anyone else. In theory, you should be able to preserve your childlike innocence and do as you please. However, in practice life just doesn't work that way. You are likely to experience remorse if your actions inadvertently hurt someone's feelings. It seems as if you are caught between the proverbial rock and a hard place. Instead of behaving like no one else matters, talk with those people who matter the most before doing something you can't undo."
capricorn,2016-06-28,"You prefer to keep your emotions under wraps but circumstances continue to poke and prod your most vulnerable spots. Your nerves may be on edge today because you feel like you could lose your temper if pushed too hard. Ironically, the more you try to maintain control, the closer you get to an emotional meltdown. Thankfully, you can easily prevent an unpleasant scene by taking proactive measures early in the day. Sharing your concerns with someone you trust acts as a safety valve and reduces the pressure. Good friends make hard times easier."
aquarius,2016-06-28,"You need to get something off your chest today and are ready to speak your truth even if others don't want to hear it. Although you might be itching for some verbal fireworks, it's not necessarily in your best interest to disregard everyone else's feelings just so you can express your own. Exercising discretion is part of a winning strategy if you're willing to take the high road and keep your mouth shut. Reevaluating your motives before you say a word turns out to be the smartest move now for everyone involved."
pisces,2016-06-28,"In the heat of the moment, it's impossible to remain objective when discussing your feelings. If anyone challenges your beliefs today, you're likely to take it so personally that you feel as if you're under attack. Unfortunately, your insecurities could get in the way of a constructive conversation. Your current discomfort is a chance for you to grow emotionally and recognize that intelligent people can hold different positions and remain friends. In a mature relationship, disagreement is possible without disrespect."
aries,2016-06-29,"Lately it's been easier to dance around the idea of intensifying a relationship than to actually do anything about it. However, your key planet Mars turns direct in your 8th House of Intimacy, motivating you to deepen a partnership now. Instead of distracting yourself with someone or something new, work through this metamorphosis, even if you don't know where the transformation will lead. Impatience can be your downfall, but it's wise to exhaust all your options before admitting defeat. Your tenacity will overcome all obstacles if your connection is meant to last."
taurus,2016-06-29,"You might be quite contemplative today as you try to gain perspective on a key relationship. If retrograde Mars has stymied positive developments over the past couple of months, his direct turn in your 7th House of Companions indicates that forward movement is imminent. Unfortunately, it's challenging to keep your annoyance from growing into anger when progress doesn't occur according to your plan. Thankfully, reaching out to those you love plants seeds of hope for the future."
gemini,2016-06-29,"Sometimes you quickly lose interest and place your attention elsewhere when you don't see immediate results from your efforts. Your recent laissez-faire attitude at work might have contributed to a lack of observable progress. However, action-planet Mars turns direct in your 6th House of Daily Routine today, motivating you to overcome sluggishness on the job. You have fiddled with your plans long enough; it's time to swing into action and hope for the best."
cancer,2016-06-29,"You are intent on revitalizing an existing relationship or finding new outlets for your emotional expression now. You're looking forward to experiencing more joy in your life and want to replace delays with successes. Thankfully, you can summon your natural patience as superhero Mars turns direct in your 5th House of Love and Creativity. You have pulled the bowstring back as far as possible; steady your aim and release your arrow of pent-up intention. Choose your target wisely and never stop believing in yourself."
leo,2016-06-29,"Your spirit of risk-taking is encouraged today as impulsive Mars turns direct in your 4th House of Roots. The gears of change begin to engage at a very fundamental level, prompting you to get new projects up and running. Although you might prefer more immediate gratification from your bold initiative, you can draw from a very deep well of determination as you strive to advance in your chosen career. Doors will open if you're bold enough to knock."
virgo,2016-06-29,"You have grown weary of paddling as hard as you can, only to find you're still drifting in the same circles. However, plans that were postponed start to take shape once superhero Mars turns direct in your 3rd House of Immediate Environment. Although there are powerful forces to overcome, it's time to restate your goals and put a solid plan into play. It may take a couple of weeks yet to see real progress, but it's today's actions that will determine tomorrow's success."
libra,2016-06-29,Adapting your vision for the future to the three-dimensional world is top priority now. You have an opportunity to connect the ideal and the real when physical Mars turns direct in your 2nd House of Resources. The action planet's forward shift in powerful Scorpio energizes you with the motivation and materials required to fuel your ambitions. Investing in your education will enhance your competence and increase your ability to make a positive difference in people's lives.
scorpio,2016-06-29,"Your waiting period is finally over and perhaps you already see the signs of a cosmic green light up ahead. Recent frustrations will begin to fade in the rear-view mirror as your ruling planet Mars turns direct in your 1st House of Self, starting a work party that lasts until it leaves your sign on August 2. But there's no time to waste; the winds of change are blowing in your direction. Nevertheless, make the most of this propitious moment by pursuing your passion with all of your might."
sagittarius,2016-06-29,"Releasing the past automatically frees up your creative resources. Your recent progress may fall short of your expectations, but development has been occurring behind the scenes. Dynamic Mars turns direct in your 12th House of Destiny to mark the beginning of a new wave of forward momentum. Ironically, you are also at the end of a larger cycle of self-expression between now and August, when Mars enters your sign. In the meantime, continue to chase your dreams with the confidence that today's persistence will bring the results you seek."
capricorn,2016-06-29,"Your hard work is likely to pay off as long as you involve others in your endeavors. Thankfully, persuasive Mars turns direct in your 11th House of Social Networking, inspiring you to deliver a convincing argument as you gather support for your cause. Although working within a group may be most effective, be prepared to push on alone if necessary. Don't judge anyone too swiftly; leave the invitation open-ended for someone to join you on your adventures later on."
aquarius,2016-06-29,"It's time to channel your frustration into intention if your success at work has been thwarted recently. Energetic Mars turns direct in your 10th House of Career, making it easier to get new projects off the ground. The rising force of Mars feeds your enthusiasm; take the bull by the horns and make significant changes in order to modify the direction of your professional life."
pisces,2016-06-29,"Although you may have experienced more than your fair share of setbacks in recent months, the tide is about to turn and worldly success will be within your grasp. Fortunately, Mars turns direct in your 9th House of Big Ideas, placing unfulfilled dreams back on the front burner. Keep the faith, even if you feel a bit discouraged by the snail's pace at which things are moving. Don't let your impressive amount of hard work go to waste just because you're impatient for results now. Regardless of the temptation, shortcuts won't save you time. Slow and steady wins the race."
aries,2016-06-30,"Returning to the basics is a significant theme today, yet the art of simplification can be quite complex. You may be motivated by dreams of success only to find yourself engaged in a very real power struggle at work. You might need to argue your case if you believe your future is worth fighting for now. But don't be scared away by the possibility of hurting someone you love. Acting with integrity and kindness allows you to be honest in a way that helps rather than harms."
taurus,2016-06-30,"Sometimes you must hold your ground, yet other times it makes more sense to yield. It's tempting to avoid conflict today by acquiescing to someone else. Unfortunately, a strategy of propitiation is like putting a bandage over a deep wound. Thankfully, calmly addressing your powerful feelings makes it possible to regain the trust and joy that you once thought were gone for good. Believe it or not, vulnerability is your friend."
gemini,2016-06-30,"Slipping into denial might sound like a viable option, but suppressing emotional tension creates ripples that eventually overwhelm you. Living in the moment is a sound strategy, unless you also insist on exerting control over others for no reason now other than ego gratification. Practicing non-attachment empowers you to smoothly glide through the day, learning and sharing as you go without causing any drama. Sometimes you just need to relax and have faith that everything will be alright."
cancer,2016-06-30,"Finding satisfaction can be an uphill battle when you're dealing with an unhappy partner or when you recognize the pain of your unfulfilled needs. Relationship issues confront you with your own drive to be in control now as nurturing Venus opposes domineering Pluto in your 7th House of Partnerships. It's all too easy to play the blame game, but there are no winners if anyone ends up feeling like a loser. Be truthful about your desires; expressing them in a loving manner turns a potential breakdown into a powerful breakthrough."
leo,2016-06-30,"There is no time to lose now when encountering unpleasant power politics at work. You may feel discouraged once you realize how little leverage you actually have in the situation today. Nevertheless, an emotional eruption won't bring anyone closer to satisfaction. Thankfully, you can make a plan and execute it effectively if you pull back from your creative pursuits now and take on more responsibility on the job. A true professional keeps her priorities in order."
virgo,2016-06-30,"It really doesn't take much to arouse your feelings today. You may experience alternating waves of emotional highs and lows that stimulate buried feelings of resentment or regret as an intense opposition between magnetic Venus and manipulative Pluto rocks your 5th House of Romance. Nevertheless, getting to the core of your desires can revitalize your heart. Initiating profound changes in how you pursue relationships ultimately attracts the love you desire."
libra,2016-06-30,"You prefer change when it's slow and steady now, motivating you to choose a more conservative route while exploring your feelings. Nevertheless, maintaining a casual attitude about your desires is nearly impossible while sexy Venus opposes fierce Pluto. You might even run into resistance at work where others underestimate your commitment. Nevertheless, you're determined to overcome all obstacles in your current struggle to balance your emotions with your career objectives. Love doesn't pay the bills, but it's a poor life without it."
scorpio,2016-06-30,"Unresolved relationship turmoil bubbles to the surface today, stimulating questions about your future. You might think it's best to ignore your gut reaction so you can avoid upsetting yourself or someone else. However, the hidden cost of burying your feelings now will only become more apparent over time. Dealing with your emotions as they arise could reveal practical resolutions to your problems. Fortunately, you have more support than you realize, making the present moment the best time to face the music and change your tune."
sagittarius,2016-06-30,"Although you may be lucky enough to be secure in your job, unspoken feelings can negatively impact a professional relationship. Control issues about money might even impede your progress on a current project at work. Thankfully, the outcome will probably open the door to new opportunities if you share your concerns now. But being honest about your assessment of the current situation could go against the grain of your peers. Nevertheless, your full disclosure will clear the air and allow you to get back to work with a guilt-free conscience."
capricorn,2016-06-30,"Both of your feet are firmly planted on the ground today, and a minor crisis will not likely upset your balance. However, you still might struggle to compromise in a relationship because people tend to arouse your extreme attraction or total repulsion now. Although it's tricky to find the right connection, you must rise above your emotions of the moment and think about long-term consequences. Revealing your personal likes or dislikes is healthy as long as you listen to the needs of others as well."
aquarius,2016-06-30,"You might feel as if you're in the midst of a tug-of-war with your desire for security pulling one way and your obsession with personal transformation pulling the other. Pluto's power can be emotionally overwhelming while its opposition to vulnerable Venus in your 6th House of Habits motivates you to revert to familiar routines that increase your comfort. Nevertheless, change is inevitable and the sooner you relinquish your hold on the past, the smoother your transition will be into the future. Take the road less traveled and carry no regret."
pisces,2016-06-30,"Emotional satisfaction may seem out of reach as control issues with those near and dear shake your faith in relationships. Maintaining a healthy perspective is challenging while sensual Venus in your 5th House of Love and Romance opposes insatiable Pluto. Fortunately, defining your desires more clearly is a necessary step toward getting what you want, both personally and professionally. While declaring what you expect from someone doesn't guarantee that you'll receive it, it certainly improves your chances. The squeaky wheel gets the grease."
aries,2016-07-01,"No one could blame you for focusing only on the positive when blinders are already preventing you from seeing the truth. Paradoxically, you have an innocent air of invincibility about you today that makes others trust your judgment. You can get away with pursuing your ambitious goals now because your drive is softened by gentle Venus as she assists enthusiastic Jupiter in your 6th House of Employment. Fortunately, the support of your coworkers enables you to accomplish more than you would alone, as long as you don't scatter your energy by trying to do everything at once."
taurus,2016-07-01,"Your imagination is inspired these days when your heart is stirred by optimistic daydreams of love and pleasure. Beautiful Venus supports beneficial Jupiter in your 5th House of Romance, allowing satisfaction to come easily if only you stop struggling now. The key to your happiness is to graciously receive what is offered. You don't need to keep score when you're with someone you trust. Drop your defenses and there's no limit to the joy you can experience."
gemini,2016-07-01,"Emotional satisfaction might be much closer than you realize now so don't even think about giving up. Although you are reassessing your priorities, it's more important than ever to remain singularly focused on your career objectives. Persistence is the secret to your success. Don't pretend to be shocked if you receive that long-overdue raise or promotion. Nevertheless, you still could be surprised because rewards don't necessarily arrive in the form you expect. Keeping an open mind allows you to be happy, no matter what."
cancer,2016-07-01,Discretion is critical today as you handle the awkward cleanup from a recent disclosure. Spilling too many secrets in a giddy moment of optimism could actually cause damage to a relationship. Strong emotional bonds and a sense of compassion help you let go of conflicts and enjoy pleasurable experiences. But don't agree with others just because it's the easier thing to do; you'll earn more respect by establishing clear boundaries now than compromising to maintain the peace.
leo,2016-07-01,"Hard work produces tangible results today, thanks to the activity of propitious Jupiter in your 2nd House of Finances. A sobering Venus-Saturn connection may cool your desires, but it also grants you the patience you need to wait for gratification. Although you might confuse your fantasies with reality, the blessings of the enriching Venus-Jupiter sextile indicate that Lady Luck is on your side. The only failure now comes from quitting too soon."
virgo,2016-07-01,"Sometimes the grass really is greener on the other side of the hill. Luckily, reaching for new experiences now actually pays off as long as you don't raise the bar too high. If you seek the impossible, your hope can dissolve into despair. Think twice before taking on another project because even a simple one can end up testing your patience. But if your goal is based on sound logic, you will be more than pleased with the results."
libra,2016-07-01,"Your charm is your not-so-secret weapon as auspicious Jupiter flatters attractive Venus in your 10th House of Public Life today. You can be especially persuasive if you employ a gentle touch in your approach. Don't worry if you need to lower your expectations in one situation, because bigger emotional or material rewards will likely appear somewhere else. Expect the best, plan for the worst, and prepare to be surprised."
scorpio,2016-07-01,"You may find resolution today to a recent struggle between you and someone who seems to oppose your every move. Although it might be difficult to get your way at first, uncovering hidden resources coaxes your adversary to step out of your way, enabling you to take definitive action. But problems happen even when everything is looking bright. Adopting a healthy sense of perspective allows you to handle nearly any situation that pops up with grace and humor."
sagittarius,2016-07-01,"Your dedication and sweat equity don't seem to offer the immediate return you expect for the amount of effort you invest. Fortunately, your persistence has the magical power to turn lemons into lemonade while sweet Venus cooperates with lucky Jupiter in your 10th House of Worldly Success. Happily, you could see a lovely outcome if you just slow down and focus on what needs to be done next. It helps to accept the fact that you can't control everything; nevertheless, you will be compensated one way or another as long as you demonstrate your willingness to be patient."
capricorn,2016-07-01,"The lingering effects of yesterday's stress might still be stirring up anger or mistrust. However, it becomes easier to release any negativity as the love planet Venus forms a cooperative sextile with generous Jupiter in your 9th House of Future Vision today. Although you prefer to focus on the big picture now, managing the littlest details of your life is a necessary step toward reaching your goals. Sometimes the most trivial matters are actually the most important."
aquarius,2016-07-01,"Declaring your needs may seem selfish but you're determined to get what you want today. However, pushing too far could put everyone on edge. Thankfully, a friendly sextile between sociable Venus and broad-minded Jupiter keeps the windows of hope and the doors of opportunity open wide. Additionally, a dash of good humor at the right moment could transform a volatile situation into one that ultimately generates satisfaction."
pisces,2016-07-01,"Staying cool under pressure today earns you positive recognition within a partnership. In fact, others offer a safe haven for joyful experiences now that delicious Venus sextiles buoyant Jupiter in your 7th House of Relationships. Fortunately, you know how to bring out the best in people. Your entire life is enhanced by your optimism, expanding your capacity to appreciate your current blessings and attract even more."
aries,2016-07-02,"Keeping your focus can be rather tricky today as you jump from one project to the next. You might believe you're in complete control of every detail and look forward to surprising everyone with your amazing multitasking skills. However, everything you try to do is complicated if you can't find your groove. Instead of negatively judging yourself for your inconsistencies now, just vow to do your best each moment without concentrating on your shortcomings. Positive thinking leads to positive outcomes."
taurus,2016-07-02,"You might wish you could spend the entire day puttering around the house without being distracted by anyone else. Unfortunately, you can't easily escape from the well-meaning interruptions by people who want to include you in their fun. Thankfully, you don't need to make an all-or-nothing decision about your current plans. It might seem awkward at first, but you can participate in social activities and still leave enough time to pursue your personal interests."
gemini,2016-07-02,"You are exhibiting your infamous split personality today as forks in the road appear and you want to take both options. Your indecision is obvious now that the Moon is back in your changeable sign. However, people may be harsh critics if you continue to flip-flop when explaining your intentions. Nevertheless, keeping your options alive as long as possible is a useful strategy for you Gemini Twins who like to live in duality. Worry less about what others think of you than about making the most of every single choice."
cancer,2016-07-02,"Your feelings are flying through your mind at the speed of light today, making it nearly impossible to grab on to any one of them. Verbal communication is unsatisfying because your words cannot capture the subtleties of your emotions. Nevertheless, you must overcome a defeatist attitude and do your best to convey your thoughts to your audience now. Maintaining healthy relationships starts with recognizing the importance of clear communication."
leo,2016-07-02,"Although you may need to deal with complicated logistics today, you're itching to relax in the company of your friends. The loquacious Gemini Moon is visiting your 11th House of Social Networking now, yet you're having trouble shaking your conflicting wish for peace and quiet. Unfortunately, you'll be bored before you know it if you stay home alone. It seems as if you can't win until you realize that the only real difference between a good and bad day is your attitude."
virgo,2016-07-02,"You would like to be seen as a compassionate leader, at home or in your community. However, your thoughts are jumping from one innovative idea to another today, inspiring you to talk quickly before you forget what you were going to say. Unfortunately, your need to verbalize everything now makes it difficult for others to connect with your softer side. Thankfully, you can take control of the situation by choosing to share less and care more. In the long run, nothing will be lost if love leads the way."
libra,2016-07-02,"You might be living in the present moment, but your thoughts are carrying you off into the future. Fortunately, your fantasies are quite entertaining now and bring a smile to your face whether or not you share them with anyone else. There's no reason to waste energy trying to avoid current responsibilities, since you can fulfill them while still exploring your imagination. Dancing in two worlds enables you to cultivate your dreams no matter where you roam."
scorpio,2016-07-02,You long for that rare conversation with a special person that elevates your spirit while touching your soul. You're not interested in chatting about the news or the weather; you want to get directly to the core of the matter. You might feel as if time is running out and you're fearful of missing the opportunity to make a real connection. Your willingness to bring your heart into the equation can change the lives of those involved.
sagittarius,2016-07-02,"Although you're certain about your destination today, everyone else seems to be buzzing around in circles without a purpose. However, you might be more easily pulled off course now that the interactive Gemini Moon is cavorting through your 7th House of Others. There is no need to push anyone away in order to eliminate the excess noise from your life now. Instead of wasting time getting rid of the distractions, focus more intently on your goal. When you concentrate on manifesting your dreams, everything else will fall into place."
capricorn,2016-07-02,"Deeply ingrained moral issues can be irritating if they create inner conflict today. You're not as forthcoming with your feelings as it seems because you don't want others to get involved in your process of contemplation. You may project your more talkative side, but it's probably just a way to cover concerns you don't care to discuss. Your smartest strategy now is to just go about your day as normal until your mental unrest settles on its own. Be patient; the calm after the storm is on the way if you don't rock the boat in the meantime."
aquarius,2016-07-02,"The fireworks in your brain are putting on quite a show with ingenious thoughts lighting your inner sky. However, your attempts to record the magic are futile and could even ruin the brilliant performance. Granted, sometimes it's tough to stay present when you fear the moment will quickly pass. Instead of trying to savor your current experience, immerse yourself in it. Every breath you take is a precious gift as long as you're willing to give it back without trying to possess it."
pisces,2016-07-02,"People seem to show up at your door today simply to bring you good news or to demonstrate their appreciation for what you do. However, you can't capitalize on their support if other circumstances are blocking your progress. Don't allow frustration to hijack your positive mood, or you'll end up souring your entire day. You might not be able to directly alter your fate now, but changing your attitude changes everything."
aries,2016-07-03,"Relying on your physical senses is not an effective way of navigating through an obstacle course today. You might do better by closing your eyes and letting the Force be with you. Nevertheless, you probably won't relinquish your old ways until you make a significant judgment error that complicates your life. The more you try to talk your way out of the mess you created, the worse it gets. Thankfully, things start looking up once you stop resisting change and commit to going with the flow."
taurus,2016-07-03,"You may hold your friends in such high regard now that they can't help but let you down. It's not that anyone does anything that's so bad; it's just that your optimism is so high today that no one could possibly fulfill your dreams. Nevertheless, your standards of excellence inspire people to strive for better results. Your job is to find the sweet spot that entices others to reach farther, but not so far that they end up discouraged. As Tony Robbins says, ""Trade your expectation for appreciation and the world changes instantly."""
gemini,2016-07-03,"It's one thing to imagine a future filled with abundance, but your dreams of personal wealth can seem so real now that you may make an important decision based upon sheer fantasy. However, the true purpose of your vision is not to leave you lost chasing your illusions, but to motivate you to greater heights. Entertaining possibilities is wiser than accepting limitations, but knowing the difference between fact and fancy is critical to your success."
cancer,2016-07-03,"You are more transparent today than you think. In fact, you might want to run and hide when you realize that you're wearing your dreams on your sleeve for all to see. However, there's really no sound reason to be overly protective of your plans now. Thankfully, people close to you are more likely to support your current decisions when they understand the underlying motivation behind your actions. Ultimately, the real risk is in doing nothing at all."
leo,2016-07-03,"It's not like you to conceal so much of your fantasy world, but you're not interested in letting others see your most private thoughts now. You are certainly enjoying the fruits of your imagination and might be fearful that your vision will disappear in a puff of smoke if you talk about it. Some things are better left unspoken. Don't succumb to anyone's pressure to share those dreams that are yours alone. Thankfully, if you build it, they will come -- whether or not you tell anyone about it."
virgo,2016-07-03,"It doesn't matter much what other people say now, since you only hear what's already in your head. The line between illusion and delusion is elusive, especially if you don't go the extra mile to discern the truth. Although you can be easily misled by your own assumptions today, you can untangle your dreams from reality if you're willing to devote some energy to it. Don't be afraid to ask questions; however, taking the time to listen improves the quality of your relationships more than anything else."
libra,2016-07-03,"You can let down your guard today and just be who you are. There's really nothing to gain by obscuring your truth, even if you don't think you can verbally communicate your deepest beliefs. Nevertheless, reconsidering your overall life trajectory is a healthy exercise now if you temporarily allow your imagination to run supreme. You don't have to pursue every goal that appears in your mind's eye, nor do you need to speak about those things which should remain private. All things are possible if you believe in yourself."
scorpio,2016-07-03,"Your dreams hold the key to your future if you're willing to share them with a select few. However, it's still scary to reveal your most personal truths when you don't know how they will be received. Although opening your heart can temporarily intensify your discomfort, it's also the key to developing deeper intimacy in your relationships. Don't settle for less when you're so close to obtaining more."
sagittarius,2016-07-03,"You are more likely to see the bright side of life today, especially when examining family dynamics. You might easily miss the most important issues if you already assume they don't exist. But living in a bubble of dreamy perfection will only last until it's popped by the sharp edges of the truth. Rather than waiting for a rude awakening, consciously dismantle your fantasies as you explore them. You can still experience the magic of your inner world without confusing it with reality."
capricorn,2016-07-03,"Although a close friend or relative might go out of the way to show how much they care for you, their good intentions could backfire today. At first, you luxuriate in the protective energy but it grows overly restrictive as the day unfolds. However, it's hard to admit that you like the fact that someone is watching out for you. You may need to establish new boundaries that give you more latitude to move now, but don't overreact or you might end up throwing the baby out with the bathwater."
aquarius,2016-07-03,"You don't want to follow a schedule today because you prefer to rely on your intuition when it comes to deciding what to do. Unfortunately, there is a price to pay for this level of spontaneity and self-determination. You may end up spending more time alone than you originally imagined to counteract the structure others try to put into the day. People won't necessarily wait for you to make up your mind. Living in your dream world works amazingly well until reality interferes with it."
pisces,2016-07-03,"You are in your own element today as you happily swim through the magical waters of your vivid imagination. But be careful what you fancy because your powers of manifestation are exceptionally strong now. Anything you visualize, however extraordinary it might be, has the potential to leak through the veil that separates this world from others and become real. In the words of the late great Wayne Dyer, ""Believing is seeing."" Discernment is your friend."
aries,2016-07-04,"Being in close contact with your family and friends ranks as a top priority today. Although the heat of summer lures you out into the sunshine, the Cancer New Moon draws you into your inner world as it waters your 4th House of Roots. Renew links to your past and rejuvenate relationships with your kin to reaffirm your connection with your soul. Never forget, the love of your tribe is one of life's greatest blessings."
taurus,2016-07-04,"You may feel isolated even in the midst of your loved ones if they disagree with your thinking on a sensitive subject. Your fear of being vulnerable is triggered by the timidity of the thin-skinned Cancer New Moon that accentuates your 3rd House of Communication. Meanwhile, pensive Mercury bumps into naysaying Saturn, reminding you that putting your feelings out in the open isn't always the best idea. The quieter you are, the more you can hear."
gemini,2016-07-04,"You might be so concerned about your finances that you seek ways to limit your expenditures now. You're even more eager for change in money matters when the security-conscious Cancer New Moon lands in your 2nd House of Personal Resources. Unforgiving Pluto's opposition to this lunation could mean that you're hitting a financial wall, so don't be afraid to put all your marbles on the table. You may need to reorganize debt or renegotiate a partnership before you can cash in on this potentially lucrative transit. Anything is possible when you take ownership of your life."
cancer,2016-07-04,"Complex emotions and shifting circumstances require you to take a stand as you try to restore order in your personal life. Your dreams may seem endearing to others today, prompting you to say what you want, even if it's more than you previously intended to share. Thankfully, the cautious Cancer New Moon falls in your 1st House of Personality, encouraging you to withdraw into the security of your emotional shell. Use this time for constructive self-reflection instead of worrying about what others think."
leo,2016-07-04,"An emotional interaction grows stressful if someone criticizes your disclosure without really listening to the meaning behind the words. In your current vulnerable state, you don't necessarily want to share more details about your inner process. Fortunately, you can make excellent use of the hypersensitive Cancer New Moon in your 12th House of Endings by letting go of your past. Even if you don't feel the support from others now, stand by your decisions, knowing that transformation will soon follow."
virgo,2016-07-04,"Your friends are intrigued by the mysterious quality of your plans because they can't tell whether or not you are actually being serious. Although the Cancer New Moon harmonizes with nebulous Neptune, it's imperative to let others know where they stand by stating your intentions as clearly as possible. This lunation plants a seed of intention in your 11th House of Dreams, but it's up to you to nurture the seedling to fruition over the weeks ahead."
libra,2016-07-04,"You can't decide whether to fully immerse yourself in the social activities of the day or to run from them. Naturally, being around friends and family can be revitalizing to your spirit, but conflict in communication makes the interpersonal dynamics tense. Fortunately, the caring Cancer New Moon falls in your 10th House of Public Life, allowing you to mend hurt feelings and set positive intentions for the future. Love conquers all."
scorpio,2016-07-04,"Sometimes it's wiser to carefully step around a patch of stinging nettles instead of plowing directly through them. The needy Cancer New Moon emphasizes your 9th House of Big Ideas, but its opposition to powerful Pluto is a reminder to rein in your emotions while you still can. Applying self-discipline gets you further now than allowing irrational feelings to dictate your behavior. A moment of consciousness saves days of regret."
sagittarius,2016-07-04,"You are at your best when you're able to communicate exactly how you feel. However, it's more problematic when your emotions are buried so deeply that they can't make it to the surface. Fortunately, the protective Cancer New Moon directs your attention to your 8th House of Shared Experiences, which makes listening just as important as speaking today. But this is a time to heal wounds and talking about your relationship issues only takes you so far. Thankfully, you also can benefit from giving and receiving the kind of love that needs no words."
capricorn,2016-07-04,"Your ambitions might conflict with the aspirations of someone close to you and the resistance you face could impede your progress today. You may choose to withhold your feelings while the cautious Cancer New Moon highlights your 7th House of Others. However, disclosing your thoughts won't complicate your road to success as much as keeping them to yourself. Ultimately, it's the things left unsaid now that create heartaches later on."
aquarius,2016-07-04,"Your plans for the future may seem a bit removed from reality today, but integrating your dreams into every little action sets the stage for your success. Ultimately, you may fail unless your objectives are aligned with your highest ideals as the meticulous Cancer New Moon in your 6th House of Self-Improvement aligns with spiritual Neptune. Many trivial issues demand your attention now, but it's crucial to leave time for reassessing your long-term goals. As author Washington Irving wrote, ""Great minds have purpose, others have wishes."""
pisces,2016-07-04,"Your big heart and tender spirit shine brightly now, eliciting warm encouragement from everyone you meet. Activities involving children should go well since you know how to act like a kid, provided it's within safe and reasonable limits. Happily, the emotional Cancer New Moon stirs your 5th House of Love and Play, making this a great opportunity to express your creativity and get noticed without looking needy. But in your haste for personal satisfaction, don't avoid the challenges of the day; your commitment to overcoming obstacles inspires others at the same time."
aries,2016-07-05,"Put those technical manuals and financial spreadsheets away for another day since you aren't likely to make much progress on them today. You are better suited now to write poetry, explore your fantasies or chant spiritual mantras while cerebral Mercury is harmonizing with ethereal Neptune. The more you try to fit your thoughts into rational containers, the less sense they will make. Listen to the cosmic music of the spheres and be the dreamer of dreams."
taurus,2016-07-05,"You may grow irritated at your inability to communicate your feelings today, especially if there are practical issues that need to be discussed. Nevertheless, it's prudent to postpone conversations about mundane subjects such as schedules and logistics. Don't waste energy attempting to discipline your mind when it wants to trip the light fantastic. Make the time and space to share your dreams with your friends, instead. You will return from your little mental excursions refreshed and ready for another round of reality."
gemini,2016-07-05,"It never hurts to reevaluate the things in your life you value the most while clever Mercury occupies your 2nd House of Core Beliefs. Although you want to express these fundamental concerns through a professional outlet, it's challenging to put your ideas into a sustainable plan today. Don't get caught up in trying to squeeze your life's purpose into a step-by-step recipe. Instead, nurture your visions by immersing yourself in them. Chase dreams, not people."
cancer,2016-07-05,"Your thoughts are colored by your emotions and you find it nearly impossible to maintain objectivity today. Your fantasies superimpose your notion of beauty on to the world around you, enabling you to imagine amazing potential ahead. Your idealism serves you well if it motivates you to make your wishes come true. However, living in a bubble of illusions can isolate you from the real world. Ultimately, success belongs to those who see their dreams as a blueprint for their future."
leo,2016-07-05,"You can retreat into your fantasies today so gracefully that no one realizes you disappeared. However, your imagination reigns supreme as otherworldly Neptune harmonizes with mischievous Mercury in your 12th House of Spiritual Mysteries. Falling down the rabbit hole could be quite entertaining, but might create problems unless you swiftly respond to real-world communications, too. Your greatest success comes from dreaming with your head in the clouds while still walking on earth."
virgo,2016-07-05,"You want nothing more than to be in the company of your friends today because they will listen to your dreams without judgment. You prefer to bask in the light of sharing ideas in an emotionally safe environment without having to justify every word you say. Today's Mercury-Neptune trine stimulates your creativity, but doesn't guarantee practicality. Nevertheless, if you maintain a healthy perspective on the real world you can experience your fair share of magic in the realm of imagination."
libra,2016-07-05,"You are quite tenacious when it comes to executing a plan at work today. However, you may drift aimlessly if you can't break your project down into bite-sized pieces. Paradoxically, your loss of direction might not have any negative long-term consequences now. Exploring the edges of your imagination seems unproductive, but somehow you return to the real world exactly in the place you need to be. As Martin Luther King Jr. wrote, ""Faith is taking the first step even when you don't see the whole staircase."""
scorpio,2016-07-05,"It's as if a fog has settled over your world, making it difficult to discern the horizon, no matter which way you turn. It's hard to know where you are going if you can't see a landmark to set your bearings. Although today's fuzzy Mercury-Neptune connection makes navigation with a map challenging, it's still a magical time to travel as long as you don't mind being lost. What you lose in logical analysis now you regain in following your intuition. Don't worry about reaching your destination; nature is always on time."
sagittarius,2016-07-05,"You are at ease with your emotions today, even if you're traversing unfamiliar waters. You might even feel nurtured by the gentle waves as they wash over you. However, everything could change in an instant if you allow fear to stir up a storm. Your attempts to regain control by using logic now meet defeat, leaving you temporarily exhausted. Forget about thinking your way back to safety; instead, step beyond the limits of your rational intellect and let your instincts be your guide."
capricorn,2016-07-05,"Disappointment could set in when you realize your assumptions about a friend or partner are not true. However, you have a rare opportunity to perceive things exactly as they are now, rather than as you wish them to be. Harboring fantasies empowers the mind to see possibilities that are not present in reality. Nevertheless, you can make a workable plan to manifest your dreams only after you know the truth. The philosopher George Santayana wrote, ""Wisdom comes by disillusionment."""
aquarius,2016-07-05,"Your notions of material wealth aren't likely based on reality today. Dreaming about getting rich is no substitute for a concrete plan. Caution is advised because you can mislead yourself while trickster Mercury conspires with delusional Neptune in your 2nd House of Finances. Nevertheless, consciously establishing a new work routine can improve your relationship to money and even attract prosperity. Success is not a skill, it's a habit."
pisces,2016-07-05,"Sometimes your best thoughts appear to have very little use; they are just fun to think and even more enjoyable to cultivate. Nevertheless, it's these same ideas that contribute to your reputation as a creative visionary. There are times when others depend on you to be practical; thankfully, this is not one of them. Fortunately, your rational mind is able to successfully team up with your intuition now to make an unbeatable combination that can inspire others. As J.R.R Tolkien wrote, ""A single dream is more powerful than one thousand realities."""
aries,2016-07-06,"Although you might be feeling tender today, you can work through your fear of rejection and put your heart on the line. Ironically, it's easier to express your emotions now than it is to keep them to yourself. Fortunately, an honest disclosure will be received with open arms as long as you don't pressure anyone to respond. Too many expectations lead to disappointment. Instead of focusing on a specific destination, just stay in the present moment. As Rumi wrote, ""Only from the heart can you touch the sky."""
taurus,2016-07-06,"You don't like it when your feelings complicate your life, but sometimes they just won't go away until you acknowledge them. You might be overly worried about people close to you, motivating you to protect them from any emotional hurt or ill will. Although your intentions may be honorable, you could inadvertently smother someone with your love and attention. Fortunately, practicing a little self-awareness now enables you to care for others without creating any additional drama."
gemini,2016-07-06,"Your message is right on target today and could elicit a much stronger response than you thought possible. Nevertheless, don't hold your tongue when expressing your point of view. Instead of strictly relying on the facts now, allow your subjectivity to shine through by sharing your personal likes and dislikes without justification. Rather than being vilified for any particular position, everyone seems to applaud your willingness to be honest, even in the face of possible rejection. Revealing your heart is an act of courage."
cancer,2016-07-06,"Welcome to the paradox of being you! On one hand, you crave support from those you admire, but on the other hand, you wish to remain invisible today. Feeling connected to your friends and family will only happen if they can see through your mask. Rather than waiting for someone to find the secret key to your inner sanctum, reach out to others and share your feelings now. There are times to stay hidden, but this is not one of them. Love is everywhere around you; all you need to do is ask."
leo,2016-07-06,"Your game is on point today and you can't help but make one smooth move after another. Others may not notice it at first, but you're purposely keeping a piece of yourself in reserve with no desire to reveal it to anyone now. In fact, your amazing performance might turn out to be a red herring that distracts everyone from the real you. Unfortunately, you become more transparent as your voice grows louder in protest. Relax and be yourself; it takes less effort and people will end up liking you even more."
virgo,2016-07-06,"You might want to shelter everyone you know under your protective wing today. Your heart is full of love and there's no end to the ways in which it can be expressed. However, you may be extra cautious now because you don't want to cross socially defined boundaries, especially if your behavior could make someone uncomfortable. Step back and take a few breaths to let the energy settle down. Dream without fear; love without limits."
libra,2016-07-06,"You may be scared to tell others about your ambitious agenda. You prefer to work toward your objectives alone than have your ideas shot down before they even get off the ground. Nevertheless, the potential for receiving positive feedback is greater today than you realize. In fact, the potential resistance you face now might actually be of your own making. Ultimately, there's only one way to discover what is real versus what is imagined; share your plans and see who is on your side."
scorpio,2016-07-06,"Finally, the ice has broken up, the water is flowing and you're experiencing smooth sailing once again. Rather than obsessing about what might happen if everything refreezes, concentrate on making as much progress as you can while the warmer conditions last. Whether you are pursuing the adventure of love or the satisfaction of career success, there's no time for self-doubt. The object of your dreams may be within reach, but you'll never know it if you give up too soon."
sagittarius,2016-07-06,"You secretly want to sneak into an ancient temple, partake in a sacred ritual and steal a glimpse of the hidden mysteries. But you might feel like touching the magic isn't enough to bring you emotional satisfaction now; you must tell someone about it. Unfortunately, your language skills seem to be lagging behind your ability to be in the right place at the right time. Communication is only a struggle when you force the conversation. Revel in this spiritual experience that is meant for you alone."
capricorn,2016-07-06,"Sometimes, your practicality is a real blessing; other times, your common sense just gets in the way of your happiness. Unfortunately, you could miss out on an amazing experience today if you think that all of the puzzle pieces need to be in place before you tell anyone about your secrets. Luckily, emotions flow easily between you and your friends if you simply lower your defenses and relinquish control. The beauty of heartfelt interaction is felt by all once the energy begins to flow naturally. Letting go is the best way to hold onto what matters most."
aquarius,2016-07-06,"Other people are operating with fixed agendas today while you're content buzzing around like a bee from one flower to another. Although you seem much more flexible on the surface than everyone else now, you're actually quite rigid in your determination to serve the common good. Your behavior in each moment is dictated by the nature of the circumstances; however, your overreaching philosophy doesn't change. Fortunately, your work -- however trivial in appearance -- will eventually be recognized as a positive contribution to your community."
pisces,2016-07-06,"You could project a current relationship into the future with such passion today that your fantasies can spin you around the world and even transport you through time. A Muse seems to accompany you everywhere you go now, encouraging you to artistically express something, anything, as long as you convey what's in your heart. Don't worry about how your work might be received. To paraphrase poet William Blake, your job is not to reason or compare; your job is to create."
aries,2016-07-07,"Choices to make between home and career can be quite perplexing now, but you become more decisive when push comes to shove. Nevertheless, it's all too easy to be so distracted by your immediate needs that you lose the game plan in the process. There's no reason to involve others in your melodrama; just do what you must to take care of your heart and move on. As Tori Amos said, ""Some of the most wonderful people are the ones who don't fit into boxes."""
taurus,2016-07-07,"You're not interested in speaking your mind now if you think it's going to stir up a hornet's nest. But you don't want to blindly follow the crowd just because it's the path of least resistance. Although you might try to keep your feelings to yourself and pursue your heart's desires anyway, postponing a confrontation will only intensify everyone's emotions in the long run. Don't put off until tomorrow what needs to be said today."
gemini,2016-07-07,"Although you prefer to dance your way around a sensitive subject, you can't sidestep a conversation that should have already occurred. It's one thing to compromise for the good of everyone involved, but sacrificing your values is never a smart move. Nevertheless, there's no reason to issue an ultimatum; find a way to create common ground where you can still adhere to your core beliefs while entertaining opposing viewpoints."
cancer,2016-07-07,"You might wish that people didn't love you so much today -- or that they would express their affection in a less passionate manner. But the tables may be turned if someone feels like your attention is excessive. No one wants to be smothered by another person's emotions, no matter how honorable the intentions. Find a happy medium where you can exert a positive influence on those closest to you without overwhelming them with your insecurities. Keep in mind that nurturing others is not an all-or-nothing proposition."
leo,2016-07-07,"You want people to listen between your words today and connect with your soul rather than your performance. However, your bold behavior can be more intimidating than you realize. But toning down your delivery doesn't mean you need to dilute your message. In fact, the gentler your approach, the easier it is for you to stick with your position, even if it goes against someone else's grain. A little bit of sugar helps the medicine go down."
virgo,2016-07-07,"Love doesn't have to be as hard as it seems today, especially if you're locked in a power struggle that eludes resolution. The stress of an unsolvable difference of opinion can wear you down to the point of wanting to walk away from the whole thing. But disengaging doesn't fix anything; it only delays the inevitable. Forget about determining who is wrong and who is right. Instead, assume everyone has a viable perspective and seek ways to integrate the best points from each person's experience. Blessed are the peacemakers."
libra,2016-07-07,"You may not appear to be in control today, but you're probably holding onto your position tighter than anyone realizes. Your diplomatic approach seems so natural to everyone else, but you work at it in ways that are not obvious. Sometimes you are genuinely ambivalent, but your current indecision could be part of a calculated ploy to sway people to your position. The beauty of your plan is that others will feel as if they are in charge while you gently pull the strings. Perhaps the meek really will inherit the Earth."
scorpio,2016-07-07,"You're not afraid to rattle a few cages in your fight for independence today. But you don't necessarily have a specific plan; you just want the freedom to dance to your own drummer and you believe a breakdown of structure will offer you the personal space you need. Unfortunately, everything may unravel too quickly and your strategy can backfire if you make more of a mess than you intend. You don't need to create a diversion if you have the courage of your convictions. Do what you must and let others respond as they will."
sagittarius,2016-07-07,"You are stepping into a power zone today, but need to move cautiously so you don't waste this cosmic opportunity. Although you're tempted to react without stopping to think about your feelings, it doesn't take too much self-control now to shift the balance in your favor. A little energy applied at the right moment can change the course of the day, but you must be willing to wait. As the Persian poet Saadi wrote, ""Have patience. Everything is difficult before it is easy."""
capricorn,2016-07-07,"It seems as if someone is trying to manipulate your feelings today, but they won't confront you directly. Unfortunately, it may fall on you to expose the unspoken tension. However, you might try to avoid the discussion because the negativity isn't even yours. Upon deeper examination, you could realize that your personal resistance to the ideas of others created the problem in the first place. Take a risk and share your concerns now, but do it in a manner that invites give and take. Keeping the communication channels wide open ultimately works in everyone's favor."
aquarius,2016-07-07,"You're content to remain behind the scenes today while others are shining in the spotlight. But it's not because you want to avoid recognition; of course, you prefer to be acknowledged for your contributions. It's just that you're more interested in getting things done and you're more efficient when you're not wasting time interacting with people beyond the scope of your immediate work. Thankfully, you can win both ways now; focus on the task at hand, but be ready to step onto center stage at a moment's notice."
pisces,2016-07-07,"You're not necessarily very expressive today, but your feelings are still strong enough to shake your world. However, you might be worried that someone you're attracted to now doesn't feel the same way about you. But choosing to keep your desires quiet from the one you admire does a disservice to you both. You have the potential to break out of a rut, but you must make the first move. The answer to your question will always be no if you never ask."
aries,2016-07-08,"People are impressed when you show up with your I-can-do-it attitude, but they're not as happy if you don't deliver the goods. You could sweep others off their feet with your positive assessment of a situation because they want to believe you have all the answers. Unfortunately, hyperbole is not your friend today. Being honest from the start keeps things on an even keel, instead of pretending you know more than everyone else. Facing the truth is messy but worth the inconvenience now, nonetheless, if you want to build solid relationships."
taurus,2016-07-08,"In your haste to keep things simple, you assume that what you see is actually what you get. But you can set yourself up for a fall by believing everyone is telling you the truth today. It's not that anyone is purposefully misleading you; in fact, they're probably just trying to help now. Nevertheless, you'll be happier in the long run if you counter everyone else's positivity with a touch of moderation. Do your research before signing on the dotted line."
gemini,2016-07-08,"You have a special knack for delivering bad news today in such a way that it seems better than worse. Although you can see a silver lining in even the darkest of storm clouds now, you are walking a fine line between hope and fantasy. There's no doubt that your power of positive thinking influences people's lives in a profound manner. But inspiring others only works if you keep it real. However, sometimes it's unclear where to draw the line. As science fiction writer Robert Heinlein wrote, ""Everything is theoretically impossible until it is done."""
cancer,2016-07-08,"People are encouraging you to speak up today, but you're not eager to share your thoughts until you explore all of your alternatives. Although your first reaction might be quite enthusiastic, your idealism is more of a reflection of your state of mind now than the actual circumstances. You're not interested in being a leader who rallies the troops at the expense of your own emotional security. Don't overstep your limits of comfort just to impact someone else's behavior. Listening to your intuition enables you to know when enough is enough."
leo,2016-07-08,"You might believe you already missed the chance of a lifetime to pursue your dreams. However, you're probably misinterpreting the current conditions. The cosmic energy is not denying your success; circumstances only delay you to create additional time for you to get your act together. Rather than fretting about what's not ready for prime time now, sharpen your tools and start working. Your future is calling so don't hesitate to answer with a resounding yes."
virgo,2016-07-08,"You are doing your absolute best now to prevent your work relationships from changing dramatically, but your singular focus may not be enough to stop the dynamics from shifting. You could exhaust yourself by attempting to force your agenda on others. Nevertheless, it will take more than a minor setback to halt your progress. Don't let a bout of pessimism keep you from manifesting your dreams. Nelson Mandala said, ""I am the master of my fate and the captain of my destiny."""
libra,2016-07-08,"Although your friendly nature usually puts others at ease, much to your surprise it could have the opposite effect now. Don't try to convince anyone that you're on their side, especially if people seem to bristle at your good-natured attitude today. But a personality conflict is not a good reason to raise a white flag and go home. Pay attention where you meet resistance and confront it head on. Even the smallest struggle can help clarify the route to your new destination."
scorpio,2016-07-08,"Your words brighten someone's day today, but only if you're willing to talk about your feelings. Sometimes you steer clear of personal disclosure because it places you in a highly vulnerable position. However, sharing your full spectrum of emotions strengthens your position now because it demonstrates how solid your thinking has grown. Don't be afraid to reveal both sides of your current conundrum; your honesty fosters a sense of trust in others."
sagittarius,2016-07-08,"You're hard-pressed to keep up appearances today, even if you begin the day with a hopeful heart. But an existential encounter with self-doubt is not nearly as bad as it sounds, especially if it acts as a wake-up call. A reality check can be quite invigorating -- like a cold shower -- and motivates you to get serious enough to overcome a disappointing setback. Thankfully, your irrepressible spirit is able to rebound quickly if you draw upon your support network and get down to work. Positive results create lasting confidence."
capricorn,2016-07-08,"You're no stranger to mapping out an agenda and then doing whatever it takes to achieve your goal. Unfortunately, you might feel as if you're in over your head when you realize your master plan got a little out of hand. But don't wait until there are others depending upon your success. The sooner you pare back your expectations, the happier everyone will be. Make something happen now; every accomplishment starts with a decision to try."
aquarius,2016-07-08,"You're tired of somehow being at the bottom rung of the ladder and always looking up. Nevertheless, you can gain real traction now, as long as you're willing to respect the limitations imposed by your superiors. However, this does not mean you must blindly accept the rules. Question authority if you want to overcome the obstacles in your path. And remember, the key to successful leadership today is influence, not authority."
pisces,2016-07-08,"Your hope blossoms today, only to be shut down once again by someone close to you. But you don't need to internalize anyone else's negativity, unless it's already your own. If it is yours, process it the quickest way possible and then move on. There's no use crying over spilled milk; pull your overcommitted promises back within the confines of reality and don't take no for an answer. A winner is a dreamer who never gives up."
aries,2016-07-09,"A tightly packed schedule isn't as restrictive as it appears today. Although your activities can certainly keep you busy on the outside, you're traveling far and wide within the unrestrained realms of your imagination. Others might not realize what you're up to now, allowing you to explore the edges of the cosmos in your fantasies. Thankfully, your inner journeys are spiritually rejuvenating and everyone will benefit from your mental excursions, even if they don't understand the twinkle in your eye. Those who don't believe in magic will never find it."
taurus,2016-07-09,"Although you see extraordinary possibilities in ordinary experiences today, manifesting your visions isn't as simple as you might think. It's misleading when beauty seems within your grasp, yet it vanishes when you tighten your grip. Surprisingly, the solution to many a problem is contained within this paradox. Trying too hard has a reverse effect and satisfaction remains elusive as long as you struggle for it. But relaxing your need to control the outcome allows your dreams to flourish. Happiness isn't out there; it's within you."
gemini,2016-07-09,"You wish you could let the world go by without your participation today. In fact, you might cherish the idea of just putting your feet up and giving your body a chance to recuperate from the recent stress. However, your overactive mind still seeks something to do. Peace and quiet may need to wait if you get caught up in running errands or finishing projects around the house. Nevertheless, you'll feel more energized if you balance your activities with a bit of well-deserved rest. All work and no play is rarely a good idea on the weekend."
cancer,2016-07-09,"It seems as if there's never enough time to catch up on all your networking and today is no exception. But devoting your day to phone calls, texts, email and social media doesn't leave you any time to connect with your soul. Do something special for yourself now and unplug from technology. Play some music, read a book or take a hike; going offline for a while creates space for your inner wisdom to shine through. Journalist Sydney J. Harris wrote, ""The best time to relax is when you don't have time for it."""
leo,2016-07-09,"It's ironic that you have a fixed idea of what you want today, yet you encounter trouble putting it into words. Of course, people can't read your mind, making it unlikely they will assist you on your quest. Nevertheless, you're ready to go off on your own in search of your dream. But try not to alienate others just because they're not joining you. Maintaining solid connections with those you love enables you to travel even further while on your spiritual pursuit. Sharing your experience with your friends after the fact is still cause for celebration."
virgo,2016-07-09,"Your powerful mood changes are both a strength and a weakness today. Your gut reaction to each situation is clear enough to reveal your inner truth, but you know your current thinking is not permanent. You also have an antenna tuned toward the distant horizon that makes you recognize the limitations of your immediate feelings. Nevertheless, you can't live in one world without also being acutely aware of the other. Sometimes it's the unsolvable dilemmas that fuel the most creative solutions."
libra,2016-07-09,"Your dreams have broken free from the restraints of reality and it sounds like fun to follow them wherever they lead. However, those closest to you have other ideas in mind and you're unable to ignore their wishes today. Thankfully, with a little cosmic magic you can do it all with very little effort on your part. Enjoy your time with friends and family but don't give up on your dreams since they have the power to transform your world."
scorpio,2016-07-09,"Your social life is suddenly taking off in unexpected ways and you don't know whether to celebrate or mourn. Although you may need to sacrifice some personal freedom to participate in group activities, it will be well worth the detour. It's healthy to open your heart to new experiences now. Don't worry about being distracted from more important tasks since they will still be there upon your return. Putting your priorities in order allows people to come first."
sagittarius,2016-07-09,"Unexpected opportunities offer you the chance to connect with an entirely new cast of characters now. It's quite exciting when your dreams come true and you can't tell the difference between them and your real life. But there's also danger in the air when your power of discernment is malfunctioning. Making long-term decisions is tricky because today's treasure can turn into tomorrow's prison. Accept invitations to play, but make sure you have an escape plan and a way home for when you need it."
capricorn,2016-07-09,"You're not limited to your regular choices today. It's as if your blinders were removed and there's a variety of roads leading from the present moment into the rest of your life. Although this jolt of awareness is thrilling, it's also daunting. You don't necessarily enjoy being overwhelmed with so many alternatives. Nevertheless, you can still apply your methodical analysis to the situation and weed out the most unrealistic options before picking your path. Your potential is unlimited now; the only thing that restricts your future is your mind."
aquarius,2016-07-09,"You're likely to encounter a few surprises today no matter how meticulous you are in your planning. But you're not willing to put up with anyone's restrictive ideas because people's plans that are built on fear seem ignorant to your progressive thinking now. It's as if a strike of lightning has lit up your entire brain and you can see everything from a more cosmic perspective. Where others want to erect walls, you see opportunities to build bridges. Living in your fantasy world is easy; the hard work begins when you commit to taking action in the real world."
pisces,2016-07-09,"It's nothing new if people accuse you of being a dreamer, but the dynamics change if you're not motivated to defend your practicality today. Instead of arguing with anyone, you probably just see their criticism as a distraction from your magical thinking. You don't want to waste time engaging doubt, no matter where it originates. Instead, you are obsessed with creating your own version of Utopia, even if it's temporarily contained within your imagination. Sowing the seeds of the future begins in your mind."
aries,2016-07-10,"Your message is as upbeat as you are today and you feel like you're as good as gold. For once, there's no need to monitor your words before speaking them since your positive attitude won't likely offend anyone. Don't waste energy defending your behavior. There's no reason to curb your enthusiasm now; accelerate confidently in the direction of your drive while it lasts."
taurus,2016-07-10,"You're eager for a play day and, fortunately, reality seems to be conspiring with you to make it happen. However, you might be so confident that everything will fall into place today that you don't put any effort toward manifesting your vision. It doesn't matter how smoothly events unfold; you need to take the first step by voicing your intention. Circumstances will follow a different trajectory unless you share your ideal scenario. Your words are very convincing now, but only if you speak them out loud."
gemini,2016-07-10,"The sparkle in your eyes tells it all today; you're looking to create some mischief and you should be able to do so without too much delay. But flying by the seat of your pants won't work now because thoughtful Mercury trines Mars in your 6th House of Logistics, requiring you to think through your day in advance. You are better equipped to take advantage of a sudden turn of events if you have a rough schedule sketched out. Ironically, spontaneity is especially kind to you if you already have a plan in mind."
cancer,2016-07-10,"You're quite content in your own little corner of the universe today. Although your friends might encourage you to join them in a variety of activities, you're more inclined to spend some quiet time with your family or partner. You're not interesting in changing the world when you can carve out a piece of paradise to be your very own. Emotional rewards are yours now if you go deep instead of wide."
leo,2016-07-10,"You're more flexible when it comes to making plans today than others expect. You're often the one with the inspiring agenda, but you're not usually willing to negotiate. However, the diplomatic Libra Moon is visiting your 3rd House of Communication, blessing you with an extra helping of people skills. Even if your friends have conflicting preferences, you're capable of facilitating easy conversation that leads to a common goal. But don't wait for a better time to initiate a sensitive discussion; your chance to find a resolution now is as good as it gets."
virgo,2016-07-10,You may be reconsidering your position on a complex issue because of a recent mind-altering experience. You might have learned something important that catalyzed your thinking and is now rippling inward to impact your core beliefs. But don't let anyone push you one way or another just yet. Continue to gather information with an open mind and draw your own conclusions in a natural and organic process. It's been said that you're not using your mind if you can't change it.
libra,2016-07-10,"Your notorious ambivalence is a bigger problem for others than it is for you. However, the ever-changing Moon's return to your sign is annoying if you thought you already made up your mind about your feelings. You might wish you took decisive action early in the day because your certainty seems to fade as the hours tick by. But things happen (or don't happen) for a reason. It's better to wait until you're sure than to regret an overly passionate but premature reaction. Silence can be a source of great strength."
scorpio,2016-07-10,"Although you have a silver tongue today, you don't want to waste it on meaningless chatter. In fact, you want to investigate unspoken motives while talkative Mercury harmonizes with energetic Mars, now moving direct in your penetrating sign. It's not as much fun splashing in the shallows when you can be fully immersed in the deep end of the pool. Luckily, there seem to be others willing to join you on your mystery mission. It's unnecessary to hesitate while the cosmic waters are calling your name."
sagittarius,2016-07-10,"People are attracted to your big ideas today. Everything you talk about seems like a grand adventure while still sounding feasible. But you're probably not telling the whole story; if you did explain everything, others might be scared away. Some exploits are better experienced in the mind than in the real world. Don't hide any perilous details when stirring up interest for your undertaking. Arm everyone with all the facts so they are empowered to make the best decisions for themselves."
capricorn,2016-07-10,"You have a rare opportunity to forge a new path in a current relationship today if you're willing to open your heart. Powerful communication is facilitated by a Mercury-Mars alignment that energizes your 7th House of Relationships. But you won't be able to hide behind safe formalities or intellectual analysis as emotional water signs are prominent. It may feel awkward, or even scary, to express what you are feeling in the moment. Allow your words to flow directly from your soul and your fears will dissipate as the conversation deepens."
aquarius,2016-07-10,"You would like to follow your regular Sunday routine but it's impossible if your schedule is disrupted by events that are beyond your control. Luckily, you are blessed with the ability to adapt to the unexpected changes today, even if this is not your normal modus operandi. The most important tool in your toolbox now is your skill of putting your perceptions into words. Helping others see things in a new light initiates conversations that inspire you to greater heights."
pisces,2016-07-10,"The most complex relationship dynamics are temporarily simplified today by some unknown cosmic intervention. For some reason, you're suddenly able to talk about a subject that was previously taboo. Thankfully, an honest discussion now reduces conflict to the point of non-existence, even if it would have started a war just a few days ago. But you must take the initiative or you'll lose the chance to finally clear the air. Don't let an opportunity that could change your life pass you by."
aries,2016-07-11,"You normally like being in the thick of it all, but today you have mixed feelings about being the center of attention. Although there's a lot going on behind your eyes, you don't necessarily want everyone involved with your inner process. However, those closest to you can tell you're on edge, even if you pretend that all is well. It makes sense to maintain boundaries and keep your private life away from the public. Nevertheless, confiding in someone you trust helps to settle your nerves while you continue to work through your current dilemma."
taurus,2016-07-11,"Thoughts are flying through your mind so fast that it's hard for you to keep up with them. You want to tell others what you're thinking, but you're afraid they won't understand you. Acknowledging your own self-doubt is an important step in overcoming your resistance to talk with your friends. Nevertheless, you could be happily surprised with your healing if you take a risk by lowering your defenses enough to let someone special in. You'll never know what might have happened unless you try."
gemini,2016-07-11,"Current circumstances at work require you to focus on practical issues today, but you may find it impossible to concentrate on mundane matters. Nevertheless, some things can't wait even if your curiosity pulls you in other directions. You can work yourself into an anxious state by trying to shut off your thoughts. Instead, choose your battles wisely. Pick a few tasks that demand your attention and get them out of the way. Allowing time for more creative pursuits will settle your mind and have you back to earth soon enough for another round."
cancer,2016-07-11,"Instead of nurturing those you care for by comforting them with tender words, you want to empower them to take control of their own lives. Your message might sound harsh at first, but it's tough love that enables a mother bird to push her fledglings out of the nest so they may learn to fly. Someone might resist your efforts today and accuse you of withholding support. Do not waver if your actions are misunderstood. You will receive kudos later on once others see the results of your radical behavior."
leo,2016-07-11,"You are in a bit of a predicament today because you want everyone to know your plans yet you don't feel like talking. Obviously, you must give in on one side or the other. Unfortunately, if you don't say what's on your mind, you have little chance of getting along with others. Additionally, what's left unspoken can be used against you later on. Thankfully, you're the master of your own fate; all you need to do is overcome your inertia and start the conversation. Everything will fall into place once your thoughts are out in the open."
virgo,2016-07-11,"Your long-term goals don't necessarily mesh with the expectations of your friends and associates, prompting you to withdraw socially and keep your thoughts to yourself. However, you're likely to receive flak from those who think you're ignoring them. It might take a while for you to run though all your options, but sharing your thoughts is really your only viable option. Don't worry if you alienate others at first; they'll come around when they see how serious you are. Even if your peers don't agree with your choices, they will respect you for having the courage of your convictions."
libra,2016-07-11,"You're ready to throw in the towel today because it seems as if you don't have a clear path to follow. You're faced with making a choice between logic and emotions, yet each has its pros and cons. You can't serve two masters now and must choose sooner or later. Although it may be easier to justify a rational decision, you'll be happier in the long run if you listen to your heart. You can always rely on your head to work out the details after the fact."
scorpio,2016-07-11,"You're overwhelmed with all the options now and need some time to retreat into a safe space where you can figure out your next move. Establishing boundaries helps you limit your interactions to a few special people. Thankfully, meaningful conversations are possible once you filter out the extraneous noise. But don't be afraid of someone's point of view that conflicts with yours. A difference of opinions is the grist for your intellectual mill. Once you grind all the thoughts into their basic essence, you'll be ready to create a new plan."
sagittarius,2016-07-11,"You are wearing your detective hat today as you uncover missing bits of information needed to make an important decision at work. You might be tempted to go with whatever your gut tells you, but the wiser approach is to gather useful data before regretting an impulsive choice. Contrary to your instincts, this is not the best time to get creative. A healthy dose of common sense is worth more than a sprinkling of brilliance. There is a Filipino proverb that rightly claims, ""Caution minimizes loss."""
capricorn,2016-07-11,"Although you might seek out lively conversations today, don't just provoke arguments to satisfy your need for mental stimulation. View each interaction as an opportunity to clarify your relationship dynamics with that person. But communication is more than expressing your point of view, so take the time to ask questions and then listen closely to what others say. Thankfully, maintaining objectivity prevents a heated debate from escalating into a major conflict."
aquarius,2016-07-11,"You may believe that time is running out at work and you must finish a project so you can move on. But your heightened anxiety could cause you to make errors, which further delays your completion. Fortunately, you're experienced with working under pressure. Furthermore, you're not a stranger to job-related tension. You have the skills to skillfully dance in the territory between the electric edge of brilliance and the safety of stable ground. Don't worry so much about what others may think; trust your own inner compass for the most accurate guidance."
pisces,2016-07-11,"You can easily slip into the role of a merry prankster today. You want to have fun with your self-expression and you might not stop to consider the impact of your behavior on those around you. What's fun and games to you could be a waste of time and energy to someone else. Nevertheless, your playful activities that have no socially redeeming value today might develop into something useful in the days ahead. As William Blake wrote, ""If the fool would persist in his folly he would become wise."""
aries,2016-07-12,"Your playful spirit and warmhearted generosity make you and whatever you bring to the table a joy to behold. Your love life heats up when stylish Venus sashays into charismatic Leo and your 5th House of Romance to magnify your charm and increase your popularity. Nevertheless, you can push your luck too hard if you forget to honor the needs of others. Thankfully, recognizing people's limits helps you to avoid stress today and during the weeks ahead. All the world's your stage but it's more fun when shared with someone you love."
taurus,2016-07-12,"Uncertainty about your emotions and the unreliability of other people should dissipate as you step forward to take charge of your life. Sweet Venus waltzes into showy Leo, encouraging you to be more open when sharing your feelings with those close to you. Fortunately, you may feel more secure as Venus drifts through your 4th House of Home and Family for the next three weeks. But remember the words of John Lennon: ""And in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make."""
gemini,2016-07-12,"Romantic urges may overrule your logic today and you won't be able to think your way out of trouble. Venus marches into dramatic Leo and your 3rd House of Communication, bringing your desires into the open now. Don't bother trying to rationalize your needs; just express what you want without any crazy expectations. Those who care about you will not only listen to what you say but could also surprise you with their support."
cancer,2016-07-12,Buying things that pump up your prestige may be worth the money now if gaining a higher status stimulates your creativity. You grow increasingly extravagant as vivacious Venus moves through luxury-loving Leo and your 2nd House of Resources. But be careful not to go too far on your quest for pleasure. Stretching yourself to reach the stars is admirable as long as you are realistic when you calculate the cost of fulfilling your dreams.
leo,2016-07-12,"The revival of your creativity makes you feel especially attractive these days. Luckily, your admirers can't help but notice and are more than ready to reward you with the attention and affection you crave now. Effervescent Venus enters bighearted Leo and your 1st House of Personality to enhance your self-image and increase your charisma, enchanting others with your every move. It's exhilarating to go with the flow when the pendulum finally swings in a more positive direction."
virgo,2016-07-12,"You might be tapped on the shoulder now and asked to perform selfless acts of love and compassion. But there's no need to play the role of a martyr if you must set your personal needs aside for a while. Although you may not experience the pleasure that affectionate Venus in Leo often brings, her visit to your 12th House of Spirituality all but assures a deeper level of emotional satisfaction later on. To have an open heart is to be truly alive."
libra,2016-07-12,"You're in the mood to party but you might be tempted to overindulge tonight. Nevertheless, you want to spend more time with your friends when your key planet, Venus, prances into playful Leo and your 11th House of Dreams. But don't pretend that everything is okay when it's not. If you have deadlines you can't meet or commitments you can't keep, just admit it; accept the consequences and move on. Being honest can make life difficult for a while, but hiding the truth creates a deeper layer of problems."
scorpio,2016-07-12,"If you have your sights set on getting ahead in your career, encountering supportive people and favorable circumstances make your progress easier than ever. As friendly Venus in lovable Leo wends her way through your 10th House of Status, people in authority will come to your aid because they are attracted to your magnetic energy. Remember, there is no better way to thank the universe for your good fortune now than by offering a helping hand to someone down on their luck."
sagittarius,2016-07-12,You are dreaming of faraway places and distant romances now that vivacious Venus is traveling through dramatic Leo and your 9th House of Adventure. But paying attention to more immediate obligations obviously takes priority today whether you like it or not. You may be held accountable for unfinished tasks or shoddy work. Don't let resentment waste your precious time. Buckle down and meet your responsibilities while you still can turn things around.
capricorn,2016-07-12,Gifts of love or money may start to flow when affluent Venus enters generous Leo and your 8th House of Deep Sharing. You could hear news about someone's ambitious plans that stretch your credibility. You don't want to rain on their parade today since you have more to gain by engaging your heart and raising your hopes than by stewing in skepticism or hanging back in fear. There's no question about it; prosperity begins with your state of mind.
aquarius,2016-07-12,"An abundance of pleasure is undeniably sweeter than a handful of empty promises. But watch out for a tendency to overspend and overindulge, for you might expect too much from others when Venus shifts into extravagant Leo and your 7th House of Companions. It's all too easy to allow your fantasies to overpower reason but this strategy only works for short bursts of time. If you must set reality aside in the pursuit of romance, remember not to lose touch with your common sense."
pisces,2016-07-12,"Overblown pride and outrageous revelations could set you up for disappointment at work when Venus struts into theatrical Leo and your 6th House of Employment. Grand gestures may attract the spotlight now, but demanding too much or offering more than you can deliver is a risky strategy. Pushing the intellectual envelope eventually assists your career if you do the research before filling in the details of your agenda. As Ben Franklin wrote, ""If you fail to plan, you are planning to fail!"""
aries,2016-07-13,"You might believe that revealing your emotional secrets today will put everything on the right track for your relationship goals. However, your desires may not hold much interest for others as they wrestle with their own set of issues. Instead of just putting on a show to express your feelings, step back and reassess the big picture first. Everyone has a story to tell and yours is just one of them. Although it seems as if you know the truth; you actually only know one version."
taurus,2016-07-13,"You spend much of the day in a dreamy reverie until someone or something shocks you back into reality. But you might not be ready to return to your mundane chores; after all, your fantasies contain much more intrigue and fascination. The enchantment with inner realms is very compelling now but your work continues to pile up. There's no easy resolution to your two voices. Continue to hold space for both worlds without choosing sides. As John Lennon wrote, ""Reality leaves a lot to the imagination."""
gemini,2016-07-13,"Your workmates may opt to keep a safe distance from you today because of your uncharacteristic single-mindedness. Your current obsession is both a blessing and a curse now. Once you find your groove, you will be able to stay in it for a while, adding to your overall efficiency. But don't get lost in the details since they can distract you from the main event. Relaxing your rigidity empowers you to take advantage of the changing dynamics. Flexibility is your friend."
cancer,2016-07-13,"You're not a fan of instability, especially when it impacts your career path. You are traveling on one trajectory at work, only to discover it isn't as smooth as you anticipated. Unfortunately, you might be uncertain as to where your life is heading now. You can wait until something happens and then try to make the best of it. Or, you can instigate change today by sharing your frustrations with your boss or colleagues. Be patient; something has to give -- and it will."
leo,2016-07-13,"You are trying to fly beneath the radar today, but grow increasingly motivated to come out of hiding. Ironically, as challenging as it is to dream out loud, you might not be able to stop once your imagination starts rolling. Thankfully, your closest allies rally around your cause, encouraging you to develop your best ideas even further. However, you'll lose precious ground if you reveal too much too fast. Your process of gaining visibility will be successful now as long as you take it at a steady pace."
virgo,2016-07-13,"Your fixed position on a controversial subject can land you in hot water with your friends today. Nevertheless, you're so emotionally charged now that you're not likely to revise your thinking, even if the facts support a different conclusion. However, you can start to overcome your fear of change by becoming more aware of it. Ultimately, it's more painful to stay stuck with no way to escape the status quo. Admitting when you are wrong is a a sign of humility and strength."
libra,2016-07-13,"You like the idea of hanging out with people who are free spirits. But the uninhibited actions of a friend could frustrate you to no end today. You are not comfortable when others won't play by the rules because you can't trust them to stay on script. There's a time and place for personal expression, but it only adds to your anxiety now. Sometimes, even the simplest problems evade resolution until you are focusing on something else."
scorpio,2016-07-13,"You could find yourself in the middle of an intense but illuminating debate about your future and what's ahead for humanity in general. But perhaps your discussion is taking place entirely within your own head today. Unfortunately, you won't get a fresh perspective until you engage with others in an open-ended debate. Obviously, there's a gamble involved because you can't predict how someone else will react. Nevertheless, if you don't risk anything, you will end up risking everything."
sagittarius,2016-07-13,"Too many job-related constraints prevent you from exploring more radical expressions of your wanderlust. Unfortunately, you've been withholding your feelings long enough to fuel an impulsive emotional outburst. Although clearing the air can help to move the energy along, it's wiser to bring your ideas out into the open in a less abrasive manner. Moderation will help you accomplish what extremism cannot."
capricorn,2016-07-13,"You prefer to sidestep passionate discussions, but people still seem driven to take conversations into sensitive territories today. You're not eager to discover and disarm emotional landmines because this process distracts you from more mundane priorities. But don't be so resistant to explore your feelings now. Sigmund Freud, the father of depth psychology taught, ""Unexpressed emotions will never die. They are buried alive and will come forth later in uglier ways."" Heartfelt expression fuels healthy relationships."
aquarius,2016-07-13,"Complex political maneuverings at work add stress to your life now. You're unsure how to position yourself in the fluctuating dynamics because there are pieces of the current situation you simply don't understand. Unfortunately, as long as you focus on untangling the external circumstances today, you won't find a solution. Radically change your frame of reference by concentrating on doing the right thing, no matter the consequences. Integrity is timeless."
pisces,2016-07-13,"People don't necessarily see your compassionate side today because they are distracted by your exemplary performance at work. You possess all the right moves now and can dazzle others with your fancy footwork. But you know better than anyone that there are more important things than putting on a good show. You want to make a positive impact that has an enduring effect after your song and dance routine is over. As Pisces Albert Einstein wrote, ""Strive not to be a success, but rather to be of value."""
aries,2016-07-14,"You appear emotionally tougher than you actually are today, even if you're scared by your own shadow. But it's more likely that you're frightened by unexpressed feelings. Nevertheless, you always retain the option of confronting your suppressed fears instead of running from them. Although this courageous strategy requires a healthy amount of self-esteem, you can draw upon the memory of previous successes to bolster your confidence. The way out is the way through."
taurus,2016-07-14,"You don't like wasting time with anyone's emotional drama, but you might not be able to avoid it now. Unfortunately, logically talking your way around the intensity only makes the situation worse today. It is said that you must fight fire with fire; accordingly, you need to drop all the rational strategies and come from a subjective heart-centered place when fighting water with water. Surrendering to your feelings is the only way to swim."
gemini,2016-07-14,"You're ready to engage in a battle to defend your way of doing things today. However, your new approach may not be any more efficient than the old method. Nevertheless, sticking to one over-arching philosophy enables you to judge your progress with an objective eye. Don't worry if you're not moving along as quickly as you prefer. Give yourself plenty of time to establish a sustainable rhythm. As Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""Adopt the pace of nature: her secret is patience."""
cancer,2016-07-14,"You are struck by the lightning of inspiration today, but could have a tough time integrating your cosmic creations with your job duties. In fact, the more outrageous your behavior, the less expressive you are. Don't withdraw emotionally and alienate yourself from everyone else when you really need the human connection now. Before you initiate your great escape, remember the Beatles who sang, ""I get by with a little help from my friends."""
leo,2016-07-14,"Your opinions are so strong today that you can't keep quiet. However, you're concerned about coming on too strong because your current intensity has the potential to spiral out of control. But rather than worrying about how others might react, just let the loving energy of Mercury and Venus shine through your affectionate sign. Sometimes, heartfelt words need to carry extra weight. Fortunately, people expect you proud Lions to roar when you express your truth."
virgo,2016-07-14,"You're a champ at setting your needs off to the side in order to maintain intellectual clarity. However, it's not so easy to deny your emotions today, especially if anger bubbles into awareness. It's unhealthy to ignore your feelings or try to bury them because they'll only grow in strength and resurface at a less convenient time. You can't delete a thought in the same way you delete a message. Acknowledging your passions is the first step to transforming them into something positive."
libra,2016-07-14,"You can't separate your feelings from your material possessions today. Everything you own has a story attached to it that adds to its unique value. But some things are associated with difficult experiences and bring up fear or regret. Obviously, you can get rid of these offending items by giving them away or selling them. However, it takes extra work to fully process your emotions instead of just eliminating the objects. Embracing the associated memories starts the healing process of letting go."
scorpio,2016-07-14,"You are recycling an old feeling one more time, even if you thought you were already done with it. You have experienced some change in the past few weeks, but not enough; your frustration could reach a critical level today when you recognize your limited progress. But don't let your concerns run away with your entire day. Step back from anything that feels overwhelming now. It's as if you are putting a wide-angle lens on your camera. Once you see things from a larger perspective, it's easier to release the past and proceed into the future."
sagittarius,2016-07-14,"Although you might create a little ruckus to let everyone know you're serious, you don't want to be in the spotlight today. Ironically, taking a stand could end up attracting the same attention you were trying to avoid. In the final analysis, your need for privacy will likely outweigh your desire to be understood. It really doesn't matter if people see the real you or not. Concentrate on finishing your tasks on time, rather than worrying about what others think. Quietly working behind the scenes may ultimately bring the deeper satisfaction you seek."
capricorn,2016-07-14,"Engaging with others feeds your ambitions and brings your passions to the surface today. Competing on a team or participating in a group effort is a perfect way to express your commitment to your extended family or community. But watch out for extreme feelings upsetting the delicate balance of interpersonal dynamics. Obviously, pulling someone down won't ever help you reach the top. Honor your feelings as you honor your friends, but don't fuel either with irrational expectations."
aquarius,2016-07-14,"Your career objectives are quite fixed now and you have very little desire to negotiate those things that are important to you. Although there's no doubt about your goals, you're still working on your plans to reach them. Trying to get anyone to join you on your next venture is not a wise strategy because it will only distract you from your quest. You don't need to be carrying others who will only slow you down. If people aren't actively supporting you, politely ask them to have the courtesy to get out of your way. Fortune smiles on those who create their own opportunities."
pisces,2016-07-14,"You are excited about expanding your world view by taking up a new course of study or embarking on your own exploratory travels. However, you must be willing to open your mind to unknown experiences. If you try to cling to your current perspective, the opportunity for spiritual and emotional growth could be lost. Don't sit around for days fine-tuning your plans; get rolling as quickly as possible. The cosmic energy is conducive for creating positive change."
aries,2016-07-15,"It's as if you lost the ability to tell the difference between enough and too much. You may be reflecting on your own personal version of the global meltdown where all signs are blindly pointing down the Road of Excess. Nevertheless, you might want to limit your indulgent proclivities before finding yourself in an awkward predicament. But don't worry about losing face; as a human, you are full of shortcomings and inconsistencies like everyone else. Before you judge anyone else, just remember compassion works both ways."
taurus,2016-07-15,"It makes you nervous when your adrenaline heats up your blood. You normally seek freedom by creating practical plans, but now they only bore you. You might surprise your friends with your new outlook as you strive to squeeze more into your weekend. Although others see you in a different light, you're not as comfortable with all the fanfare as you seem. You don't need to impress anyone else; slow down and enjoy where you are without striving to be something you're not."
gemini,2016-07-15,"You have slipped into a cosmic grace period when people seem to enter your life just to make it better. Naturally, there's no resistance on your part; you like the idea of participating in activities just for the fun of it. But you might need to make some tough choices because you can't say yes to everything. Take cues from your environment; the flow of events will lead you in the right direction today. Luckily, answers come easily now as long as you observe the signs and pay them heed."
cancer,2016-07-15,"Your big plans for the weekend might sound like a dream come true, but first you must make it through today's list of chores. Unfortunately, piles of work prevent you from jumping into play mode too soon. Nevertheless, you can't stop your brain from planning for the good times to come while the Moon influences your 6th House of Logistics. Don't get too far ahead of yourself; counting chickens before they hatch is never a smart idea. One foot in front of the other will get you to your destination on time."
leo,2016-07-15,"You're eager to finish up your chores because the Moon's shift into your 5th House of Fun and Games is inviting you out to play. Although you might not be free to call your own shots until you finish your work, nothing can stop you from imagining all the fun that's just around the corner. But don't make your move too soon or you'll mess things up before they even get off the ground. A magical time awaits you if you have the good sense to stay focused on the present moment until your obligations are fulfilled."
virgo,2016-07-15,"Fighting the temptation of inflated thinking is one of your recognized skills, but today it will require a consistent high level of concentration. Thankfully, you're up for the task while your key planet Mercury challenges bombastic Jupiter in your sign. You are walking a fine line between optimism and realism now. Keep in mind that ""practical"" is not a dirty word. It just takes a little more creativity to imagine castles in the air while your feet are on the ground."
libra,2016-07-15,"A sweetness of spirit permeates your day but it can quickly turn sour if you are too greedy. Indulging your senses is a well-earned luxury now as long as you know when to stop. Although Mae West said, ""Too much of a good thing can be wonderful,"" it's just not true for you today. Basking in a lovely experience is fabulous, but pushing your limits too far leads to disaster. Get ahead of the curve by practicing moderation before it's too late."
scorpio,2016-07-15,"You're anticipating some overdue downtime, yet still may need to juggle work and play today. Performance art takes on an entirely new meaning now as you share your ideas about the future. But knowing your audience is absolutely crucial or you could ramble on endlessly about something that isn't even of interest. Your steady vigilance and your acute sense of timing enable you to decide when to stop talking and when to swing into action."
sagittarius,2016-07-15,"Although the weekend is quickly approaching, you might be required to reverse your priorities by indulging yourself early in the day and settling down to work later in the evening. Nevertheless, you're restless and on the lookout for your next adventure while the Moon is visiting your expansive sign. Additionally, prosperous Jupiter is in the spotlight, inspiring you to reinvest in an idea or a person. Give yourself plenty of time; you could grow disappointed when you realize you can't arrive at a destination the very same moment you leave."
capricorn,2016-07-15,"Your external success is dependent upon your internal housekeeping today. For someone who likes to keep your world orderly, it might be more constructive if you let some corner of your domain remain completely chaotic now. This uncharacteristic behavior is a metaphor that gives you permission to leave your imagination raw and wild. An unrestrained fantasy life leads to new ideas and the potential of an ingenious breakthrough if you're willing to take a risk."
aquarius,2016-07-15,"You're enjoying the company of your friends and colleagues so much today that it's difficult to get back to unfinished business. But it's absolutely imperative that you live up to your professional commitments now because your forward progress will be inhibited until you do. Nevertheless, your enthusiasm can work in your favor if you imagine the fun times ahead as a reward for a job well done. As Mahatma Gandhi wrote, ""The future depends on what we do in the present."""
pisces,2016-07-15,Everything at work is flowing so smoothly today that you might begin to wonder if you're missing something. The truth is you could easily overlook an important piece of information that will be crucial later on. Don't assume you have all the answers. Asking a friend or colleague for advice gives you the perspective you need to you can turn a pretty good day into one that rocks your world.
aries,2016-07-16,"Changes on the home front create tension, challenging you to keep up your normal routine. But maintaining a cheerful attitude is tough if you feel stuck with nowhere to go. On one hand, you've had enough; your impatience is reaching a crescendo. On the other hand, the Sun's smooth trine with action-hero Mars in your 8th House of Transformation empowers you to pull rabbits out of hats in a way that eases the stress. Regardless of the situation, a playful approach improves the prospects for a better future."
taurus,2016-07-16,You are torn between your urge to hold on tight and your impulse to break free today. The Sun's dynamic square with radical Uranus can make you feel queasy with uncertainty. A simple statement might trigger strong reactions and trusting others is difficult when you're not sure where you stand yourself. Taking a risk and inventing new ways to express yourself is more rewarding than trying to change someone else's behavior. Tearing down barriers instead of reinforcing walls enables you to reclaim your balance and find stable ground.
gemini,2016-07-16,"Successfully maneuvering your way through recently troubled waters brings greater freedom of expression and potential financial rewards. Complex issues around money and its influence on personal relationships may be overwhelming today. But rather than seeking quick solutions, make changes in your daily routine that can continue to have significant impact well into the future. If you want something new, you must do something you've never done before."
cancer,2016-07-16,"Your self-esteem will grow today if you fight for what you think is yours. But win or lose, a shocking Sun-Uranus square opens your eyes, radically alters your perspective and could even turn your life in an entirely different direction. You might find yourself in a conflict with people in power over you, or if you're the one in authority, with those below you. Either way, your flexibility to negotiate around delicate issues is a moot point unless you actually make the attempt."
leo,2016-07-16,"The magnitude of recent changes becomes readily apparent today as shifting circumstances require you to let go of a feeling that ties you to the past. Respond with a touch of caution because your nerves are stretched tight as the Sun squares uncontainable Uranus in your 9th House of Beliefs. Luckily, you can trust your initial reactions while the radiant Sun harmonizes with impulsive Mars. Strike while the fire is hot as long as no one gets hurt."
virgo,2016-07-16,"Your rebellious attitude puts others on notice that you're no longer willing to play by their arbitrary rules. Reactionary Uranus dynamically squares the Sun in your 11th House of Social Networking, prompting you to take action today, even if your behavior could disrupt your plans with your friends. However, the winds of change are blowing in your direction, ensuring a smooth transition as long as you're honest about your feelings from the start."
libra,2016-07-16,"Unpredictable transits can turn your life upside down now, yet they also embolden you to make impressive positive changes. Although a personal relationship may be the designated battlefield today, the real issue is your growing need for independence and your reluctance to reveal what you truly want. Even if you're not sure about the consequences of your words, others will respect you for having the courage to speak up. Remember, there's no going back once the metamorphosis has begun."
scorpio,2016-07-16,"Your life seems like a multiple-choice exam that has many correct answers. However, you must choose one response now even if you wish you had more time to make up your mind. The Sun's dynamic square to spontaneous Uranus in your 6th House of Logistics tempts you to overreact when a smaller modification in your routine will have a greater impact in the long run. As Abraham Lincoln said, ""Commitment is what transforms a promise into reality."""
sagittarius,2016-07-16,"It's easy to be grumpy today because an early morning Moon-Saturn conjunction in your sign frowns upon pleasure. But an electrifying Sun-Uranus square provokes your spontaneous reactions or acts like a lightning rod to attract the same. Nevertheless, this dynamic aspect indicates that your tenacity could pay off with an unexpected breakthrough at the last minute. If you're considering throwing in the towel now, remembering why you held on for so long can inspire you to give it one more try."
capricorn,2016-07-16,"Conflict and confusion lurk at the edges of your perceptions today as unconventional Uranus squares the Sun in your 7th House of Partnerships. If someone pressures you to change, your smartest strategy is to stay calm while the insecurities and odd behaviors of others intensify. Luckily, reclaiming your peaceful center allows you to demonstrate your value as a caring and competent friend or colleague in a time of crisis. Reliability is your trademark of success."
aquarius,2016-07-16,"You may need to fight in order to advance your interests, especially if your agenda clashes with someone else's plans. But exciting events provoke you to rebel against rules and break with tradition. Innumerable trivial issues require your attention; however, saving a chunk of time to reassess major long-term goals is more important today. Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf said, ""If your dreams don't scare you, they are not big enough."""
pisces,2016-07-16,"Relationships might take an unexpected twist today as an irrepressible Sun-Uranus square hits your 5th House of Love and Romance. A thrilling surprise or a sudden disappointment can catch you off guard either way. Fortunately, you possess the tools to come out on top in both scenarios as long as you're adaptable and prepared to change your plans at a moment's notice. Like a willow tree, it's better to bend than break."
aries,2016-07-17,"You may feel quite comfortable with your emotions today, but you're hypersensitive to other people's reactions. You often know exactly what you need to say and don't really care about the consequences of speaking your mind. However ambitious your plans are for sharing your feelings with someone special, you might end up just keeping them to yourself now. But don't be too self-critical if you choose to say nothing at all. Silence speaks when words can't."
taurus,2016-07-17,"Although there might be an undertow of unspoken issues in a relationship today, you're capable of keeping your balance without opening an emotional can of worms. Even if someone pressures you to talk about your feelings, let them know that you're not ready to have the discussion yet. However, it's important to explain that you're not looking to bury the topic; you only want to delay the conversation for a while. The right timing can make all the difference in the world."
gemini,2016-07-17,"Slowing down isn't always the easiest task for you restless Twins, but a day of contemplation may be exactly what the doctor ordered. Although your thoughts could drift into the distant future, for the most part you are able to stay focused on the here and now. However, your spiritual quest will be more meaningful if you set everything else aside today and schedule a specific time for your meditation. Consciously postponing social commitments enables you to create the space you need to pursue serenity for your soul."
cancer,2016-07-17,"Unfulfilled promises may temporarily interfere with your desire to relax today but, thankfully, you can rise to the occasion and do it all. The magic of water is that it seeks its own level before it comes to a standstill. Today's Grand Trine activates the emotional water signs, inspiring you to find peace of mind by giving your feelings the freedom to flow. Nevertheless, like a river running to the sea, you might experience resistance along the way. Instead of trying to overcome an obstacle, just sink into a state of easy acceptance and let the cosmic forces work their magic."
leo,2016-07-17,"A seemingly perfect day stretches out before you and you're eager to jump feet first into the scheduled activities. However, you may quickly change your mind, deciding that running around in pursuit of pleasure sounds more exhausting than it is worth today. Consider excusing yourself from your social commitments and taking the day to relax at home, alone or with your family. Creating sacred space now is the essential ingredient to finding real happiness."
virgo,2016-07-17,"Although you might have a very particular notion about how you want your day to unfold, you could run into resistance as you execute your plan. In fact, sticking to your original idea might leave you feeling discouraged and dejected. Fortunately, reality has a few happy surprises up its cosmic sleeve that actually improve upon your original expectations. However, you must relinquish the reins of control in order for the universe to play its hand. Trust is the key that opens the door to your success."
libra,2016-07-17,"You may feel like quitting today, but giving up before you even start is a terrible idea. Luckily, everything seems to slowly fall into place if you set reasonable goals and continue to strive toward achieving them. But assuming that everything will work out perfectly now is an open invitation for disappointment. Instead, forgive yourself for your flaws; accepting your humanness is the trick to turning an ordinary day into an extraordinary experience."
scorpio,2016-07-17,"You are owning your power today and have no reason to apologize to anyone for your intensity. You are the beneficiary of a stabilizing Grand Water Trine; all you need to do is to shine the light of your awareness, regardless of what you see. Some people might not appreciate the brutal truth, but it's not your place to co-dependently support their denial. To paraphrase President Harry S. Truman, if people can't stand your heat, they should get out of your kitchen."
sagittarius,2016-07-17,"Living in two separate worlds is tricky today as your head pulls one way and your heart another. The Moon's current visit to your adventurous sign inspires you to plan your future. However, an emotional Grand Water Trine lures you deep into the Sea of Imagination where the Land of Logic is left far behind. Rather than trying to choose one location, observe how you move from one realm to the other throughout the day. Dancing in multiple dimensions is easier than you think if you're not tied to any specific outcome."
capricorn,2016-07-17,"You know you need to finish up old business today in preparation for the week ahead. However, you really don't feel like doing much of anything now. You might wonder what has become of your ambition if you can't motivate yourself. Thankfully, there's no reason to panic because your drive will return later in the day when the Moon shifts into your industrious sign. In the meantime, kick back and enjoy a bit of time off. The best investment you can make is in your own wellbeing."
aquarius,2016-07-17,"Your friends struggle to understand you today, especially if you decline their invitation to a social event. Unfortunately, they may take your action as a personal rejection, when that's the furthest thing from your mind. You're not purposely trying to avoid anyone now; it's just that you can't be sidetracked from your agenda. Happily, it doesn't take much effort on your part to explain your intentions. Nevertheless, when you care about someone's feelings, it's worth going the extra mile."
pisces,2016-07-17,"You might feel pressured today to make decisions about upcoming events in your life. However, you're not interested in finalizing plans in the real world while you're happily distracted exploring your emotions. An energetic Grand Water Trine focuses on the healing power of your feelings. Maximize the potential of mind over matter by actively envisioning your ideal future while saving the execution for another day. The mystic poet Rumi wrote, ""Let the water settle and you will see the Moon and Stars mirrored in your being."""
aries,2016-07-18,"You believe you can accomplish anything once you set your mind to it today. Although your imagination may run amok, you're able to harness the power of your ideas as the clarity of your thoughts increases throughout the day. If you feel hyperactive, consciously slowing down your thinking process adds to your productivity. There is work to be done now, and if you focus your mental energy you'll surely achieve more than you once thought possible. Every success story starts with the decision to try."
taurus,2016-07-18,"You are inspired to work hard today in order to reach your dreams. In fact, you may become singularly focused on proving how serious you can be when it comes to achieving your goals. Mercury's easy trine to steadfast Saturn encourages you to communicate in a very matter-of-fact manner, helping you to regain any credibility that you recently lost. Just remember that you can't build a solid reputation on your promises, so get busy before it's too late. Actions speak louder than words."
gemini,2016-07-18,"You can discuss delicate matters skillfully today thanks to a winning combination of compassion and tact. An emotionally sensitive Sun-Neptune alignment softens your heart, enabling you to empathize with others. Mental Mercury forms a favorable trine to steady Saturn, helping you bring a vague hope or dream down to earth with a perfect balance between inspiration and practicality. Hold the vision; trust the process."
cancer,2016-07-18,"Channeling your artistic creativity into something tangible isn't easy as the moody Cancer Sun conspires with imaginative Neptune. Fortunately, you can rely on strategic thinking and your well-honed skills to capitalize on even your most whimsical thoughts. But don't expect your visions to materialize on their own. Sharing your best ideas with someone you trust is a good first step toward manifesting your dreams. Intention plus hard work equals magic."
leo,2016-07-18,"It's confusing when facts and fiction become so entangled that you can't tell which is which. Your dreams are powerfully vivid now as the Sun shines upon otherworldly Neptune. But it's easier to face the truth while interactive Mercury in your sign trines no-nonsense Saturn. Fortunately, you have a solid grasp on both reality and fantasy that you can use to your advantage. Utilizing your imagination empowers you to take your knowledge to the next level."
virgo,2016-07-18,"You are more confident of your decisions when you're able to trust your senses. However, you also receive excellent information today directly from your intuition. Don't discard the wisdom that comes through images and symbols, even if there's no logic to it. It doesn't matter if you can't easily explain how you arrive at your conclusion; ultimately, savvy Mercury's supportive trine with solid Saturn roots you in reality."
libra,2016-07-18,"You must act with full honesty and integrity today, or you could become lost in your own dreams. Fortunately, a smoothly flowing trine between clever Mercury and karmic Saturn enables you to navigate the uncertain realms between your imagination and reality. Stretch your perspective to understand how your friends think, but don't lose sight of your own core values. As the Dalai Lama teaches, ""Compassion and tolerance are not a sign of weakness, but a sign of strength."""
scorpio,2016-07-18,"Call on your persistence and ingenuity today to turn an elusive dream into reality. Your psychic powers are operating at high volume, but it's difficult to know how much your intuitive voice should be trusted. Fortunately, a solid trine between cerebral Mercury and systematic Saturn motivates you to unpack the complexity of an issue and drill down to the source. Imagination and common sense work hand-in-hand now. Your unflappable determination will all but ensure your success."
sagittarius,2016-07-18,"Your logic won't steer you wrong today as long as you start out with valid assumptions. Unfortunately, you could jump to an erroneous conclusion if you let your current desires influence your long-term thinking. Fortunately, clever Mercury's favorable aspect with reliable Saturn strengthens your organizational skills and inspires you to create an ambitious plan that can lead you boldly into the future. Proper preparation prevents poor performance."
capricorn,2016-07-18,"You don't need the recognition for your work today; completing your tasks on time is its own sweet reward. However, you won't be as effective if you try to remain a solo act. You could receive additional support and useful ideas from your friends and coworkers when intelligent Mercury trines constructive Saturn. Thankfully, the combination of solid thinking and clear communication helps you manage the complexity of a project so too many cooks don't spoil the broth."
aquarius,2016-07-18,"If you're stuck in a jam today, it makes sense to pursue all forms of communication as a ticket to your escape. But don't let the potential of a Mercury-Saturn trine go to waste when you could be reinforcing your plans for the stressful days ahead. Thankfully, others will hear your message loud and clear if you take the risk and share what's on your mind. Open your heart; you never know who you are inspiring with your random acts of vulnerability."
pisces,2016-07-18,"Although you might be placed in a leadership position today, you could run the emotional gamut from conflict to contentment. You can state your needs and prove your worth convincingly because others believe what you say while stable Saturn harmoniously trines messenger Mercury. It may be difficult at times to focus on the necessary details, but you're capable of overcoming your tendency to scatter your attention by consciously listening and speaking clearly to avoid wasting time and energy. Communication is a two-way street."
aries,2016-07-19,"Although you know what you want and have a simple plan to get it, your energy is drawn toward strengthening family relationships now, delaying your professional success. The aspiring Capricorn Full Moon in your 10th House of Career could trigger a work-related crisis that pushes you to recognize the need for self-discipline. Although you might be confused by conflicting demands on your time, your persistence will pay off in the long run. Ironically, attending to your personal needs makes everything in the outer world more manageable."
taurus,2016-07-19,"You are proud of your realistic goals and are more driven now than ever to achieve them. The calculating Capricorn Full Moon spotlights your 9th House of Big Ideas, revealing sensible ways to reach your destination. Nevertheless, your overly practical nature can fill you with doubts about the feasibility of your grand plans. The contrast between the real and the ideal is palpable today. Cultivate your dreams by doing the hard work necessary to make them come true."
gemini,2016-07-19,"You're ready to risk your comfort by confronting a deep emotional issue now. Clarifying what you want from others enables you to advance your personal and professional interests as the Capricorn Full Moon illuminates your 8th House of Shared Resources. Although your imagination is a powerful tool that helps you achieve success, it can also color your communication with misleading emotions. Concentrate your energy where it counts most in order to enhance your self-worth and increase your net worth at the same time."
cancer,2016-07-19,"You may be painfully aware of the feelings you normally suppress to maintain the harmony of personal and business relationships. The goal-oriented Capricorn Full Moon falls in your 7th House of Partnerships, reflecting your desire for emotional stability. Unfortunately, you might feel as if you have reached an impasse. Something needs to give, for you can't sustain old illusions any longer. You have seen the truth;  respond to the situation by taking decisive action now before the opportunity slips through your fingers."
leo,2016-07-19,"It's time to come back down to earth and take concrete steps to upgrade your life. You don't have to conquer the world; just add some constructive order to it as the responsible Capricorn Full Moon lands in your 6th House of Daily Routine. Practicing self-discipline on a small scale allows the larger pieces to fall into place. Methodically focusing on one thing at a time is the most efficient way to complete your tasks. Remember, it's the tiniest details that add up to the biggest picture."
virgo,2016-07-19,"Uncertainty is hanging in the air while the crafty Capricorn Moon overwhelms your 5th House of Love and Play. Emotions are revealed that test the boundaries separating a romance from a friendship. Unfortunately, your rational faculties might not be up to your exacting standards today, creating a short lapse of sound judgment. Don't take any unnecessary risks unless you have carefully weighed the consequences. Better safe than sorry when it comes to matters of the heart."
libra,2016-07-19,"You may be pulled between the pleasure of being with others and the need for quiet time by yourself. The ambitious Capricorn Full Moon lights up your 4th House of Roots, stirring an urge to take on new challenges. Vivid memories of parental advice can propel you along with their high expectations or hold you back with their fears. However, self-doubt is not a signal to curtail your aspirations; instead, your insecurities show you where you need to apply more effort to get ahead."
scorpio,2016-07-19,"A trivial thought can grow to grandiose proportions today, so be watchful for a loss of perspective as you turn molehills into mountains. Although your passions are stretched to extremes by the rational Capricorn Moon opposite the emotional Cancer Sun, an all-or-nothing approach to relationships might not serve your best interests now. It's much more advantageous to try to find a middle ground. The Full Moon brightens your 3rd House of Communication, making enlightened compromise a sign of inner strength and not outer weakness."
sagittarius,2016-07-19,"Navigating murky emotional waters isn't your favorite activity, yet the vulnerability it can trigger now improves strategic alliances. A power struggle over fiscal control could create unexpected stress in a relationship; money matters may erupt when the responsible Capricorn Full Moon emphasizes your 2nd House of Resources. Wishing things were better is not a financial plan. Commit to stabilizing your cash flow and patiently cultivate your talents to set yourself on a firmer foundation."
capricorn,2016-07-19,"You are driven to establish a healthier balance between your outer professional life and your inner emotional world now. The Capricorn Full Moon occurs in your 1st House of Personality, urging you to get in better shape and consider updating your appearance. Although your relationship life may be complex, you can still set your heart on a destination and, with a little help from the cosmos, figure out the best way to get there. Even if a lucky break doesn't turn out to be all you want, pursuing it with gusto could teach you a valuable lesson for the next opportunity."
aquarius,2016-07-19,"You can cling to your vision of a better future while still fulfilling your promises. The reliable Capricorn Full Moon is a reminder that you must honor your commitments prior to indulging your fantasies. This Full Moon energizes your 12th House of Secrets and can put you in touch with a practical side of your spirituality that you may have set aside. As Sufi poet Rumi wrote, ""The door is wide and open; do not go back to sleep!"""
pisces,2016-07-19,"You are driven to stabilize your relationship with your local tribe or community today. The sobering Capricorn Full Moon casts its light in your 11th House of Groups and Friends, making it clear how much is expected of you as a member of the team. Open your eyes to see where you truly stand with your peers. Notice people who take more than they give and then start to change the equation in order to make it more balanced. However, don't forget to offer plenty of words of appreciation for those who support you behind the scenes."
aries,2016-07-20,"There is no question about it -- you are a force to be reckoned with in the department of love today. Venus gives you the gift of heightened charm while her proud trine to taskmaster Saturn tempers your behavior with deliberate actions. However, your lack of motivation could be a problem as your present comfort zone creates a temporary bubble of safety around you. Nevertheless, initiating a discussion on a sensitive topic strengthens a relationship. It's smarter to build stability in calm seas than to wait for the next storm to hit."
taurus,2016-07-20,"Your interactions with others are so smooth today that you can charm your way into someone's heart. Luckily, your ability to approach new relationships with both vitality and responsibility enhances your personal life. Your impulse to create art, establish a new enterprise or organize a social event can infuse you with an enduring passion. Whatever attracts you now becomes part of you, bringing lasting pleasure and well-earned respect."
gemini,2016-07-20,"You may feel as lucky as a four-leaf clover today, and you won't even have to kiss a leprechaun to make your dreams come true. However, you must move the energy out of your head and into your body. Treat yourself to a therapeutic massage, go out for an evening of dancing or tell that special person how much you care. But don't just drift through the day; make well-defined plans and commit to them. Ultimately, you will be judged by your actions, not your intentions."
cancer,2016-07-20,"You may not set the world on fire with the heat of your passion today, but you can reliably keep the love light burning on a very low flame. Although romantic Venus is traveling though playful Leo, somber Saturn places a more serious spin on things. Relying on common sense works effectively now as you establish the authority needed to further your personal or professional goals. But don't waste time looking for immediate gratification; passing pleasures can't hold a candle to the enduring connection that comes from mutually earned respect and admiration."
leo,2016-07-20,"Deepening a current relationship makes much more sense now than running off to initiate a new one. Loyalty becomes more important than frivolity when friendly Venus in your flirtatious sign is subdued by stern Saturn. It's best to work closely with someone else to establish priorities and then focus on one subject at a time. Avoid leading anyone on with your good intentions. People's expectations could become burdensome when your need for freedom grows. As Abraham Lincoln said, ""Commitment is what transforms a promise into reality."""
virgo,2016-07-20,"You wish you could perform your everyday tasks differently today because the old ways seem tiresome and inefficient. Although the quirky Aquarius Moon may steer you away from emotional intensity, attractive Venus harmonizes with realistic Saturn to bring you a reasonable attitude about love. Impulsive behavior can create problems so you really must lay the groundwork before rushing into a major project. Move slowly and surely toward that which makes you happy."
libra,2016-07-20,"Normally, your high tolerance for ambiguity enables you to maintain your composure when the universe sends you mixed signals. However, you have no time for indecision while a Venus-Saturn trine offers you the opportunity to strengthen an existing relationship. Breathe deeply and consider your options, for conscious action will bring better results now than recklessness. Remember, there's no need to hurry; change will continue to happen at just the right speed if you let it."
scorpio,2016-07-20,"You are super-productive and extra-efficient today, especially when it comes to making money. However, you may be so self-sufficient that working with others is not on your radar now. Establishing trust is essential while loving Venus harmonizes with accountable Saturn. Supportive relationships should flow easily now if you share a common goal. But throwing in the towel is not a wise strategy, even if the going gets tough. Don't lose a diamond while chasing glitter."
sagittarius,2016-07-20,"You are free to create new goals now as long as they are on the practical side of the fence. Fortunately, a methodical approach enables you to turn your big ideas into reality. Don't be afraid to ruthlessly narrow your focus today, because eliminating extraneous activities is a key to your success. Be wary of getting bogged down in the minutiae; details and distractions will only disrupt the inevitable learning that ultimately is meant to expand your world."
capricorn,2016-07-20,"Climbing the ladder of success leaves you feeling empty today. You are intent on finding personal enjoyment, but even a wonderful experience must be part of a larger package that also includes a heart connection. Unfortunately, your unflappable sense of determination puts your emotional desires in direct conflict with your goals. Ultimately, you can find the money and love you seek as long as you avoid getting swept up in the urgency of the moment. Never underestimate the power of persistence."
aquarius,2016-07-20,"You can turn your creativity and charm into professional assets today as resourceful Venus forms a superconductive trine with productive Saturn. Luckily, you could use your charisma to graciously guide people where you want them to go without stirring up any resistance. You might be pleasantly surprised at how simple the process is and how well it all turns out. Nevertheless, it's also tempting to take the easy way out and do nothing at all. As Pablo Picasso said, ""Action is the fundamental key to success."""
pisces,2016-07-20,"You may be overly protective of someone at work today. Unfortunately, distinguishing your feelings from those of others around you can be tricky until you draw clear boundaries. You are receiving support from the cosmos that gives you inner resolve now when you need it. Your strength of purpose empowers you to secure a safe haven for you and your friends. Remember, you won't be swept away by any drama that isn't yours if you firmly hold onto your center."
aries,2016-07-21,"Sometimes you're unable to just power your way through a difficult situation, even though you might try anyway. However, knowing when to hold and when to fold could turn your day around. Prematurely walking away reduces the immediate pressure, but doesn't resolve the underlying cause. Stay where you are, even if it's uncomfortable. You can find brilliant solutions beneath the current stress -- but only if you're willing to engage in the magical process of transformation."
taurus,2016-07-21,"You might wish you could become a hermit for the day -- but you can't. Although you may be confused about your role in a group activity, you don't really want to push your friends away; you just hope the emotional drama will disappear without your involvement. However, interacting with others is also a major source of inspiration now and you count on your social network to support you when you need it. Fortunately, a solution isn't required yet. Surprisingly, the tension begins to dissipate once you accept the temporary uncertainty and go with the flow."
gemini,2016-07-21,"You can talk your way in and out of problems today, but it's no fun to be in a nearly constant state of stress. Steer clear of heavy fog instead of swinging into motion after you're already in trouble. In other worlds, don't drive if you can't see the road in front of you. It's better to slow down or even stop than to create a dangerous situation. There's nothing to prove to anyone now. Nevertheless, once your clarity returns, be ready to hit the gas and make up for lost time."
cancer,2016-07-21,"You know you are at a turning point yet you can't imagine what might be around the next corner. The nurturing Cancer Sun has encouraged you to reconnect with those you love. But soon everything is about to change and you cannot stay in the nest just because it feels safe and cozy. The problem is you may not have a clue as to where you're going next. Nevertheless, you must spread your wings and fly. Thankfully, the notion of leaving home is worse than the actual deed. Fear looks, faith jumps."
leo,2016-07-21,"There is no time to waste since your show is about to start when the radiant Sun enters your expressive sign tomorrow. However, you were more certain about your relationship status last week than you are today. Don't make any sudden moves yet because, most likely, very little has changed in the basic interpersonal dynamics. You will be happily surprised when the sky clears and you wake up with the sunshine on your face."
virgo,2016-07-21,"You're ready to shake up the status quo, but you're worried about making changes that actually set you back. The truth is that your judgment may be slightly off today and your less-than-critical thinking could prompt you to make a bad decision. Don't assume that your new method is an improvement just because you can see the results you want in your mind's eye. Continue to explore the possibilities now without committing to any one path."
libra,2016-07-21,"You crave more freedom in a relationship now and are considering bringing the subject up in a conversation. Unfortunately, a discussion may not follow your ideal script today; the more you talk, the more elusive the truth. However, avoiding the subject won't further your cause. Rather than announcing to your partner what doesn't work for you, focus on what does. Any forward movement is healthy as long as you allow nature to follow her own course. Planting a seed is more effective than trying to prematurely harvest the entire crop."
scorpio,2016-07-21,"You might be stuck between a rock and a hard place today with no apparent way out. But your current dilemma is likely of your own making, especially if you're holding onto the past too tightly. There's a wave of new energy heading your way, but you must be ready to receive it. Letting go of old feelings makes room for new ones. Joseph Campbell wrote, ""The cave you fear to enter holds the treasure that you seek."""
sagittarius,2016-07-21,"Your friends are willing to put up with your idiosyncrasies because they know how brilliant you are when you're on a roll. But you can't get away with pretending to be so certain of the future if you've come untethered in the present. Instead of pushing your relationships further and further off the deep end, bring your feelings back to the here and now. You can travel anywhere in your imagination once your feet are solidly on the ground."
capricorn,2016-07-21,"You sound like you're expressing yourself on a profoundly deep level today, but your words may stir up more confusion than resolution. It's not necessarily your intention to mislead anyone, but language is more like a smokescreen now that obscures reality rather than exposing it. Unfortunately, you might believe you're getting your message across when nothing could be further from the truth. As Confucius said, ""Silence is a true friend that never betrays."""
aquarius,2016-07-21,"Although people may be exceptionally nice to you now, their current motives are not fully transparent. On one hand, you can just accept someone's good deed without asking any questions. Or you might fearfully reject an individual's honorable behavior without waiting to learn your assumptions were wrong. Jumping to conclusions is dangerous today. Your mind is powerful, yet it will steer you wrong unless you take the time to exercise your brain."
pisces,2016-07-21,"Your anger could bubble to the surface now, creating a little mess you will need to clean up. One simple emotional outburst won't fix anything; in fact, it could send you in a wrong direction, especially if you're looking for love, truth and beauty in all the wrong places. Observe your inner processes while you can still see them. So many things are about to change and what was easily visible today could vanish by tomorrow. As Lao Tzu wrote, ""He who knows himself is enlightened."""
aries,2016-07-22,"Contradictions abound as you're torn between hiding your feelings now and throwing caution to the wind. On one hand, the Moon's visit to your 12th House of Invisibility reflects your need to retreat into the unseen reaches of your imagination. On the other hand, the Sun's shift into lively Leo and your 5th House of Spontaneity motivates you to open your heart as wide as you can. Don't worry if you choose to bury your head in the sand today. There will be plenty of time to come out and play in the days ahead."
taurus,2016-07-22,"You're quite intuitive when it comes to social interactions today and you are willing to meet people more than halfway. You can postpone your agenda, tune into the needs of others and work toward the common good. However, your connection with your inner sense of purpose remains strong, even if it conflicts with your outer behavior. Holding both perspectives is a challenge but is well worth the effort. The best way to multiply your happiness is to share it."
gemini,2016-07-22,Communication is almost always a top priority for you chatty Twins but getting your message across is not enough today. You want everyone to see you in motion so you can be recognized for what you do. You may even go out of your way to put on such a memorable performance that you transform yourself into a caricature. Don't focus on how others might perceive you; just show up as the best version of you that you can muster up. An original is worth more than a copy.
cancer,2016-07-22,"You need to work behind the scenes today so your insecurities can dissipate before they mess up a relationship of interest. Although you may be living in your fantasies, the real world seems too far away from your ideal situation. Don't lose faith; a pinch of hope is the cosmic superglue that holds the future together. Remember when Cinderella sang, ""A dream is a wish your heart makes when you're fast asleep."""
leo,2016-07-22,"Voices of ancestors are whispering in your ear today and your subconscious mind is activated by unseen forces. Unfortunately, all this psychic activity can be quite distracting as you try to go about your day in the mundane world. Luckily, the Sun's return to animated Leo and your 1st House of Self boosts your energy and motivates you to complete whatever you start. Keep your eyes on the finish line until you reach your destination."
virgo,2016-07-22,"The more answers you seek today, the more questions you have. People around you seem to harbor bigger dreams than ever once the surreal Pisces Moon enters your 7th House of Others. However, you are clinging to a few fantasies of your own and might be unwilling to let them go. Don't hide your desires; the sooner you share them with those you trust, the more help you will receive. Teamwork divides the task and multiplies the success."
libra,2016-07-22,"An increasing number of social commitments begins to infringe on your personal time. Nevertheless, you're a champion at balancing your needs with others and happily enter the complicated dance by taking everyone's interests into consideration now. Establish your work pattern early in the day and stick to it. Your performance may require extra energy today, but finding your mojo and expressing it is the ticket to your current happiness."
scorpio,2016-07-22,"You might not be able to separate your work from your creative pursuits today. Everything you do has the potential to be thoroughly enjoyable but you are driven to reach for a higher goal. If promotions or salary increases are not likely, it may be time to widen your choices and think about other options. But contemplating the possibilities is not the same as pursuing them. For now, don't make any choices you cannot undo. The wheels are still in spin and your world is still in motion."
sagittarius,2016-07-22,"You're not sure how to proceed on the home front, especially if you're running into walls every which way you turn. Although you might use techniques of creative visualization to break through the restraints, you have trouble knowing when to stop. Don't wait until you've gone too far. Pare back your plans and make time to put up your feet. As Carolyn Myss writes, ""The soul always knows what to do to heal itself; the challenge is to silence the mind."""
capricorn,2016-07-22,"Your intentions are not as straightforward once the Moon enters the murky waters of Pisces today. You might even feel as if you've lost your way, but this is just a temporary state of affairs because you gain momentum from the Sun's shift into bold Leo and your 8th House of Transformation. You can't keep things as they are; something needs to change. Once you release your hold on the status quo, the skies will begin to clear and the path ahead will be easier to follow."
aquarius,2016-07-22,"It's not much fun when the Moon drifts through spacey Pisces today, unless you relinquish power and stop trying to figure everything out. You don't possess all the answers now, yet the potential for growth is greater than ever while the willful Sun transits through your 7th House of Partners this month. You might not have the clarity you need to make an important decision, but solutions begin to show up when other people get involved. Many hands make light work."
pisces,2016-07-22,"Your current bout with indecision might hit too close to home as the emotional Moon returns to your changeable sign today. Your moods are swinging so fast that it's nearly impossible to keep up with them now. Don't even try; give yourself permission to let your feelings run with the wolves. In the meanwhile, focus all your attention on specific projects at work. Balance these two approaches for your best chance at finding answers that make sense."
aries,2016-07-23,"You can get carried away with your desire to retreat from the world today. Perhaps you thought you could just slip away and no one would notice, but it's not going to be that easy. Nevertheless, a little advanced planning goes a long way to making your wish come true. Dividing your time between living in the real world and attending to your creative or spiritual needs is a small price to pay. Thankfully, if you're not totally unrealistic about how long you can avoid reality, you might successfully pull off your disappearing act without any dire consequences."
taurus,2016-07-23,"A long-overdue home improvement project may take you on a surprising journey today. You might think that a few hours will be sufficient to spruce up a room or tend to the garden but one thing leads to another and you're in over your head before you know it. Instead of losing confidence in your ability to plan ahead, just do what you can now without trying to finish everything in one day. A new burst of creative energy tomorrow will carry you through completion. If you feel like quitting, just remind yourself why you started in the first place."
gemini,2016-07-23,"Plans for taking charge of your life sound good on paper, but could run into trouble in the real world. Thankfully, you're not receiving much resistance from others now; instead, you might be struggling to direct your energy toward your goals when there are so many other pleasurable distractions. Don't get caught up in trying to measure your progress today. As Einstein said, ""Not everything that counts can be counted."""
cancer,2016-07-23,"Your dreams seem more important than your real life today, but getting lost in a fantasy can lead to a plethora of problems. Nevertheless, it's a delicate balance that could have a positive influence on your life if your imagination also motivates you to take action. There's nothing wrong with thinking about taking a fantastic vacation if it inspires you to work harder to make the money to pay for it. Using your vision to fuel your drive for success is admirable but falling victim to a delusion is not."
leo,2016-07-23,You are the epitome of the roaring Lion today as you face your day with indefatigable optimism. You are proudly in your element and believe you can overcome any obstacle that comes your way. But you might overdo your positive thinking with buoyant Jupiter in the picture. Don't spread yourself so thin that you fall short on those tasks that should be a piece of cake. Maintaining a healthy perspective now makes the difference between failure and success.
virgo,2016-07-23,"You might be quite attached to your idea of perfection today, especially when romantic fantasies are involved. However, you're not likely to share your secret dreams with anyone else, so they won't have much of a chance of becoming real. Opening your heart is tricky business since a rejection could send you into an emotional tailspin now. Nevertheless, you may be pleasantly surprised when someone you like responds with a positive reaction. Displaying your vulnerability is a gamble, but well worth it if it brings you closer to your goals. You're always going to miss your chance if you never take a risk."
libra,2016-07-23,"You head into the day expecting one thing and then before you know it, find yourself on the road to somewhere else. You might not have the peace and quiet you want now, but the enjoyment you glean from your social connections is compelling. Don't fight against the currents that pull you out into the world today. Although they are a temporary distraction, your life will be enriched by the people you encounter. Balancing expectations with reality is an ongoing dance, but one that serves you well in the long run."
scorpio,2016-07-23,"Your theme song today could be the Beatles' ""Good Day Sunshine."" You can barely contain your enthusiasm for an upcoming special event. Or, you might be happily anticipating fun activities involving friends or family. Just remember that the unobscured Sun casts shadows and the brightness makes it hard to see what lurks in the darkness. Nevertheless, there's no need to fear the shade; it just means that you are standing in the light."
sagittarius,2016-07-23,"You may be looking forward to a wonderful adventure today that places you in the public eye. Or, perhaps people will see you in a new light as the spiritual Pisces Moon reflects the optimism of joyful Jupiter in your 10th House of Status. Either way, you can satisfy a long-standing fantasy if you don't get carried away by the potential of your own dreams. Keeping facts separate from fantasy enables you to fully enjoy your current experience without being disappointed if it falls short of your expectations."
capricorn,2016-07-23,"You are a bit lighter on your feet today and a little happier in your heart. It's as if you have traveled a bumpy road and are now ready for a brand new path. But even if the current trials are not quite over, you're already planning your next move forward. Don't let recent history hold you back. There may be a few more days of transition, but it's time to look away from the past and keep your eyes fully focused on the future. Hope anchors the soul."
aquarius,2016-07-23,"You might feel as if reality cannot stand between you and success now. You're not in denial about your current financial or relationship circumstances. It's just that you believe in yourself so thoroughly that you're eager to show the world what you can do. The power of positive thought is an amazing tool, but don't let your blind optimism lead you into a trap. Continue to weigh the pros and cons, even when everything is coming up roses. Keeping it real is your ticket to success."
pisces,2016-07-23,"Dreams overflow the sleep barrier now, challenging you to remain objective in the light of day. Fortunately, you may be able to happily dance on the edge between reality and illusion without anyone taking you to task. You might not need to fully wake up yet while your imagination joyfully colors your world with rainbows. There's no reason for concern; you can hold onto today's happy memories when the mundane world reasserts its dominance tomorrow."
aries,2016-07-24,"It may be a day of rest for some folks, but not likely for you. You probably have one too many items already on your list of things to do and you can't wait to get started. Hopefully, you will find time to express your creativity because there's so much on your mind and you want others to share your experience. Fortunately, the timing is perfect for telling a secret or two, even if your disclosure creates waves. You never know who you might inspire when you reveal what's in your heart."
taurus,2016-07-24,"Lights are changing to green and you're itching to stomp down on the gas pedal wherever you are going. However, it's hard to know whether you're driven to succeed or simply motivated to enjoy yourself. Usually, there's a clear difference but now the two divergent paths travel along side by side. Luckily, you can race ahead for a little while without needing to choose your destination just yet. The trouble is you think you have plenty of time until it runs out; he who hesitates is lost."
gemini,2016-07-24,"There might not be much downtime on your schedule today, but that's exactly how you like it. The pace of life is quickening and the Moon's shift into the 11th House of Friends opens the door to a variety of social activities. Losing yourself in the crowd brings relief because you don't have to figure everything out for everyone. However, you grow restless throughout the day and long for some quality one-on-one time with a close friend. As educator Stephen Covey says, ""Don't prioritize your schedule, schedule your priorities."""
cancer,2016-07-24,"You're expected to take over a floundering project today, even if it's grown in complexity in recent days. In fact, your future was quiet and manageable until someone started to play the what-if game in real life, expanding all the possibilities in your mind. You may be uncharacteristically intrigued by so many choices and wish you could choose them all. Thankfully, you can quickly pick the best direction when the time is right if you're willing to listen to your intuition."
leo,2016-07-24,"Chalk up another day of unstoppable summer Sun and Games. Although you might believe it's as good as it gets while bright Sol blasts the Earth with his warm rays, it's all too easy to let the day go by without actively converting your dreams into reality. Your feelings grow more complicated as time wears on, leaving you less certain about the direction you are actually heading. Fortunately, as novelist Margaret Atwood wrote, ""When nothing is sure, everything is possible."""
virgo,2016-07-24,"Although you have energy to spare as the astrological element of fire burns brighter, you may not be very motivated to do much of anything now. In fact, you might even need to seek solace as the emotional Moon in your 8th House of Deep Sharing harmonizes with the Sun in your 12th House of Secrets. You have your feelings tucked away and locked up under surveillance. Contrary to your first inclination, take the time to talk about your needs and your fears with someone you trust. Remember, discomfort is not your final destination, even if it's a stop along the way."
libra,2016-07-24,"Your perfect day includes plenty of time to relax with friends while sharing your thoughts about life, love and the pursuit of happiness. Luckily, reality will likely grant your wish while the Moon trines the playful Leo Sun in your 11th House of Social Networks. However, you can upset some of your peers when you talk about your feelings today without regard for theirs. No matter what you think, say what is right and not what is easy."
scorpio,2016-07-24,"The atmosphere continues to lighten and your heart forges ahead inch by inch in its attempts to connect with others. Ram Dass said that living on Earth requires us to keep our hearts open in Hell. Most often, love is followed by the pain of separation, disappointment or disillusionment. Nevertheless, the alternative is to close down and alienate yourself from everyone. Given this deeper understanding, your choice is a simple one that only you can make."
sagittarius,2016-07-24,"Your mind is like the sea that has washed over the tide wall and your thoughts are breaking the molds of containment. Although it feels as if nothing can stop you now, your confidence borders on denial. It's a bad idea to disregard the laws of the road or the rules of engagement today. But you might feel even freer once you agree to color within the lines. Ironically, sometimes the right constraints grant you the independence you seek."
capricorn,2016-07-24,"Your newly found optimism might run into a roadblock today as charming Venus is overwhelmed by the power of ruthless Pluto in your sign. You are acutely aware of the fact that your serious style of love doesn't always play well to your audience. You might try a more lighthearted approach now, but others see right through your feeble attempts at camouflage. Throw in the towel of resistance; just be real and let the chips fall where they may."
aquarius,2016-07-24,"Your objective perspective enables you to remain enthusiastic about the future. But, you also carry the weight of responsibility on your shoulders, and know enough to restrain your expression now if it borders on anything controversial. Meanwhile, a close friend or partner turns the tables on you by revealing his or her feelings today. You might want to run for the hills, but avoidance is not a wise strategy. The only way to escape from your current problem is to solve it once and for all."
pisces,2016-07-24,"You aren't sure that your personal contribution adds much to the grand scheme of things today. But magic isn't always obvious, even to those who practice it. Don't let your intentions waver, for they set the stage for your future. Your individual actions are part of a larger plan that might not come together until midweek. There's no need to rush anything now; even in fairy tales, the happily-ever-after occurs on the last page."
aries,2016-07-25,"Excess and self-indulgence entice you to risk stability in search of pleasure today. Three planets, including sensual Venus, are camped out in your 5th House of Love, urging you to express your romantic needs. Unfortunately, you might fall victim to your own excitement and share more than you intend. Your enthusiasm prompts others to expect even more from you, which could eventually lead to disappointment, unless you follow through with your promises. Be safe and stick to the script."
taurus,2016-07-25,"You face complicated issues with a playful sense of humor that makes it easy to turn a loss into a gain. However, you can still see the dark side of things -- perhaps even imagining the worst -- yet a Grand Fire Trine reveals a great potential for happiness. But don't get bogged down in doubt; let go of someone or something important if you must. Doing so makes room for even better experiences to fill in the gap. A head full of fears has no space for dreams."
gemini,2016-07-25,"Your nerves are on edge now and you're ready to seize the moment as it arrives. However, anxiety and frustration can catalyze a sudden shift of energy. Nevertheless, today's Grand Trine activates your social life, motivating you to go out of your way to interact with others at work and play. Developing new communication skills is easy once you recognize its importance in bringing happiness back into your life. A caring heart that listens is more valuable than an intelligent mind that talks."
cancer,2016-07-25,"Ironically, you can push others to their limits without appearing pushy today. Adopting a gentler approach increases your sensitivity and enables you to address difficult issues with compassion. Collaborating with your colleagues makes it easier to pursue mutual dreams. But communication needs to flow both ways for everyone to benefit. Although you're ready for change now, even the most brilliant strategy will require time to manifest the results you seek."
leo,2016-07-25,"You can charm your way into nearly anyone's heart today, but you may overstep your bounds without even realizing it. Although the Moon's presence in your 9th House of Big Ideas is inflationary all by itself, trines to Venus and Mercury enable you to sweet talk your way out of trouble. Nevertheless, you might try to shatter the social conventions that normally restrain you. Tread lightly now; your unconventional ideas could create a mess you'll be busy cleaning up over the days ahead."
virgo,2016-07-25,"Analysis comes easy to you Virgos, empowering you to make a particularly smart decision today. However, brainy Mercury can lead you down a confusing path if you're under pressure to make an immediate choice, especially if others are depending on your powers of discernment. Eliminate unrealistic alternatives when trying to make up your mind. Nevertheless, entertain every sensible possibility on its own merit as it appears. In all likelihood, you already know the truth."
libra,2016-07-25,"Cultivating close connections is complicated today because you're following your feelings down two entirely different tracks. On one hand, you can get along with others better than ever. On the other hand, you're itching to surprise everyone with your independent thinking and bold actions. Unfortunately, you might be so far ahead of your time that you must slow down, step back and rethink your strategy to bring your ideas to life. Focus on collaboration instead of competition for the best results."
scorpio,2016-07-25,"You can feel the cosmic equilibrium today, even if there are disturbances to the force. The Moon's square to tough-guy Pluto agitates a conflict between you and someone who may oppose your plan. Later in the evening, the Moon runs into reckless Uranus, encouraging you to push everyone out of their comfort zone. Battles for control and a desire for freedom can undermine cooperation. If you find a compromise is impossible now, walk away from the disagreement before it escalates into a fight. A moment of silence saves you from a lifetime of regret."
sagittarius,2016-07-25,You are hungry for new experiences and find yourself taking chances in pursuit of a good time. You are compelled to express your feelings in more dramatic ways now thanks to an alignment of the Moon in your 5th House of Play to affectionate Venus and curious Mercury in your 9th House of Getaways. Romantic feelings may be aroused when you push past personal limits and explore unfamiliar territory. Proceed on the side of caution when someone's heart is on the line.
capricorn,2016-07-25,"You're convinced you have to take charge today or you'll completely lose control when a Grand Fire Trine zaps three planets in your 8th House of Transformation. Fortunately, you should have no difficulty sharing power and cooperating on a profound level as long as there's time to gradually let down your guard. Once you notice the little improvements that are occurring around you, making a giant leap forward will seem as simple as taking another small step."
aquarius,2016-07-25,"Your thinking could be so far out on the ledge today that people believe you might be losing touch with reality. It's entirely possible that your ideas are too radical to be understood. Nervous energy and intellectual restlessness is high as cerebral Mercury forms a creative aspect with evolutionary Pluto. Concentration is difficult when the flow of information is constantly interrupted. Nevertheless, exciting discoveries offer unexpected answers and foster surprising new connections if you can relax enough to stay flexible."
pisces,2016-07-25,"Your playful mood and creative approach to relationships make you a skillful collaborator today. You're feeling quite popular now as the spontaneous Aries Moon trines flirty Venus in expressive Leo. This yummy cosmic combination magnifies your desirability, making you more successful at getting what you want from others. Passion expressed with patience is a winning formula; know what you want and pursue it at your own pace."
aries,2016-07-26,"Although you normally enjoy the excitement of the adrenaline rush, you're thankful when the energy settles down a notch today. But the stress isn't quite over yet, even if you're dealing with more mundane issues now. You could tighten up with fear because you probably don't want to accept impractical solutions. Nevertheless, your obstinacy may not be enough to stop radical ideas from crashing through into your awareness. Resist less; move more."
taurus,2016-07-26,"It's not wise to become overly comfortable with any one emotional posture today, since a process of change will take you through your paces. The Moon's shift into sensible Taurus amplifies your feelings that conflict with your recently established goals. Something must give, and fortunately, a late night rush of inspiration could bring the answers you seek. As author Paulo Coelho writes, ""If you think adventure is dangerous, you should try routine."""
gemini,2016-07-26,"You're not thrilled when the electrical storm that's been stimulating your brain begins to dissipate. However, you're eager to take the intellectual buzz of these past few days and use it to imagine how your future could turn out. But you're not as interested in the practical logistics that lurk close by in the shadows. Try not to fight against your current destiny, even if it contains an overload of calendars and appointments. A late night Mercury-Uranus connection could bring brilliant insights while also keeping you up past your bedtime. True genius never sleeps."
cancer,2016-07-26,"You might finally get the respite you crave as the demands of work begin to settle down today. However, you can't assume that this less hectic pace will last for long. Thankfully, an illuminating Mercury-Uranus trine clears away your uncertainty with one momentary lightning-like flash of awareness. Even after the darkness returns, you'll know exactly what to do. Your epiphany sticks with you once you see the situation in a bright new light."
leo,2016-07-26,"A renewed interest in getting ahead at work grabs your attention today but you're not driven to see results right away. Instead, your strategy is based upon gradual progress as the plodding Taurus Moon enters your 10th House of Career. Nevertheless, a wave of urgency emboldens you to ride high on new ideas as they begin sparking connections in your brain later in the day. Just make sure that your enthusiasm doesn't leave your resources depleted. Let go of the things you can't change while focusing on those you can."
virgo,2016-07-26,"You may spend a fair amount of time today mulling over recent events and trying to determine your next move. However, initiating action is not as high on your priority list as making a concrete plan for the future. Paradoxically, your practicality relaxes your mind, helping you to see the problem from a totally new point of view. A slow and steady approach ends up saving the day with an unexpected solution. A break from your routine offers you the fresh perspective you need."
libra,2016-07-26,"If you've been running at the speed of light, it feels great to be able to slow down and take a few deep breaths. You might even get a bit lazy and try to avoid interacting with others. Although you may downplay your social involvement today, events will continue to vie for your attention until you acquiesce and participate more fully. The good news is that intelligent Mercury's fortunate trine to brilliant Uranus indicates that stepping beyond your comfort zone now will likely bring surprising rewards."
scorpio,2016-07-26,"Following your bliss would be the natural and easy thing to do today if it wasn't for other people's expectations. The demands of a partner or coworker might seem excessive, especially if they hijack your personal agenda. Although you are tempted to lay everything on the line and choose one path over the other, it's wiser to take a less extreme approach until later in the day. Clever thoughts and witty repartee enable you to talk about your dilemma without necessarily upsetting anyone along the way."
sagittarius,2016-07-26,"Although the idea of less involvement with others sounds great today, you might find it challenging to retreat into your private world. Nevertheless, you have a specific list of chores to finish and you don't want to be distracted by everyone else. Thankfully, you can accomplish an amazing amount of work in a very short time if you concentrate on your goals. Mental Mercury's trine to ingenious Uranus in your 5th House of Creativity triggers so much innovative thinking that you will emerge the hero with time left over for rest and relaxation."
capricorn,2016-07-26,"Your ability to filter out extraneous noise makes you an excellent problem solver today. However, you could be pulled into someone else's drama if your boundaries are undefined. Your smartest strategy now is to withdraw from conflict as soon as you see it coming. Signing on the dotted line is best postponed until others are more willing to negotiate. Wait until your intuition grows stronger later in the day and new insights reveal surprisingly simple ways to resolve an existing issue. It is the journey, not the destination, that matters."
aquarius,2016-07-26,"Think clearly, speak slowly and remain patient in order to calmly get your message across today. However, your certainty could be problematic if you're unwilling to listen to the feedback you receive. Fortunately, an inventive Mercury-Uranus trine helps you leap over any obstacles created by your own stubbornness. If you can remain open-minded, effective communication becomes the key to your personal success story."
pisces,2016-07-26,"You could easily overstep your bounds today, defending an indefensible position. Luckily, a crafty Mercury-Uranus trine enables you to smooth ruffled feathers by providing solutions that seem to come out of the blue. Although it might be exhilarating to stretch the limits by provoking others with your unconventional ideas, it's wiser to step back when you get close to the edge of a cliff. Remember, you're most convincing when you calmly address one subject at a time instead of overloading others with too much information. How you deliver your message makes all the difference in the world."
aries,2016-07-27,"You're passionate about helping your friends any way you can today. You might go out of your way to nurse someone who isn't feeling well or attempt to solve a problem for a colleague. However, you must be careful about asserting yourself so vehemently that your behavior seems aggressive without you realizing it. Nevertheless, you can play the role of the Good Samaritan as long as you are sensitive to the needs of others. Be sure that your assistance is wanted before you choose to get involved. Poet T.S. Eliot wrote, ""Most of the evil in this world is done by people with good intentions."""
taurus,2016-07-27,"You could set yourself up for disappointment today by expecting your friends to come to your rescue. It may seem obvious, but your chances of receiving the support you seek are negligible unless you actually ask for help. However, you might make the mistake of assuming that others know you so well that you don't have to say a word; they should just intuitively sense what you need. It's a shame when the things that are on your mind and in your heart never reach your lips. Psychic connections can be real, but it's unfair to blame anyone else if you don't try to bridge the gulf yourself."
gemini,2016-07-27,"Your words have the power to heal today, but they also have the power to hurt as communicator Mercury forms a stressful aspect to vulnerable Chiron. The difference between a positive message and a negative one has less to do with the words you use than it does with your attitude. Although your thoughts are often restless, you can be as steady as a rock now when it comes to setting the agenda for the day. Others rely on you more than you realize when roads are rough and the journey uncertain."
cancer,2016-07-27,"Your listening skills are legendary; it's as if you can find meaning from the momentary silences between the words. The more attentive you are now, the more information you derive from what's not being said. Thankfully, your psychic powers are especially strong today as long as you know when to be quiet and simply observe the energy of others. Remember, you don't have to fill up all the empty spaces with noisy chatter. All you need to do is show up with an open heart; your emotional receptivity allows the universe to do the rest."
leo,2016-07-27,"You might choose to make a big deal about how much you support someone's great idea. However, you're likely to be more judgmental now that the Moon and Venus are locked into an uncomfortable square. Rather than trying to undo a pattern in another person's life, observe your reactions without doing anything drastic yet. Fortunately, you gain strength as the day progresses and you will outgrow your need to fix anyone's problems. Instead, shift your focus back to your own life by finding the determination and energy to make your dreams come true."
virgo,2016-07-27,"You're not completely upfront with your feelings today. You know that there is more going on behind your polite smile than you care to share with anyone. Paradoxically, the less you say, the more people understand you. Some thoughts don't fit into the regular flow of conversation and forcing the subject can do more harm than good. Pick your discussion topics carefully and save the others for a rainy day. In the meantime, keeping the emotional drama to a minimum makes everyone happier now."
libra,2016-07-27,"You may feel a bit confused at work today, making it difficult to set goals and put a long-term plan into action. Even if you are clear about which direction you're heading now, you might wonder if you'll ever achieve success when it comes to your worldly ambitions. Fortunately, as you work on resolving your own issues of self-esteem, you can positively impact others with your willingness to grow and change. Surprisingly, healing yourself turns out to be contagious if you set an example for others to follow."
scorpio,2016-07-27,"Sometimes your creativity flows naturally, but you may experience a mental block when trying to express yourself today. One way to get the energy moving again is to shake up your routine. Approaching your work from an entirely different angle could be the catalyst you need in order to get back in a groove of productivity. Nevertheless, your desire for consistency grows throughout the day and you might choose to return to an earlier method once you've recaptured your sense of spontaneity. Exploring all your options opens your eyes to possibilities you never imagined."
sagittarius,2016-07-27,"Childhood memories could seem so real today that they strangely influence the present moment. You may remember a time when you felt misunderstood or rejected by your family. Although you can't go back and change the past, you can use these recollections to fuel your relationship dynamics now. Instead of approaching an emotional confrontation with a sense of dread, access your compassion to help others resolve their personal pain. It is said that all healing is essentially a release from fear. The light of love conquers the darkness."
capricorn,2016-07-27,"You might have suffered as a youngster because of communication struggles within your family. Even as an adult, you may still contend with issues around cultivating emotional connections with those you love. Although a current misunderstanding could stimulate a cascade of memories, you have a chance to elevate your self-esteem and let go of any old patterns that continue to hold you back. You can't change what has already happened, so focus on the future instead of replaying your past. Author Robert Green Ingersoll said, ""Hope is the only bee that makes honey without flowers."""
aquarius,2016-07-27,"Although you appear quite animated in your interactions with others today, your spirited style might actually be camouflaging a painful issue. Emotional wounds from your childhood may still do a number on your sense of self-worth. Paradoxically, acknowledging your insecurities is a strength rather than a weakness. Sharing your process of self-discovery and healing can inspire others more than you realize. Poet Khalil Gibran wrote, ""Out of suffering have emerged the strongest souls."""
pisces,2016-07-27,"Your drive to become a healer in your own right may be motivated by remembering experiences of rejection. Learning how to assimilate your personal history into your current circumstances is a continuing source of emotional growth. Taking a risk within a relationship now might seem like a daunting task, but you possess a strength of conviction that enables you to tell the story about your wound in a way that helps others. Remember, past failures are often the openings into your best and most beautiful parts if you're willing to explore your vulnerability."
aries,2016-07-28,"A slow start to your work today could lead to never-ending frustration, especially if you have a long list of things to do. Nevertheless, you're spinning your wheels without making much headway and it might even seem as if the harder you try to get traction now, the slower your progress. Fortunately, patience pays off and production that was stalled earlier begins to roll along later in the day. However, your expectations may rise just as fast as your confidence. You can avoid setting yourself up for failure by establishing realistic goals and relying on your sense of humor to provide comic relief along the way."
taurus,2016-07-28,"An emotional conflict early in the day might leave you with unresolved anger later on. You are annoyed with your performance if you freeze in the heat of an argument, leaving important things unsaid. Nevertheless, your perspective on the interaction changes once the Moon shifts from your sign to the adaptable realms of airy Gemini. Although you may nurse hurt feelings for a little while, a fresh breeze blows through your life, enabling you to move on without harboring any ill will. There's no reason to hang onto the past when the future looks so good; there are no regrets in life, just lessons."
gemini,2016-07-28,"You've been hiding in the shadows for too long and are now ready to come out of your shell. Thankfully, your world lightens up once the reflective Moon enters your sign this afternoon. It's as if the storm clouds suddenly disappear, leaving blue sky in every direction. However, dwelling on your feelings today only slows you down. Sometimes you need to stop and listen to your heart, but now it's time for bold action. Adventure awaits and the sooner you step into your future, the shorter your journey will be."
cancer,2016-07-28,"You're slightly uncertain about your next move, even if there appears to be a reward -- monetary or emotional -- heading your way. You are not in such a rush now and may prefer to slow your pace for the sake of simplicity. You assume the good news will still be there when you arrive, even if it takes a few more days to collect on the cosmic goodies. Thankfully, your logic is sound and it might make sense to postpone any major push forward until the Moon reaches your sign on Saturday. According to a Welsh proverb, ""More the hurry, more the obstacles."""
leo,2016-07-28,"It's as if you are in a sailboat trying to reach your destination but the breeze isn't blowing in your direction. Thankfully, a change in the cosmic weather fills your sails today and propels you along your way. But don't assume the winds will remain steady, for the flighty Gemini Moon is capricious in nature. Just as you get accustomed to one feeling, there's another unexpected shift. Fortunately, being prepared for the instability in the air enables you to be more adaptable when plotting your course. Be stubborn about your goals, but flexible about your methods."
virgo,2016-07-28,"Just as you are ready to settle into a wave of stability in your life, another round of changing dynamics requires your undivided attention on the job front. You rather enjoyed the temporary peace and quiet, but now you must respond to the noise as the Moon flies into interactive Gemini and your 10th House of Public Life. It's nearly impossible to retreat to a space where you can simply focus on your work. Treat the distractions as a harmless test of your patience and willpower. Thankfully, annoyance transforms to optimism as the evening approaches and you can see how much you managed to accomplish in spite of everything."
libra,2016-07-28,"After a morning of inner stress or outer disagreements, you're quite happy when the resistance fades and you're back in a groove. It takes quite a bit to push you to the point of fueling a conflict, but you might not be satisfied with the way things are going now. Don't slip into denial; the adage, ""no pain, no gain"" could be your mantra while the Moon is still camped out in obstinate Taurus. Thankfully, your awareness of the current dynamics catalyzes changes later in the day that enable you to regroup and reestablish your center of gravity."
scorpio,2016-07-28,"It might feel as if people are pushing back at your every move. Even your casual comments seem to elicit negative responses from those close to you. Naturally, you prefer support rather than opposition, but it's best if you don't stir the pot needlessly. Happily, the emotional climate changes when the stubborn Taurus Moon enters curious Gemini and your 8th House of Deep Sharing. Paradoxically, your conversations flow easier even as the emotional intensity increases. As George Bernard Shaw wrote, ""The single biggest problem in communication is the illusion that it has taken place."""
sagittarius,2016-07-28,"Your optimism soars on its own wings today, even if there's nothing in your world that changes other than your perspective. Fortunately, your attitude is within your control and when you shift your thinking in a positive direction, everything in the outer world shifts with it. But this is not about ignoring the truth; it's about using your imagination to create a path to a better future. If every thought you think is actively altering your destiny, it's wise to mainly focus on manifesting your dreams."
capricorn,2016-07-28,"Although you may encounter a few stumbling blocks today, your pragmatic outlook and sheer determination empower you to accomplish your goals. But rather than resting on your laurels, you aren't content with your achievements as expansive Jupiter tempts you to set even higher standards. You might not be able to turn off your restless mind when it's seeking new lands to conquer, but you can moderate your ambition with emotional awareness. Reaching for higher ground is admirable, but don't forget to give yourself time to enjoy the fruits of your labor along the way."
aquarius,2016-07-28,"You might realize that you can't avoid confronting a lingering issue head-on today. Your impatience reaches a boiling point as the Moon shifts into fickle Gemini and your 5th House of Self-Expression, compelling you to make your move. It seems as if the main obstacles are now gone. In fact, there's no resistance at all when you speak directly from your heart. But talk is cheap; you must follow up your message with decisive action. As the saying goes, ""Do it today or regret it tomorrow."""
pisces,2016-07-28,"The luxury of reveling in a past accomplishment is over. You must demonstrate to everyone that a recent success was not a fluke or a flash in the pan. But you have more options now than you did before and your next victory or failure will be a result of the path you pick today. Unfortunately, you never know for sure where the road of life will lead. Nevertheless, it's wise to make decisions based upon facts rather than fantasies. You might be free to make certain choices, but you're not free from the consequences of your choice."
aries,2016-07-29,"You might feel like your world has grown larger than life, and significant portions of your creativity are out of your control. However, a period of intense upheaval is already slipping into the past and you need to follow through by initiating changes at work. Extending your spheres of influence could affect your relationships, especially with those in your immediate environment. Ultimately, you may have to play your cards sooner than later and reveal your intentions. If you want something, don't wish for it; life is too short to wait."
taurus,2016-07-29,"You're picking up some very strange signals today that could easily distract you from your goals. You might even think you've become slightly unhinged if you can't make heads or tails out of your current experience, but there's really nothing to worry about at all. Nevertheless, sharing your inner conflicts without expecting anything in exchange is enough to the get the balling rolling in your direction. ""Dream big, start small"" is your motto for success."
gemini,2016-07-29,"It's best to unfold your story gradually today but you're too anxious to share your best-kept secrets. Unfortunately, your spontaneous disclosure won't make you feel any better, and might emotionally agitate others in your circle of friends. Nevertheless, initiating a conversation about a subject dear to your heart brings a smile to your face. But it's not enough to steal a moment or two of happiness; you long for a much more meaningful exchange. Don't be afraid to reach back into the recesses of your mind and talk about something that truly matters with someone who truly cares."
cancer,2016-07-29,"The very things that have been blocking your path seem to quickly fade into the past today. Although you might not be ready to swing into action yet, circumstances can force your hand. If someone does something that annoys you now, you won't be able to just sit quietly because you feel the need to even the score immediately. There's nothing wrong with standing up for yourself as long as you take a few minutes to fine-tune your message. Julian Assange writes, ""Every time we witness an injustice and do not act, we train our character to be passive."""
leo,2016-07-29,"A social cause might have you so fired up today that you can't help but jump up on your soapbox and speak out. Sometimes it takes a lot to grab your attention, but you're hooked now and won't be able to move on until you respond to this important issue. However, your straightforward reaction opens a portal into a parallel universe; nothing goes according to your plan. It's understandable if everything gets strange for a while; thankfully, it won't last long. There's no reason to resist the weird energies that are coming to the surface. Live life to express, not impress."
virgo,2016-07-29,"You want to take care of business today, but responsibilities on the home front could interfere with your busy schedule. Rather than sharing your predicament with anyone, you prefer to keep your worries to yourself until you fulfill your commitments. Only after you honor your promises will you feel comfortable discussing your difficulties about your job performance. Nevertheless, you don't have to wait; the sooner you reveal your vulnerability, the faster you'll receive much-needed advice. Share your burden and lighten your load."
libra,2016-07-29,"Relationships with your friends and associates are complicated today because sparks may fly over agendas that are not really in conflict. However, it might seem as if the disagreement is irresolvable until you start to delve deeper. Magnetic Venus receives an intensity booster from potent Pluto that could send you spiraling into the darkness, but this is an unexpected blessing since you could discover a misplaced rainbow. Whatever happens, don't relinquish your power; ultimately, nothing can stand in the way of your truth."
scorpio,2016-07-29,"You may have so much work on your plate now that you just want to escape through the nearest exit. But you're not usually one to run out on something that's unfinished. Nevertheless, you can stir up a hornet's nest if your unexpressed anger gets the best of you. Instead of waiting until it's too late, lay your feelings out on the table. That which is seen is much easier to work with than that which you marginalize or pretend is not there. Although total denial isn't a sensible strategy, be cautious as you open the door to the unknown."
sagittarius,2016-07-29,"You're pushing into new territory these days and you won't be able to continue looking in your rear view mirror for long. Even if you're feeling nostalgic today, you can't just slip into your time machine and dial up powerful experiences from the past. Nevertheless, you can bring old memories forward into the present moment. In the final analysis, you have a chance to rewrite your personal story in a way that positively impacts your future. Thankfully, once you're aware of your own history, you're blessed with the opportunity to change it."
capricorn,2016-07-29,"You have many little tasks to do today and you're not sure how you will get them all done. However, you can accomplish a lot in a very small amount of time if you put your heart and soul into your work. You grow motivated to find answers to larger questions about your life as you watch your friends sink deeper into Pluto's mysterious realms. There's no logical reason to fear the unknown, but then again, you're required to leave your rational thoughts behind. As Albert Einstein said, ""Logic will get you from A to B. Imagination will take you everywhere."""
aquarius,2016-07-29,"A relationship at work grows messy today as someone stops walking their talk. You don't know whether or not to trust the words you hear, or to only pay attention to their actions. Unfortunately, cerebral Mercury dynamically squares warrior Mars, bending you out of shape and reminding you to be prepared for anything you might face. You're primed to do something you will regret unless you move through the day with great intention. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of care."
pisces,2016-07-29,"You may have plenty to do at home today, but your job duties must come first. Thankfully, you are particularly adept at juggling all the components of your life now. Although you might want to do everything at once, the only way you'll get through the day with flying colors is to make a detailed list of exactly what you want to accomplish. Narrowing your attention is an absolute must. The more you focus on your priorities, the greater your chances of finishing everything in a timely manner."
aries,2016-07-30,Sticking with your original intention might be tricky today as rationality overpowers your feelings. Flying by the seat of your pants usually gives you the ability to make the most of the changing circumstances because you can modify your plans on a moment's notice. But you can't get away with cavalier behavior now and must commit to a specific schedule. Stop resisting the inevitable; practicing self-discipline is for your own good.
taurus,2016-07-30,"You may feel the weight of responsibility lift from your shoulders today, especially if you stop and take a few deep breaths of relief. You are back in your element as mental Mercury shifts into earthy Virgo, emphasizing your natural tendency to be stable and sensible. Although your unexpressed feelings linger, you no longer need to say everything that's on your mind. Those who don't understand your self-restraint will never understand what motivates you to speak."
gemini,2016-07-30,"It seems as if someone has grabbed the controls and is playing with the volume knob in your imagination. You Twins are exceptionally attuned to your key planet Mercury and its entry into Virgo creates a power surge in your brain. Your dilemma is that just because your thinking is louder today, doesn't mean that it's better. You must carefully consider what you say and what you keep to yourself. Sometimes, consciously choosing a little solitude is enough to calm your soul."
cancer,2016-07-30,"You are returning to a familiar place today as Luna cycles back into your sign. Since you Crabs are so attuned to the pull of the Moon, you might be moodier than others now. Although you're quite comfortable with your temporary emotional withdrawal, people may misinterpret your retreat and ask you what's wrong. Let them know that you just need some space to sit with your own feelings, without having to verbalize them to anyone else. As Ram Dass says, ""The quieter you become, the more you can hear."""
leo,2016-07-30,"You may observe that one of your inner voices is muted today as verbose Mercury leaves your sign. Although this exit from lively Leo and entry into timid Virgo won't necessarily have a huge impact on your life, you might not be as quick to express your thoughts. You can derive great benefit now from your newly found ability to filter out the excess noise, both within your own head and what comes out of your mouth. The Dalai Lama reminds us, ""Silence is sometimes the best answer."""
virgo,2016-07-30,"It's time to step out of the shadow and into the light. Consider sharing your thoughts with those close to you, especially if you recently danced around the edges of the truth. Pensive Mercury is busy in your sign until October 7, bringing you a heightened sense of your own analytical process. Use these days wisely to strengthen your logic and research your area of expertise. Learn to politely say no to anything that doesn't fit in with your current trajectory. Setting boundaries is an essential element to self-care."
libra,2016-07-30,"You're inclined to demonstrate your ability to nurture others by performing random acts of kindness. However, your actions may not be fully aligned with your heart today. This gulf between your thoughts and your emotions prompts you to remain unresponsive. Unfortunately, this dilemma can result in unexpressed anger, pouting or even passive-aggressive behavior. As difficult as it sounds, try to keep your true feelings close to the surface, especially around those you trust. Authenticity is your friend."
scorpio,2016-07-30,"It's as if you are awakening from a deep sleep today; your mental clarity seems sharper than it has been in a while. Suddenly, you are thinking more about the future than the present. This is especially true at work, where you can refocus your intentions on longer-range goals, rather than just putting in the hours. Make use of the analytical powers that you now have at your disposal and apply this logic to all walks of your life. As Wayne Dyer wrote, ""Our intention creates our reality."""
sagittarius,2016-07-30,"You are being pulled in two opposing directions now. Your mind is quickly becoming more discriminating and detail oriented, but you still prefer to be thinking about the entire universe. You might grow anxious when you realize that you must concentrate on the minute particulars instead of the global picture. However, if you can focus on your specific role in the community, there will be real payoffs just around the corner. Think cosmically, act locally."
capricorn,2016-07-30,"A major change is occurring in your outlook on life that could positively impact the next couple of months. Since Capricorn is an earth sign, Mercury's current shift into earthy Virgo means you Mountain Goats are receiving an intellectual zap that you can put to good use. You're thinking in a more pragmatic manner, but you may encounter unexpected challenges today. You must continue to widen your perspective or you might end up feeling mentally blocked. It has been said that the mind is like a parachute in that it works best when it is open."
aquarius,2016-07-30,"You can't get away with your typical quirkiness now. However, it's not likely you're going to change overnight. It's just that circumstances are going to keep calling you back to the details you would rather forget. There's no escape; swallow your annoyance with reality and try to get the unpleasant tasks out of the way so you can put your attention toward things of greater interest. Determination and discipline lead to success."
pisces,2016-07-30,"It's a mixed bag for you soft-hearted Fish today. The Moon's shift into watery Cancer enables you to be nourished by the emotional richness that is reentering your life. The problem is there are deep feelings that you are afraid to share now. Fortunately, if you are willing to face your fears straight on, you may just discover that you will accelerate into the future. Your life is an adventure that's waiting to begin, so open your heart and see what happens."
aries,2016-07-31,"You may be hesitant to share your feelings with anyone outside of your family today. Simultaneously, you begin to think about trying something completely different, and this might require you to talk openly about your newfound interests. Unfortunately, you could draw the anger of someone who is intimidated by your defiant behavior. Nevertheless, your radical approach to romance now opens the way for new forms of love. Sometimes you need to rock your world when it comes to matters of the heart."
taurus,2016-07-31,"A high-frequency energy can make you jumpy today and uncertain about the choices ahead. However, you're mostly concerned with the unreliability of other people now. Nevertheless, your key planet Venus harmonizes with wild Uranus, pumping up your potential for pleasure. Don't just act on every crazy feeling; instead cut through all the hype and apply your adrenaline where it will be most productive. Channel your enthusiasm into your art."
gemini,2016-07-31,"You're ready for an out-of-the-box experience today. But rather than knowing what you want to do, you might be open to the unexpected as long as it brings you a thrilling sense of adventure. Nevertheless, you are probably holding onto something or someone from the past while the Moon travels through tenacious Cancer. It's a tricky dance when you're being pulled in two completely different directions, but the rewards are great if you can keep your balance while staying in motion."
cancer,2016-07-31,"You are not restrained by your usual concerns today as adorable Venus aligns with antsy Uranus. Your eccentric tastes seem endearing to others now, allowing you to say whatever you want -- even if it's more than you initially intended to share. Paradoxically, the Moon's current visit to your self-protective sign prompts you to withdraw into the security of your emotional shell. Instead of worrying about what others think, use this time for constructive self-reflection. In Aristotle's words, ""Contemplation is the highest form of activity."""
leo,2016-07-31,"Your nerves are stretched taut today, but feeling on edge can be quite thrilling if a pleasant surprise comes out of the blue. Sassy Venus in your playful sign forms a thrilling trine to experimental Uranus, rapidly replacing yesterday's peace and quiet with new forms of pleasure and unexpectedly delightful connections. The only difference between fear and excitement is your attitude. Free your mind and the fun will follow."
virgo,2016-07-31,"Your uncharacteristic rebellious behavior puts everyone on notice today that you're not willing to play by their arbitrary rules. You're attracted to the unusual as sexy Venus conspires with quirky Uranus in your 8th House of Intimacy. Instead of clinging to past memories, find the exhilaration in recognizing that you are emotionally free to express your true desires in the present moment. You only live once."
libra,2016-07-31,"You want more freedom now than you previously experienced in a relationship. Enchanting Venus trines unorthodox Uranus in your 7th House of Others, suggesting that you can smile through the resistance you encounter in your pursuit of pleasure. Even if you try to minimize your needs, you won't be able to contain yourself for long now. Tell others about your desires while your charisma is charming and disarming. Sometimes you need to rock the boat in order to get what you want."
scorpio,2016-07-31,"You may be able to successfully persuade someone to join your exploration of the unusual today. Your unconventional tastes are blown out of proportion when seductive Venus trines irrepressible Uranus. Although the passive Cancer Moon tempts you to withdraw emotionally, this is a chance to express what you want because your anticipation of breakthrough is greater than your fear of rejection. No risk, no reward."
sagittarius,2016-07-31,"It's tempting to set logic aside while you pursue the fun and frivolous today. Flirty Venus in theatrical Leo prompts you to tell everyone the wishes of your heart. The Planet of Love's smooth trine with rowdy Uranus stirs up irrepressible desires. Your provocative behavior makes you even more intriguing to others now. Luckily, you can have a blast breaking a few social rules without getting into too much trouble. Play safe and there will be no regrets tomorrow."
capricorn,2016-07-31,"Anything is possible in love now, but there may be some stormy weather along the way. Your confidence might suffer but your hard work will bring you the results you desire as shocking Uranus harmoniously trines romantic Venus in your 8th House of Deep Sharing. Don't be discouraged; the resistance you face is really a gift that reveals your current weaknesses. Trust your intuition because your momentary flashes of creative insight will open a portal to the future."
aquarius,2016-07-31,"You are eager to display your affection for a loved one today. However, your attractions are quite unpredictable as vivacious Venus harmonizes with weird Uranus. Potential pleasure tempts you to step beyond your normal limits, offering you an exhilarating and liberating experience. Sensuality and sexuality can be intoxicating, so be sure to treat your feelings and those of your partner with the respect they deserve."
pisces,2016-07-31,"You might try to convince everyone that everything is normal today, but clearly it is not. Although you are usually sensitive when sharing your feelings, you may forget to check in with others now in your haste to make your point. Seeking new ways to express your creativity could lead you to completely shake up your schedule while electric Uranus zaps lovable Venus in your 6th House of Daily Routine. Chaos is your secret key to happiness."
aries,2016-08-01,"There's so much going on in your life now that it's difficult to know where to even begin. The paradox is that you really should be completing unfinished business before you launch any new projects. But if you shirk your commitments, reality will grab your attention fast and you'll be back in the starting gate before you know it. Nevertheless, give yourself permission to be a beginner when you try something for the first time. Your fear of making mistakes is not a valid reason to give up if you're learning along the way. Martial artist Bruce Lee said, ""In great attempts it is glorious even to fail."""
taurus,2016-08-01,"Someone attractive could lure you off your path today, but you can avoid complications with a simple ""No thank you."" Nevertheless, you still might regret something you did yesterday as a result of taking your feelings too far. Actually, everything you do now could have significant ramifications in your life, even if you think it's trivial in the moment. But there's still room for trouble when things are going your way. Stay cool, calm and collected, because your perseverance won't let you down."
gemini,2016-08-01,"You're hesitant to do anything out of the ordinary today while strict Saturn is watching your every move. Normally, you're happy to make new connections and get projects started on your own. Thankfully, the Sun's trine to Saturn in your 7th House of Others also helps you build stability in relationships. Taking a calculated risk makes a great deal of sense since you can open your heart, hopes, and even your wallet without fear of serious loss now. When fears are grounded, dreams take flight."
cancer,2016-08-01,"You're looking to stabilize your routine now and hope to make good progress toward your goals. Your mind is exceptionally well organized and you can accomplish a lot today, even when emotional drama returns in the form of a power struggle. Fortunately, the Sun's smooth trine to ethical Saturn means that your emotional honesty is more important than anything else now. Even if you're tempted to take the easy way out, succumbing to indulgent behavior will only distract you from the work of being yourself. As C.S. Louis wrote, ""Integrity is doing the right thing, even when no one is watching."""
leo,2016-08-01,"Recent decisions that may be shaking your life awake now are reaffirmed by a series of highly positive aspects. Controlling Saturn trines the Sun in your dramatic sign today, enabling you to exhibit restraint, patience and self-discipline. Scattering your forces is fun for a while, but it won't produce the lasting results you desire. Save your best shot for the target you really want to hit."
virgo,2016-08-01,"It feels as if party time is here and you want to pack the most pleasure you can into a short period of time. Romance and fantasy trump reality in a friendly atmosphere where work feels like play. Join others in a collective effort to spruce up a common area or experiment with expressing your creativity on the job. Measurable results will come eventually, but the keyword is fun for now."
libra,2016-08-01,"Your ambivalence doesn't mean that you don't care; it means that you are preoccupied with considering multiple options. You may be coming down from an amazing experience where your mind was operating free of social restraints. But the Sun conspires with restrictive Saturn today, preventing you from acting on your newfound wisdom. This constraint creates a split where your head pulls one way and your heart another. Don't force the issue now, even if you are questioning the status quo. Patience is your greatest teacher if you're willing to listen."
scorpio,2016-08-01,"Don't let anyone talk you out of your perceptions today just because stern Saturn is giving you a sobering view of reality. There's no need to waste time worrying about little uncertainties while you're standing on such solid ground. Act on the strength of your convictions now. But remember that power is a double-edged sword and you could inadvertently hurt someone by brandishing it unconsciously. Play for keeps, but do it with awareness and humility."
sagittarius,2016-08-01,"Your appetite for pleasure is strong today and following the road of excess is a very real possibility. But it's prudent to restrain your indulgences if you want to avoid expensive surprises. An object of your desire (whether a person, activity or thing) may not be worth as much as you think. It's hard to turn off your attraction to excitement, so a bit of adult supervision and moderation is recommended to keep you within reasonable bounds."
capricorn,2016-08-01,"It's not about the clothing you wear or how you do your hair; it's more about what attitude you decide to put on for the day. If you choose to show a confident but humble demeanor, real progress will be yours. Your organizational skills are functioning at peak performance and you won't waste any energy as long as you act with great authority and determination. You will be recognized for your hard work if you persevere with prudence and consistency. Shine your light so brightly that others can see their way out of the dark."
aquarius,2016-08-01,"A coherent presentation of your goals offers the likelihood for success. The Sun in your 10th House of Career creates an easy trine with ambitious Saturn, allowing you to capitalize on your previous experience. Work toward building things that will endure, for Saturn's law suggests that you will get what you earn. The climb to the top of the mountain is long, yet the best way to ensure that you reach your destination is to initiate strategic action right now."
pisces,2016-08-01,"You are the master of your own universe today with a strong sense of your personal identity. Fortunately, you possess an unshakeable willingness to do what's necessary to achieve your goals. You have the resolve to cut through social chatter, establish clear priorities and take care of your business. Following a concrete plan and eliminating distractions empower your position of authority and can earn you respect and admiration from others. Don't just look at the stars, be one."
aries,2016-08-02,"Your plans may need to be changed at the last-minute if unfulfilled commitments still require your undivided attention. Be as generous as possible when responding to the expectations of others, regardless of how inconvenient it is for you. Luckily, the playful Leo New Moon occurs in your 5th House of Spontaneity, giving you a chance to catch your breath from dealing with the larger issue of restoring balance to your life. Instead of seeking alternate solutions, focus your energy on making the present moment meaningful for everyone involved."
taurus,2016-08-02,"You enjoy an ideal balance of enthusiasm and skill when the generous Leo New Moon triggers your 4th House of Domestic Conditions to bring joy, drama, and inspiration to your personal life. A smooth trine to reliable Saturn provides you with the tools you need to give substance to your new ideas. Brightening up your home and focusing on your family life motivate you to also act more creatively outside the house. From small beginnings come great things."
gemini,2016-08-02,"Self-restraint may be a challenge when your restlessness provokes rash behavior, but there's too much at stake to prematurely risk your current position while pursuing castles in the air. The fixed Leo New Moon rattles your 3rd House of Communication, but plans can fall apart as grandiose declarations fail to live up to your expectations. New ideas that excite your mind also require careful consideration before you launch into a full-fledged campaign. Your ability to rally people to your cause is strong, but make sure the emotional cost is worth it."
cancer,2016-08-02,"Make sure the foundation is solid before you commit to anyone's brilliant plan; otherwise, you might wind up cleaning up someone else's mess. The creative Leo New Moon falls in your 2nd House of Finances to help you cook up moneymaking ideas. Luckily, you can combine the Lion's bold behavior with your strong organizational skills today. Your inner dedication and discipline ultimately reward you with greater income and a healthy sense of pride."
leo,2016-08-02,"There are no easy answers to life's complex questions now, yet, simply knowing this secret can alleviate much of your pressure. The courageous Leo New Moon may be the cosmic turning point you need. Many previously unrelated events appear to reach a confluence as the separate strands of reality are woven together to change the course of your life. Even if recent distractions were exciting at times, you haven't progress toward your goals as much as you intended. Seize the moment because some opportunities don't knock twice."
virgo,2016-08-02,"Connecting with your inner guidance and having faith in your vision of a brighter future are two keys to your personal growth. The expressive Leo New Moon energizes your 12th House of Privacy, where its flames of creativity may be hidden from view. Nourish your hopes quietly, instead of advertising them too soon. Nevertheless, realizing the need to delve into your own imagination enables you to discover how past experiences are still affecting your current choices. Your spiritual journey isn't an easy one, but the possible ramifications of your metaphysical quest can be life-altering if you're willing to do the work."
libra,2016-08-02,"You are more eager than ever to engage in clever conversations or flirtatious behavior today. But you might find yourself lost in a crowd as the dramatic Leo New Moon activates your 11th House of Social Networking. You may be quite rigid in your thinking today because Leo is a fixed sign. You don't want to just go with the flow. You have an agenda in mind and are determined to stick to it, even if progress is temporarily slow. As journalist Jim Watkins wrote, ""A river cuts through a rock not because of its power, but its persistence."""
scorpio,2016-08-02,"Your professional life receives a boost of energy when the expressive Leo New Moon highlights your 10th House of Career, perhaps earning you greater public recognition. You are willing to go the extra mile and can ensure the viability of your dream with careful research and planning. Setting your own standards of excellence, along with a sustainable pace, improves your chances of reaching the top of almost any mountain."
sagittarius,2016-08-02,"You are inspired to take more risks now -- perhaps seeking a more prestigious job or even starting a business on your own. The demonstrative Leo New Moon fuels your expansive 9th House of Future Vision, widening your horizons and revealing new opportunities to distinguish yourself in your chosen profession. You are not interested in mediocrity; you are motivated to succeed even when you face difficulties or setbacks. When it comes to your career, don't take no for an answer."
capricorn,2016-08-02,"Instead of seeking someone who always agrees with you, find a trustworthy partner who cares enough to tell you the unvarnished truth. You will need the honest feedback because the brassy Leo New Moon in your 8th House of Transformation pushes you to take bold steps forward in both your personal and professional relationships. A steady trine to workhorse Saturn supplies the initiative and dogged determination to build something that lasts. Success can't be hurried; Rome wasn't built in a day."
aquarius,2016-08-02,"A reliable colleague shows you how to keep your passion flowing now without burning out. Fortunately, the audacious Leo New Moon blesses your 7th House of Partners, bringing a wave of self-confidence, reinforced by the support of friends and coworkers. The extravagant ideas of your allies and the originality of your own proposals gain credibility from a solid trine to realistic Saturn that provides the follow-through to turn your plans into reality. Thankfully, hard work is child's play when you do it for a cause or project you fully believe in."
pisces,2016-08-02,"There is a rare opportunity to share your idealism with your colleagues today, but without a solid plan your hopes are likely to go up in smoke. The Leo New Moon lands in your 6th House of Work and Service, sparking your enthusiasm for learning new skills or encouraging you to seek more fulfilling employment. A growing desire to express more creativity on the job can inspire you to take up a new hobby. Don't be afraid of the power of your dreams; observe what magically floats into your awareness so you can integrate it into your everyday life."
aries,2016-08-03,"Your heart is focusing on such a big prize now that people may ridicule you and accuse you of wasting your energy. Nevertheless, you could have the last laugh when you make your fantasy come true. Although you might be operating with an optimistic outlook on life now, holding a vision in your mind's eye reinforces the image in your brain. Your path to success is not a straight one. Dream it and then do everything in your power to make it happen."
taurus,2016-08-03,"You typically prefer to keep your feelings to yourself, but are inexplicably compelled to express them now. You realize that your desires may lose their power once you share them with someone else. Nevertheless, your logic isn't strong enough today to overcome your irrational need to receive approval from others. Tread carefully as you traverse this tricky ground. You're likely to court a rejection if you reveal too much, which ends up being a self-fulfilling prophecy. There's no need to perform a song and dance when the only person you must prove anything to is yourself."
gemini,2016-08-03,"Everything seems to be slightly out of focus today as you explore a variety of approaches to rein in the energy. However, the more you try to regain control, the more daunting the task appears. Instead of looking at your world and seeing it as an obstacle course to be conquered, imagine that it's a dance to music you've never heard before. You must let go of your need to make intellectual sense of the events and just operate directly from the longing in your heart."
cancer,2016-08-03,"You have big ideas about what you want to accomplish today and are not interested in reconsidering your goals. Unfortunately, your self-esteem could suffer if you just assume that everything will work out as you imagine. Coworkers might resist your plans, thinking theirs are better. Nevertheless, you have an excellent chance of reaching your goals if you set your sights with accuracy and are tenacious in your pursuit of success."
leo,2016-08-03,"Giving up is tricky business, especially if you're so close to tasting success. Nevertheless, you might feel as if your choices are limited if you're not making any apparent progress. However, what you see is not what you get; there's a whole wide world of action that is sitting behind the veils of illusion. There's no urgency to sort it all out today; just keep one foot moving in front of the other. Taking little steps is better than taking none at all."
virgo,2016-08-03,"You appear to be an armchair general today, issuing commands from the safety of your own castle. Nevertheless, your goal might be nothing short of world domination. However, mysterious forces are working behind the scenes to ensure a positive outcome, even to your misdirected intentions. Rather than trying to control everything in order to hide how little you understand the cosmic forces at work, open yourself to the spiritual lessons at hand.  Remember, the power of now contains the consequences of the future. Love is stronger than fear."
libra,2016-08-03,"You might feel as if you're bumping up against walls, but every time you lean against a structure, it disappears into thin air. Your key planet Venus forms an otherworldly aspect with the keeper of the three-dimensional world, Saturn, informing you that this is not another typical day at the office. You must choose your battles wisely because you do not possess the energy to fight them all. Play a game of elimination until your priorities become clear. Focus on your goal; don't look in any direction but ahead."
scorpio,2016-08-03,"You have your mind set on a fixed goal today and will not rest easy until your work is done. You intuitively realize that you have run out of discretionary time. Your clocks have suddenly been reset and are now ticking in a parallel universe where time can flow in many different directions simultaneously. Fortunately, this means you still have the opportunity to get your work done. Paradoxically, there is not a moment to spare. Get out of the rat race by stepping off the hamster wheel; give your body a chance to recuperate and then fearlessly try again."
sagittarius,2016-08-03,"You are willing to take on anyone or anything that stands in your way. Mars and Saturn, the bad boys of astrology, are camped out in your 1st House of Personality now, giving you an irrepressible drive that is fueled by unrelenting determination. However, it's a smart idea to check your bearings one more time before you head off in the wrong direction. You can manifest real magic today as long as there's a sensible method behind your madness."
capricorn,2016-08-03,"Sharing your feelings isn't enough today; you need to be overly dramatic to keep everyone's interest. Unfortunately, this conversation is less about a colorful presentation than it is about a heartfelt interaction. One-way communication feels empty; you might as well be talking to a wall. It's all about the feedback you receive that helps you clarify the fuzzy edges of your perceptions. The more you talk now, the more you need to listen."
aquarius,2016-08-03,"You might surround yourself with people who are very enthusiastic today, but this doesn't give you permission to take the day off. In fact, you have an important role to play by assuming a responsible place within your community. You can keep your opinions cool, calm and collected for now, but will forfeit your objectivity over the next few days. Swinging into action too soon disperses your creative energy. Instead, observe it, sit with it and watch it transform."
pisces,2016-08-03,"You're either working extra hard today or you might just be putting on a show to impress everyone with your current role of authority. However, it can be lonely at the top and you could isolate yourself from those you love while establishing your position. It's challenging for you to see how other people perceive your energy; nevertheless, considering another person's perspective is a useful exercise to help you gain self-awareness. As Buddhist teacher Thich Nhat Hanh says, ""Don't just do something, sit there!"""
aries,2016-08-04,"You could feel resentful if someone railroads you into doing something against your will. Nevertheless, you're ready to fight for what feels like your survival. In fact, it's hard to bury your anger any longer while combative Mars packs a punch today. But be careful not to overreact; the stakes are considerable and you will likely emerge the winner as long as you take the high road. Acting for the good of all is more soul-satisfying than selfishly attempting to garner more power or wealth for yourself."
taurus,2016-08-04,"You may be a bit thin-skinned today, even if everyone else seem tough as nails. Aggressive Mars creates a contentious connection with uncompromising Pluto that can turn a small disagreement into a serious quarrel. Nevertheless, your key planet Venus aligns with wounded Chiron, sensitizing you to the emotional vulnerability of others. Ideally, your delicate feelings give you the finesse to frame conflict in a loving light by establishing common ground as the basis of cooperation."
gemini,2016-08-04,"You can see that something's wrong with a relationship today and are ready to jump in and fix it. Although action-hero Mars is teaming up with penetrating Pluto, they have vastly different approaches to problem-solving. On one hand, you want to go for the quick solution. On the other hand, you're driven to get to the underlying source of the conflict and handle it once and for all. Whichever route you choose, be cautious since you could stir up resistance from others. As with all Pluto aspects, acting for the common good brings more emotional satisfaction than just striving for personal success."
cancer,2016-08-04,"A simple difference of opinion at work could grow into a major conflict today as militant Mars crosses swords with ruthless Pluto. Although you might think someone is bullying you, you could simply be caught in the crossfire between coworkers. If it's not your personal battle, establish clear boundaries and get out of the way. Even with good intentions, your high ideals may not be appreciated when belief systems collide. Every time you subtract negative from your life you make room for more positive."
leo,2016-08-04,"You're the recipient of an extra boost of energy as boisterous Mars drives you to accomplish more at work today. Thankfully, a stressful situation can remind you to handle a delicate issue that you previously dodged. But expecting too much change all at once may be unrealistic, so look at making minor adjustments that have lasting impact. As Confucius said, ""The man who moves a mountain begins by carrying away small stones."""
virgo,2016-08-04,"Maintaining a cool and calm approach helps you to manage an emotionally volatile situation today. Although you might not want to make compromises while being pressured by others, being rational is key to avoiding conflict. Practicing self-discipline and adopting a clear set of priorities empower you to promote your interests rather than getting sidetracked by someone else's agenda. Thinking about your actions in advance helps you decide where to hang on and where to let go."
libra,2016-08-04,"You are a pro at finding your way back to center when the storms of change are swirling around you. Nevertheless, it's challenging to stand back from the intensity as different points of view clash around you now. An anxious aspect between aggressive Mars and relentless Pluto can tempt you to engage in an unnecessary power struggle before reaching your goal. Paying close attention to the interpersonal dynamics and your own emotional well-being enables you to moderate your energy so you don't exhaust yourself in the process."
scorpio,2016-08-04,"Rather than getting caught up in an unwinnable struggle, focus on what you can do to positively influence long-term events. An internal conflict between your need for cash and your core values is unlikely to be resolved right away, yet your options should become clearer over time. Your key planets, warrior Mars and unyielding Pluto, are duking it out as opinions boil over with extreme points of view and little tolerance for dissent. Remember, managing your emotions is not about denial; it's about being honest in the way you express them."
sagittarius,2016-08-04,"You are riding a growing wave of enthusiasm now that fiery Mars is heating up your sign. His alignment with potent Pluto today dramatizes your desire to make measurable progress toward your goals. However, your sense of urgency can also destabilize interpersonal dynamics. Be careful about riding roughshod over someone else's wishes or you might accomplish your mission, only to find that you disenfranchised your best supporters along the way. You will be alright if you remember that compassion is passion with heart."
capricorn,2016-08-04,"Sharing power can be tricky for you calculating Mountain goats, especially when a trusted ally seems to be harboring secrets. Tough-guy Mars is pushing against non-negotiable Pluto in your sign, triggering extreme reactions that make compromise a real challenge. Neutrality is elusive if unexpressed desires and hidden agendas are at work. Whatever happens, don't waste the potency of this cosmic force on trivial matters; instead, be a fierce warrior for a worthy cause that's close to your heart."
aquarius,2016-08-04,"You're all set to challenge someone who uses self-righteousness as a justification to hold their beliefs over yours. In fact, the strength of your convictions can be inspirational if you don't promise too much or not enough. Unfortunately, the Goldilocks syndrome makes it difficult to get it just right. You may be motivated by irrational fears of failure today, so try not to overcompensate for your insecurities. Rather than getting lost in philosophical justifications for your actions, approach each situation in a practical manner. But most importantly, only make commitments you intend to keep."
pisces,2016-08-04,"Your career trajectory is blazing a direct path into your future now that superhero Mars is traveling through your 10th House of Status. However, the heavy hand of relentless Pluto can motivate you to take risks that may not ultimately work out in your favor. You must take stock of your resources, including your time and energy, and maintain control of your emotions if your current actions are to succeed. Don't get distracted by disagreements over principles or politics; instead, focus on the forces that are within your control to fuel your ambition."
aries,2016-08-05,"Office politics can impede your progress today. Although you are prepared to do whatever it takes to fulfill your professional obligations, it's still a struggle to overcome the resistance of your coworkers. It might seem as if an authority figure is working against you now, but it's your choice as to whether or not to buy into anyone else's negativity. Sweet success is your best revenge."
taurus,2016-08-05,"You have a green thumb and make beauty bloom on many forms. Beautiful Venus enters earthy Virgo and your 5th House of Self-Expression today, helping you create a garden of joy. You give off the air of being able to manifest flowers in the desert and bring happiness to those you love. However, Venus also forms a tricky aspect to resourceful Pluto, requiring you to transform awkward moments into pleasant ones. Connections with others are difficult only if you try to control your feelings. Let emotions flow and then let them go."
gemini,2016-08-05,"You are living life boldly these days yet anticipate a change as you step back from the hectic pace. Nevertheless, your creativity is enhanced as artistic Venus dances into your 4th House of Roots today. But her difficult aspect with unforgiving Pluto can impede your self-expression until you deal with unfinished business on the home front. Blood makes you related; loyalty makes you family."
cancer,2016-08-05,"While it's challenging to see a situation from someone else's point of view, it's crucial to do so if you want the relationship to grow. Processing your emotions will bring you the confidence to express your own opinions more effectively while still remaining open to those of others. You're appreciated for your willingness to discuss complex issues now that friendly Venus is visiting refined Virgo in your 3rd House of Communication. You can't judge people's choices without understanding their reasons. Treat others with the same respect you wish to receive."
leo,2016-08-05,"You may desperately try to maintain a practical perspective on your finances today, but difficulties arise from your tendency to indulge your extravagant tastes. Even if you intend to limit your desires to those things that are the most valuable, your practical perspective might not last. Although loving Venus enters efficient Virgo in your 2nd House of Self-Worth, her stressful aspect to passionate Pluto has you chasing rainbows instead of real satisfaction. Balancing your open heart with common sense helps you avoid unnecessary disappointment."
virgo,2016-08-05,"You are facing important decisions now, especially in financial matters. If you've been wavering, this is the right time to tune into your gut feelings and take decisive action. It helps if your choices are rooted in self-confidence, which, thankfully, receives a boost when attractive Venus enters your sign today. Your charming personality and sense of style turns heads in your direction during this alluring transit. But don't expect an easy victory since ruthless Pluto is testing your resolve. It has been said that if the road is straight and smooth, you're likely going the wrong way."
libra,2016-08-05,"Set aside your pursuit of passing pleasures today so you can be clear about which desires matter the most. You are in a serious frame of mind and want to narrow your options as sensual Venus enters discriminating Virgo. It makes sense to simplify your relationships and eliminate distractions in preparation for the changes ahead. Given a choice, forgo immediate gratification in the name of long-term emotional balance."
scorpio,2016-08-05,"You are eager to solidify a relationship now, but might not know how to reach your goal. However, old issues come to the surface and show you where you might have made mistakes. But go easy on the self-criticism, since the point is to improve your capacity for love and pleasure, rather than dishing out punishment. Although you might feel jealousy or resentment, motivate yourself to take positive action rather than dwelling upon the past."
sagittarius,2016-08-05,"You're more concerned with your career path than anything else now. Diplomatic Venus camps out in your 10th House of Career through the end of the month, enhancing your reputation and attracting lucrative opportunities. Nevertheless, your familiar struggle between freedom and responsibility may come back to haunt you. Nevertheless, find ways to meet your obligations while still allocating enough free time for play. As Albert Einstein said, ""Creativity is contagious; pass it on."""
capricorn,2016-08-05,"Communicating your intentions about the next phase of your life is essential today. Magnetic Venus attracts you to exotic people in faraway places when she joins the planetary pack in your 9th House of Travel. However, her presence in earthy Virgo keeps your feet on the ground. Your pragmatic approach to living provides a strong foundation for facing the rising tide of feelings that can wash reason away now. Follow your dreams but be sure to pack your integrity along for the ride."
aquarius,2016-08-05,"A never-ending string of little issues require your attention now, but it's wise to save some of your time to think about your long-term goals. Caution is stressed as modest Venus steps into meticulous Virgo and your 8th House of Intimacy, but the presence of mental Mercury, the evocative Moon and bombastic Jupiter already have you focusing on the more complex emotional dynamics. Nevertheless, as Lao Tzu wrote, ""He who knows others is wise. He who knows himself if enlightened."""
pisces,2016-08-05,"It may be time to repair a damaged partnership, but it's nearly impossible to bring passion into a conversation without experiencing some loss of control. Fortunately, you're more alluring now as captivating Venus visits your 7th House of Relationships. Being clear about what you want is a good idea that becomes more difficult in the days ahead. A magical connection can stir romantic feelings, but you'll need to see where it goes over time to see if it's real."
aries,2016-08-06,"You might feel it's your duty to share what's on your mind today, but speaking the truth can bring an undesirable response. Talkative Mercury's hard square to no-nonsense Saturn complicates conversations by undermining trust if you say too much. Granted, you aren't often the long-suffering type, yet you could possess even less self-control at this time. Others may not be willing to reveal their feelings, making you regret your disclosure. Patience is critical now, since pushing for answers only raises more questions."
taurus,2016-08-06,"The lure of pleasure could distract you from delivering on a promise today. However, there's a price to pay for irresponsibility when active Mars and hardworking Saturn in your 8th House of Shared Resources are stressed by four planets in your 5th House of Fun and Games. Fortunately, your tenacity can help you overcome your own resistance to work. Although it's possible to be pulled into an argument with a friend or colleague about your priorities, speaking carefully enables you to skirt unnecessary conflict. Diplomacy is the art of letting someone else have your way."
gemini,2016-08-06,"You want to initiate a conversation about a delicate subject to clear the air of invisible tension. Unfortunately, too many details create a roadblock that forces you to think twice before you speak your piece. Your key planet Mercury runs into scrupulous Saturn, requiring you to back up every statement you make with facts and figures. Thankfully, sufficient preparation works wonders; you'll be showered with trust and respect if you can satisfy your audience. Setting your ego aside and putting the truth first is the quickest route to your destination."
cancer,2016-08-06,"You may be quite upset with someone's actions today, yet your tendency is to withdraw rather than push outside of your comfort zone and share your concerns. Communicator Mercury in your 3rd House of Distractions crosses paths with authoritative Saturn, making it even harder to get your point across if you lose your temper. Gently express your hurt as clearly and patiently as possible and hope for the best. Kindness works magic where anger never could."
leo,2016-08-06,"Financial matters continue to be in the spotlight, especially if you must limit your activities or purchases because of fiscal restraints. Unfortunately, there might not be an easy solution to your current dilemma because valuable Venus and intellectual Mercury are feeling the pressure while visiting your 2nd House of Resources. Even if you seek advice from someone you trust today, communication bogs down and everything seems to require more effort than expected. Pay attention to the signs and simplify your life. Sticking to the basics now prevents messy complications later on."
virgo,2016-08-06,"You wish to involve others in your decision-making process, but could have a difficult time finding the advice you need. There's a lot on your mind now that romantic Venus, mental Mercury and opportunistic Jupiter are all hanging out in your analytical sign. Meanwhile, Mercury slams into a square with stern Saturn, stopping you in your intellectual tracks and forcing you to realize that a few well-considered words create more impact than a rambling speech. Remember, it's not enough to say the right thing; you must also deliver your message in a way that others are able to receive it."
libra,2016-08-06,"There's an emotional uneasiness in the air that comes from a lack of communication. It's obvious that there are things that must be shared, yet still remain buried while so many planets hide out in your 12th House of Secrets. You may feel as if you've stumbled onto a battlefield as your key planet Venus dynamically squares warrior Mars, but you're in no mood to fight now. You wish you could just mind your own business and ignore the source of irritation. Nevertheless, this is your chance to kindly yet firmly break the news. As Buddha said, ""The trouble is you think you have time."""
scorpio,2016-08-06,"Although you probably won't go out of your way to look for a fight, it still might seem as if you're cruising for trouble today. It's just that your key planet, contentious Mars, is angry and under duress in your 2nd House of Core Beliefs. Although you're ready to defend your basic values, your arguments may run into an immovable wall of authority. You are hot for action and tempers can flare. Nevertheless, you can't just walk away from the issues once they're on the table. The way through is the only way out."
sagittarius,2016-08-06,"You could doubt your own wisdom if your ambitious plans run off the rails. You are operating with a deep well of energetic reserve while superhero Mars and taskmaster Saturn are in the picture. However, reality conspires against you today, demanding that you reconsider your long-range goals. You must have all your ducks in order now, since any flaws in your argument will be revealed, whether you like it or not. Your mood quickly sours if unrealistic expectations set you up for failure. Nevertheless, success is yours if you work hard and keep your indulgences to a minimum."
capricorn,2016-08-06,"Your confidence may be shaken today if your optimism suddenly crashes into reality. Fast-talking Mercury squares nay-saying Saturn in your 12th House of Endings, requiring you to confront your inner saboteur. Once and for all, you must face the fear that the notion of failure arouses. Although you might want to withdraw from conflict, it's more productive to rethink your strategy and then respond directly to any valid criticism. Obstacles do not obstruct the path; they are the path."
aquarius,2016-08-06,"You may grow restless today, tempted to trade measurable gains for an unrealistic pie-in-the-sky dream. However, sobering Saturn puts a damper on your wanderlust. Unfortunately, garnering support is challenging now, especially if others want proof that you're speaking the truth. It might be wise to exercise self-restraint and perform your due diligence in order to build a rock-solid case for your position. Don't get discouraged if it feels like you missed the boat; you just need more time before you can proceed according to your plan. Patience is your friend."
pisces,2016-08-06,"You might be unsure of your life path today when thoughtful Mercury and physical Mars create a bit of an interplanetary struggle. Forcing resolution now at the height of your uncertainty is like slamming on the brakes during a skid. Thankfully, you can maintain control if you clear your head and acknowledge your fears. Mastering your mind is your most important assignment now. Knowing exactly what you want to say empowers your message, but confusion and frustration return if you don't rehearse your lines prior to delivering them."
aries,2016-08-07,"Unforeseen changes can force you to loosen your grip on your schedule. Go ahead and seek solace in your imagination, but if you choose to postpone fulfilling a promise, don't confuse your impractical fantasies with your mundane obligations. Logical Mercury in your 6th House of Logistics is influenced by otherworldly Neptune today, so manage your time as effectively as possible. Keeping one foot on the ground allows you to accomplish your goals and still manage to indulge your dreams."
taurus,2016-08-07,"What you lose in mental clarity today is made up in artistic potential. Your rationality is diffused while cerebral Mercury opposes nebulous Neptune, so writing technical manuals or detailed emails is challenging. Make time to enrich your soul by listening to music or relaxing in nature. Keeping your options open can be a viable strategy, but narrowing your field of vision gives you much-needed peace and quiet. Lao Tzu wrote, ""To the mind that is still, the whole universe surrenders."""
gemini,2016-08-07,"It seems like a perfect day to kick back and let your mind wander wherever it wants to go. Mischievous Mercury's opposition to surreal Neptune sets the stage for storytelling, daydreaming and other forms of mental escape. Avoid concrete planning or initiating conversations if logic is required. Minor irritations at home can surface now, but practicing compassion and forgiveness is a better use of your time than trying to take corrective action for something that's gone wrong. Take the high road; it's far less crowded."
cancer,2016-08-07,"Although you can see a domestic issue from all angles today, a sticky dispute conflict could still sidetrack your day. After putting in quite a bit of effort to sort it all out, you might discover that most of the disagreement originated from a simple misunderstanding. But an in-depth discussion only makes the situation worse if everyone is operating off of different assumptions. Frequently, the biggest snag in communication is that people don't listen to understand, they listen to reply. Open your mind before you open your mouth."
leo,2016-08-07,"You're finally ready to tackle a longstanding financial issue today, only to realize the problem isn't as bad as you thought. Unfortunately, trickster Mercury's opposition to fuzzy Neptune can delude you into believing nearly anything that resonates with your fantasies. You could even mislead yourself into imagining an improved fiscal situation. Don't turn your cash flow upside down by making a decision about a major purchase; instead, list the pros and cons about each option while postponing your final choice until tomorrow when you can hear yourself think."
virgo,2016-08-07,"Ironically, facts range from fuzzy to fantastic now, which can lead you to erroneous conclusions. Paradoxically, analytical Mercury empowers you to focus your logic like a laser beam. However, the Winged Messenger is in a tug-of-war with delusional Neptune today, making it impossible to discern useful data from an incoming deluge of unverifiable information. Rather than making yourself crazy with frustration, grab this opportunity to explore your imagination and indulge your fantasies. Your regularly scheduled program of reality will return tomorrow."
libra,2016-08-07,"You may be confused by your lack of priorities today as thoughtful Mercury opposes ephemeral Neptune in your 6th House of Daily Routine. Retreating from the public spotlight seems like your most sensible option while several planets congregate in your 12th House of Privacy. Nevertheless, the future is pulling at you from several different directions now, obscuring your final destination. Thankfully, you can probably get away with declaring a one-day amnesty from responsibility as long as you promise to finish your work upon your return. One step backward, two steps forward."
scorpio,2016-08-07,"Your dreams must be placed on the back burner today so you can direct your energy toward the outside world. Pressure to renew a commitment or change direction is likely as the illuminating Sun's presence in your 10th House of Career is intensified by powerful Pluto. However, your current hypersensitivity can overrule common sense as you try to meet other people's expectations now. No matter what anyone says, listen to your inner voice for the advice you need. As Sufi poet Rumi wrote, ""Look for the answer inside your question."""
sagittarius,2016-08-07,"You long to take spiritual refuge from the demands of life today. Messenger Mercury's opposition to metaphysical Neptune in your 4th House of Roots tempts you to escape into your imagination. However, it's nearly impossible to remain objective when every word is so loaded with illusions and emotions. While this planetary combination is wonderful for creative expression and compassionate conversation, it tends to dissipate facts in the presence of dreams. Remember the success of Walt Disney who said, ""Fantasy and reality often overlap."""
capricorn,2016-08-07,"You want everyone to see your fair and balanced approach to resolving interpersonal differences. Unfortunately, the power of your beliefs distorts your objectivity now as relentless Pluto in your 1st House of Self is bent out of shape by the dramatic Leo Sun. But it's easier to bury your agenda than to acknowledge it. Nevertheless, what's left unsaid can tilt a conversation in the wrong direction. Although coming clean might feel uncomfortable at first, pushing through your resistance and being honest from the start brings you the respect you seek."
aquarius,2016-08-07,"Your defenses soften in the presence of other people's weaknesses because you have compassion for their plight today. Wanting to help someone in need is admirable, but the sharp analytical lens of cerebral Mercury in precise Virgo is diffused by its opposition to surreal Neptune. This confusing yet imaginative aspect challenges you to discern the truth from fiction. Make sure you understand the underlying message by repeating key components of any discussion and asking for verification along the way. No question is too dumb when there's so much at stake."
pisces,2016-08-07,"Delving into the details of relationships can be a tedious process, yet it's essential work for cultivating your compassion. While it's true that love sometimes flows along with the magic of silent understanding, words are ultimately the best means for establishing deep connections. Pillow talk is the upside of chatty Mercury's opposition to dreamy Neptune today. But confusion is also possible if you don't double-check your impressions to make sure that everyone is on the same page. Don't naively assume that your interpretation matches anyone else's until you validate your instincts."
aries,2016-08-08,"You might believe that you are going out of your way to be nice to others, but their view of your behavior could be quite different. No matter how honorable your intentions are now, your brusque manner can make you appear uncaring or even offensive. But what you say is likely less important than how you say it. Rather than shocking someone with your sudden declaration, build up to it with a conversation based on give and take. A little diplomacy is all you need to create harmony in your world."
taurus,2016-08-08,"Although people may be dependent on your job performance today, it's still crucial to balance work with play. The pleasure-seeking Libra Moon brightens your 6th House of Self-Improvement, reminding you that moderation is essential -- not only to your growth, but also to your physical well-being. Instead of trying to power your way through your responsibilities like a Bull, taking regular breaks is revitalizing and enables you to be more productive in the long run. Don't rush anything; when the time is right, magic will happen."
gemini,2016-08-08,"You are thinking of all the ways -- realistic or not -- you could escape from work today. There are so many things that excite your imagination now. Nevertheless, it's unlikely that you can avoid your mundane obligations, so you might as well start your chores early in the day. Unfortunately, you won't be able to concentrate on the tasks at hand for too long, since every flight of fancy seems like an intriguing distraction. Gently bring your focus back to your assignment as often as necessary until your responsibilities are fulfilled."
cancer,2016-08-08,"An unexpected change of plans could send you into a temporary tailspin, making it tricky to regain your composure. But your response to the pressures of the day is admirable, even as the Moon encourages you to reconnect with your past. Oddly enough, stirring up your old fears doesn't necessarily mean you must take any specific actions yet. Just continue to rebuild the present moment on the foundation of old experiences. Your future depends on what you do today."
leo,2016-08-08,"You're inspired to share your love, but you might not get very far on your path to fulfillment today. People may be emotionally shut down for one reason or another, unable or unwilling to accept your gift of affection. Additionally, you aren't willing to change your attitude for the sake of winning someone's favor. Nevertheless, you can still take the high road and shine your light as brightly as possible. Instead of waiting for others to meet you halfway, express the magic of your heart without any expectations. As Nathanial Hawthorne wrote, ""Generosity is the flower of justice."""
virgo,2016-08-08,"You may need to risk more than you prefer in order to let others know exactly where you stand. Unfortunately, you face the possibility of rejection or even ridicule if you put your feelings out into the open. But something amazing is about to happen, even if it takes a while to realize the significance of the moment. You are in your element now and people are listening to every word you say. Choose your message carefully for the window of opportunity is already starting to close."
libra,2016-08-08,"Although your friends and coworkers can see through your veneer, they still might not realize the passionate emotions you're holding quietly behind your personal version of the Great Wall. On the other hand, the gracious Libra Moon enables you to show your feelings within the bounds of social etiquette. Honoring the customs from another time or culture expands your horizons, enabling you to perceive your environment from a wider perspective. What others think is none of your business at this time, but what you think makes all the difference in the world."
scorpio,2016-08-08,"You're driven to make the most out of the social media buzz today, but finding the time can be a bit of a struggle. Your intention is to be more connected with like-minded people while messenger Mercury claims the spotlight in your 11th House of Networking. However, you like your anonymity and aren't eager to take a more public stance now. Push through your fear of exposure because you can't have it both ways. The satisfaction of accomplishment will outweigh your concerns once you finally decide to take your rightful place in the community."
sagittarius,2016-08-08,"Rediscovering your life purpose takes precedence today, whether it's more of the same or an entirely different ballgame. In either case, your legendary visionary outlook inspires others to tell you their dreams. The good news is you have a clear sense of who you are, a viable plan in place and feel as if nothing can stand in your way now. Just remember to take it slowly or you will expend so much energy that you won't have any later on when you need it for a second wind. As President Theodore Roosevelt wrote, ""With self-discipline, most anything is possible."""
capricorn,2016-08-08,"Although you are working with a clear agenda for getting further on your journey up the mountain, you begin to realize that you might have bitten off more than you can chew. Instead of exhausting yourself as you strive toward the summit, be wise and scale back your plans before circumstances do it for you. If you grow discouraged because you haven't reached your goal yet, remember that it's not too late to reevaluate your progress and adjust your course as needed."
aquarius,2016-08-08,"You can't take your mind off the wonderful possibilities that lay ahead. But neither can you pick one single path because there are so many things you want to accomplish now that the ambivalent Libra Moon is visiting your 9th House of Future Vision. Nevertheless, you are just as concerned about uncovering the meaning of life, which may be counterproductive to producing anything in the real world. Balancing the spiritual with the material gives you reason to refocus on your work. Ultimately, it's your dogged persistence that will turn a potential failure into an extraordinary achievement."
pisces,2016-08-08,"All is well in your world if your relationships are in order. But if unspoken feelings hang thick in the air, you won't be able to concentrate on your work. Everyone will know that something is out of balance and it's up to you to rectify the situation. Thankfully, awareness is the first step on the road back to health and harmony. Use your current connection with the fair-minded Libra Moon to help you weigh your various options and choose the best one."
aries,2016-08-09,"Your lack of patience motivates you to move away from the centrist position you were previously holding. But you are more compulsive than impulsive about executing your plan today because you are fearful about making a careless mistake. It's one thing to acknowledge you're at a point of no return, but it's something else to be cool enough to make your current actions count. Be as practical as you can without walking away from your dreams. In Muhammad Ali's words, ""The man who has no imagination has no wings."""
taurus,2016-08-09,"Your expectations can lead to trouble today if you are relying on someone else for advice. A close friend or partner will likely step up to the plate to present an alternative perspective on a current situation. Although you may be appreciative of the additional point of view, it's not wise to accept it as equal to your own perceptions because other people have their personal biases. Take any feedback you receive now as simply more data upon which to base your decision. Ultimately, the best answers come from within and not from anyone else."
gemini,2016-08-09,"You believe you know the best way to go about your business today and are reluctant to listen to anyone else's criticism. Nevertheless, your air of self-sufficiency won't prevent someone from answering your questions before you even ask them. Although your gut reaction is to be dismissive, you could learn something important if you get past your resistance and maintain an open mind. It's your option to go back to your original idea if you so desire. Nevertheless, your receptivity might just lead to a breakthrough strategy you never considered before. Inspiration springs from the most unlikeliest of places."
cancer,2016-08-09,"You're motivated to express what's on your mind today, even if the thought of revealing your truth makes you recoil in fear. But don't let the limitations of your logic stand between you and effective communication because your disclosure carries the potential to positively impact your life. You have the power of integrity on your side; don't be afraid to use it for the good of all. Just remember that right thinking leads to stagnation without right action."
leo,2016-08-09,"You have stories that you want to keep to yourself today and no amount of prying will encourage you to loosen your lips. Your current charm enables you to keep things to yourself without alienating anyone in the process. In fact, you make it look easy when you matter-of-factly declare your boundaries in such a friendly manner that people can't help but smile and agree with your right to personal space. No one will hold a grudge if you combine your honesty with kindness."
virgo,2016-08-09,"You're unwilling to gamble on shaking up your schedule today, even if your calculated odds look promising. Oddly enough, you are not intrigued in the slightest by endless stacks of data that could be used to justify your position. Instead of your regular penchant for facts, you're eager to unwrap a few magical tidbits now. Although you're fascinated by the alluring music of your imagination, there's little room for error when it comes to your world of efficiency."
libra,2016-08-09,"It's all about your self-esteem -- or your lack of it -- today. Typically, you shine when you're surrounded by like-minded people who know and love you. But maintaining your confidence isn't easy, especially if you long for time by yourself away from the crowd. Whatever course of action you choose, you must juggle your attraction to the spotlight and your current fear of being on the big stage. As Irish novelist Laurence Sterne wrote, ""In solitude the mind gains strength and learns to lean upon itself."""
scorpio,2016-08-09,"You're unsure how to handle your intense mood changes now that the emotional Moon is kicking up a storm in your sign. As soon as you acknowledge your feelings, they morph into a new configuration that makes it difficult to keep track of them. Unfortunately, you can exhaust yourself, and others, by making a big deal of every passing thought. It's all about cultivating a healthy perspective; if you find yourself wandering off course, slow down and reestablish your center of gravity."
sagittarius,2016-08-09,"You might not want to come out of hiding today, although this reclusive behavior contradicts your normal outgoing nature. Of course, you are not responsible for everyone else's feelings, but there's no reason to alienate your allies by ignoring them. It won't take much extra energy to simply inform them of your motives so they won't over-personalize your introspective attitude now. As Mahatma Gandhi said, ""It's easy to stand with the crowd; it takes courage to stand alone."""
capricorn,2016-08-09,"You are extremely discerning about who you associate with and you aren't willing to change your selection criteria just to appease someone else today. However, establishing your standards might not be as logical of a process as you claim; instead of adhering to rules, you arbitrarily pick and choose your friends by the feeling in the pit of stomach. There's nothing wrong with trusting your instincts as long as you don't hide behind the illusion of sound judgment. Ultimately, your erroneous assumptions can be your worst enemies."
aquarius,2016-08-09,"Nearly everything you do today is aimed at climbing the ladder of success. But you're not satisfied now with making progress and then resting on your laurels. You're gazing further into the future and are willing to make short-term sacrifices to achieve long-term objectives. Although you might be tempted to set out on your own, there is much to gain from the resources others could bring to the table. Decide what you're willing to give up for the luxury of someone else's participation. Small acts when multiplied by many people can transform the world."
pisces,2016-08-09,"You have your heart set on doing something out of the ordinary and you don't want to wait forever to make it happen. However, there may be someone else involved who has a slightly different idea of what an adventure might look like. Don't get discouraged if a resolution seems elusive now; you will have plenty of time to put it all together once you reach a mutual agreement on the overall plan. Steer clear of impulsive decisions today. In the words of Ben Franklin, ""Take time for all things. Great haste makes great waste."""
aries,2016-08-10,"You have the proper words at your disposal today to describe those feelings that are typically not easy to talk about. Fortunately, you won't be deterred from speaking your piece while persuasive Mercury teams up with relentless Pluto, empowering you to press your point until you convince others that your position is a wise one. Nevertheless, there's still room for improvement which means it's crucial to listen to the critical feedback you receive. The Buddha said, ""Three things cannot be long hidden: The Sun, the Moon, and the Truth."""
taurus,2016-08-10,"Someone's response to your actions might feel like an attack on your judgment. However, it may be that your thin-skinned reaction turns constructive criticism into a personal affront. Thankfully, clear thinking and strategic planning smooth out ruffled feathers with stabilizing aspects from Mercury to Pluto. Instead of escalating an unnecessary conflict by over-personalizing everything you hear today, sink beneath the surface and connect with the deeper message."
gemini,2016-08-10,"Mixed signals at work could prompt you to think you lost your way today, yet wallowing in self-doubt won't accomplish anything. However, you are motivated to clear the air in order to improve the current communication dynamics. Thankfully, you can quickly develop a diplomatic strategy to resolve the tension while interactive Mercury trines evolutionary Pluto. Trust earned by hard work and accountability invites deeper discussions and important insights, which in turn can produce a sensible solution to an existing problem."
cancer,2016-08-10,"Your sensitivity to the plights of others is one of your greatest gifts, but it could be the source of deeply rooted angst today. You might be slightly overwhelmed because of the magnitude of trouble you see in the world or in the suffering of those around you. But instead of withdrawing to nurse your pain, you have a chance to help people by participating in meaningful dialogue. Rather than creating an emotional gulf between you and your loved ones, a supportive Mercury-Pluto trine opens communication channels so you don't feel so alone. Reaching out places peace of mind within reach."
leo,2016-08-10,"You seem to be at odds with the world today, but in your heart of hearts you know you're right. Unfortunately, everyone is so entrenched in their own positions that there's no resolution to be found. Tempers might flare at first, but Mercury's trine to Pluto allows you to bring the conversation back to the real issues. Discussing what motivated the argument in the first place is your key to resolving the differences, no matter how deep they run. Author Dorothy Thomas wrote, ""Peace is not the absence of conflict, but the ability to cope with it."""
virgo,2016-08-10,"There are many voices in your head fighting for your attention, and it is a challenge to choose which one to listen to now. You may struggle at first if you pretend to have a plan in place, yet admitting you don't have an answer for every question reveals your vulnerable side. Mercury's creative trine with surgical Pluto helps you cut through the clutter, dig down to the heart of the matter and communicate with conviction. Don't let anything or anyone stop you from achieving your goal, especially yourself."
libra,2016-08-10,"Your values might clash with those of your friends while the Moon in your 2nd House of Core Beliefs dynamically squares the Sun in your 11th House of Community, bringing you to the edge of verbal combat. You know what you want, you express it and you're willing to show that you mean it. Fortunately, Mercury creates an agreeable trine with evolutionary Pluto, allowing you to magically transform a potential conflict into an intimate moment if you're willing to join someone in unknown emotional territory. Author Gail Sheehy wrote, ""The delights of self-discovery are always available."""
scorpio,2016-08-10,"Your emotional reaction is swift and strong today yet you must fight for recognition every step of the way. It's as if everything feels more complicated than it is. People aren't confident in your ability to keep your love light shining now. Mercury's favorable trine to penetrating Pluto is ideal for addressing a delicate issue requiring careful communication. Thankfully, your perceptions empower your words and supply you with the information needed to prove your point. Your intuition is an endless resource if you are wise enough to use it."
sagittarius,2016-08-10,"You prefer to conceal your emotions today because you don't want them to interfere with your professional activities. Your thinking is clear and deep now; your communication is concise and compelling. But working to bring your hidden feelings out into the open is only the first step to connecting with others. Ultimately, directing your attention to where it will do the greatest good is your smartest strategy. Your character's strength is measured less by your words and more by your actions."
capricorn,2016-08-10,"You may feel underappreciated by someone close to you today. Nevertheless, you have a clear understanding of your desires, so concentrated efforts can produce dramatic results in a short amount of time. Cerebral Mercury's creative trine with incisive Pluto deepens your insights and sharpens your words to help you encourage coworkers and friends. In the final analysis, your positivity motivates others and then cycles around to lift your spirits. The best way to multiply your happiness is to share it."
aquarius,2016-08-10,"You can't help but bring your emotions to work with you now, even if you wish you could conveniently leave them at home. Fortunately, you can create some distance between you and your desires without denying your feelings. But you must be brave and push past your resistance to establish a deeper connection with your colleagues while Mercury forms a harmonious trine with secretive Pluto. A meaningful conversation with the right person is priceless, no matter where it takes place."
pisces,2016-08-10,"Everyone seems so practical today that it appears like you have nowhere to fit in and call home. Your emotions are so strong that you might feel a sense of alienation from those closest to you. Nevertheless, you possess plenty of perfect answers, if only you could figure out a way to get your message across. But be careful what you say when Mercury receives a passionate blast from potent Pluto, giving your words tremendous power. Your intensity can scare others away now if you put it on full blast. Ultimately, communication works best when it flows both ways."
aries,2016-08-11,"Sometimes you think you can postpone the inevitable, but today you're champing at the bit, eager for action. You don't want to acknowledge the amount of work you have ahead of you. Instead, you think that heading into it at full speed will enable you to magically accomplish everything on schedule. Nevertheless, you might be in for a rude surprise unless you reconsider your expectations. Don't wait for a better time to reclaim control of your life; do it now while you can still save face."
taurus,2016-08-11,"You might believe that the pressure will finally lighten up today, but your emotions intensify, possibly kicking up another dust storm in your relationship world. Your focus is on the future and the Moon's shift into your 8th House of Deep Sharing suggests that you should talk with someone you trust if you don't know which way to turn. It doesn't take much; even a short conversation can bring a sense of peace if you restrain your expression of any deeper anger until it morphs into something more positive."
gemini,2016-08-11,"Personal relationships are requiring you to carry a heavy load this month while dutiful Saturn continues plodding through your 7th House of Partners. The optimistic Sagittarius Moon connects with warrior Mars tonight, inspiring you with the courageous behavior of others. There's no reason to compete to see who is more outrageous in their pursuit of the truth. As soon as you understand that you're all in this together, it becomes obvious that cooperation and love trump isolation and fear."
cancer,2016-08-11,"You are making big plans for what you will accomplish at work today, yet you might easily bite off more than you can chew. Gauging the amount of time needed to complete a project is tough because your sunny outlook leads you to believe that your resources are inexhaustible. Something will likely snap if you stretch yourself too thin now, causing a house of cards to tumble. The sooner you take action to get your schedule back under control, the better for everyone involved. ""Less is more"" is your motto for the day."
leo,2016-08-11,Yesterday's conflicts morph into today's mutual agreements. Making plans to explore your self-expression is so much easier when everyone is reading from the same page and supporting one another's creative pursuits. But don't assume that everything will continue to flow smoothly since there are still a few bumps in the road ahead. You will likely finish more than you expect when you do your best to take everything in stride. A healthy sense of humor serves you well.
virgo,2016-08-11,"Trivial secrets get blown out of proportion today and you could quickly lose track of your priorities. Although you might put great intention into concentrating on your work, your thoughts are running on overdrive, making it nearly impossible to complete even the simplest task. Nevertheless, you can still turn the day into an amazing memory by cutting yourself some slack. Being totally unproductive for a little while revitalizes your system and clears your brain. Ralph Waldo Emerson said, ""It is a happy talent to know how to play."""
libra,2016-08-11,"You're trying to walk your talk and contain your growing anger at the same time. But don't worry if your negativity slips out into the atmosphere today, since others are likely to be swimming in similar waters. However, the Moon's shift into your 3rd House of Information motivates you to act on what you learn. Maintain a flexible attitude; the most interesting life hacks arrive in unexpected packages at unsuspecting times. But try them out while the planetary energy is still in your favor; it will only be harder for your changes to gain traction if you keep waiting for a better moment."
scorpio,2016-08-11,"You can breathe a sigh of relief when the Moon leaves your extreme sign this afternoon. But it's no secret that you enjoy the emotional intensity, so you might also feel let down when Luna heads into the greener pastures of Sagittarius. Nevertheless, the future looks brighter now, but it's unwise to buy into the fantasy of a perfect relationship. If you do become entangled in someone's personal melodrama, take the time to separate out your pieces from theirs. There's always something distracting knocking at your door; however, today's a great day to let it in."
sagittarius,2016-08-11,"Your gut instincts overrule your rational thoughts today, inspiring your passionate judgment about a political or personal injustice. Thankfully, you possess the gift of charisma, making even the most difficult topic approachable now. Quietly observe any negative emotions that arise in the pit of your stomach. Rather than overreacting at the drop of a hat, hold your feelings close until they develop into something more constructive. Do what is right, not what is easy."
capricorn,2016-08-11,"A strategy of secrecy isn't working now, even if you thought it would be wise to sidestep a confrontation by keeping your feelings private. The Moon's move into your 12th House of Escapism tempts you to pretend that everything is copacetic. However, some disagreements should not be avoided for the sake of maintaining the peace. Express your outrage over someone's inappropriate words or actions after you let off a little steam first. Keep in mind that denying the truth doesn't change the facts, but the delivery of your message matters more than you think."
aquarius,2016-08-11,"The storm clouds of your emotional world are clearing today, opening your mind to the multitude of possibilities that were previously hidden. But seeing further into the future comes with its own paradox and you could be struck with uncharacteristic indecisiveness if there are too many forks in the road. The sooner you can eliminate some options, the easier it will be to make the hard choices in front of you. Follow your dreams, not your fears."
pisces,2016-08-11,"You are being pressed to make a decision about your job or your career, but you might not feel as if you're ready to declare your final choice just yet. You may be tempted to push back, but nothing useful is likely to come from a disagreement between two people arguing over a minor issue that doesn't matter in the long run. Confucius said, ""When anger rises, think of the consequences."" Wisdom is knowing when being right is not worth the trouble."
aries,2016-08-12,"Paradoxically, there are so many options available now you can't seem to decide which one to pursue. A thrilling connection between unpredictable Uranus and jubilant Jupiter has hope springing forth from the farthest reaches of your imagination, teasing you with endless possibilities. Although you're itching to start a new venture, you may be temporarily thwarted in your efforts. Relax into the flow of the universe; your need for unfettered freedom will not wane anytime soon."
taurus,2016-08-12,"Reality imposes itself on you with a vengeance today, requiring accountability for any recent lack of discipline in financial matters. Fortunately, the need for clarification with others fosters a sense of trust and encourages sincere communication. Meanwhile, brilliant ideas flow through your mind like seeds in the wind. It's up to you to catch the best ones and nurture them until they grow into tangible alternatives. Shifting from talk to action creates something lasting out of this deluge of information."
gemini,2016-08-12,"Metaphysical earthquakes can shake your life, upsetting the status quo and inspiring radical change. However, the Moon's conjunction with nay-saying Saturn in your 7th House of Partnerships also brings a person into your life that appears to stand in the way of your progress. Nevertheless, the real obstacles are internal and it's up to you to process your own resistance. If you avoid the temptation to promise more than you can deliver, you'll soon see where the current transformation might lead."
cancer,2016-08-12,"Fully appreciating your current circumstances can be tricky now as boredom motivates you to initiate impulsive action. Although you may be eager to make big changes in your life, it will take time for the long-term effects of today's intentions to manifest. It feels as if you're listening to a different drummer, yet it's wise to save your wildest dancing until you see how everything unfolds. Be patient; once you alter the direction of your new path, it will take on a brilliant life of its own."
leo,2016-08-12,"Your creativity may be blocked by a temporary lack of confidence today, but an unexpected encounter could flip your perspective upside down before you know it. Irrepressible Uranus zaps boisterous Jupiter in your 2nd House of Self-Esteem, suddenly opening the floodgates to self-expression. A person or an idea that seems too outrageous at first can trigger a stroke of genius that elevates your game to the next level. The only limits that exist now are the worn-out constraints of your own mind."
virgo,2016-08-12,"You can turn the sourest of grapes into the sweetest of wine if you're willing to focus on the potential gain instead of the frustration of the present moment. Logically, you realize that a current setback might be in your best interest, even if it doesn't feel so good now. Avoid the temptation to withdraw today; instead, make a commitment to engage in the process of metamorphosis as you free the butterfly from the restraints of the cocoon."
libra,2016-08-12,"You must swallow an unpleasant dose of reality today, but this harsh medicine can help you to stabilize your closest relationships. The Moon's conjunction with pragmatic Saturn in your 3rd House of Immediate Environment requires you to approach your plans in a down-to-earth manner now. The chances for success are excellent if you clearly state your goals to everyone involved. The first step to reaching the mountain's summit is deciding to make the climb. Sharing your aspirations with your supporters makes chasing your dreams more fun."
scorpio,2016-08-12,"It's never too late to manifest positive growth in your career and achieve greater financial stability. The Moon's conjunction with crystallizing Saturn in your 2nd House of Personal Resources is a quiet reminder to conserve your energy while working toward your goals. However, an electric Jupiter-Uranus misalignment is a loud wake-up call that opens your eyes and reveals how much ground you still have to cover. Stay open to changes that can increase your freedom, even if you need to take a calculated risk with money or in love to make the most of this propitious planetary energy."
sagittarius,2016-08-12,"You might consciously decide to maintain a serious attitude today while the Moon is constrained by somber Saturn in your sign. However, you can't seem to make the ripples of excitement disappear as bountiful Jupiter connects with electrifying Uranus. Unfortunately, you may already be overloaded with work and it's not a good idea to voluntarily add anything else to the pile. Nevertheless, you're driven to capture the elusive thrill before the lightning show ends. Staying calm in the midst of a creative storm is your key to receiving the gift of cosmic awareness."
capricorn,2016-08-12,"Someone might throw a monkey wrench of unexpected information into your world today, requiring fast thinking and emotional flexibility on your part. Meanwhile, you're more serious than ever about embracing the power of now and simultaneously creating a positive impact on your future. This alternating pattern of expansion and contraction can feel contradictory, but it blesses you with spiritual insights that are well worth the stress. Ultimately, an unexpected awakening delivered by the shock of Uranus can bring you an enlightened sense of freedom if you're willing to be open to change."
aquarius,2016-08-12,"It's annoying if you can see the amazing alternatives all around you, yet still feel restricted in a way that prevents you from having too much fun. Thankfully, your self-restraint is rewarded if you work hard to fulfill your social and professional obligations. Nevertheless, the weight of heavy responsibility is counterbalanced by buoyant Jupiter's connection to wild Uranus, tantalizing you with mind-blowing possibilities when you look out toward the distant horizon. Logic tells you to avoid the more exciting path, yet your heart won't settle for anything less."
pisces,2016-08-12,"Overcoming criticism may feel like an impossible task, especially since the harder you try today, the farther you seem to wander off course. Ironically, a flexible attitude allows you to find useful solutions within the information explosion generated by the brilliant Jupiter-Uranus alignment. Although your inner voice is warning you to abandon your foolish expectations, rebellious Uranus has little respect for the laws of reality. Spontaneous actions can work against your best interests now, so walk carefully -- don't run -- toward your dreams."
aries,2016-08-13,"You could feel as if you're undergoing an emotional stress test today. Romantic expectations may suddenly deflate as they run into cold, hard truths. But this sobering lesson is only meant to start a process; if love is to last, it must weather the rough patches as well as rejoice when the road is smooth. Nevertheless, the realization that everything is imperfect can create undue ripples of discontent. Face disappointment with an open heart, for any relationship that overcomes difficulties has a greater chance of success in the long run."
taurus,2016-08-13,"You are reluctantly re-evaluating your relationship goals and making necessary adjustments. Forbidding Saturn stresses vulnerable Venus in your 5th House of Play today, leaving you to wonder why you work so hard for emotional satisfaction. You are ready to draw a line because you can't continue to give up ground at home or work, for love or money. Stand up for yourself to gain respect, but do it calmly. Remember your birthright as a Taurus: You don't have to hurry to prove your point. Commit to the long haul; happiness is yours if you make a sincere effort to do your very best."
gemini,2016-08-13,"Your romantic fantasies fall short of reality today, temporarily isolating you from loved ones. Loneliness and self-doubt are possible consequences when your friends don't understand what you need. Thankfully, feelings of rejection won't prevent you from trying to bridge the gulf of misunderstanding. You can't stay sad for long while the uplifting Sagittarius Moon trines uncontainable Uranus and squares jovial Jupiter. Remember Nelson Mandela who said, ""Do not judge me by my successes; judge me by how many times I fell down and got back up again."" Resiliency is your middle name."
cancer,2016-08-13,"No one can soothe your angst today, until you examine your own buried feelings. Lovable Venus in your 3rd House of Communication squares austere Saturn, tempting you to erect walls to protect your heart from rejection. Unfortunately, people might put so much emotional pressure on you that it seems as if you can't do anything right. But retreating into the safety of your shell won't solve anything. There may be such a great sense of urgency that you could make matters worse if you try to suppress your discontent. Author Alice Walker wrote, ""Hard times require furious dancing."""
leo,2016-08-13,"No matter how clever you think you are today, something may prevent you from getting the acknowledgment you deserve. Earning approval requires diligence now as well as talent. Social awkwardness is one possible outcome of the dynamic square between affectionate Venus and demanding Saturn. Dealing with intimacy in relationships can be challenging, but nothing is gained if you pull away from someone you love. Lean into your fear of rejection, for that's where you will find the sweetest rewards. Cherish the treasures of the heart."
virgo,2016-08-13,"It's wise not to make any drastic decisions for a few days, because even the most amazing relationship can ebb and flow now. Family dynamics may be the source of tension when unyielding Saturn squares accountable Venus in your 4th House of Domestic Conditions. Disagreements about your self-expression could arise today, especially if you've neglected your fiscal responsibilities. The underlying stress won't disappear until you give it your undivided attention. Carl Jung wrote, ""What you resists, persists."""
libra,2016-08-13,"Your entire world seems to be grinding to a halt, like reality is trying to teach you a valuable lesson. Meanwhile, your impatience grows; you have no interest in taking the time to negotiate in relationships or balance your bank accounts. Unfortunately, you must do exactly what you wish to avoid today. The stress continues to intensify only because the more pressure you feel now, the more stubborn you become. The paradox is that in showing some of your natural grace and flexibility by yielding to the needs of others, you can better demonstrate your strength and competence."
scorpio,2016-08-13,"Stress levels regarding money and love may be uncomfortably high today as valuable Venus dynamically squares immovable Saturn in your 2nd House of Money and Resources. Unfortunately, you can't easily hide your displeasure now and a simple path to your heart's desire is nowhere to be found. Don't push for resolution; just drag the issues out into the light of day and see what happens. Instead of worrying about everything that could go wrong, keep one eye on the past, one eye on the future, and your feet grounded in the present circumstances."
sagittarius,2016-08-13,"Patiently weighing the costs and benefits of any partnership leads to more responsible decisions today. It's easy to be grumpy while ominous Saturn inhibits pleasure by dynamically squaring off with sensual Venus in your 10th House of Public Status. But recent self-doubt or moodiness isn't sufficient to explain away your nagging dissatisfaction. Nevertheless, irrepressible desires for a new adventure conflict directly with your pressing obligations. Keeping everyone informed of your plans increases your independence without losing your integrity."
capricorn,2016-08-13,"A powerful exchange may leave you feeling shocked and emotionally unsafe today. Thankfully, you can discover a stable place to stand while exacting Saturn and resourceful Venus battle for control. Saturn limits the approval you receive from others, possibly giving you more than one reason to doubt yourself. Running away or pretending you don't care is an easy solution, but courageously digging in and dealing directly with relationship issues will produce more satisfying results."
aquarius,2016-08-13,"A trivial event might remind you of what you lack in your life today. Sweet Venus squares stern Saturn, eliciting feelings of loneliness, even if you're happily involved in an intimate relationship. Additionally, you might not have sufficient funds or time to take a pleasurable vacation you believe you deserve. Whatever obstacles Venus runs into now, don't be too discouraged by the shortcomings of your life. Instead, use this time to clarify what you really need and what you're willing to pay, emotionally and fiscally, in exchange. Counting your blessings cultivates a grateful heart."
pisces,2016-08-13,"You're inspired to push past your usual limits of what you say and do today. You may expose an inconvenient truth or challenge yourself by trying something new. Nevertheless, you can ramble on too long or go too far if you don't temper your enthusiasm with a healthy dose of self-restraint. Stirring conflict or promising to carry a heavier load than you can handle is more foolish than brave unless you stop to consider the consequences of your actions. Stay out of trouble by channeling your passion into your art."
aries,2016-08-14,"Although you strive to make decisions based upon the facts, even the clearest picture is blurred today. Forgive yourself for not being able to discern the truth now, especially when trying to explain your feelings to others. Venus, the planet of personal love, opposes Neptune, the planet of spiritual love, catching you in a fantasy web of your own making. Thankfully, the stable Capricorn Moon in your 10th House of Public Responsibility empowers you to address emotional issues in a logical manner. Check out any assumptions you make about your partner before you act on faulty conclusions. Oscar Wilde wrote, ""Illusion is the first of all pleasures."""
taurus,2016-08-14,"Knowing what you want from others is the key to opening love's door today, yet you must be willing to make reasonable compromises regarding your expectations to find satisfaction. The practical Capricorn Moon fosters stability, but fantasy rules when magnetic Venus opposes enchanting Neptune, making a fairy-tale romance too alluring to resist. Use your imagination to create the future, but don't drift off into dreamland and lose touch with your common sense. To move freely one must be deeply rooted."
gemini,2016-08-14,"Your sharp perceptions are tingling as they help you make sense of recent events. However, separate ideas and images start to weave together in a logical way, revealing the big patterns that show you how to be more efficient in the future. This entangling of thoughts can result in disoriented feelings when needy Venus opposes foggy Neptune in your 10th House of Status, making it difficult to find direction in your search for meaning. Let your imagination and heart guide your next steps.Remember the words of the Dalai Lama who said, ""The purpose of our lives is to be happy."""
cancer,2016-08-14,"It's reasonable to make a sacrifice for love or approval, as long as the other side is willing to meet you halfway. Unfortunately, giving everything with the unrealistic hope that you'll get your fair share in return is not a sustainable strategy. Dreaming and scheming with someone can be a lot of fun now as long as you remain in the world of fantasy without making any serious commitments. Because your emotional sensitivity is even higher today, unsupportive comments could sound harsher to you than intended. Remember, no one can make you feel inferior without your consent."
leo,2016-08-14,"You might be feeling quite hopeful one moment and somewhat doubtful the next. A rational Capricorn Moon is pitted against an irrational Venus-Neptune opposition today, making for a volatile mix of calculated ambition and unavoidable hypersensitivity. One person may seem like a bully while the other plays the role of a victim. Fortunately, you can experience the magic of delight when tenderness toward others is blended with a desire to follow your heart's wishes."
virgo,2016-08-14,"Relationships aren't necessarily all that they appear to be today. You may be quite sweet on someone while romantic Venus in your 1st House of Self opposes spiritual Neptune in your 7th House of Relationships. However, the biggest danger is setting yourself up for future heartache, since fantasies can seem so authentic that they feel palatable. Thankfully, a simple reality check now can minimize the emotional letdown later on. Normal is an illusion; what is normal for the spider is chaos for the fly."
libra,2016-08-14,"You're in a rather somber mood while the Moon is visiting serious Capricorn. You plan on narrowing your options now that Venus is in discriminating Virgo, but her opposition to blurry Neptune makes it nearly impossible to focus on what you want. In your fantasies you can have it all. Nevertheless, there are important matters to consider; although your imagination is extraordinarily vivid today, it's obvious you can't escape the material world. Thankfully, you can choose to worry less about what is currently missing from your life and concentrate on creating a positive future."
scorpio,2016-08-14,"It may be challenging to distinguish between your dreams and reality today, so be careful about believing that all is well if it isn't. Sexy Venus opposes illusory Neptune in your 5th House of Romance, creating a heightened sense of fantasy. You want to experience the ideal union and won't be satisfied with physical pleasure unless the elusive spiritual component is also present. As Bucky Fuller wrote, ""Love is metaphysical gravity."""
sagittarius,2016-08-14,"The spotlight of recognition and appreciation shines on you now that three planets are activating your 10th House of Status. However, Neptune can leave you wildly dejected if your expectations are too high and an opposition from delectable Venus is too idealistic. Nevertheless, exercising a little self-restraint at the right time restores your faith in dreams while simultaneously keeping you realistic about what you can accomplish. Author Thomas Carlyle wrote, ""The greatest of faults is to be conscious of none."""
capricorn,2016-08-14,"Although you might drift into fantasy realms today, you're unlikely to get completely lost in the mists of illusion because the reflective Moon is firmly anchored in your sensible sign. Nevertheless, your heart and soul are gently opening due to an inspiring opposition of delightful Venus to magical Neptune. Don't be afraid to dream; instead of gazing at the distant horizon with no idea how to reach it, trust your imagination's inner map to show you the way."
aquarius,2016-08-14,"You may spend money unwisely today or feel a bit disillusioned by people when receptive Venus opposes deceptive Neptune in your 2nd House of Personal Resources. Fortunately, you are realistic enough to adopt a more practical outlook on life. Nevertheless, there is tension between your desires and your social obligations. Baby doctor, Benjamin Spock, told us all, ""Trust yourself. You know more than you think you do."""
pisces,2016-08-14,"Compassion is admirable, yet quite difficult to maintain if it's not reciprocated in some way. A partner may lack credibility today when vulnerable Venus in your 7th House of Associates opposes slippery Neptune. Knowing what you want and holding people accountable for their actions are essential pieces of the puzzle while the Moon is visiting earthy Capricorn. Remember, you can't afford to have untrustworthy allies when there's so much at stake. Respect is a two-way street."
aries,2016-08-15,"The energy seems to be settling back into place and you're eager to re-establish your daily routine. Although you must work extra hard today, at least you're keeping up with your responsibilities. The more specific you are in your communication with your coworkers, the more you can expect to accomplish. But don't be concerned if your schedule falls apart later in the day; sometimes it's best to just laugh when things don't go the way you planned. Paradoxically, your cheerful flexibility allows changes to occur that make your day turn out even better than you thought possible."
taurus,2016-08-15,"You have a solid idea of how you want your day to unfold and you're not willing to negotiate with anyone. The ability to stand strong with determination is one of your greatest assets. However, today's strength of character is best demonstrated by your ability to adapt to changes as they unfold rather than resisting them. As self-help author Tony Robbins says, ""Stay committed to your decisions, but stay flexible in your approach."""
gemini,2016-08-15,"Although you are known for your talent of keeping things light and breezy, the Moon's conjunction with potent Pluto in your 8th House of Deep Sharing motivates you to dive into an emotional issue today without reserve. Thankfully, words come easily now, enabling you to ask probing questions in a disarming manner. However, you could discover something so shocking that you might wish you didn't dig so deep. Give it time for the new information to sink in; you will be richer in spirit for possessing the truth."
cancer,2016-08-15,"Normally you can handle emotionally intense conversations, even if you hold your own feelings close to the chest. However, you may grow upset today if you are goaded into discussing delicate matters by someone who doesn't know when to stop pushing. You could surprise others -- you might even surprise yourself -- by the intensity of your reaction when you share your discomfort. Never be afraid to express the truth, but always do it with the utmost of respect and kindness."
leo,2016-08-15,"Your coworkers might be quite annoying now, especially if your agenda is different from theirs. Although you prefer it when everyone follows your lead, you're willing to go off on your own in order to stay true to your highest calling. Thankfully, you are working with just the right cosmic balance today that makes you crazy enough to do anything, but sane enough to stick with the tried-and-true. Instead of running to the edge of the cliff, walking there slowly gives you sufficient time to rethink your options. Let your faith be bigger than your fear."
virgo,2016-08-15,"You're still living under the illusion that more information is better than just a little bit. However, several planets in picky Virgo reinforce your desire to hold on to only the most useful data. Don't jump to any conclusions because your perspective will likely change and develop throughout the day. As Atticus said in To Kill a Mockingbird, ""You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view, until you climb into is skin and walk around in it."""
libra,2016-08-15,"You're not interested in revealing too much about your feelings or your plans today as the strategic Moon-Pluto conjunction falls in your 4th House of Roots. In fact, others could see you as a stoic optimist who will not succumb to negative thinking. Although your logic is sound now, you may not reach the best decision unless you open your heart to the love and support that's all around you. Ultimately, you might not even need advice; you just need somebody to listen."
scorpio,2016-08-15,"You have something significant to say about many different subjects today. Although you might prefer to remain quiet in a crowd, you're motivated to share what's on your mind with a receptive audience. You are viewing your world with a very practical lens now and are afraid that others could steer things in a different direction. Think through your message before speaking and be as concise as possible. Don't be dissuaded if you seem to be losing ground. Concentrate on your goal, speak your truth, and others will come around to your position in time."
sagittarius,2016-08-15,"An investment opportunity may come your way today and you would be wise to pursue it with gusto. However, this is not a get-rich-quick scheme; you can't sit by idly and expect money to grow on trees. This is a hands-on chance to turn sweat equity into something of intrinsic value. Once you make a commitment to participate in the project, don't throw in the towel until you reach your goal. The future belongs to those who create it."
capricorn,2016-08-15,"You are prepared to take a strong position on nearly any matter that comes to you for consideration today. In fact, you may react in such an extreme manner that your behavior is upsetting to others. Nevertheless, you're not likely to temper your words; everyone must simply deal with the truth as you see it. Unfortunately, the ruthless Moon-Pluto conjunction in your 1st House of Personality can make you less effective unless you're willing to soften your stance. As Chinese physician and novelist Han Suyin wrote, ""There is nothing stronger in the world than gentleness."""
aquarius,2016-08-15,"You are working with specific goals in mind today, but you're more comfortable keeping them to yourself. The steady Capricorn Moon joins shadowy Pluto in your 12th House of Privacy, amplifying your power as long as you can surround yourself with an air of mystery. Additionally, you don't want to waste energy defending your plan until it has already gained enough momentum that it can't be stopped by someone else's criticism. Wait until the Moon returns to your sign tomorrow before you share any trade secrets."
pisces,2016-08-15,"It actually takes a village to do anything of consequence today. The Moon's conjunction with ruthless Pluto in your 11th House of Community symbolizes the extraordinary power that is generated by a group. Buckminster Fuller coined the word ""synergy"" to mean ""the behavior of whole systems is greater than the sum of its parts."" Nevertheless, things could get out of control for a while, making you wish you had gone solo. Don't deviate from your mission; lead by example and the group will come through to support you in your work."
aries,2016-08-16,"Sometimes you gung-ho Rams can't tell the difference between assertion and aggression. However, your steady persistence is rewarded today because it counterbalances the progressive Sun-Uranus trine which blasts you clear into the future. An odd mixture of strategic planning and impulsive reactions can positively influence your work and help you reach your professional goals. Success doesn't just come and find you; you must go out and get it."
taurus,2016-08-16,"Innovation and common sense work in tandem today. The Sun's harmonious trine to independent Uranus in your 12th House of Fantasy sets your imagination free. Out-of-the-box solutions to stubborn problems empower you to untangle knots in your progress or raise your awareness to new levels of understanding. Unfortunately, all your brilliant concepts are useless now if you don't have the means to make them real. Nevertheless, if you want to achieve your dreams bad enough, you'll find a way rather than an excuse."
gemini,2016-08-16,"It requires courage to reveal your vulnerability instead of just showing off the clever side of your personality. The bighearted Leo Sun, shining in your 3rd House of Communication, motivates you to take chances and talk about your feelings, especially now that it's forming a liberating trine to spontaneous Uranus. Honesty can sometimes be a double-edged sword, but it's easier to build a solid foundation when you come straight from your heart. It takes time to build trust, but it's an essential ingredient in any type of relationship."
cancer,2016-08-16,"You can straddle the divide between caution and risk today by discovering and applying previously untapped talents and abilities. However, the creative Sun in your 2nd House of Self-Worth forms a supportive trine with Uranus, encouraging you to take chances in your professional life. This is your moment to shine; the cosmos is empowering you to be boldly innovative and break out of your familiar shell. As Robert Kennedy said, ""Only those who dare to fail greatly can ever achieve greatly."""
leo,2016-08-16,"Allow yourself as much freedom to dream as you can today. Temporarily letting go of responsibilities gives you the space you need to see your life in a fresh new light. The unconventional Sun-Uranus trine opens your mind, creating an ideal time to release your old self-image, making way for a more amazing version of you with a more adventurous future. Learning to fly looks harder from the ground. Jump and your wings will appear."
virgo,2016-08-16,"Although your thoughts are truly brilliant now, people may not be able to understand what you're saying unless you simplify your concepts. Instead of rushing ahead in a flurry of words, slow down and explain everything methodically. Although a thrilling Sun-Uranus trine opens doors that were previously locked, it's still up to you to be careful so you can make the most of this more permissive environment. Today is an opportunity that vanishes tomorrow; don't waste one moment second-guessing yourself."
libra,2016-08-16,"You're hesitant to come out and say what's on your mind today because you're worried about people misunderstanding your intentions. Although you might send subtle signals of interest to someone so you won't be noticed by others, your actions may be more obvious than you think. Luckily, a stroke of genius suddenly reveals a way for you to break free of an unpleasant situation as the Sun trines rebellious Uranus in your 7th House of Others. For once, it's better to say too much now than nothing at all."
scorpio,2016-08-16,"It's as if a lightning rod is attracting unexpected events and encouraging radical behavior at work. Although this cosmic interference might normally be disturbing, the Sun's superconductive trine to electrifying Uranus is thrilling as it lights up your mind with original answers to existing questions. But don't waste this energy on attention-seeking antics; keep your ego in check and just do your job to the best of your ability. Success can be yours if you don't become arrogant or expect everything to fall your way. Humility is your friend."
sagittarius,2016-08-16,"Don't wait for someone else to rush in and save the day today. The dramatic Leo Sun's trine to radical Uranus calls for bold action that produces both emotional and financial rewards. Although you may be inspired by the vibrant Leo Sun's presence in your 9th House of Big Ideas, its awkward aspect to wounded Chiron leaves you uncertain about the value of your actions. Fortunately, your amazing ideas are the proof of the pudding if you trust in yourself. Doubt kills more dreams than failure ever will."
capricorn,2016-08-16,"There is chemistry at work today if you're open to the spontaneity of the moment. Collaborating closely with a creative partner sparks contagious excitement and fascinating ideas while the willful Sun in your 8th House of Shared Resources trines brilliant Uranus. Make sure to record your conversations for future use or the genius of the moment could be lost into space forever. As Dante wrote, ""He listens well who takes notes."""
aquarius,2016-08-16,"You can take giant leaps over huge hurdles while the confident Sun in creative Leo forms a mind-opening trine with revolutionary Uranus. When you devote your heart and head to a cause, the obstacles you encounter are no match for the strength of your convictions. You're ready to carve out a unique path into the future that fully expresses your originality.

Seek out new experiences, but proceed with caution, so you don't do anything you'll soon regret."
aries,2016-08-17,"Prepare to journey to the bottom of the Sea of Mysteries today. You probably won't be very comfortable during this excursion, but you know it's something you must do to clear the air of hidden feelings. More emotions are brought to the surface than you prefer when compelling Venus trines dark Pluto, but you could return smiling from an unforgettable experience. As author Jack Canfield writes, ""Everything you want is on the other side of fear."""
taurus,2016-08-17,"Although you are usually willing to wait for what you want, you may lose your cool as the energy builds prior to tomorrow's Full Moon. A perceptive Venus-Pluto trine enables you to see through the apparent niceties in a romantic relationship, urging you to say what's left unsaid. Thankfully, your ability to cut past superficial issues and get to the heart of the matter offers closure that has been out of reach. Wake up with determination and go to bed with satisfaction."
gemini,2016-08-17,"Surprisingly, you're not in the mood for casual flirtations today. You need to make deeper connections as sensual Venus in laser-like Virgo dances into the shadows of unfathomable Pluto, intensifying your desires. Your eagerness to sink into heavier feelings without analyzing them allows you to overcome your fear of emotional vulnerability. Don't try to escape the complexity of the moment or you could miss the treasure that's waiting for your discovery. Stay fully engaged until the darkness transforms into the light of awareness."
cancer,2016-08-17,"Listening to a piece of friendly advice may help you become aware of resources you didn't realize you possessed. Hopefully you are ready to repair a relationship while diplomatic Venus forms a creative trine with regenerative Pluto. Thankfully, you are capable of processing deep feelings now without upsetting the status quo. Relationship problems are more easily resolved and you can address difficult issues with the power and self-control required to produce the desired outcome. Compassion is the key to your success."
leo,2016-08-17,"A friend or partner might not respond as expected, raising uncharacteristic feelings of insecurity. This wave of self-doubt comes at an inconvenient time because an intense Venus-Pluto connection adds undeniable passion to everything you touch today. You don't want to show your feelings because it only puts you in a more vulnerable position. However, maintaining integrity is more important than anything else now that Venus is visiting your 2nd House of Self-Esteem. Telling the truth may be awkward at first, but the emotional dynamics will quickly improve once everything is out in the open."
virgo,2016-08-17,"You are not afraid to step into the darker realms of your suppressed desires today. The love planet, Venus, creates an easy trine with intense Pluto to help you overcome complacency and make your needs known. Thankfully, the Aquarius Moon expands your perspective, allowing you to express yourself with sufficient detachment so others won't be overwhelmed by your disclosure. Deep emotional transformation is just around the corner if you possess the clarity of mind to choose growth over stagnation."
libra,2016-08-17,"You may experience intense desires today, yet you must settle your thoughts in order to enjoy the richness of the experience. Although you're likely to be extra passionate about your cause now, you're also aware that there's a fine line between making your case and sounding like a fanatic. Fortunately, you're able to take care of emotional business productively when Venus in analytical Virgo forms a charming trine with shrewd Pluto. This favorable alignment can also make you highly persuasive without seeming the least bit pushy to anyone around you."
scorpio,2016-08-17,"You're able to convey your strong passions to others today, yet you're not so overwhelmed by your own feelings that you sacrifice your good judgment in the process. Sharp perception shows you the potential in people that others can't see, while a profound awareness of what you need makes it simple to screen out distractions to get what you want. It's almost as if you can't go wrong as desirous Venus aligns in a harmonious trine with fierce Pluto, allowing you to apply your emotions intelligently. Repair a damaged relationship or strengthen a healthy one to take intimacy to a deeper level."
sagittarius,2016-08-17,"You excel at the art of persuasion today, and can easily convince others to give you the additional support you need. Stating your professional goals clearly entices the doubters to fall in line as they join your parade. The synergistic trine between magnetic Venus and passionate Pluto rewards you by revitalizing a valuable business relationship or setting a new one into place. Your talent for creating success through connections with others is solidified if you allow the energy to flow without restriction. It takes two sides to make a bridge."
capricorn,2016-08-17,"You need to stop and make a decision before proceeding any further if your path to the future is still uncertain. Powerful Pluto in your sign is busy networking with resourceful Venus in your 9th House of Distant Horizons, reminding you to trust your feelings when it comes to setting long-term goals. As the Roman philosopher Seneca wrote, ""If one does not know to which port one is sailing, no wind is favorable."" Sink into your feelings; create a vibrant vision of your desired destination in your mind and make a promise to yourself to see your dream come to life."
aquarius,2016-08-17,"You might feel quite vulnerable today, and your drive for intensity could arouse issues that connect love with power. Addressing your fears can be highly therapeutic, especially if you are able to bring your most secret desires out into the light while the soulful Moon is visiting your sign. Stop thinking about all of the alternatives; you already know what you need to do. Expressing your hidden feelings deepens a relationship as Venus forms a restorative trine to resurrecting Pluto. Don't build unnecessary walls between you and those you love."
pisces,2016-08-17,"Strong emotional undercurrents take you on a transformational journey today. You're not willing to accept ""no"" for an answer when sensual Venus forms a smooth trine to demanding Pluto, strengthening your desires. Unfortunately, it could be difficult to handle these intense feelings while the Moon is visiting emotionally detached Aquarius. But you may be pleasantly surprised with the results if you express your current dissatisfaction instead of suppressing the darker side of your attractions. It's lack of communication, not distance, that keeps people apart."
aries,2016-08-18,"You might think you have not done enough work, but there is only one more hurdle to jump before you are given the green light on the road to your destination. The Aquarius Full Moon activates your 11th House of Long-Term Goals, urging you to envision the future and the steps you will need to take to make your dreams come true.

taurus,2016-08-18,"It appears as if someone is pushing you to take on additional responsibilities. Don't promise more than you can deliver now, even if you are willing to sacrifice some playtime to fulfill your obligations. Social demands may trigger your desire to retreat from the crowd. But it's nearly impossible to remain isolated when the Aquarius Full Moon draws your energy from the subjective personal realms into your 10th House of Public Life, where you are more concerned with the objective issues of community and career. As George Eliot wrote, ""It is never too late to be what you might have been."""
gemini,2016-08-18,"Old fantasies are being washed away to make room for new dreams. The detached Aquarius Full Moon shakes up your 9th House of Higher Truth, reminding you that enthusiasm doesn't necessarily alter reality. Your patterns of perception are changing; being more skeptical now isn't a turn toward cynicism, but breaking with outdated ideas makes way for a fresh view of the world. Thankfully, responsibilities that previously held you back are now relaxing their grip. Don't rush your first steps on your journey or you will be required to repeat them in the days ahead."
cancer,2016-08-18,"You're capable of setting your pride aside today so you can talk about your needs. Fortunately, the Aquarius Full Moon lands in your 8th House of Intimacy, encouraging you to reveal your heart as you strive to express your individuality. Although this is likely the beginning of a more outgoing cycle for you Crabs, emotional tension boils over if you try to ignore your true feelings. Fear of change might be prompting you to overreact, but burying your head in the sand is not helpful. Adaptability in the face of adversity is your greatest ally."
leo,2016-08-18,"Don't try to overcome a sudden cooling of interest from a person you admire by being too aggressive in your approach. The Aquarius Full Moon falls in your 7th House of Partnerships, triggering unexpected behavior from a lover or a close friend. Or maybe you need to step back and look at things from a different angle to add more excitement to the relationship. Unfortunately, digging in your heels is not the answer; letting go of control is a must. Persistence, one of your greatest strengths, might actually be a weakness now. Pride is the longest distance between two people."

The Aquarius Full Moon in your 6th House of Health can overwhelm you with a wide variety of different options about your daily routines.

libra,2016-08-18,"You have run out of patience when it comes to people breaking promises, yet you might be ready to break a few of your own. The unconventional Aquarius Full Moon falls in your 5th House of Self-Expression, bringing out the quirky and playful side of your personality. Your craving for fun and attention is hard to ignore, possibly creating tension with your desire for privacy. But you have the right to take center stage, and then retreat when you so choose. It's fine to shine in the spotlight on occasion as long as you have an exit strategy in place."
scorpio,2016-08-18,"You might not fully understand what's unfolding on the home front now. However, once you accept that the emotional dynamics are beyond rational analysis, you'll be able to glean important lessons from your experience. The quirky Aquarius Full Moon sinks into your 4th House of Foundations, surrounding you with a complicated array of alternatives.

Nevertheless, the Aquarius Full Moon inspires your 3rd House of Information, encouraging you to ask tough questions and seek honest answers. Just remember: opinions are just ideas attached to a belief. Sharing your thoughts without taking yourself too seriously produces the best results. Buddha said, ""The root of suffering is attachment."""
capricorn,2016-08-18,"You may discover discrepancies with joint finances when the independent Aquarius Full Moon rattles your 2nd House of Money. Your problem might be as simple as feeling annoyed if someone is too careless with cash for your taste. Nevertheless, it's important to keep your reaction in check since an irritating Moon-Jupiter aspect possibly tricks you into believing you discovered a quick fix to the monetary crisis. Deviating from a budget can drain your resources, leaving you overspent in more ways than one. Saving money saves energy."
aquarius,2016-08-18,"Melodrama runs rampant while the partial Lunar Eclipse in Aquarius polarizes your sign. This overstimulating Full Moon occurs in your 1st House of Personality, drawing your emotions very close to the surface. Others can see past your apparent detachment now. Your discomfort in dealing with your feelings could turn your frustration into anger as hot Mars moves to conjunct cold Saturn next week. As Tom Petty sings, ""The waiting is the hardest part."" Make sure to utilize your wicked sense of humor as often as possible."
pisces,2016-08-18,"You want to break free from the past and apply your vision to a higher cause when you are coaxed to express your feelings more openly. Your lifelong pursuit of spiritual meaning is reinvigorated as the cosmos delivers you an inspirational message. However, you might be tempted to run away from the monotony of your daily tasks now. Although the rebellious Aquarius Full Moon rattles your 12th House of Secrets, escaping is not a viable long-term solution. A head full of fears has no space for dreams."
aries,2016-08-19,"You're desperately aiming to finish up your work before the weekend, but it's no easy matter to maintain your focus today. Your emotions are being dragged all over the place as people seem to come out of the woodwork just to create trouble. You might be unable to fit all the pieces of the puzzle back into place at first. However, you'll surely learn an important lesson about single-mindedness if you simply set your priorities early in the day. You can't win unless you're willing to be in the game."
taurus,2016-08-19,"Although you might try to be rational, there's no straight path to success today. Normally, your steady-as-she-goes demeanor is enough to keep you on track and everything in your world moving forward. But this strategic method only seems to land you further behind now. Nevertheless, there is hope -- assuming you're ready to surrender control. Paradoxically, you will soar through the day with flying colors if you can stay open to the idea of change."
gemini,2016-08-19,"A pile of responsibilities at work leaves little time for any other activities today. You're probably not very happy about needing to postpone personal pleasure while the spacey Pisces Moon reminds you how much fun it is to just hang out with friends. But don't get overly attached to everyone else's expectations; in the final analysis, there's only one person to whom you are beholden. When you feel a sense of proud accomplishment, your satisfaction will rub off on others."
cancer,2016-08-19,"So many thoughts are running around inside your head that you don't know where to start. Each time you begin a conversation today, it feels as if you should have said something else. It's like you're trying to sing karaoke yet the music keeps changing every time you sing a few notes. Nevertheless, don't quit when you are so close to expressing your creativity; your unwavering perseverance will pay off in the long run. Failure is not the opposite of success; it's a stepping stone to success."
leo,2016-08-19,"You are on a mission and will not be lured off track by anyone's insistence or attempts at persuasion. However, a morning of fuzzy thinking gets you off to such a slow start that you're unsure if you will make any progress today. Luckily, this is a great opportunity to put your thoughts in order once and for all. But keep in mind there won't be any overnight miracles now; the work isn't glamorous and you must reach your goals the good old-fashioned way. Sweat plus sacrifice equals success."
virgo,2016-08-19,"Household responsibilities are multiplying faster than you can keep up with them. Thankfully, you don't need to finish every last chore today, just make sure you get a good start on them. Meanwhile, a close friend or partner may serve up an outrageous idea that's out of the question in its original form. Relentlessly bring every new option back down to the ground by assessing the pros and cons. Pursue only the ones that make practical sense after running it past your critical eye. Your standards are high for a reason."
libra,2016-08-19,"You want to work on your own today because you believe you will stay focused if you don't encounter a lot of distractions. However, you still may require some support along the way to recharge your spirits when you're feeling depleted. Instead of just declining all invitations now, do what you Libras do best. Put yourself in the middle of the extremes by carefully balancing your social obligations with your personal desires. If you play your cards right, you can have your cake and eat it too."
scorpio,2016-08-19,"You're connecting the dots with your peers today -- at work or in the neighborhood. Either way, you're a part of a larger cause that reinforces your personal identity. However, you still must leave fringe facets of your personality out of your interactions because others might not approve. But there's no reason to compromise your fundamental core values, for that's where you derive your strength. You can't understand the power of a community until you become a proud member of one."
sagittarius,2016-08-19,"It seems as if you are nearing the finish line on a marathon at work, but you can't slow down yet. There are a few more hurdles to overcome before you can take a rest and catch your breath. You're in tune with your emotional roots now, whether they stem from family or business. But either way, you may be slightly out of your element. Face it, you can't fit a round peg in a square hole, and the sooner you realize this, the happier you will be. Embracing what makes you unique gives everyone else the chance to do the same."
capricorn,2016-08-19,"Making plans can be a real challenge if you're unsure of your destination; nevertheless, you might go ahead and try to create a road map anyhow. Unfortunately, putting the cart before the horse is not the most effective method of transportation. Take a few steps back and consider all the possibilities for your next adventure. There's no reason to obsess over the details until the larger pieces of the puzzle all fit together."
aquarius,2016-08-19,"It's safer to delve into the emotional realms if you narrow your vision and concentrate on one aspect of your feelings at a time. But even if you're certain that your new conversational topic isn't controversial, the discussion still takes a weird turn and you find yourself in a dangerous metaphysical neighborhood. Keep aiming your thoughts upward toward the sky; dismiss any negativity or doubt from your mind. Difficult roads often lead to beautiful destinations."
pisces,2016-08-19,"You can't trust others today because their plans seem out of touch with reality. But once you thoroughly vet someone's idea, you might actually discover they are on to something brilliant. Naturally, you don't want to waste energy on a wild goose chase that leads you nowhere in particular, but neither do you want to miss out on an unexpected opportunity. Exercising caution at the beginning of a conversation can save you endless hours of not getting anywhere at all. Performing your due diligence pays off."
aries,2016-08-20,"You can tell that your world is in flux because there are more positive possibilities ahead now than negative ones. What seemed nearly impossible just yesterday is more than likely today. You don't feel like you're just glossing over the bad news; something is really shifting and you want to be a part of it. This is no time to idly stand by and wait for opportunity to knock on your door. President Abraham Lincoln said, ""The best way to predict the future is to create it."""
taurus,2016-08-20,"You are often content to follow the letter of the law. In fact, sometimes the social restraints add to your productivity because you accomplish more when you're feeling safe and secure than when you're uncertain about your role. Nevertheless, you might attempt to bend the rules today, especially if you're ready to try something entirely new. Your out-of-the-box behavior could surprise others, but people will stop criticizing you once they see your genius at work. Maintain your integrity and you will win over even your loudest detractors."
gemini,2016-08-20,"Although your thinking is a bit more cautious now, you still realize you will need to take a risk to get what you want. You might be tempted to run with your first idea when deciding what to do today. However, you can take a simple thought and inflate it into one that is so unrealistic that there is little chance of it manifesting. Thankfully, the potential for success grows throughout the day. Keep refining your best plans and then swing into action, but not until your heart says yes."
cancer,2016-08-20,"It's refreshing when your social and domestic commitments don't stand in the way of your active inner life. Fantasies continue to spin a web of enchantment today, even if you keep snapping your thoughts back to reality. Luckily, you are quite discerning now and can easily separate facts from fancy; nevertheless, you're still eager to slip off into your daydreams whenever you get the chance. Give yourself permission to come and go between both worlds as needed. But don't let this propitious moment pass without taking action that moves you closer to your goals."
leo,2016-08-20,"There's a palpable uneasiness in the air; your heart is open and ready to reveal its truth but you just don't know how to put your feelings into words. It might be frustrating at first because you want others to see the real you rather than how you outwardly appear. Instead of spiraling into uncertainty, continue to explore your emotions as they deepen and change. If you are patient with yourself, you might just discover that your behavior is expressing everything you wanted to say. Sometimes actions really do speak louder than words."
virgo,2016-08-20,"You take great comfort in knowing the facts and sticking to them in all that you do. However, you might be challenged to determine where reality ends and your dreams begin while bombastic Jupiter blows details out of proportion. Fortunately, you can stretch the truth in creative ways today, enabling you to find ingenious solutions to the same problems that stumped you yesterday. Let your faith be bigger than your fear."
libra,2016-08-20,"There's no urgency to share all your fantasies today; in fact, one of the most thrilling parts of your private explorations is knowing that you can keep them entirely to yourself. Nevertheless, it certainly could be more fun if you tell your dreams to someone you trust. However, you don't really know what might happen if you open the door to your inner world. Although you might be judged or even rejected, you also could be embraced for your courage. The risk of saying nothing is the greatest risk of all."
scorpio,2016-08-20,"You're ready to fly today, even if you have multiple destinations in mind. In fact, you're so eager to launch into your future that your lack of wings might not even be enough to stop you. Paradoxically, you're not interested in making it up as you go. Although optimistic Jupiter encourages impatient Mars to make a move, you can feel the weight of consequences lurking around the corner. You know that irresponsible behavior won't serve you well. Continue to consider all the options until one stands out so far above the rest that you know it's yours."
sagittarius,2016-08-20,"Although all signals appear to be giving you the green light today, you feel the looming conjunction of hot Mars and cold Saturn close on your tail. You want to join a party already in progress or head off on a little adventure of your own, but common sense prevails when it comes to your calendar. Nevertheless, you can still enjoy the evening, with or without others, as long as you maintain control over your schedule. Don't rush anything now; everything will fall into place when the time is right."
capricorn,2016-08-20,"The more grandiose the adventure, the more eager you are to embark. You're typically the realistic one who needs to keep your feet on the ground. However, you're tired of always coloring within the lines. You like the idea of loosening up and wandering off the beaten path now. Sometimes it feels good to relax and have faith that everything will turn out for the best. Just make sure to keep the end game in mind. If you need to reclaim control for any reason, you can be back in the driver's seat in a moment's notice."
aquarius,2016-08-20,"Surprising others with your eclectic beliefs or your open-minded approach to life never gets old. Thankfully, you have a chance to test the limits today when sharing your feelings with a family member or close friend. You're particularly aware that rules of etiquette can make it easier to mask complicated emotions. However, your curiosity allows you to play with the edges as you explore the deeper side of relationships. Nevertheless, remember that pushing your boundaries doesn't mean it's okay to push anyone else's."
pisces,2016-08-20,"You're intrigued by someone's invitation today because it sounds like so much fun. The timing might be perfect because you're looking forward to doing something special now. However, there could be more going on than meets the eye. Be certain that everyone's agenda is on the table from the beginning since it may be awkward to change your mind once you say yes. Thankfully, your actions have more immediate consequences as the day progresses, so don't hesitate to speak your truth and act accordingly."
aries,2016-08-21,"Your plans begin to take shape as your impulsive reactions gain momentum throughout the day. Stabilizing Saturn enters the picture today, enabling you to construct a solid foundation on which to build your future. Although you are feeling your oats now that the Moon has returned to your incorrigible sign, her meeting with shadowy Pluto can hijack your efforts and significantly alter your priorities. Continue to keep your eyes on the final destination. Eliminating distractions as they arise improves your chances for success."
taurus,2016-08-21,"You don't like to be pushed into anything against your will, even if it's for your own good. Although you possess the good sense not to resist earlier in the day, you might grow resentful later when you wish you were doing anything else. But rather than obsessing about your current uncertainty, shift your attention to someone or something you can count on. There's no need to create a drama where there isn't one."
gemini,2016-08-21,"You're excited about the prospects of doing something special with a close friend or relative today. However, there's no need to use your current plans to escape from previous promises. In fact, fulfilling your obligations early in the day frees you up to travel the outer edges of your mental explorations later on. But don't try to convince anyone that your philosophy is the only one that matters. Although you might not see how all the separate pieces of your life are interrelated in this moment, you will understand soon enough. Patience is the companion of wisdom."
cancer,2016-08-21,"You're ready to spread your wings and fly today, yet run into complex dynamics that force you to change your plans. You could encounter delays that turn out to be the result of someone covertly working against your efforts. However, you can't face an unseen enemy; it's like shadow boxing with an invisible opponent. Instead of looking outside yourself for answers, explore your own resistance to success. When you understand your fears, the external obstacles will likely fade away. As Carl Jung wrote, ""We always see our own unavowed mistakes in our opponent."""
leo,2016-08-21,"You're eager to go the extra mile today because you see the potential for beauty everywhere you look. Fortunately, you can rely on your solid thinking as long as you don't let the current spontaneity of the Aries Moon run off with your day. But Luna harmonizes with feisty Mars and authoritarian Saturn in your 5th House of Self-Expression, urging you to bust out of your self-imposed restraints. It's challenging to find the Goldilocks point where everything is exactly just right. Perfection is in the eyes of the beholder."
virgo,2016-08-21,"You're in an odd state of mind now because you want to mingle with interesting people yet have no patience for any opinions that conflict with your own. You could end up planning to attend a social event, only to back out at the last moment when you realize the same old people will be in attendance. You currently crave the excitement that goes along with rubbing elbows with new and different people, and you won't even have a chance to do so if you're at home sitting on the sofa. Forget about all the logical reasons to turn down an invitation today; just smile and say yes."
libra,2016-08-21,"You don't usually mind redirecting love and admiration away from yourself and onto your friend or partner. However, you grow annoyed now when someone else consistently tries to commandeer the center of attention. The spontaneous Aries Moon shines in your 7th House of Others, drawing the crowd's attention elsewhere and you don't like feeling as if you're invisible. There's no need to fight against the natural flow of energy since you will attract your fair share of recognition soon enough. A candle loses nothing by lighting another candle."
scorpio,2016-08-21,"Your mental bandwidth is narrowly focused on all the things you must finish today. Separately, each item sounds manageable, but all together they seem so daunting that you might not know where to begin. A little forethought is a good idea, but too much thinking now sets major delays into motion and places you even further behind the eight ball. Don't worry about the problems you encounter; you can successfully handle them one at a time. Author Saul Bellow wrote, ""Whoever wants to reach a distant goal must take small steps."""
sagittarius,2016-08-21,"You're flying off into the wild blue yonder today, but you only have a small amount of gas in your tank. The planetary emphasis on Fire signs ensures you won't be lacking for wonderful activities to capture your imagination. However, building pressure from the mid-week Mars-Saturn conjunction is already slowing your progress and forcing you to be hyperaware of every move you make. Easy does it for the next couple of days if you want the magic to last."
capricorn,2016-08-21,"Ingenious ideas are buzzing around inside your head now, but you may be insecure about sharing them with anyone else. The pioneering Aries Moon is traveling through your 4th House of Foundations, empowering you to explore creative options at home. Although this might sound contradictory, there is so much you can do without venturing far into the world. Unfortunately, refusing is tricky if someone insists that you participate in his or her adventure. As Paulo Coelho writes, ""When you say yes to others, make sure you are not saying no to yourself."""
aquarius,2016-08-21,"Everything seems to be fine today until you open your mouth. The bossy Aries Moon in your 3rd House of Communication squares unrelenting Pluto, bringing hidden issues out into the blinding light of day. You might be surprised when you run into negativity from someone you thought was a friend. Nevertheless, it's impossible to overcome a problem unless you identify it. Better the devil you know than the devil you don't."
pisces,2016-08-21,"You might try to power your way through a tricky situation today, but somehow keep stalling at the same point in your process. It doesn't even seem to help when others cheer you on from the sidelines. In fact, the support you receive encourages you to keep pushing in the same ineffective manner, setting you up for a fall. Fortunately, there's a lesser known way to reach your goals; working smarter, not harder all but guarantees your success."
aries,2016-08-22,"You are so focused on doing a good job today that you can get lost in even the smallest task. Learning how to adjust your methods at work is especially important once the Sun moves into modest Virgo to join an ongoing planetary party in your 6th House of Service. This is an excellent time to sharpen old skills and develop new ones. But getting attention is not the same as getting results. When you make a good impression, follow up with hard work to maximize the return on your efforts."
taurus,2016-08-22,"While it's smart to have the right data at your fingertips, too much information can weigh you down and prevent you from reacting spontaneously. The way in which you see your world determines how you live in it. Naturally, you want to take responsibility and do what's expected of you. However, it's also beneficial to make time for fun when the Sun dances into virtuous Virgo and your 5th House of Fun and Games. Never get so busy making a living that you forget to make a life."
gemini,2016-08-22,"Redefining your relationship with your home and family entails a complex mix of thinking and feeling. However, you receive a convincing invitation to reality when the Sun moves into pragmatic Virgo and your 4th House of Security. Thankfully, observing how your subconscious mind operates can help you turn anxiety into opportunity. Recognizing and respecting the line between enthusiasm and hyperactivity actually makes it possible to enjoy the thrills of discovery without losing your perspective or scattering your energy."
cancer,2016-08-22,"No matter how busy you think you are now, the cosmos is raising the ante and you will soon be even busier. There's no time to rest once the Sun rushes into your 3rd House of Immediate Environment, making it nearly impossible to keep up with everything that's happening. Be prepared to pass up a chance for career advancement if the trade-off is to keep your life in balance. Every lucrative possibility that comes along isn't necessarily the right one for you. Making informed choices today means no regrets tomorrow."
leo,2016-08-22,"The best way to collaborate with individuals who are working with ideas contrary to your position is to balance your joyful creativity with objectivity and common sense. The Sun's shift into prudent Virgo and your 2nd House of Resources reminds you to attend to pressing financial matters while they are still manageable. Of course, being thrifty today helps, but upgrading your present arsenal of skills or learning an entirely new trade is even more financially beneficial in the long run. Be so busy improving yourself that you have no time to criticize others."
virgo,2016-08-22,"Easy Street might appear to be around the next corner, motivating you to take a shortcut and make a mad dash for the finish line. Unfortunately, this impatient move is not wise -- opposing forces may be stronger than you realize. Proceed with caution, instead of trying to force progress today. Sometimes you can make a sensible decision by lining up all the alternatives and rationally eliminating them one by one. However, you're better off now entertaining each possibility on its own merits as it appears. Carl Jung wrote, ""Synchronicity is an ever present reality for those who have eyes to see it."""
libra,2016-08-22,"Take some time away from the maddening crowds for a hefty dose of self-reflection now. Engaging in a spiritual practice counterbalances the high levels of personal and professional activity that are bound to keep you hopping throughout this month. Nevertheless, serious matters demand your attention with the Sun's presence in methodical Virgo and your 12th House of Privacy. Make adjustments if you're helping others without getting anything in return. Healthy relationships depend on mutual support and respect."
scorpio,2016-08-22,"Your future is brighter than you realize even if your plans are up in the air. Your fears about the direction of your life may be exacerbated now; thankfully, you can rely on your inner voice to come through with sound advice. Listening to your intuition helps you resist the temptation to overstep your current boundaries and enables you to proceed with sensible caution. Nevertheless, you will go places you never dreamed if you can stay open to change."
sagittarius,2016-08-22,"Brilliant insights pop out of thin air while your nerves are stretched tight by practical issues. Taking center stage seems natural now that the hardworking Virgo Sun is shining in your 10th House of Career. Concentrating on immediate tasks while polishing your skills raises your status on the job, but a lack of focus could reduce your effectiveness. If you aspire to turn your life in a radical new direction, lay down a solid foundation with disciplined competence to create a future that aligns with your dreams."
capricorn,2016-08-22,"The future is now and you're ready to apply the principles that you hold most dear. Thankfully, practical intelligence is a gift of the Sun's entry into technically astute Virgo and your 9th House of Higher Mind. Mapping out the details of a complex journey comes easily today; you're primed to learn from the best and can be an effective teacher for those who lack your skills and experience. Step up to the plate; it's your turn to manifest positive change in your life and in the world around you."
aquarius,2016-08-22,"Being flexible enough to shift from making plans for the future to addressing the nuts and bolts of present logistics is essential for creating more effective alliances now. But general principles give way to concrete pragmatism as the Sun shifts into earthy Virgo and your 8th House of Shared Resources. Blaming others isn't helpful if reality doesn't match up to your expectations. The ""Lazy Man's Guide to Enlightenment"" reminds us, ""What happens is not as important as how you react to what happens."""
pisces,2016-08-22,"All types of relationships find their way into the spotlight now. The Sun's entry into ethical Virgo and your 7th House of Companions starkly illuminates the complex dynamics of your partnerships, while encouraging you to work through unresolved issues with others. Discovering a new truth can be a powerful source of inspiration, but testing it diligently will reveal whether it's actually useful or just a passing thought. Your priorities might change even if you don't."
aries,2016-08-23,"It's easy to forget your real worth now if you're confused by a spiral of self-doubt. Although you may be the target of someone's negativity, other people's actions might actually be a reminder to examine your own role in the current conflict. Don't succumb to the temptation of escaping into indulgences or denial. Instead, buckle down and overcome the resistance by tackling your obligations one at a time in an orderly manner. Work hard in silence; let your success be your noise."
taurus,2016-08-23,"Your inner work is preparing you to make external changes that involve others in your life. Although this emotional process should be relatively straightforward while the Moon is visiting your determined sign, you could meet one challenge after another now. Don't even consider quitting, no matter how weary you are of confronting adversity. The looming Mars-Saturn conjunction is one of the best transits for concentration and productivity, even if you're annoyed about how the current circumstances are unfolding. Put your suppressed anger to good use and you will be blessed with something lasting to show for it."
gemini,2016-08-23,"A sudden realization reveals a radical solution to an existing problem today. But you must consistently follow through on your intentions or people will lose faith in you. A hard-core conjunction between expressive Mars and repressive Saturn imposes limits that separate truth from fiction now. Relationships can be tested by a lack of trust or by mounting stress; if you value the connection, focus on fixing the situation instead of adding more emotional fuel to the fire. St. Thomas Aquinas wrote, ""A man has free choice to the extent that he is rational."""
cancer,2016-08-23,"An out-of-the-box breakthrough at work drives home the idea that you can do anything you set your mind to now. However, hot-to-trot Mars pushes against the cooling authority of Saturn, causing frustration to build to a breaking point. Resolving your dilemma seems impossible today, for there's no easy way to express your feelings without creating an unwanted negative response in return. Take a walk, engage in strenuous exercise, or do some yoga -- anything that burns off excess energy. Ultimately, the solutions based on meticulous planning combined with hard work are the ones that will accomplish the most."
leo,2016-08-23,"You might believe your new plan will solve all that ails you. However, a tough Mars-Saturn hookup in your 5th House of Self-Expression puts an end to any pie-in-the-sky thinking. Forget about making grand gestures and fulfilling your desire to be king of the jungle. Instead, just take the practical route and focus all your energy now on overcoming the obstacles in front of you. This is your time to squash the lingering resistance that prevents you from experiencing happiness. As Gandhi said, ""Satisfaction lies in the effort, not in the attainment. Full effort is full victory."""
virgo,2016-08-23,"Escaping to an exotic location might sound like the spiritual antidote you need now, but the practical realities of your life won't allow such irresponsible behavior. Assertive Mars joins up with make-it-real Saturn in your 4th House of Foundations, requiring you to take a small but solid step toward upgrading your domestic life. Strengthen family bonds by working for a common cause. Choose your actions carefully, for anything put into motion now will produce positive results, as long as you don't expect it to be an overnight success."
libra,2016-08-23,"You may experience a heightened sense of frustration now as energetically expressive Mars slams into the confines of Saturn's walls. This is not the best time to push your opinions on others. Easing up in your approach helps to create the enduring impact you hope to achieve. Don't wag your tongue or scatter your energies; instead, focus your intentions and act with conviction. Handling issues with serious determination can finally free you from the constraints that have limited your success in the past."
scorpio,2016-08-23,"You prefer to keep your vulnerabilities hidden under lock and key, but they can still find a way to surface. Although you may be managing a crisis in the material world, there are other issues to consider now. While you could be short of cash or feel restrained by someone who isn't acknowledging your true worth, the real dilemma is your inability to just be yourself. Remember, you might be bringing leftover feelings of rejection into this new situation. Forgiving the past empowers you to face the present with compassion for everyone you encounter. Loving others starts with loving yourself."
sagittarius,2016-08-23,"Choices made now are likely to have long-term consequences, especially regarding your career. Sobering Saturn anchors impulsive Mars in your inspirational sign, so don't expect a success story to develop if you act out of haste. The bigger the commitment, the more cautious you should be about making it. If you feel competitive juices flowing or your adrenaline rising, contain the excitement so you can direct it with clear purpose and maximum control. Channel your passion into your work."
capricorn,2016-08-23,"A complex combination of overreaction and self-restraint makes for an emotionally trying day. The planetary pressure builds and you could feel either confined or ignored as assertive Mars meets up with oppressive Saturn. Use these conflicting energies in a constructive manner by hatching a plan that is consistent with your destiny as you see it. This moment in time is just the start of a long process, so don't worry if everything seems to move in slow motion for a while. The art of discipline is just choosing between what you want now and what you want most."
aquarius,2016-08-23,"Hang on to your hat, for an instant replay of the past few months is possible today. You are caught in the middle of a cosmic game of chance, reminding you of other times in your life when you didn't get what you wanted, or when you fell short of your target. One minute you're not sure of your next move, and the next moment you're impulsively jumping into a new venture or relationship without considering the ramifications. But don't try to make anything permanent now. Letting the energy play on through allows you to find a unique solution to this familiar predicament."
pisces,2016-08-23,"Power struggles are spawned by your bright ideas and the subsequent resistance you encounter. However, self-restraint is the key ingredient for moving through this dynamic phase when impetuous Mars slams into cautious Saturn in your 10th House of Career. What began as a whimsical inspiration now requires planning and management. Push ahead with determination, even when pleasure tempts you to relax. Skipping a party or missing a concert won't feel like a sacrifice when keeping your commitment to yourself can be so much more satisfying in the long run."
aries,2016-08-24,"It might seem as if you're fighting an uphill battle when it comes to making plans for the future. Every time you decide on a course of action, circumstances throw you another curve ball. Thankfully, your luck is about to change in a significant manner as your key planet Mars pushes past constrictive Saturn. Reconsider your priorities one more time since your current trajectory will determine your progress in the weeks ahead. As Professor Irwin Corey said, ""If we don't change direction soon, we'll end up where we're going."""
taurus,2016-08-24,"Salmon fight against the river's currents and demonstrate great intention by swimming upstream to spawn. Your unflappable determination has brought you this far on your quest to deepen a relationship, even if the waters seem too shallow for passage. But the tide is shifting now and it will soon be obvious that you are not at the end of the journey. Continue to work for whatever is most important to you without taking the easy way out. Napoleon Hill wrote, ""Effort will release its reward only after you refuse to quit."""
gemini,2016-08-24,"Someone close to you may still be sending mixed messages by flashing a red light and green light at the same time. Unfortunately, you don't know whether to speed up or slow down; whatever strategy you try, the opposite seems to be a wiser approach. It's nearly impossible to blast ahead and screech to a halt all at once, but that's exactly what you must do. This cosmic dilemma requires you to hold two different positions simultaneously. Although it might sound corny, it's just another chance for your brilliant thinking to work its magic."
cancer,2016-08-24,"You wish you could deviate from your predetermined action plan today. Thankfully, you are given a chance to shed heavy-handed Saturn's weight and head out on a course of your own choosing. But don't wait until it's too late. Take small steps at first until you establish a steady pace. Once you start moving, it really doesn't matter that you're still figuring out your final destination. Nevertheless, changing dynamics require you to modify your game. You might not be able to control your reactions, but you can control your response."
leo,2016-08-24,"Spontaneously connecting with your inner child invites your mini-me to come out to create mischief. But something still continues to hold you back from freely expressing the innocence of your heartfelt desires. Sadly, you can grow up too quickly by accepting a more mature set of duties and responsibilities. Or, you could respond to the situation by revisiting your childhood. George Bernard Shaw wrote, ""We do not stop playing because we grow old; we grow old because we stop playing."""
virgo,2016-08-24,"There is so much happening in your life now that you're uncertain about how to dig your way out of the overloaded present moment. However, everything is about to change and you will be surprised by how much time you have on your hands. Nevertheless, waiting to make your move is a mistake, since the sooner you start on your new path, the better. Nobody is ever too busy; it's just a matter of reshuffling your priorities and improving your attitude."
libra,2016-08-24,"It doesn't matter how long you've been trying to bring up a sticky subject at work without any success. The very same topic is somehow approachable now, and the resistance seems to have vanished into thin air. Nevertheless, your discussions may not fulfill your expectations because of their lack of intensity. But don't make lasting judgments based upon an arbitrary classification. Friendships and work relationships elude categorization. Embrace each person according to his or her characteristics, not position or title. Everyone you encounter is your teacher."
scorpio,2016-08-24,"Although you appreciate certain aspects of your personality more than others, it's discouraging when people criticize you for those very same traits. You may be clear about your long-term goals, but can still be reticent when it comes to standing up for your rights. You are a child of the universe and have as much right to be your authentic self as anyone else does. Remember, you were born to be real, not perfect. An original is worth more than a copy."
sagittarius,2016-08-24,"One minute you're waxing eloquently about the need to strike when the iron is hot; the next minute, you may be lost in a cloud of self-doubt. However, you are at a tipping point and are ready to leave uncertainty behind as a new wave of confidence ripples through your life. Don't spend a lot of time today trying to figure out what has changed. Just set your sites on your next goal and do whatever is necessary to reach your desired destination. Winners are not people who never fail, but people who never quit."
capricorn,2016-08-24,"You excel at mapping out your plan and then executing it step by step. Although this methodical approach is likely behind your current achievements, it won't carry you to your next milestone. Oddly enough, your own ideas can be your greatest limitations now. In fact, you might need to throw away your previous blueprint for success and just make it up as you go. The exhilaration you feel from playing without a game plan can fuel your efforts for a long-term conquest. Taoist philosopher Wei Wu Wei wrote, ""Spontaneity is being present in the present."""
aquarius,2016-08-24,"Acknowledging your need for structure is imperative today, especially as you look forward to the future. You're eager to move your life in a more meaningful direction, but you might temporarily be wary of the unknown. Thankfully, you can have it both ways now if you are sufficiently ready for this major undertaking. Prepare by going over your plan one last time. However, keep in mind that you can't navigate into the future by replaying history. There's no time to gaze back in the rearview mirror when you must keep your eyes peeled on the road ahead."
pisces,2016-08-24,"Everyone seems to have their own idea about what you should be doing to make the most of your natural talents. But you might balk at listening to any advice now because it all sounds so critical to your ears. Remember that others judge you based upon their limited perceptions of your capabilities. Nevertheless, you possess a rare opportunity to set a career goal and then work toward making it real. No matter who gives up on you, don't ever give up on yourself."
aries,2016-08-25,"Don't ask questions today unless you want to hear the unvarnished truth. The answers you receive may not be what you expect, but you must listen to the response even if it triggers a difficult conversation. Although you might be surprised or even shocked by what you learn, assimilating the new information will open your eyes. Slipping into denial can appear to be the easier route but, unfortunately, won't lead you to your desired destination. Knowledge is power."
taurus,2016-08-25,"You're on the lookout for something radically different today, whether it's an idea that frees you from your regular thinking patterns or an unconventional person who stretches your sense of normalcy. However, your outrageous behavior comes with a cost; if you take your rebellion too far, you will be stopped in your tracks when the Moon opposes karmic Saturn. Moderating your response before you're in over your head is wiser than dealing with the fallout after the fact."
gemini,2016-08-25,"You could feel like you're a ship without a rudder today as the currents pull you one way and then another. You don't seem to be able to control your direction even if you know which way you want to go. But instead of exhausting yourself by fighting against the prevailing winds, it's smarter to save your energy until it can serve your purpose. In the meantime, enjoy the ride. You won't know where you might land until the tides begin to shift. Thankfully, they will ultimately carry you back home."
cancer,2016-08-25,"People may question your current choices, but you're not likely to reveal your motives now. You have your reasons for pursuing the road less traveled while quietly working on your own agenda. However, your decisions are yours alone and you don't want to talk about them until you are more confident about your new direction. Nevertheless, pushing against your discomfort by sharing your unfinished plans with a potential supporter can be the catalyst you need to jolt you into action."
leo,2016-08-25,"No matter how much money you make these days, you have your eye on additional sources of income now. However, putting your plan into motion may be more complicated than it seems in your fantasies. Although you might run into an obstacle or even a setback, meeting the current challenges demonstrates your strength of purpose. Don't settle for less than you're capable of as you take the external resistance in stride. Continue to show up with your irrepressible light and shine it to the best of your ability."
virgo,2016-08-25,"It feels as if you have only one chance to get it right today when it comes to a career decision. Opportunities abound, but there is a personal price to pay for avoiding a domestic responsibility. Take your time and reconsider your priorities; there's nothing wrong with choosing work over home and family as long as it's a conscious choice. Discuss your options with your most trusted companions. However, answers will not arrive in the form of good advice; they will only be revealed now as inner truths."
libra,2016-08-25,"Your hidden desires can leak out into the open as the whimsical Gemini Moon prompts you to talk first and think later. You might say something in a totally casual or even sarcastic manner today, but it doesn't matter once the cat is out of the bag. Your comments may be problematic at first if others overreact to your disclosure. But don't back down or try to minimize your truth. Although a heartfelt discussion is necessary before emotions settle down again, you will ultimately feel relieved once your secret is told. Sometimes honesty is the best gift you can give."
scorpio,2016-08-25,"Your financial decisions may raise someone's eyebrows today, but probably not because you're spending too much. In fact, others might see you as stingier than you actually are. If cash is tight, make sure you're not overreacting by being penny wise and pound foolish. Fortunately, modifying your budget now can produce lasting positive effects while the Moon is reflecting on Saturn and Mars in your 2nd House of Personal Resources. Nevertheless, remember Bob Marley's last words, ""Money can't buy life."""
sagittarius,2016-08-25,"The same people who normally give you the best advice seem to be talking out of both sides of their mouths today. You can't get a simple answer to a straightforward question from anyone now that the loquacious Gemini Moon is hijacking your 7th House of Relationships. However, it's not everyone else who is unclear now; it's most likely your indecision that creates the ambiguity. Listen to your own internal discussion; if you want to achieve greatness, stop asking others for permission."
capricorn,2016-08-25,"There are so many tasks to complete today that you just want to walk away from it all. Ironically, you can finish everything in a timely fashion, but the more you think about all there is to do, the more your frustration impedes your productivity. The only way to break this vicious cycle is to consciously shift your frame of reference. Look at your chores as a challenge and turn your work into a game. Change your attitude, change your life."
aquarius,2016-08-25,"Your friends are inconsistent today, encouraging you one minute and then criticizing you the next. You're particularly sensitive to their words and might be confused by their mixed messages. Nevertheless, you're ready to reach beyond the status quo now and shake up any stagnant energy. However, expressing your feelings is a bit risky because it can add to the instability of the moment. Let go of your assumptions and adapt to the circumstances as they continue to twist and turn. Deepak Chopra wrote, ""All great changes are preceded by chaos."""
pisces,2016-08-25,"Professional obligations weigh heavily on your shoulders today, but you have a bit of magic up your sleeve that enables you to dream your way through the rough patches. You can accept your fate at face value and work extra hard to meet everyone's expectations. Or you could use your creativity to invent new solutions that change the rules of the game. Your imagination is the source of great inspiration if you're willing to tap into the power of lateral thinking now. As Harry Houdini said, ""My brain is the key that sets me free."""
aries,2016-08-26,"A realistic approach to your unfulfilled dreams prevents you from quitting your job and sailing off into the sunset. However, action-hero Mars is stepping away from Saturn's stern grasp in your 9th House of Big Ideas and your mind churns with every imaginable possibility. Your fantasies are like a runaway train now, and mystical Neptune's presence tempts you to throw caution to the wind. Give yourself permission to dream the impossible dream, but don't try to turn every passing whim into reality or you'll exhaust yourself in the process."
taurus,2016-08-26,"Your boundaries are being stretched beyond the regular limits today, yet it's better to take a calculated risk of your own choosing than to react to a challenge thrust upon you. But it's difficult to fully comprehend the bigger picture now as nebulous Neptune squares Mars in your 8th House of Transformation, distorting your perception of change. Nevertheless, if your overactive imagination prompts you to expect more from your relationships, get busy and make your wishes come true."
gemini,2016-08-26,"You have something to say to nearly everyone today, but not everyone has something to say to you. Although you're normally quick to interact with others, the Moon in your curious sign causes you to think so fast you misread people's signals. Unfortunately, a deceptive Mars-Neptune square indicates that your incorrect interpretation sets you up to chase an illusion. A small but conscious modification to your fantasy may be all that's needed to put it within reach."
cancer,2016-08-26,"You might be grappling with the fine line between fact and fantasy as your serious nature snaps you back from the realms of imagination today. But just as you accept the limitation of your daily work duties, a surreal Mars-Neptune square urges you all over again to believe in the possibility of your wildest dreams. Red-hot Mars fuels your enthusiasm, which feeds your professional ambitions. Nevertheless, you could lead yourself astray if your actions are not grounded in reality. Finding the sweet spot between the rational and irrational is your ticket to success."
leo,2016-08-26,"Confusing messages about love make it tricky to know how to react now. While expressive Mars energizes your 5th House of Romance, its dynamic square to magical Neptune stimulates your imagination. Thrill-seeking is a wonderful distraction unless your impulsive actions are slightly off target. Fortunately, a practical plan saves the day because stabilizing Saturn grounds your fanciful flights with reality and gives you a chance to actually find the elusive pot of gold at the end of the rainbow."
virgo,2016-08-26,"You want to be appreciated for your authenticity, but your actions don't seem to communicate your real intentions. Avoiding negative thinking is a real challenge today, especially if you feel like others aren't seeing you in your true light. Unfortunately, you might overcompensate for your apparent invisibility by telling stories or exaggerating the facts while delusional Neptune squares defensive Mars in inspirational Sagittarius. Ultimately, you must set your own limits; no one will do it for you."
libra,2016-08-26,"You can be quite decisive about your goals today, but uncertainty at work makes it difficult to execute your plan. Clinging to your original agenda brings frustration as your destination grows further and further away. Thankfully, freeing yourself from an impossible situation is as simple as altering your approach. Instead of waiting for clarification from your coworkers, just proceed confidently until you receive feedback that you need to reset your bearings. Remaining unattached to the outcome prevents emotional distress. Maintaining a sense of humor helps you roll with the punches."
scorpio,2016-08-26,"Although you may have already drawn a line in the sand, your solid grasp of the facts seems to be slowly slipping away. Optimism is a positive motivating factor, but when blind it can prompt you to overstep sensible limits in your quest for emotional satisfaction. Exercising extra caution is advisable now so you don't act on a foolish impulse. Thankfully, responsible Saturn empowers you with the persistence and patience you need to gain the self-mastery you seek."
sagittarius,2016-08-26,"It might seem like you stood up tall to one challenge after another and are now, finally, ready to fly. Warrior Mars in your sign is enthusiastically wired to push ahead on all fronts. However, Mars forms a debilitating square to fantasy-prone Neptune, muddying the waters and making it more complicated to take on an adversary or just go for the gold. Ultimately, you may find your toughest competition is staring right back at you in the mirror."
capricorn,2016-08-26,"You are not enthused about sharing your ideas with your colleagues now because you're afraid they won't approve of your radical methods. After all, you're more ambitious than others; sometimes you even need to cool your jets if you get too far ahead of the pack. Underestimating the size of a job can mean big trouble down the road while a blurry Mars-Neptune square distorts your 3rd House of Information. Preemptively slow down and ask others for their feedback. Resist less; listen more."
aquarius,2016-08-26,"You're eager to wage battle for a cause today, but you could flounder if you don't have all your facts in order and your ducks in a row. Thankfully, you can be very successful if you're willing to accept the assistance of your allies now that action-packed Mars is visiting your 11th House of Networking. Nevertheless, as noble as it is to fight for something important, stop and re-evaluate your plan before foggy Neptune sends you on a wild good chase. Moderating your efforts prevents you from wasting a lot of time and energy before it's too late."
pisces,2016-08-26,"Words flow off your tongue today, enabling you to charm your way into someone's heart or mind. Thankfully, you possess the gift of gab while the Moon is visiting witty Gemini. Nevertheless, you might be fighting with ghosts while courageous Mars squares phantasmagorical Neptune in your sign. Focusing your energy on practical goals may be an uphill battle now if you're too busy talking up a storm. When you need something concrete to believe in, start with yourself."
aries,2016-08-27,"What starts as an irresolvable conflict between what you want and what you must do magically transforms into a best-case scenario today. Taking steps to manifest your dreams could paint a rosy picture, but the truth will be revealed because your feelings are running deeper than usual. You will not be satisfied until you fulfill your desires in a sustainable manner. Thankfully, sweet Venus canoodles with magnanimous Jupiter, indulging you with love and happiness if you give generously from your heart."
taurus,2016-08-27,"Your reluctance to compromise could be a mistake that alienates people today. Fortunately, philosophical Jupiter's conjunction with mental Mercury and diplomatic Venus arms you with information that helps resolve a sticky situation. However, consciously choosing to be flexible restores intellectual and emotional connections. Keep in mind there's no need to withdraw to protect your heart since lucky Jupiter's presence indicates a promising outcome to your recent drama. The most important trip you may take in life is meeting people halfway."
gemini,2016-08-27,"Your brain is running at warp speed with your mouth running just as fast. Luckily, your key planet Mercury is buzzing around a delicious Venus-Jupiter conjunction, revealing a treasure trove of wonderful ideas. Your genuine optimism plays a significant role in creating abundance when it comes to love and recognition. Use your positive thinking selectively, instead of believing that everything is for your personal gain. As Oprah Winfrey said, ""What we dwell on is who we become."""
cancer,2016-08-27,"You seem to have plenty of information to share today but, thankfully, you don't come across like a know-it-all. Charming Venus kisses generous Jupiter to continue a positive-people trend in your life. Happily, you're able to gain admiration from others and draw them into your world. Although the compliments you hear now may be flattering, they could be lacking in sincerity. Flirting and teasing are sweet pastimes, but rarely have lasting value. In the end, kindness and compassion are the keys to your heart."
leo,2016-08-27,"You can feel the good vibrations now, offering you a break from a recent financial struggle. But even if money matters remain unchanged, you might be self-indulgent anyhow. A sweet conjunction between beautiful Venus and opulent Jupiter floods your 2nd House of Material Possessions with good news, tempting you to forget your current fiscal condition. Just remember that serious underlying issues still lurk behind the bright lights of optimism. An old Filipino proverb teaches, ""Caution minimizes loss."""
virgo,2016-08-27,"Any lingering self-doubt quickly dissipates today as witty Mercury and friendly Venus hang out with buoyant Jupiter. You are truly inspired now as new ideas increase your options and bolster your self-esteem. Be willing to take a risk, but bring along some of your famous common sense for backup. As Mae West said, ""You only live once, but if you do it right, once is enough."""
libra,2016-08-27,"Although illusory visions may already be dancing in your head, it's still worthwhile to let your imagination run wild today. Paradoxically, daydreaming is likely to produce positive results, even if your facts are wrong while mental Mercury and valuable Venus collaborate with auspicious Jupiter. Create your own fantasies rather than falling for someone else's tall tales, since good fortune rewards following your instincts now. Instead of making decisions based on logic alone, factor in your dreams and emotions to add magic to your life."
scorpio,2016-08-27,"Your network of friends is your primary support system now as you attract people who admire your goals and appreciate the passion you bring to a cause. Your current powers of persuasion allow you to make your points more effectively than ever. Thankfully, you can restore the confidence of an old friend or appear more desirable to a new one today. Nevertheless, a relationship without trust is like a car without gas; you can stay in it as long as you want, but it won't go anywhere. Actions, not words, reveal the true intentions of your heart."
sagittarius,2016-08-27,"All the pieces seem to fit into place today when captivating Venus connects with prosperous Jupiter in your 10th House of Public Status. It's hard to avoid falling in love with your career as you chase every opportunity that appears now, convinced that fame and fortune will be yours. However, gaining recognition for your work can be an empty achievement if you don't pursue personal relationships, too. As Mother Theresa said, ""If we have no peace, it is because we have forgotten that we belong to each other."""
capricorn,2016-08-27,"Cooking up plans for an inspiring trip or engaging in stimulating conversations connects your head and your heart in delightful ways. Good news is all but guaranteed while a generous conjunction of delectable Venus and cheerful Jupiter lights up your 9th House of Future Vision. This is a perfect time to pitch your ideas to others because they are likely to be receptive. Just don't go overboard with superfluous information. For the best results, tailor your pitch for your intended audience. Short and sweet does the trick when it comes to selling your dreams."
aquarius,2016-08-27,"Your cash flow may be stretched to the max, but that won't stop you from trying to squeeze more out of every penny these days. A valuable triple conjunction of clever Mercury, magnetic Venus, and promising Jupiter in skillful Virgo falls in your 8th House of Shared Resources, giving you the edge in financial negotiations. A positive outcome is likely for nearly any investment or project you start now, as long as you don't expect too much too soon in return for little effort on your part. Prosperity begins with a state of mind."
pisces,2016-08-27,"It's as if you just won the relationship lottery and people seem to be going out of their way to be extra nice to you. A delightful union of delicious Venus and buoyant Jupiter in your 7th House of Companions brings you gifts from good friends or openhearted individuals. Seek support, including funding, for your latest cause. You will never know who might come through for you unless you ask. Nevertheless, remember the words of Lao Tzu who said, ""The heart that gives, gathers."""
aries,2016-08-28,"Although everything seems to slow down a bit on the outside, you're still running through a maze on the inside. You long for less drama today, but could end up internalizing the conflicts rather than preventing them. Thankfully, there are no boundaries to what you may contemplate if you keep everything to yourself. But don't expect your silence to go unnoticed. Unfortunately, what you don't say encourages others to make up their own version of your reality, which might wildly deviate from the truth. As Deepak Chopra writes, ""Awareness brings freedom."""
taurus,2016-08-28,"A straightforward approach to communicating your feelings can reduce the pressure in a relationship. You might be so sensitive about your point of view today that you talk as if you're walking on eggshells. Unfortunately, your caution causes others to think you're hiding something significant. It's not that your message should be altered to change the meaning, only that your delivery could make a big difference in what people hear. Don't beat around the bush; say exactly what you mean and let the conversation take flight from there."
gemini,2016-08-28,"Your deeply ingrained values come to light today if you witness a social injustice or misuse of power. Although you typically can see both sides of an argument, you're likely to favor the underdog in most cases. However, be aware there is an arbitrariness to your opinion now, whatever position you choose. You might be better off being the champion of communication, rather than supporting any single point of view. The truth is out there, but it's not as simple to find as it seems at first. Let your moral compass be your guide."
cancer,2016-08-28,"You're not interested in shaking up the world with your radical ideas today. You prefer to explore all the unlikely possibilities and impossible futures within the safety of your own mind. But this secrecy isn't about uncertainty or low self-esteem; it's about your pragmatic approach to making a lasting impact instead of a short-lived blip on someone's radar screen. There's no need to waste your energy defending your thoughts on social or personal issues. As Robert Louis Stevenson wrote, ""Don't judge each day by the harvest you reap but by the seeds that you plant."""
leo,2016-08-28,"You are operating in stealth mode as you go about your business of creating something special. You intuitively know it's more important now for you to get it right than it is to be seen on the world stage. Thankfully, your current intentions exude the authority of Saturn and they will ultimately earn you the recognition you seek. Respect is for those who deserve it, not for those who demand it. Speak softly and carry a big stick."
virgo,2016-08-28,"You can be so discerning in your quest for perfection that others criticize your pickiness. But you could surprise your friends today with the inconsistency of your actions. One moment, they think you are withholding your negative judgment, ready to list the reasons why you refuse their invitation to collaborate on a project. However, you could shock them when you say yes, especially if you take their idea and then expand on it. Albert Einstein said, ""Creativity is intelligence having fun."""
libra,2016-08-28,"You may appear disengaged and disinterested today, but you're really exerting more control than anyone realizes. One of your greatest skills is being able to listen to what others want and then motivate them to realize their dreams. However, you have your own agenda now and won't let someone else's plans take precedence. Nevertheless, it doesn't look like you're pulling the strings because you know when to remain quiet and divert the attention elsewhere. Hiding in plain sight can be oddly satisfying, especially when everything just seems to fall your way."
scorpio,2016-08-28,"Your friends are your lifeline to the future now as they reflect your dreams back to you with their love and encouragement. Naturally, spending time in such a supportive community does your soul good, especially when you share values at such a fundamental level. Fortunately, there's nothing you must do in this immediate moment, other than showing up with an open mind. Today is meant for contemplation, not action. A grateful heart is a magnet for miracles."
sagittarius,2016-08-28,"The secret to your success is setting your specific goals down on paper now. Although energetic Mars is empowering your exuberant sign, taskmaster Saturn is not ready to let you off the hook. Don't take your eyes off the distant horizon, but you must simultaneously reassess your plans for the next few weeks. The more you can accomplish now, the easier it will be later on. Literary giant Samuel Johnson wrote, ""The future is purchased by the present."""
capricorn,2016-08-28,"Sunday is a day of rest for many, but you might see it an opportunity to fine-tune your plans so you can gain a strategic advantage. Unfortunately, everything will take longer than you think, so don't set yourself up for failure or disappointment with exorbitant expectations. Nevertheless, you're capable of seeing the future possibilities through a very practical lens, enabling you to simplify the steps needed to accomplish your goals. As Zig Ziglar said, ""There is no elevator to success; you must take the stairs."""
aquarius,2016-08-28,"You seek a deeper level of compassion in your relationships, but you prefer to make this connection via intellectual analysis rather than emotional involvement. It's not that you are detached from your feelings; it's just you can dig deeper if you approach interpersonal dynamics objectively. Nevertheless, you're still treading on volatile ground where a cool discussion can quickly grow heated. Keep in mind, a healthy relationship will inspire both parties to be their best selves. Trust your heart today, not your head."
pisces,2016-08-28,"You might resist if someone is trying to pin down your feelings today. You want to answer their concerns in an honest and caring manner, but find it impossible to squeeze your emotions into words now. Your first inclination is to say nothing at all, but your evasiveness can be even more misleading than any attempt to communicate your truth. Ironically, your self-criticism may be harsher than necessary, so don't talk yourself into silence. Remember, your initial response is just the opening reply to a volley that will create its own meaning as the conversation continues. Love is a game that everyone wants to win."
aries,2016-08-29,"You may be so impatient that you could do something today you quickly regret. Although your intentions are honorable, superhero Mars squares the karmic Moon's nodes, placing your behavior in conflict with your higher purpose. Whatever urgency you sense now is probably based more on your internal fears than on the external situation. Ironically, your belief that you must act right away is a sure signal to slow down. Aristotle wrote, ""Patience is bitter, but its fruit is sweet."""
taurus,2016-08-29,"You put such a smooth spin on your words today that others are convinced by your stellar performance. People are likely to agree with you just because you sound agreeable to them. However, they might not support you in a pinch if they don't have the strength of their convictions. It's sweet to have people in your corner, but this kind of encouragement may be more dangerous than helpful if you expect anyone to come through at a vital moment. You can weed out the fair-weather friends by being authentic right from the start."
gemini,2016-08-29,"You're at the end of your rope and don't know what you will do next. You know that big changes are in the air and you're ready to leap into the unknown. But instead of fretting about the logistics today, you are enjoying the excitement of the moment and the anticipation of the future. Follow your intuition but remember that your destination is not as close as it appears. Reassess the current circumstances and prepare for a longer journey. Your chances of reaching your goal improve greatly if you don't give up. Fear looks; faith jumps."
cancer,2016-08-29,"You know the solution to a lingering problem, but you don't want to appear cocky to your friends or teachers. Nevertheless, your confidence builds now as everyone else's lags. It's not that you're feeding off other people's failures; it's just that you can see how your plan is an improvement over their more conservative approaches. Nevertheless, it's essential to share your ideas without assuming your way is the only way. Your open-mindedness is the key to success."
leo,2016-08-29,"Keeping your feet on the ground isn't a very complicated order, yet it seems far from easy today. You're in a naturally optimistic state of mind, making it tricky to prevent your thoughts from inflating every project or idea. The lively Leo Moon reflects the power of your positive thinking while several planets in earthy Virgo are more practical in nature. Paradoxically, you can walk down two paths if you put your mind to it. Being realistic in your approach while holding on to the hope of something better combines the best of both worlds."
virgo,2016-08-29,"You are standing at a fork in the road with three planets hovering around the last degrees of your sign. New challenges are just around the corner, but time is already slowing down. Mischievous Mercury turns retrograde tomorrow and you will soon discover there is unfinished business that must be completed before you're free to step into the future. Don't fight against the current delays; resistance is futile. Instead, resign yourself to getting as much accomplished as possible in anticipation of your launch next month. Busy hands are happy hands."
libra,2016-08-29,"Your communication skills are so on point today that people will approve of your message even if you deliver the worst news possible. Clever Mercury kisses romantic Venus, casting a beautiful glow on your love life and heightening your senses. However, you're a bit shy now and might choose to keep some things private -- even the best news. Nevertheless, your key planet Venus moves into your sign this evening, increasing your popularity and garnering the adoration you crave. There's no reason to push your luck; all good things will be yours in time."
scorpio,2016-08-29,"You might feel as if you're a spinning top today; all is well as long as you stay in motion. However, your security becomes precarious when you start to slow down. Instead of clinging to the illusion of stability, embrace the uncertainty of the future because it contains the fruition of the seeds you're now planting. Your fear of change stands between your current dissatisfaction and your unrealized potential. Sometimes you need to lose your balance in order to recreate a solid foundation on which to build your amazing new life."
sagittarius,2016-08-29,"A sinking feeling in the pit of your stomach is a reminder that you only have a limited amount of time to finish up old business before it's too late. It's as if one foot is on the dock and the other in the boat; you can't hold on to the past for much longer. Unfortunately, there's nothing to be gained by nostalgically pining for the good old days when everything seemed more certain. Thankfully, you're in luck if you want life to be an adventure. Just remember, you can't start writing the next chapter of your book if you're still reading the last one."
capricorn,2016-08-29,"Putting a solid support network in place can make the difference between failure and success. But you must have a sustainable plan in mind for others to know where they fit into your big picture. Luckily, the cosmic energy is conspiring on your behalf now, giving you a perfect combination of visionary ambition, mental clarity, and friendly charm. There's no time to waste; secure your resources, sound the trumpets, and gather the troops. Asking for assistance doesn't mean you're weak; it means you're a wise leader."
aquarius,2016-08-29,"You're anticipating a fabulous adventure that's about to unfold. Although the potential is great, you realize you're not quite ready to embark to points unknown. The conflict between your enthusiasm and your hesitation can shade your excitement with doubt. But there's no reason to worry now, because you have more time than you realize to put everything in order before you start the next journey. Dream big but don't lose focus of the details. Modifying your plans in the days ahead improves your chances for satisfaction."
pisces,2016-08-29,"You may create a dramatic scene to make sure others notice what you are doing now. Ironically, it might take more time than you wish to reach your goals, but rest assured your current efforts are not wasted. Fortunately, you are able to clearly communicate your intentions at work today, enabling you to solidify the relationships that help you succeed. It's amazing how much you can accomplish when you don't care who gets the credit in the final analysis. Focus on collaboration instead of competition for the best results."
aries,2016-08-30,"Although you're in a playful mood today, you're secretly concerned your current joy won't last. The lively Leo Moon buzzes with excitement in your 5th House of Fun and Games, but you can't avoid your obligations while Mercury retrogrades through your 6th House of Employment. You know the power of the present moment and can make the most of your positive attitude, but the pressure of work-related commitments is never far away. Unfortunately, Abraham Lincoln was right when he said, ""You cannot escape the responsibility of tomorrow by evading it today."""
taurus,2016-08-30,"You enjoy the consistency of your everyday routine. But one annoying distraction after another prevents you from settling into a regular daily schedule while mischievous Mercury backtracks through your 5th House of Spontaneity. Instead of adding to the frustration by denying your creative self-expression, have fun whenever the circumstances allow. Of course, your chores will still be there when you return. Remember, you're the only person accountable for the quality of your life. Work hard; play harder."
gemini,2016-08-30,"You wish you were free to pursue your creative dreams, but you're not quite ready to sacrifice your current stability. Trickster Mercury has started a 3-week remedial project in your 4th House of Family, burdening you with the task of managing household logistics. You might be overwhelmed with scheduling details and juggling your commitments in order to keep everyone and everything on track. Thankfully, taking care of personal business now leads to profound emotional satisfaction. Be patient; you'll have plenty of time for your own fun and games down the road."
cancer,2016-08-30,"You might feel as if you're caught in a time loop, revisiting the same conversation again and again. Each time around, there are slightly different nuances that bring new issues to light. Mental Mercury's retrograde in your 3rd House of Communication is like your own personal Groundhog Day, requiring you to go around and around until you finally get it right. Believe it or not, there's no reason to be in a hurry now; the deeper you sink, the more you discover about yourself and those you love. A lesson will repeat itself until learned."
leo,2016-08-30,"You're eager to present a show-and-tell today, but you won't be satisfied with a simple presentation. Although the dramatic Leo Moon fuels your enthusiasm, it's challenging to sustain it unless you know you're having a positive impact on your audience. You want to initiate a process that encourages people to do something meaningful with their lives as Mercury retrogrades through your 2nd House of Core Values. As Thoreau wrote, ""Live your beliefs and you can turn the world around."""
virgo,2016-08-30,"You don't want everyone to know your business now; in fact, you might be happiest doing your thing behind the scenes instead of under the bright spotlight. Ironically, you would like recognition for your contribution to a project, but not while Mercury is retrograde in your perfectionist sign. If you use these days to work out the kinks in your routine, you'll be more confident when others can finally see you in your full glory. In the final analysis, your work ethic should have nothing to do with the acknowledgment you could receive. The only person you need to impress is yourself."
libra,2016-08-30,"Your social life is on the move, but you're not quite ready to roll with all the activity. You like the idea of mingling among friends, experiencing the bright lights and creating a memorable time. But Mercury's retrograde through your 12th House of Privacy pulls you away from large crowds and unnecessary chatter. You might feel conflicted because you need silence now to hear your own inner voice and are afraid of losing touch with the source of your inspiration. Life is so much better when you focus on what really matters."
scorpio,2016-08-30,"You hold your friends in high regards, but you also hold yourself to higher standards than anyone else. In fact, you might harbor regrets about your shortcomings in the public arena while analytical Mercury backtracks through your 11th House of Social Networking. Don't cry over spilled milk; just clean it up the best you can and move on. Although you may think too much time has passed, it's never too late to do the right thing."
sagittarius,2016-08-30,"You are finally free to explore a wide variety of options for your future on your own terms. The fact of the matter is you were carrying a heap of responsibilities that had to be fulfilled before you could move on. However, you might be reconsidering a recent career decision, wondering if you acted in haste. Mercury's retrograde dance in your 10th House of Profession isn't meant to send you into a tailspin of self-doubt. The truth is that you're being given a few extra weeks to re-evaluate your new plans before etching them in stone. Examining every alternative from every angle sets you up for success."
capricorn,2016-08-30,"You may see your career as a game of skill and chance now. You're eager to play the next round as you establish new goals. But you might be wondering if your current trajectory is still the best one for you. Don't worry if answers are not forthcoming while intellectual Mercury backtracks through your 9th House of Higher Truth. Keep your eyes on the horizon; the details will gradually come into focus over the next few weeks. Tennis champion Arthur Ashe said, ""Success is a journey not a destination. The doing is often more important than the outcome."""
aquarius,2016-08-30,"Someone special may be putting on an unexpected show for you and you like what you see. But you don't necessarily have an agenda for any relationship now, whether it's business or personal. You prefer to gather information while interactive Mercury retrogrades through your 8th House of Deep Sharing for the next few weeks. Don't eliminate any possibilities yet, because there's magic stewing in the cosmic slow cooker and it's impossible to tell how it will manifest. Blessed are the flexible for they shall not be bent out of shape."
pisces,2016-08-30,"You want to make your mark at work now by performing your duties in an exemplary manner. But it's not just about your actions, because talkative Mercury's retrograde in your 7th House of Partnerships emphasizes the give and take of conversation. Ironically, your productivity is less important than your words today, assuming you're also willing to listen. It's so compelling to be understood that sometimes it's easy to forget to be understanding. Seek respect, not attention; it lasts longer."
aries,2016-08-31,"You can dream up many ways to combat your boredom today, but finally come to the realization that escape is not an option. Your promises are catching up with you and there's really nothing you can do but put your shoulder to the wheel and push, even if it's an uphill journey. Succumbing to a distraction is not a wise move now; it will only be gratifying for a fleeting moment and just put you further behind schedule. You only fail when you stop trying."
taurus,2016-08-31,"There's no reason to restrain your colorful streak of creative energy today. In fact, the more chances you take now, the greater your odds for success. Naturally, analyzing your options before you begin a project is prudent, but don't think about them so much that your mojo begins to fade. Get out of your head and into your heart. Don't minimize your potential. It's better to gamble on your vision than settle for mediocrity. Norman Vincent Peale wrote, ""Shoot for the Moon. Even if you miss, you'll land among the stars."""
gemini,2016-08-31,"Although you might know where you're going, there seems to be too many speed bumps on the road to success. You don't want to slow down for the purpose of safety. You want to gain momentum and fly right over any obstacles, but that only works in your dreams. The key to reaching your destination is to be aware enough to actually interact with any resistance that's between you and your personal satisfaction. Philosopher Soren Kierkegaard wrote, ""Life is not a problem to be solved, but a reality to be experienced."""
cancer,2016-08-31,"Finding the right words to let someone know how you feel can be exhausting, but you're not interested in giving up before you bridge the gulf, even if you're struggling with what to say. Although you might make a false start or two, your powerful intentions combined with persistence win others over. Don't assume you know where the conversation will lead. Summon up your courage, get the ball rolling and let reality surprise you with the outcome."
leo,2016-08-31,"You are resistant to conforming to other people's expectations today. In fact, your rebellious urge won't settle down, even if you know it will only stir up a storm. You can't suppress your true nature now because denial only makes it grow stronger. Instead, find a creative channel for expressing your unconventional position. People will be more supportive than you think as long as your message is consistent with your conscience. Intelligence is knowing which path to take; wisdom is taking it."
virgo,2016-08-31,"You are in your element as the Moon joins the planetary party already in progress in your rational sign. You can isolate important facts, analyze the data and choose the most sensible direction. However, timing is a problem as tomorrow's Virgo Solar Eclipse draws near. You might believe that anything you do today will be washed away in the cosmic tides over the next few days. However, nothing is further from the truth. Big shifts are on the horizon, but your current behavior is more important than ever. Picasso said, ""Action is the foundational key to all success."""
libra,2016-08-31,"You might feel like a monk in search of a monastery today. Unfortunately, even if you find a place for spiritual retreat, you may not have a lot of time for metaphysical pursuits. Nevertheless, the emphasis on your 12th House of Soul Consciousness is as strong as your real-world responsibilities, making your search for inner peace inescapable. Acknowledge the limitations placed on your current actions by circumstance and accept what can't be changed. However, it's crucial to keep your dreams alive no matter the cost."
scorpio,2016-08-31,"You are resigned to fight an uphill battle today as long as your core beliefs are connected to your cause. In fact, you're a sight to behold when you're so charged up and ready to take on the world. But you might find yourself worn out by the end of the day, without a lot to show for your efforts, especially if you're not following a specific plan. Take a few steps back and reevaluate your strategy. Work smarter, not harder and success can be yours."
sagittarius,2016-08-31,"Although you are highly driven in your pursuit of your professional ambitions these days, your progress is still annoyingly sluggish. Your plans seem to be taking longer to manifest than you imagined. Nevertheless, the clouds are clearing and you can see blue sky today, raising your optimism and increasing your levity. Hope is replacing doubt, even if you're not yet sure how everything is going to work out, but don't worry about the big picture now; just attend to each little detail as it arises. Van Gogh said, ""Great things are done by a series of small things brought together."""
capricorn,2016-08-31,"You're drifting in dreamland today and could float off into the inner dimensions of space. Thankfully, the pragmatic Virgo Moon is a counterbalance that keeps you grounded. If you are championing a cause now, shout your message from the mountaintops. Nevertheless, your social concerns might conflict with your personal interests. Sigmund Freud counseled, ""In the small matters trust the mind, in the large ones the heart."""
aquarius,2016-08-31,"Although your day begins normally, interpersonal dynamics quickly grow complicated. Your initial reaction is to jump in with your rational approach and do whatever is necessary to handle the tension. Unfortunately, your intervention only amplifies the problem today; the more you try to fix things, the worse they get. Paradoxically, the shortest path to resolution is to do nothing at all. Let the energetic imbalances tilt reality until it unwinds. The calm will return after the storm releases the blocked energy. Sometimes, nature takes care of things better than humans."
pisces,2016-08-31,"You may be criticized for being lost in your dreams today, but your inner world is where you do your best work. People might not take the time to listen to your process; they only judge you from their limited perspective. Nevertheless, there's a grain of truth in the unsolicited advice you receive now. It never hurts to check back with the facts when you're cruising the outer limits of your imagination. However, author Lloyd Alexander had a point when he wrote, ""Fantasy is hardly an escape from reality. It's a way of understanding it."""
aries,2016-09-01,"You can gauge how well you're currently doing by how much unexpected changes at work or in your health throw you off balance. The Virgo New Moon Eclipse rocks your 6th House of Daily Routine, requiring you to relinquish old habits that no longer support your goals. For example, a sudden health concern may be your body's way of telling you to improve your lifestyle. Issues that arise should not be ignored or suppressed or they will only return later to cause more serious problems. Act now; sometimes later becomes never."
taurus,2016-09-01,"You are currently engaged in a process of transmuting your inner joy into reality. In order to make your dreams come true, you must take the recent lessons you've learned and begin to put them into practice. A dramatic Virgo New Moon Eclipse falls in your 5th House of Love and Creativity, loosening up old patterns of playing it safe. Taking risks in self-expression can be very rewarding as long as you calculate the pros and cons before shaking up the energy. Don't hold back when it comes to showing your feelings. Upsets are possible but a profound emotional breakthrough is well worth the effort."
gemini,2016-09-01,"Domestic pressures bring you face-to-face with your dreams and your disappointments. The Virgo Solar Eclipse lands in your 4th House of Home and Family, revealing cracks in the foundation of your world. It might be scary to realize how far your beliefs have strayed from reality, but you can turn them around through deliberate action rather than panicking and trying to set everything right overnight. Change is inevitable; be honest with yourself and you'll find the courage to transform a potential loss into a major gain. Letting go is safer than holding on."
cancer,2016-09-01,"Although you might be dreaming of an exotic vacation, the only traveling you'll likely be doing now will be a visit to the neighbors or a quick trip to a local market. The efficient Virgo New Moon Eclipse activates your 3rd House of Distractions, indicating a lot of movement without really going anywhere significant. Your greatest challenge comes from wasting time as you try to weed out the extraneous noise in your life. Don't be afraid to say no to a good idea, for it's more productive to concentrate your actions instead of scattering them. Energy flows where attention goes."
leo,2016-09-01,"Watch your wallet and change your online passwords while the Virgo Solar Eclipse rattles your 2nd House of Money and Resources. You might even find yourself involved in a dispute over a bill or some other financial matter. It's worth digging to the bottom of the issue even if it raises unpleasant feelings, since a resolvable misunderstanding may be the cause of the current conflict. With nebulous Neptune and realistic Saturn lurking in the picture, the more clarity you can bring to the matter now, the better."
virgo,2016-09-01,"Burying your head in the sand is tempting but there is no way to deny the truth today. A Solar Eclipse in your sign opposes surreal Neptune in your 7th House of Relationships, luring you into sharing a believable fantasy. But the Sun and Moon square Saturn, confronting you with an unavoidable reality check. Great things can develop from a failure or delay if you're willing to step up your game and strive for excellence. Your disillusionment can be momentarily painful, but saying goodbye to old habits makes room for something or someone special to enter your life."
libra,2016-09-01,"You are reminded of everything in your life that remains incomplete and all those things you do not understand, but you're driven to explore the invisible metaphysical realms now to broaden your perspective and inspire your creativity. Although the Virgo Solar Eclipse stimulates your 12th House of Mystery, its connection to irrepressible Uranus encourages you to reveal your spiritual journey with your closest friends. In fact, you can't rest until you make others aware of your recent experiences. True power is gained by sharing knowledge not hoarding it."
scorpio,2016-09-01,"Being sidetracked by your desires and illusions gobbles up valuable time and money. Although the Virgo New Moon Eclipse makes a racket in your 11th House of Long-Term Goals, its opposition to fantasy-prone Neptune in your 5th House of Love can invite a dreamy romance. Refocusing your attention on practical matters makes sense in a rational world. Harder work may bring greater success, but your efforts might be best applied toward personal, rather than material, rewards. Sufi Mystic Rumi wrote, ""What you seek is seeking you."""
sagittarius,2016-09-01,"Unforeseen changes in your career path may catch you off guard today. You might not see the shift coming yet the concentrated energy of the Virgo New Moon Eclipse electrifies your 10th House of Public Status. This cosmic wake-up call puts you on notice to clean up your act and bring any uncertainties out into the open. It's tempting to avoid a power struggle if you're dealing with someone who isn't treating you fairly. Nevertheless, reasserting your authority allows you to reclaim control over your professional life. Be a voice, not an echo."
capricorn,2016-09-01,"Unexpected challenges to your belief system, sudden detours in travel plans, or an overload of new information can be quite upsetting to the status quo. The Virgo Solar Eclipse destabilizes your 9th House of Adventure with rapidly changing circumstances, flipping your normally rational thinking into indecision. On the positive side, unanticipated news will thrill you if you keep an open mind. Thankfully, establishing priorities and eliminating extraneous activities reduce the excess of sensory input you're likely to receive. Clear out the cobwebs and jump into new experiences to accelerate your growth."
aquarius,2016-09-01,"You think you know what is right, but now your knowledge could stand between you and happiness. The Virgo New Moon Eclipse polarizes your 8th House of Deep Sharing, insisting that you surrender your absolute certainty in order to get what you want. Imaginative Neptune's opposition to the Sun and Moon asks you to leave your logic behind. True intimacy may be within your reach, but first you must open your heart. Admitting that you don't have all the answers is a perfect place to start."
pisces,2016-09-01,"The urgency for change can be especially intense these days. There's a tremendous amount of planetary activity focusing on the Virgo New Moon Eclipse that hurls lightning bolts in your 7th House of Significant Others. Issues of fear and loss of control lead to further reevaluation of your relationships. Something may be ending, but it's human to try to avoid difficult choices that intensify emotions. Nevertheless, it's essential to get to the truth at the bottom of your soul. When you stand in a place of self-awareness, you are the master of your destiny."
aries,2016-09-02,"Overconfidence or over-commitment, whether yours or someone else's, is a warning sign that you're reading a situation at work incorrectly. You may believe someone else isn't doing his or her part. But don't overcompensate today and sacrifice your integrity in the process, since the planetary focus on nebulous Neptune and inflationary Jupiter can produce promises without substance. It's tempting to exaggerate when making your point, but being concise in communication with a specific goal in mind will be more fruitful. Say what you mean and mean what you say."
taurus,2016-09-02,"There are fuzzy boundaries between a casual friendship and a more intimate connection today. Unfortunately, your brain may be going on vacation while retrograde Mercury stumbles into excessive Jupiter, distorting reality by magnifying the importance of a spontaneous conversation. In fact, a tense alliance between illusory Neptune and the Sun in your 5th House of Spontaneity creates an air of fantasy everywhere you turn. Be careful what you put in motion when offering someone your hand or your heart. Wait until your clarity returns before making your move."
gemini,2016-09-02,"You may feel like you're lost in a Hall of Mirrors as you see a distorted version of the world reflected back at you today. It's nearly impossible to know what's real when the Sun forms a disquieting opposition with surreal Neptune. Disillusionment can follow if you allow yourself to be distracted by fantasies of sensual enjoyment rather than utilizing your imagination for more practical purposes. Author John Maxwell wrote, ""Dreams don't work unless you do."""
cancer,2016-09-02,"Whether you are pursuing a passionate interest or promoting a creative project, ask specific questions to make sure your words are completely understood. The Sun opposes spiritual Neptune in your 9th House of Future Vision, infusing you with hope for a better tomorrow. Meanwhile, an abundant Mercury-Jupiter connection spews more creative ideas than you can use, enticing you with fantasies just beyond your reach. Honor your lofty aspirations with commitment and hard work, because fulfilling your dream is a gift to yourself that also inspires others."
leo,2016-09-02,"The people you work with might struggle to see your special gifts now, perhaps in part due to your own lack of clarity. Whatever the cause, you're likely to be misunderstood when the Sun in your 2nd House of Self-Esteem opposes deceptive Neptune. Fortunately, you can still express your dreams effectively if you limit your vision and reveal the big picture step by step. Precision in communication can be yours if you simply stay on topic without any deviation. Once you make your point, stop talking long enough to let your words sink in."
virgo,2016-09-02,"You are the go-to person that everyone seems to rely on today, and your communication skills are on point. A highly intelligent conjunction of messenger Mercury with optimistic Jupiter empowers you to share what's on your mind. However, your logic and reason are tested now that the Sun opposes delusional Neptune in your 7th House of Others. Compassion for someone who seems lost or simple gullibility might cloud your judgment. Nevertheless, relationship wounds may be healed if you can overlook petty differences and see the best in everyone."
libra,2016-09-02,"Although you might try to narrow your thinking and filter out excess noise with so many planets in critical Virgo, mental Mercury's alignment with expansive Jupiter widens your intellectual horizons. Additionally, the Sun's opposition to nebulous Neptune can fuel your dreams or lull you with a false sense of security. Don't stress trying to fine-tune the fuzzy spectrum of reality now. Instead of concentrating on any single event, pay attention to the entire mix. As Mark Twain said, ""You can't depend on your eyes when your imagination is out of focus."""
scorpio,2016-09-02,"Your vivid imagination adds an extra sparkle to your world today. A dynamic opposition between the brilliant Sun and elusive Neptune can attract people who are all flash and little substance. Diaphanous Neptune's presence in your 5th House of Romance is a perfect condition for falling for a fairy tale, but risky for making lasting commitments. As long as you don't engage in serious business, you can have a great time now without facing negative consequences. As Anais Nin wrote, ""We do not see things as they are, we see things as we are."""
sagittarius,2016-09-02,"Finishing your work should be a piece of cake today as long as you don't promise too much. Mercury's retrograde dance with overconfident Jupiter occurs in your 10th House of Public Responsibility, encouraging you to underestimate the complexity of a project. However, you might end up spreading your energy so thin to fulfill your commitments in a timely manner that you fall short on all fronts. Even if you think you can stay on track, every little thing that happens lures you away from being practical now. Idealism loses to pragmatism when it comes to taking care of business."
capricorn,2016-09-02,"Your enthusiasm is on the rise, yet you may lose focus today if your goals fade into the shrouded mists of uncertainty. Although the Sun's opposition to nebulous Neptune opens your heart to the unlimited potential of the future, it can also set you up for failure if your expectations are not grounded in reality. However, even impractical dreams fill your soul with the promise of a better tomorrow. Instead of planning too far ahead, concentrate on doing the best you can in the present moment. Once you've successfully navigated the current challenges, your life will blossom in ways you can't imagine."
aquarius,2016-09-02,"Protecting your material resources makes sense today because even a short lapse of attention to your finances could create trouble fast. In fact, a major purchase may be a bad idea now that the Sun in your 8th House of Shared Resources opposes flaky Neptune in your 2nd House of Money. Investing in someone else's fantasy can be a costly experience, emotionally and economically. Cultivating self-respect helps prevent another person's neediness from draining your bank account or damaging your confidence."
pisces,2016-09-02,"You're motivated to look past the limits of reality today, even though you don't know what you might find. However, your judgment may not be very sound when the Sun opposes metaphysical Neptune in your intuitive sign. Nevertheless, the most outlandish dreams are worthy of consideration now. Keep the doors to your imagination open as wide as possible because you have the magic touch to manifest miracles if you believe in yourself."
aries,2016-09-03,"You have charm to spare today and can be a magnet for creative folks who turn work into play. People bring more joy into your life as a sweet lunar conjunction to sexy Venus spices up your social life. This is a great time to make amends with someone if a relationship has recently cooled off. Even an old enemy may reconsider their allegiance if you take the initiative now to resolve your issues with an open mind and heart. Jimi Hendrix said, ""When the power of love overcomes the love of power, the world will know peace."""
taurus,2016-09-03,"You might be tempted to cast aside your sensible plans today as your desire to engage in pleasurable activities takes center stage. Your key planet Venus colors your perceptions as she aligns with the evocative Moon, emphasizing sweet emotions. However, a fateful aspect between mischievous Mercury and high-strung Uranus adds a sense of urgency to your needs. The danger of overindulgence is present, as is your ability to express yourself with more confidence than you actually feel. A little caution comes in handy when following your heart."
gemini,2016-09-03,"A soothing conversation with a friend comforts you with pleasant thoughts today. Nevertheless, retrograde Mercury's otherworldly alignment with electric Uranus stirs a restless breeze that makes it difficult to feel completely settled now. On the upside, you may experience a breakthrough in awareness about your responsibilities and professional goals. An unexpected sequence of events could spur a change in your work duties in the days ahead. Remember, reviewing your past can leave you stuck on Memory Lane; envisioning the future opens the door to opportunity."
cancer,2016-09-03,"Your heart is alternatively attracted and repulsed to someone as love and fear take turns guiding you through the tricky realm of relationships today. While a sweet Moon-Venus conjunction calms your 4th House of Security, an erratic Mercury-Uranus aspect arouses your inner rebel. Keep an open mind and be ready for surprises. Paradoxically, the road ahead clears once you adjust your thinking and embrace the unknown."
leo,2016-09-03,"Someone may have recently offered you a lucrative opportunity. However, it's not turning out to be what you expected and you're now anxious to learn the rest of the story. Communicator Mercury connects with revolutionary Uranus and authoritative Saturn, giving you the clout to use your words effectively. Tell it like it is today, for others will respect you as long as you keep your integrity and don't lose your cool. Adopting a balanced approach creates a healthy atmosphere for all involved. Lao Tzu wrote, ""If you correct your mind, the rest of your life will fall into place."""
virgo,2016-09-03,"Staying conscious of other people's feelings can be a tough task now. Fortunately, the Moon's conjunction with beautiful Venus helps you get away with otherwise unacceptable behavior and you are stubbornly sticking to your agenda. Nevertheless, current circumstances could provide you with a rude awakening today. Even if you are uncomfortable with an unexpected change of rules, just accept it and move forward. And above all, be kind in your words and deeds; everyone you meet is fighting a battle you know nothing about."
libra,2016-09-03,"Pleasure prevails today, but you may toss good judgment out the window to play with friends or to pursue a questionable romance. The longing to satisfy your desires can prompt you to lose sight of your basic values and, perhaps, even spend more than you should. It might be appropriate to broaden your palate and feed your senses, but keeping this indulgence within reasonable bounds now can save you from regret later on. The Greek philosopher Epicurius wrote, ""Be moderate in order to taste the joys of life in abundance."""
scorpio,2016-09-03,"Finding balance isn't always easy for you Scorpio extremists. You may be so eager to help anyone in need today that you say yes before considering the cost of such a sacrifice. However, you can lean on the objective Libra Moon to establish equilibrium between your personal goals and your commitments to others. Mercury's creative quintile to responsible Saturn indicates that discipline and restraint are your current keys to success. Good fortune is indicated as long as you don't go overboard or overlook any significant details. Nevertheless, making generosity part of your growth strategy is medicine for your heart."
sagittarius,2016-09-03,"A gentle nudge from a friend might feel like an unexpected shove today. Normally, you would just push back, but you won't likely be in the mood to fight as the reflective Moon hugs gentle Venus in gracious Libra. Although you may be blindsided by someone you trust, your overconfidence in the situation probably wasn't warranted. Fortunately, clever Mercury offers you a new way to react that isn't angry or aggressive, enabling you to put a relationship back on harmonious ground. As Elvis Costello sings, ""What's so funny about peace, love and understanding?"""
capricorn,2016-09-03,"You can temper your high hopes with your down-to-earth common sense in a way that allows you to bring about positive long-term changes. A magical Mercury-Saturn alignment empowers you to narrow your focus and harness the energy you're feeling now, so you can channel it more judiciously in the days ahead. A socially skillful Moon-Venus conjunction in your 10th House of Career inspires you to turn on the charm and express your creative ideas in an approachable manner. Eleanor Roosevelt said, ""The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams."""
aquarius,2016-09-03,"You may be overexcited today as new ideas continue to explode into awareness. Fortunately, your judgment improves when retrograde Mercury connects with stabilizing Saturn. However, it's challenging to ground the energy because it feels as if there is a lot on the line. You might be willing to risk more now that you believe the consequences of your current actions will turn out for the best. Samuel Johnson wrote, ""The natural flights of the human mind are not from pleasure to pleasure, but from hope to hope."""
pisces,2016-09-03,"You are being given a golden opportunity to clear the air of unresolved feelings which are weighing heavy on your heart. Retrograde Mercury aligned with far-reaching Jupiter yesterday, and is still widening your horizons today. Nevertheless, it's the conjunction between the Moon and vulnerable Venus that offers compassion in communication, motivating you to mend fences. There's no reason to look back when you have so much to look forward to now."
aries,2016-09-04,"Cut yourself some slack today if you fall short of your own expectations. You may feel responsible for someone's well-being and go out of your way to assist them. Selfless service is wonderful, but not if you become a martyr in the process. Although placing yourself in a victim role is not your typical style, you might not see other options clearly now. Nevertheless, when you are called upon to set aside your own plans to come to the aid of a friend, don't forget that saving something for yourself is important, too."
taurus,2016-09-04,"Pursuing pleasure can be a healthy indulgence today. However, you must be as flexible as possible if you want to enjoy the excitement of love. Something you previously overlooked might suddenly become the center of conversation. Nevertheless, reaching satisfaction could take a while, so make positive changes without expecting immediate results. Race-car driver Mario Andretti said, ""Circumstances may cause interruptions and delays, but never lose sight of your goal."""
gemini,2016-09-04,"You must feel emotionally safe before you engage in sweet talk today. Although you may crave a lighthearted encounter, you might not have the time for such fun and games. Listen to the messages of several planets in virtuous Virgo as they cluster in your 4th House of Roots now, while increasing responsibilities on the home front bring your mind back to the fundamentals. News anchor David Brinkley quipped, ""A successful person is one who can lay a firm foundation with the bricks others have thrown at him."""
cancer,2016-09-04,"You are busier than usual now yet may seek even more distractions to add to the noise of the day. Although you might try to conjure up a variety of interesting activities today, you won't likely want to leave the neighborhood while the Sun brightens the soulful North Node in your 3rd House of Immediate Environment. Make good use of this cosmic energy by redirecting your attention to catching up on correspondence and tackling numerous chores. A task finished is better than an unfinished one that could be perfect."
leo,2016-09-04,"Unconventional ideas trigger uncharacteristic doubts about your self-worth today. However, income and self-esteem can rise from a low point with objective analysis and hard work. The fair-minded Libra Moon gives you a fulcrum point on which to balance your life. But Luna's high-powered opposition to unpredictable Uranus prompts you to make surprising choices. Nevertheless, enjoy the creative possibilities available when you're no longer bound by tradition or self-restraint. On the other side of fear lies freedom."
virgo,2016-09-04,"Your drive for quality is overwhelming at times, but now you have a chance to change your story. Instead of expecting perfection in the present moment, think of your life as a process where gradual improvement is the goal. Gratefully acknowledge each advancement as a step in the right direction, no matter how much further there is to go. Your time is precious, so weed out the hopes and concerns you can't do anything about today. Focus on where you can create positive change in the weeks ahead. From the tiniest acorn grows the mighty oak."
libra,2016-09-04,"Although you intuitively know there are great opportunities on the horizon, you still may be frustrated by the current speed of progress. You might be unaware that your fear of failure is now a major impediment to your success. But your worries are probably unwarranted, based on past occurrences that have nothing to do with current events. You can reminisce about your personal history all you want, but you can't change it. If you continue to look back, you'll miss what's right in front of you."
scorpio,2016-09-04,"You may find yourself at the center of attention in your social network today. Rather than avoiding the spotlight, you enjoy the adoration enough now to figure out how to sustain your few minutes of fame. However, you might be shocked when someone does something that's socially unacceptable or counterproductive to your cause. Nevertheless, motivating others is more effective when you encourage them to be the best version of themselves. The world already has plenty of critics; try being a cheerleader instead."
sagittarius,2016-09-04,"Taking slow and deliberate steps is your surest path to success now that the radiant Sun is aligned with the North Lunar Node in your 10th House of Career. Nevertheless, you are capable of raising your professional profile by increasing your responsibilities and assuming more authority. Master a new skill and you will gain the confidence and competence to upgrade your status at work. Treat your ideas with respect because they can produce impressive results if you're willing to commit to them."
capricorn,2016-09-04,"Finding the right balance between humility and grandiosity is tricky today. Ironically, three planets are now traveling through detail-oriented Virgo and your 9th House of Big Ideas, revealing the tension between the very small and the very large. You may tend toward over-exuberance now, even in your daydreams, but you could also suddenly manifest the trip of a lifetime. Buddhist teacher Thich Nhat Hanh says, ""Because you are alive, everything is possible."""
aquarius,2016-09-04,"The current lessons could be tough ones that may challenge your faith. However, you will emerge with a stronger understanding of where you are headed -- not necessarily in your career, but on your spiritual journey. The Sun is shining in your 8th House of Shared Resources, enabling you to thrive as the storms of change blow into your life. It's more important to pay attention to the present moment than to worry about positioning yourself for the future. Trust the universe and believe you're exactly where you need to be now."
pisces,2016-09-04,"You are willing to jump through hoops to live up to other people's expectations today. You may think you're on an equal footing with everyone else, but you still feel an inexplicable need to impress them with your actions. Three planets residing in meticulous Virgo help you focus on the details, but you could quickly become hypercritical of someone else's ideas. Once your intentions are clear, smaller issues can be ironed out. As Dr. Seuss wrote, ""Step with care and great tact; and remember that life's a great balancing act."""
aries,2016-09-05,"Don't worry if your current choices seem irrational since it still may take time to get a clear perspective on events at work. Nevertheless, the extreme Scorpio Moon pushes you to react one way or another, even if Mercury's retrograde means that a final decision isn't as final as you think. This might be one of those times when you need to trust your intuition until your rational mind catches up with your emotional experience. Listen to your inner voice that doesn't use words. Silence isn't empty; it's full of answers."
taurus,2016-09-05,"It's easier to meet people now, both personally and professionally, even while you're also developing a deeper level of connection in your current relationships. The passionate Scorpio Moon's visit to your 7th House of Partnerships intensifies all interactions, especially while red-hot Mars is in the equation. You can package your feelings with enthusiasm to make your case, but might come on so strong that others back away before you deliver your message. Ultimately, it's your willingness to listen and learn that enhances an exchange of ideas beneficial to all involved."
gemini,2016-09-05,"You must revisit the lesson of self-restraint today or suffer the consequences of an ill-fated impulsive decision. It's more advantageous to improve what you already have going now, rather than rushing off to start something new. The Moon's shift into your 6th House of Daily Routine reaffirms your need to eliminate emotional distractions and concentrate on the basic necessities of life. Leave the grand gestures and earth-shattering epiphanies for another time. Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."
cancer,2016-09-05,"Opportunities for personal satisfaction rise from the ashes of a recent defeat, enabling you to turn losses into gains. The Moon's move into regenerative Scorpio and your 5th House of Self-Expression inspires you with passion and imagination to bring new life to a fading romance or to reinvigorate a stagnant project. Your methodical approach pushes you past your fears and straight toward what you want most in life now. Persistence in the pursuit of your own interests is a critical ingredient in your current success story."
leo,2016-09-05,"Although you may be in touch with complex feelings that are lurking in the shadows today, it's time to change your attitude and lighten up your life. The transformative power of the Scorpio Moon brightens your 4th House of Security, motivating you to confront an unresolved hurt from the past, process it and move on. Fortunately, impulsive Mars in adventurous Sagittarius, a fellow fire sign, empowers you to do what makes you feel great in the moment. As poet Guillaume Appollinaire wrote, ""Now and then it's good to pause in our pursuit of happiness and just be happy."""
virgo,2016-09-05,"Finding the right balance between unbridled hope and unexpected disillusionment makes for a complex and powerfully intense transition. Opportunistic Jupiter is in the last few days of its year-long stay in your sign, turning your optimism into panic as you realize that your current growth phase may be swiftly coming to a close. Although wild leaps will likely miss the mark, your enthusiasm can still be broken down into small increments that will enable you to reach your goals. Inch by inch it's a cinch; yard by yard it's hard."
libra,2016-09-05,"Your ambivalence falls away when changing circumstances motivate you to make choices with more certainty. The Moon's entry into your 2nd House of Money focuses your attention on practical matters that affect your material wealth. However, you may need to be a financial detective and gather information before signing on the dotted line. Acquiring the right data allows you to effectively follow through on your intentions. However, you must be careful not to jump to an erroneous conclusion in your haste to seize the moment. As Frank Lloyd Wright said, ""The truth is more important than the facts."""
scorpio,2016-09-05,"You're driven to push your agenda forward today if you fervently believe in your mission. You can put up quite a fight if others at work are moving in a different direction. Thankfully, your self-confidence is high and you possess a greater awareness of how to manage your own energy now that the Moon is stirring the pot in your sign. You may reach a point where you decide to break away from the group and head off on a solo adventure. Shrewdly acknowledging the limitations of your coworkers tells you when to bring them with you, and when to advance on your own."
sagittarius,2016-09-05,"Your friends might think that all is wonderful in your world, but there's more going on within your brain than is apparent on the surface. You're reluctant to reveal everything you know until people demonstrate that they are ready to handle the entire truth as you see it. However, misunderstandings are likely and you must exercise caution before asserting yourself while Mercury is still retrograde. Be patient; although the tides are changing, it will still take time for the new currents to carry you to your destination."
capricorn,2016-09-05,"A team effort can create something special now, bringing you positive recognition in the near future. The Moon's shift into secretive Scorpio and your 11th House of Social Networks reveals hidden talents that make you a vital contributor to the community. Your skill at assessing the strengths and weaknesses of your associates is a key factor to increasing group productivity. Nevertheless, you must remember to balance the intensity of the energy you expend with others by seeking quiet places where you can recharge your batteries alone."
aquarius,2016-09-05,"Although you might be convinced your goals are slipping through your fingers, developing a plan for your professional growth can ensure greater success in the days ahead. Nevertheless, you're willing to convey your doubts to your associates while the emotional Moon camps out in your 10th House of Career. Although your progress may not be obvious, channeling your energy empowers you to achieve your aspirations. It might appear as if you're not advancing as much as you want, but you're improving your life in more ways now than you think."
pisces,2016-09-05,"Learning is not an abstract process now, but one that must engage your heart as well as your mind. The resourceful Scorpio Moon's current emphasis on your 9th House of Future Vision intensifies your desire to broaden your frame of reference. You welcome new ideas and experiences that inspire you to set more ambitious goals. Fortunately, if you manage all the pesky details first, a magic carpet ride of opportunity will take your life to new heights."
aries,2016-09-06,"Solutions to problems at work that recently eluded you are now ripe for the harvest. The transformative nature of cryptic Pluto in your 10th House of Career can reveal your assumptions about people who previously held power over you. Your old ways of relating to authority are no longer relevant. You can't go back to the safety of the past; commit to what's ahead, rather than clinging to what you once had. George Bernard Shaw wrote, ""Progress is impossible without change, and those who cannot change their minds cannot change anything."""
taurus,2016-09-06,"Your creativity is cooking up a storm today while powerful Pluto harmonizes with the illuminating Sun in your 5th House of Self-Expression. Refining the skills required to manifest your desires demands unwavering concentration, yet your complacency makes it easy for social distractions to derail your best-laid plans. Fortunately, your determination allows you to cut through the clutter and aim your will where it can have maximum positive impact. Saying no to others may be the smartest way to say yes to yourself."
gemini,2016-09-06,"Your coworkers might fall into the trap of underestimating your power now. However, you can shock others with the depth of your understanding and your unrelenting persistence. But there is no reason to be concerned about anyone else's judgments; you are working with a deep emotional reserve and can accomplish more than anyone thinks. In fact, the old motto of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is your rallying cry today: ""The difficult we do immediately. The impossible takes a little longer."""
cancer,2016-09-06,"You're feeling your oats now that the radiant Sun is reinforced by its regenerative trine to ruthless Pluto. But rather than putting your physical resources to the test, the methodical Virgo Sun advises you to conserve your strength for the long haul. Luckily, unrelenting Pluto in your 7th House of Companions indicates that collaborating with others fuels your passion to work even harder. Be smart by using your brains and not your muscles, so you will still have the energy you need tomorrow to finish what you started today."
leo,2016-09-06,"It seems as if everyone is suddenly eager to drop their previous positions and cooperate with you today. But you may overestimate someone's abilities or underestimate the resources needed to finish a project. A little discernment prevents you from wasting your time chasing rainbows across rugged terrain. Nevertheless, a resolute Sun-Pluto trine foretells that you will succeed in navigating the dangerous curves ahead if you decide to put your heart fully into reaching your destination."
virgo,2016-09-06,"You're longing to color outside of the lines today. In fact, your creativity can have a profound impact on others when you simply show up and be yourself. Although you might not have a specific goal in mind now, the willful Sun in your sign forms a smooth trine with passionate Pluto in your 5th House of Romance, enabling you to make a lasting impression on someone you admire. Nevertheless, an overly rigid plan could be your downfall; instead, prepare to make as many minor modifications as necessary as you push forward to your dreams."
libra,2016-09-06,"You might not want to follow the well-meaning advice of others who encourage you to risk more than you're willing now. Thankfully, your keen intuition will successfully guide you with a mix of faith and focus. This is a time for a spiritual renewal as the discerning Virgo Sun in your 12th House of Destiny trines evolutionary Pluto. You are approaching the end of a larger cycle but you must allow the past to fade away if you truly want to move into the future. Find your new dream and then do whatever it takes to transform it into reality."
scorpio,2016-09-06,"A strong dose of purpose and perseverance today enables you to have your way without being pushy to achieve your aims. A superconductive Sun-Pluto trine blesses you with the power of precision rather than brute force. Although you may have recently tried yet failed to make an impression, express your desires once more before moving on. If resources for a creative project are lacking or if you lost in a personal quest for love, you can travel within to find the resilience you need to recover gracefully. Ultimately, it's not necessary to convince anyone of anything if you just speak the truth."
sagittarius,2016-09-06,"You are capable of accomplishing more than you ever dreamed possible today. The dedication of the hard-working Virgo Sun in your 10th House of Public Responsibility is supported by a trine from powerful Pluto, blessing you with an apparently infinite reserve of vitality and the commitment to deliver on your promises. But tread carefully, since poorly managed energy will not last forever. Fortunately, a well-conceived plan combined with sustainable action leads to surprising results."
capricorn,2016-09-06,"It's tempting to seek security in what you know, rather than facing the unknown. But the greatest potential for positive change does not always come from taking the safest route. Furthermore, waiting to initiate action is not a smart idea. Luckily, you may feel invincible while the Sun in your 9th House of Adventure trines fierce Pluto. But uncertainty will soon creep back into the picture, so make your move now while the cosmic forces are working in your favor. Today is your lucky day only if you strike while the iron is hot."
aquarius,2016-09-06,"There is more potential packed into the present moment than you realize. Thankfully, you can work behind the scenes quite effectively while the industrious Virgo Sun in your 8th House of Shared Resources conspires with obsessive Pluto. Completing a job is more crucial than gaining attention today. Be as specific as possible when you focus your intention, for the power of precision can help make your dreams come true. C.S. Lewis wrote, ""Aim at Heaven and you will get Earth thrown in. Aim at Earth and you get neither."""
pisces,2016-09-06,"Compassion, sentimentality and a vivid imagination are your trademarks. However, giving people too much leeway today can weaken your position. While your softheartedness is admirable, you risk wasting resources if you scatter your gifts indiscriminately. Fortunately, a confident Sun-Pluto trine activates your 7th House of Relationships and empowers you to be a more effective leader. As psychologist Brene Brown writes, ""Daring to set boundaries is about having the courage to love ourselves even when we risk disappointing others."""
aries,2016-09-07,"You have an air of invincibility about you and won't stand for anything blocking your path to success. Fortunately, you possess an uncharacteristic patience today, enabling you to give others the room to breathe. Nevertheless, you're wise to make the most of the current cosmic momentum while the Sun energizes uncompromising Pluto in your 10th House of Career. Thankfully, your drive is softened just a touch, allowing you to get away with announcing to the world that you are an unstoppable force to be acknowledged. A gentle hand wins you more admiration than you might expect."
taurus,2016-09-07,"Your imagination soars today and your heart is stirred by divine daydreams of love and pleasure. However, complications arise while your key planet Venus connects with pragmatic Saturn and whimsical Neptune, blurring the boundaries between reality and fantasy. Although you could misread someone's signals, don't withdraw in fear. It's healthier now to move forward with the assurance that a stabilizing Venus-Saturn sextile can bring. Don't  overestimate your weakness or underestimate your strength."
gemini,2016-09-07,"You're ready to roll your sleeves up and get your hands dirty today -- and thankfully, your hard work will likely be rewarded. You have an ambitious goal in mind and are willing to be patient in order to achieve the desired results. Nevertheless, you might secretly believe that you possess superpowers and can get whatever you want now. Be careful about pushing your agenda too hard or you could undo your recent gains. Gentle persistence is more productive than overt aggression."
cancer,2016-09-07,"Discretion is essential today while penetrating Pluto stimulates deep conversations. Spilling a secret opens a can of worms, prompting you to rethink your ability to make decisions in the throes of passion. Nevertheless, you can cut through the clutter of confusion and score some powerful points if you're well-prepared and singularly focused. Sneaking away from your usual surroundings is your ticket to a magical moment that could awaken your heart and inspire your dreams."
leo,2016-09-07,"Your fierce intentions produce concrete results when combined with hard work. Your odds improve if you're willing to stick with a project even when it seems like you're not making any progress. Thankfully, a stabilizing Venus-Saturn sextile cools your sense of urgency so you can wait for gratification. Although you may mix up your fantasies with reality when Venus misaligns with ephemeral Neptune, your current actions benefit from a creative twist. Don't just look at the stars; be one."
virgo,2016-09-07,"You are doing your best to balance your dreams with the current limitations of your life. Fortunately, a formidable Sun-Pluto trine empowers you to find effective solutions to problems that might otherwise prevent you from tackling big tasks. You may be aware of information that gives you a distinct edge, yet abusing the power it delivers could undermine trust. Let your light shine so brightly that others can see their way out of the dark."
libra,2016-09-07,"You are blessed with an abundance of positive energy today that inspires you to realize your goals. However, you may blur the lines between the current circumstances and your romantic illusions while Venus in your sign stirs up mischief with delusional Neptune. Thankfully, your key planet Venus is also collaborating with sensible Saturn, instructing you to balance your idealistic dreams with reality. Dr. Seuss wrote, ""Fantasy is a necessary ingredient in living. It's a way of looking at life through the wrong end of a telescope."""
scorpio,2016-09-07,"You are wrestling with your angels and demons today. You may be super productive now, motivating others with your efficiency. However, planetary crosscurrents heighten your emotional sensitivity while the Moon is still in your perceptive sign. A starry-eyed Venus-Neptune connection skews your judgment, possibly triggering paranoid thinking that allows you to misinterpret someone's intentions. On the plus side, meaningful conversations could overflow with incredible kindness and compassion. An Amish proverb reminds us, ""Instead of putting others in their place, put yourself in their place."""
sagittarius,2016-09-07,"You might believe you're unstoppable now that your life is moving forward again. Ironically, an illusory Venus-Neptune alignment infuses you with dreams of a fairy tale romance, while a steadfast Venus-Saturn connection simultaneously encourages common sense. Think before acting on your feelings or you will find yourself untangling the emotions of a messy situation. Nevertheless, success in your current endeavors is likely as long as you don't have outrageous expectations. A moment of thought prevents many moments of regret."
capricorn,2016-09-07,"You can express your plans today with such clarity that you're able to forge ahead without ruffling anyone's feathers. An odd mixture of cosmic signals helps you peel away any illusions you have about what you want in life, possibly leaving you feeling emotionally unsatisfied. Seek a more compassionate approach to self-assessment and a more tactful way to tell others your needs. As Buddha taught, ""If you truly love yourself, you could never hurt another."""
aquarius,2016-09-07,"People may mistakenly assume that you're a pushover today because your quiet manner is not revealing your whole story. Nevertheless, you might believe you will have more freedom if no one is paying attention to you. It's not that you are operating without an agenda now; it's just that you are keeping it to yourself. Luckily, the cooperation between charming Venus and persistent Saturn gives you the endurance you need to finish what you start. However, bending the truth can create trouble down the road; honesty is the best policy."
pisces,2016-09-07,"Images of love and beauty swirl around in your imagination, possibly exceeding the limits of the material world. Amorous and artistic Venus forms a complicated aspect with enchanting Neptune in your 1st House of Self, washing away inhibitions and stimulating your colorful fantasies. Thankfully, pragmatic Saturn is also in the equation, inspiring you to bring the mists of illusion down to earth. Although this isn't the time to make important decisions about practical matters, you will certainly enjoy the dance between these two worlds while it lasts."
aries,2016-09-08,"You have a plan to inject a shot of adrenaline into your life today. You're eager to initiate direct action as you step closer toward making your move. However, you might realize that previous commitments are still keeping you from making the important changes you're visualizing  in your dreams. You may wish to do something right away to rock the boat, but the consequences of your current behavior are still to be determined. Act if you are certain; if you are wavering in doubt, it's best to wait."
taurus,2016-09-08,"You're ready for a major shake-up of relationship energy to thrust you forward into an exciting new direction. Interpersonal dynamics appear complicated when the Moon runs into karmic Saturn in your 8th House of Intimacy and Transformation. However, it's hard to take anything too seriously when the Moon squares starry-eyed Neptune. Being temporarily stripped of your illusions may sound healthy, but this means you must face your fears of the unknown. Even the most reliable things seem up in the air now. Don't try to fake confidence or a reality check will call your bluff when you least expect it."
gemini,2016-09-08,"Stable foundations are beginning to dissolve and it's hard to know where to stand. You can sense that your world is growing more expansive, simultaneously enchanting and confusing you with fantastic scenarios of the future that may be totally unrealistic. Still, you must claim your favorite visions to be the guiding lights for the positive changes you hope to make now. As Aldous Huxley wrote, ""Dream in a pragmatic way."""
cancer,2016-09-08,"Recent actions may resurface today for further consideration. Keep an open mind and postpone making serious commitments because cosmic factors add ambiguity to what people say. In fact, what you hear might not be the whole story, so filter information with the extra caution that's always recommended during Mercury's retrograde phase. On the positive side, faith could wash away unnecessary doubt or cynicism, giving you more hope that you can make a real difference in the world."
leo,2016-09-08,"Reaching too far could cause you to lose your balance today. Your perceptions may not be accurate as you stand on unfamiliar ground. Even if everything seems equally important now, financial stress can provoke a lack of confidence. Taking steps to improve your self-esteem might also be an effective way to ultimately increase your income. As the legendary Wayne Dyer wrote, ""Self-worth comes from one thing -- thinking that you are worthy."""
virgo,2016-09-08,"Your irrepressible desire to express your creativity is ready to blossom. However, the evocative Moon bumps into resistant Saturn today, teaching you a valuable lesson. Meanwhile, Neptune's presence in your 7th House of Partners brings someone into your life to play the role of a muse. Nevertheless, be wary of overindulging yourself, overestimating another person's abilities or spending more than your budget allows. Albert Einstein wrote, ""The difference between genius and stupidity is genius has its limits."""
libra,2016-09-08,"Hopefully, you remember to respect people's boundaries, even when you're feeling ecstatic about your future. Although pleasure has been abundant, the pressure kicks back in today as strict Saturn reminds you that avoidance isn't a viable long-term strategy. Meanwhile, imaginative Neptune counsels you on the importance of your dreams. After your work is done, take time to reevaluate the place responsibility holds in your life. The conflict between clinging to your past and stepping into your future is complex enough that it might need additional time to resolve."
scorpio,2016-09-08,"You may misjudge the amount of energy that's required to keep up your participation in a group activity now. But opportunistic Jupiter's yearlong visit to your 11th House of Social Networks is coming to an end, giving you one last chance to redefine your relationship with your community. Nevertheless, beautiful Venus is waiting in your 12th House of Privacy, reminding you that taking time to create a spiritual sanctuary now is not a retreat from reality; it's a return to dancing with the delight and divinity that exists in your heart."
sagittarius,2016-09-08,"Second thoughts about a recent professional decision make you wonder if you're on the right track, especially if your job is no longer supporting your dreams. Unfortunately, your ambitions may be clouded by fantasies as a motivational Moon-Saturn conjunction in your optimistic sign squares otherworldly Neptune, obscuring your current path. A disappointment or setback can morph into disorientation, leaving you to feel a sense of alienation. But don't blame your frustration on anyone else; focusing on the positive potential brings more clarity to the picture. You are what you think."
capricorn,2016-09-08,"You are typically quite eager to obey the rules and respect the limits, but lately it's been tough to rein in your extravagant desires. Thankfully, the Moon's conjunction with dutiful Saturn reminds you when to call it quits today. Paradoxically, letting go of control could be exactly what you need while fanciful Neptune cheers you on from the sidelines. But your current choices are intertwined with enticing dreams that have little possibility of manifestation. Although you find it challenging to separate your fantasies from reality now, the power of discernment is your greatest ally."
aquarius,2016-09-08,"Your instinct to maintain an alliance that isn't working is reflected by a responsible Moon-Saturn conjunction. Stern Saturn can restrict the ways in which you respond to your friends as it meets up with the inspirational Sagittarius Moon in your 11th House of Groups. Nevertheless, control can easily slip from your grasp as the Moon squares diaphanous Neptune. Don't limit your challenges. Challenge your limits."
pisces,2016-09-08,"Setting career goals is a growing priority when the Moon lines up with hardworking Saturn in your 10th House of Status. Staying alert by keeping your eyes open and your ears to the ground enables you to raise your standard of living now. However, it may take a while to establish solid footing with slippery Neptune in the mix. The bigger your expectations, the more important it is to take your time and put every little detail into its proper and exact place. Dream big; start small."
aries,2016-09-09,"Clues may appear today that give you an inkling of what you can expect as Jupiter enters your 7th House of Partnerships. Instead of pursuing success as a solo act, consider the potential rewards that could develop from your relationships with others. The possibilities might even include committing to love and marriage. But also be on the lookout for encounters in business that lead to learning about new subjects or traveling to places you've never been. Greet everyone you meet with the same respect you wish to receive in return."
taurus,2016-09-09,"You don't want to make any mistakes when taking the next step along your path to success. You could feel somewhat limited in your ability to respond to opportunities today, but rest assured you can turn a small seed into a mighty tree. However, your growth won't come from scattering your energies and taking on lots of new projects while Jupiter moves through your 6th House of Work for the next year. The daily habits that you establish now will set the stage for rewards down the road."
gemini,2016-09-09,"You're eager for more spontaneity and romance in your life once jovial Jupiter shifts into your 5th House of Fun and Games. Nevertheless, you're still carrying residual emotional weight and it might take a few weeks to lighten your load. Someone could be trying to control you in ways that you don't appreciate. The discord isn't quite out in the open which makes it even more difficult to address. Pick an appropriate time to bring up your feelings of anger or resentment, but do so with kindness. Luckily, it takes very little effort to be patient now because you intuitively know that your life is about to change for the better."
cancer,2016-09-09,"The cosmos is offering you a chance to cultivate peace and harmony in your personal life. This lovely news is made possible by a resurgence of self-confidence and a re-connection to your roots. You can derive great satisfaction from your private world when joyous Jupiter takes up residence in your 4th House of Home and Family. Emotional security is an ongoing concern for you Crustaceans, and sometimes it's a struggle to let down your guard. Bob Marley said, ""Being vulnerable is the only way to allow your heart to feel true pleasure."""
leo,2016-09-09,"Hang onto your hat, for the busyness of your everyday life is about to intensify before you know it. Although you may want to deepen a meaningful relationship, expansive Jupiter's visit to your 3rd House of Immediate Environment suggests that larger social issues will pull you away from the focus on any one single person. The energetic pace is picking up and people will enter your world with good news if are willing to listen. Don't just stand there when opportunity knocks, open the door and invite it in."
virgo,2016-09-09,"Your personal development has been on the fast track while Jupiter, the magnifying lens of the cosmos, was in your sign last year. You have grown in many aspects; perhaps you even stretched beyond your normal comfort zone. However, Jupiter now moves on to objective Libra and your 2nd House of Self-Worth, offering you strategies to solidify your recent gains. Although things may settle down on a psychological level, the action will continue in more practical ways, positively impacting your ability to acquire material wealth and greater self-esteem."
libra,2016-09-09,"It's time to stretch your wings so you can fly higher than you ever dared to dream. A wave of optimism begins to mount, carrying your hopes to new heights as auspicious Jupiter returns to your sign for a yearlong visit. However, everything looks better than it actually is, so remember to return to the ground for an occasional reality check. This is the beginning of an exciting twelve-year growth cycle, so get ready to embark on a journey to reach for the stars."
scorpio,2016-09-09,"Although your immediate needs may be quite pragmatic, imagination is your salvation now. If you can visualize it, you can manifest it while propitious Jupiter blesses your 12th House of Destiny. Magically, your aspirations are freed from the constraints of your real-world obligations. It's most beneficial to use this time to dissolve your boundaries through spiritual study than to lose your identity in unattainable fantasies. Quiet the mind and the soul will speak."
sagittarius,2016-09-09,"You are ready to forge a new relationship with your network of friends and associates. Your key planet Jupiter is beginning its yearlong visit to your 11th House of Groups, expanding your community involvement and encouraging your participation in social causes. This shift is a background note that not only feels good; it can bring important people into your life as your dreams for the future are magnified and reflected back to you. Your natural idealism motivates you to help others for the simple sake of doing what's right. You don't need a big wallet to have a big heart."
capricorn,2016-09-09,"You Mountain Goats are an ambitious lot as you are driven to climb to the highest summits. Now you stand to reap the harvest from the seeds you've sown and tended over the years as opportunistic Jupiter enters your 10th House of Career. But this time of fruition is not without its stress. Even if you receive professional recognition, you must strike a healthy balance between your long-term goals and your immediate emotional needs. Don't ignore the softer and more artistic side of life. As John Cleese said, ""If you want creative workers, give them enough time to play."""
aquarius,2016-09-09,"The future is calling to you in a voice that sounds much like your own. Oddly enough, Jupiter's visit to your 9th House of Big Ideas is not about any one concrete objective. You're willing to let the promotion pass you by if the additional responsibilities might inhibit your potential explorations of new ideas or new lands. Fortunately, you're on the edge of a great adventure. If you were consistent in your recent efforts, now is the time to collect your rewards and set your sights on the next horizon."
pisces,2016-09-09,"You can see far into the future as changes clear away old blockages. Jupiter's shift into your 8th House of Deep Connections reveals a whole new landscape from which to explore all relationships. You are intrigued with the complexity of the entanglements that lurk beneath the surface and can learn much about the magic of shared vulnerability this year. Sometimes, dependency on another person slows your growth; however, financial and emotional interdependence now leads you down a very different road than you expected. Life is full of wonderful surprises if you keep your heart and mind wide open."
aries,2016-09-10,"Frustration mounts if you aren't measurably progressing toward your goals. Surprisingly, you may end up doing better than you expect as long as you respect other people's boundaries. Karmic Saturn seeks stability, yet its stressful square to nebulous Neptune could bring discouragement if control of your own destiny slips away today, leaving you uncertain about your next move. A temporary retreat seems to be a smart idea now but if you want a lasting resolution, take responsibility for your own emotions instead of attempting to change anyone else's."
taurus,2016-09-10,"You're currently walking a fine line between the real and the ideal while limit-setting Saturn crosses paths with visionary Neptune. Steady growth is more likely if you stay on top of your obligations, but following through with your promises may not be all that easy now. The secret to success is graciously adapting to the shift from dreams to necessities. Be prepared to radically alter your approach as conditions continue to fluctuate. Sometimes you need to hold your ground and other times it's best to go with the flow."
gemini,2016-09-10,"It's nearly impossible to deny an underlying sense that something isn't quite right, for you can feel the resistance every which way you turn. Nevertheless, you're eager to assert your opinion if someone challenges your perspective. What begins as a bout of free-floating anxiety can morph into an unavoidable situation that requires you to make a tough decision. Remember, cosmic forces are always pulling you in two different directions. Maintaining your balance is easier if you work with the external influences instead of against them."
cancer,2016-09-10,"Your responsibilities are in the process of change and it takes a lot of focus to keep up with them. It's exhausting to fight against pressure from others, yet an uncomfortable Saturn-Neptune square reveals a significant difference of agendas. Conserve your energy for tasks you do well, rather than wasting time engaging in losing battles. Even if you're not prepared to take a risk professionally today, at least let your imagination cultivate visions of a more rewarding career. According to Oprah Winfrey, ""The biggest adventure you can take is to live the life of your dreams."""
leo,2016-09-10,"You may be dazed and confused today, but thankfully, clarity chases the clouds away later to give you a new purpose in life. A stressful square between accountable Saturn and hazy Neptune has you wondering if you are in a state of denial. Having the courage to question your direction is healthy, but don't be surprised if your malaise grows the deeper you dig. You might find it an impossible task to get to the origin of your low spirits now. Keep calm and remember the words of Deepak Chopra, ""Every great change is preceded by chaos."""
virgo,2016-09-10,"People seem to be misleading you today, even if they're not doing it intentionally. Meanwhile, you're so sure of your own position that you have little interest in negotiating or compromising with others. Nevertheless, the key to your success is blending authoritative Saturn's certainty with intuitive Neptune's vision. Let your imagination wander, even if you don't see any pragmatic value to this daydreaming process. The distance between your most magical dreams and your future is called action."
libra,2016-09-10,"Following your dreams may seem completely out of the question today. You struggle to strike a workable balance between spiritual pursuits and daily responsibilities, especially when taskmaster Saturn forms a conflicting square with escapist Neptune. Be careful how you express your annoyance or you may reveal more about your feelings than you ever intended. Using your smile to change the world is wiser now than letting the world change your smile."
scorpio,2016-09-10,"A leak of confidential information might damage trust today, yet an overreactive Moon-Jupiter square makes it tough to keep secrets. Being honest is essential, but you may want to err on the side of discretion. A square between austere Saturn and delusional Neptune can put an end to a relationship built on illusions. There is an inevitable sadness in bursting bubbles, but it will allow you to move ahead with greater clarity. Psychologist Carl Jung wrote, ""Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakes."""
sagittarius,2016-09-10,"There is a lot at stake today, yet you might not be able to get past your uncertainty about your career choices and how they impact your finances. You may discourage easily when fuzzy Neptune forms a discomforting aspect to ambitious Saturn in your sign. It's exasperating when you can't shake off lingering self-doubt. Although social activities act as a lovely distraction, they can't replace your need for a meaningful existence. Change is everywhere, but you won't get everything you want overnight. The seeds you plant now need time to grow and bear fruit."
capricorn,2016-09-10,"Making careful choices leaves you with enough time and energy to jump on the right opportunity when it comes along. Your ruling planet Saturn squares spacey Neptune, complicating your efforts to turn your dreams into reality now. Nevertheless, the outcome of a current situation may not be apparent until after Mercury turns direct on September 22. What you do today can improve all your tomorrows."
aquarius,2016-09-10,"Reshaping your vision of the future to fit into your current reality can turn confusion into productivity. But even if you're clear about your new destination, you still might have trouble paying for your journey. Materialistic Saturn is like an anchor that tethers you to your long-term plans, and its dynamic square to ephemeral Neptune can wear you out if you don't handle your workload carefully. Don't dream about your success; work for it."
pisces,2016-09-10,"Your sensitive nature can sometimes leave you struggling to speak your mind because you don't want to hurt anyone's feelings. It's even more complicated now that strict Saturn squares gentle Neptune, making it difficult to tune into other people's emotions without feeling their pain. No matter how hard you work to balance necessity with compassion, remember, you can still take care of business while listening to your heart. When you cultivate empathy, you are in a position to take the lemons that life hands you and make lemonade."
aries,2016-09-11,"A person very close to you might have the best of intentions today, but he or she may require so much from you that you consider walking away from it all. Alternatively, someone's actions stimulate buried feelings and motivate you to demand more of life. In either case, primal emotions work their way to the surface, destabilizing relationships in the process. However, you can't judge your success by external events. If you want to feel rich, just count all the things you have that money can't buy."
taurus,2016-09-11,"Your serious mood is not about denying pleasure today; it's about clarifying what you want and quantifying what you're willing to do to get it. But don't complain if you feel undervalued. Just commit to developing your talents to their full potential by demonstrating grace in all that you do now. Nevertheless, you still must reexamine your heart to uncover your basic needs. Growing resentment in a relationship is possible, but it's only a problem if you refuse to make any changes. Distance between two people is often created by an unwillingness to compromise."
gemini,2016-09-11,"The line between pleasure and pain may be quite thin while your senses are in a state of heightened awareness today. If you feel stymied by someone who is supposed to be your ally, an angry response isn't your smartest counter-move. Instead, surprise others with your emotional depth while charismatic Venus squares powerhouse Pluto. But don't go overboard and turn a good thing into a major drama. If you're not getting anywhere fast, back up to catch your breath, reassess your approach and try again."
cancer,2016-09-11,"Your emotions may be tied up in knots due to fear of a potential loss, yet romantic Venus could send you on an intense trip down the rabbit hole today. The highs and lows of passion give you little time to rest as moments of delight are sandwiched between incidents of doubt and dissatisfaction. Developing self-discipline and taking a stand in a relationship now can be hard work, but the long-term rewards of recognition and self-respect are well worth the effort."
leo,2016-09-11,"Although you are more organized in your thinking and capable of executing a well-constructed plan now, success may not be immediately forthcoming. Making your feelings known seems to clear the air, but sweet Venus' square to formidable Pluto can raise the resistance you encounter more than you expect. Luckily, Venus in diplomatic Libra empowers you to handle tricky interpersonal tensions if you're willing to meet others halfway. Bertrand Russell wrote, ""The only thing that will redeem mankind is cooperation."""
virgo,2016-09-11,"An innocent romance may be cast in a darker light while vulnerable Venus squares controlling Pluto today. Unfortunately, mistrust can be fed by lingering confusion, so don't take it personally if the current situation triggers an old issue. Additionally, finances might take a sudden turn south as hidden costs of an economic or romantic adventure come into play. The trouble is if you don't risk anything, you risk more. Keep your eyes wide open and jump."
libra,2016-09-11,"Practicing self-discipline greatly improves your chances of success today. Be wise and forgo immediate gratification in exchange for long-term potential. Nevertheless, there are still tough issues to face that could generate negative feelings like suspicion or resentment. Bringing thoughts out of the shadows and into the light enables you to gracefully manage the complex energy. Avoid covert manipulation; act with integrity in all that you do."
scorpio,2016-09-11,"Your hypersensitivity to the behavior of those closest to you can put a relationship on edge today. Old emotional wounds may feel raw, invoking unproductive jealousy or unreasonable expectations. The range of possibilities in love is being stretched now, but going too far in either direction could damage an existing partnership. Keep in mind that your most important work happens behind the scenes these days. Nourishing your soul and inspiring your imagination put your priorities back in proper perspective."
sagittarius,2016-09-11,"Although you're tempted to say yes to every invitation you receive while social Venus sparkles in your 11th House of Networking, you may be asking for more trouble than you realize. Emotional discomfort might threaten your peace of mind today, but the heightened tension also brings buried truths to light. Discontent is likely brewing, making it impossible to ignore the differences between you and those closest to you. Thankfully, you can figure out the best way to proceed in the long-run once you fully commit to the process in the present moment. Never underestimate the power of now."
capricorn,2016-09-11,"Unstable relationships and uncertainty about your own feelings can leave you feeling depleted now. You may be standing at a fork in the road that requires you to make a decision to go one way or another. Fortunately, you'll likely find resolution when loving Venus squares evolutionary Pluto, marking an end to your recent emotional roller coaster ride, or deepening your commitment to reach satisfaction at any cost. Don't allow envy or differences in style keep you from aligning yourself with those who inspire you to dream big."
aquarius,2016-09-11,"Personal issues intensify, possibly reaching the boiling point today. Extreme behavior precipitates powerful emotional reactions when vulnerable Venus squares potent Pluto. You can't escape the consequences of your actions, especially if you think you're entitled to something you are not. Be sure that you're willing to deal with the heat before adding more fuel to the fire. If you're not pushing the envelope of possibility now, you're probably not trying hard enough. Mistakes caused by going too far are more useful than benefits reaped by playing it safe."
pisces,2016-09-11,"You may feel more comfortable going solo today than depending on anyone else to show up with the goods. Innocent Venus in your 8th House of Intimacy is challenged by mysterious Pluto, stirring feelings of fear or self-doubt. You're in a serious frame of mind now and prefer to avoid casual conversations. Although your passions are intense and your desires deep, the potential rewards of engaging in meaningful exchanges are great enough for you to take a chance. Finding the right co-conspirator is the trick."
aries,2016-09-12,"You might not be able to slow things down today, even if you think it would be a wise move. Superhero Mars is all fired up by mental Mercury and you can't stop your thoughts from running around in frantic circles. If you're feeling an extra zest for life, it's time to convert your enviable enthusiasm into a plan of action. But creating a strategy in your mind is not enough. As Walt Disney said, ""If you can dream it, you can do it."""
taurus,2016-09-12,"Emotional veneers have been stripped away, putting you face to face with your deepest desires. You may be willing to risk rejection now if that's what it takes to be true to yourself. Unfortunately, you could offend someone with your disclosure, which might require you to rebuild trust in the relationship. But in the long run it could prove more damaging to hide your feelings from yourself than to honestly express them to others. Do what is right, not what is easy."
gemini,2016-09-12,"Quick thinking is stimulated by an energetic square between cerebral Mercury and red-hot Mars. Unfortunately, you lack patience with someone who can't keep up with your pace. You're capable of coming up with brilliant answers right away, but how you communicate them will either encourage productive discussion or unnecessary conflict. Although you can't control every variable, choosing your words carefully helps to prevent the interpersonal dynamics from getting out of hand. No matter what, remember the Dalai Lama words: ""Don't let the behavior of others destroy your inner peace."""
cancer,2016-09-12,"Although you're often tentative in your expression, today you're ready to take an emotional risk. An argumentative Mercury-Mars square inspires you to be uncharacteristically impulsive, yet it may be difficult to manage the collateral damage if you jump right in before knowing all the facts. Since Mercury is retrograde in your 3rd House of Communication, it makes sense to back away from petty disagreements. Verbal combat will not bring you closer to your goals, but offering an olive branch demonstrates your willingness to work toward creating an atmosphere of harmony."
leo,2016-09-12,"You may struggle with an individual at work who is unwilling to give an inch today. Unfortunately, you could be fighting a losing battle if challenged by someone in power. It's better to recognize the existence of external authority and make whatever internal adjustments you need. Even negotiating with good intentions might not improve your position now that mischievous Mercury is at cross purposes with warrior Mars. Instead of looking for a fight, fix the situation by changing your focus. Conflict cannot escalate without your participation."
virgo,2016-09-12,"Passive-aggressive messages may be accompanied with a smile today, but you still know if someone is being unkind to you. A hard square between snappy Mercury and pushy Mars prompts spontaneous replies that produce hurt feelings. Old arguments resurface now that retrograde Mercury hooks up with the Sun in your sign. Thankfully, a major drama can be avoided by your willingness to meet others halfway rather than angrily holding your ground. Offering a compromise is easier when mutual respect is the top priority."
libra,2016-09-12,"It might feel as if everyone knows exactly which emotional buttons to push to hook you into their melodramas. Quicksilver Mercury's square to bossy Mars tempts you to replace logic with impatience. Unfortunately, unpremeditated rants will only instigate further discord. Remember, it's not what you say that's contentious; it's how you say it. Find the calm in the center of the storm before you open your mouth."
scorpio,2016-09-12,"You're eager to defend your position today because you think you have all your facts in order. However, it might come as a shock to encounter someone who can be just as stubborn as you. Nevertheless, a combative Mercury-Mars square could bait you into a frustrating disagreement that brings your core beliefs into question. Instead of being swept up in the rising emotions now, use your mental agility to make a plan to put into motion later in the month. In the meantime, tap into your heightened intuition to circumvent any roadblocks in your path."
sagittarius,2016-09-12,"You're quite convincing when you speak from the heart, but an intellectual argument may not be as effective today. Someone's hidden agenda can stir complex emotional crosscurrents and you'll only make matters worse if you try to force a resolution to the tension. Mouthy Mercury squares cantankerous Mars in an explosive yet short-lived aspect. Nevertheless, the discord will settle quicker than you think if you adopt a diplomatic approach. Let there be peace on Earth and let it begin with you."
capricorn,2016-09-12,"Your recent lack of progress might have led you to question if you're on the right path. Although the uncertainty is already beginning to fade, an urgent square between trickster Mercury and militant Mars can reignite a flammable situation. Fortunately, patience is an asset you know how to use to your advantage. Self-control in word and deed minimizes unnecessary drama and earns you the respect you seek. As Ben Franklin wrote, ""Energy and persistence conquer all things."""
aquarius,2016-09-12,"Your rapid-fire thinking allows you to spout off-the-cuff answers today that just might work. However, it's all too easy to slip into verbal sparring when every comment elicits a snappy comeback. It's great to be witty, but cutting remarks could damage a relationship if you're not careful where you aim them. Combine compassion with thoughtfulness to prevent your words from inadvertently turning into weapons. With a little self-awareness now, you can put the power of your mind toward creating messages that motivate people instead of tearing them down."
pisces,2016-09-12,"Think twice before you react emotionally because other people's opinions about your goals are not as important as they seem in the moment. Nevertheless, someone's casual criticism of your career ambitions could trigger a temper tantrum today. In fact, a simple miscommunication is capable of generating a war of words over a petty issue while retrograde Mercury heightens the energy of a quarrelsome Sun-Mars square. Instead of fighting back, channel your anger into climbing the ladder of success. The best revenge is to accomplish what others say cannot be done."
aries,2016-09-13,"Your nerves are on edge and you may be caught off guard by surprising events. However, it's best not to overreact when tensions return from the past, perhaps stronger in intensity than before. You're not interested in accommodating the needs of others today but this conflict only reawakens deeper issues and makes matters worse. Express your feelings carefully in a controlled manner without giving anyone a reason to plot against you. Channeling this turbulent energy toward positive transformation isn't easy; but if anyone can do it, it's you."
taurus,2016-09-13,"You are swept up in a whirlwind of activity today, which may not leave you much time for yourself. As a result, you could strike out angrily in judgment against a friend, colleague or classmate -- even if the person doesn't deserve it. Nevertheless, if you refrain from keeping score, you can step lightly through the emotional minefield without setting off any explosions or wearing yourself out with unnecessary concern. Taking the high road is the only solution that makes sense."
gemini,2016-09-13,"Deep bonds from the past can cloud a current relationship, so be mindful when clarifying the differences between your memories and current events. A Mercury-Sun conjunction squares pugnacious Mars in your 7th House of Relationships, creating discord with others that could result from projections of your inner turmoil. Facing your own ghosts minimizes your tendency to fan the fires of a minor disagreement. Acting with kindness prevents misunderstandings and negativity from hijacking your day."
cancer,2016-09-13,"You are acutely aware of exactly what you must do to get your needs met now. An impetuous Sun-Mars square gives you the potential to surprise yourself and others by reacting before you consider the consequences. If you've been waiting for a chance to break out of your shell, this is your time to shine. Avoiding confrontation will only make you resentful of others and disappointed in yourself. After all, if you don't take a chance now, you will never know what might happen. Remember, everything is less scary when cast in the light of awareness."
leo,2016-09-13,"Although these are intense times for nearly everyone, your current challenges are centered around sharing your truth and the acknowledgment you want from others. The radiant Sun and communicator Mercury cross swords with macho Mars in your 5th House of Self-Expression. You might be tempted to shove someone out of their comfort zone to get a reaction from them. However, the response you receive may not be the one you expect. Act with caution even if you're mad, or you could upset the apple cart and will have to start over from scratch."
virgo,2016-09-13,"You're passionate about realizing your dreams, but your current progress isn't going as smoothly as you wish. Unfortunately, you could be so annoyed that someone is working at cross-purposes to your goals that you're ready to confront the person directly. Although it's wise to take action, the issue is more complex than it seems. Instead of thinking that employing logic will help today, channel your frustration into creating a new challenge for yourself. Use your intuition to solve problems with original solutions and transform a hopeless situation into a productive one."
libra,2016-09-13,"Although you don't want to hurt or embarrass anyone, it's still wiser to speak up than to clam up today. An irrepressible square between the Sun and insistent Mars drives you to say something you would normally keep to yourself. Unfortunately, you lack the patience now to wrap your message up in a pretty package. You're not interested in covering up the truth, but you can still present it in a form in which it's most likely to be understood. A spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down."
scorpio,2016-09-13,"Feelings run strong as the passion of attraction and the potential for conflict battle with one another. Words spoken with insensitivity quickly turn simple comments into personal attacks. Remember, retrograde Mercury and the Sun are dynamically squaring combative Mars, possibly tricking you into thinking this is a fight to the finish when the only actual casualty might be your ego. Reconsider your options before firing off your rockets; make love, not war."
sagittarius,2016-09-13,"It doesn't take much to get your motor running now, whether you're heading off for a rendezvous with someone new, initiating changes at home or reshuffling your priorities. The emotional temperature is rising, making it more crucial than ever to channel your powerful energy productively -- or at least playfully. Just be cautious when engaging in physical activities because you could push yourself past your limits today. As motivational speaker Jim Rohn said, ""Take care of your body. It's the only place you have to live."""
capricorn,2016-09-13,"Your wishes may be denied today and you're ready to undertake a valiant struggle for your cause. Unfortunately, acts of aggression are totally counterproductive and will only bring unhappiness and stress. Instead of dueling with your opponents now, it's smarter to focus on the long-term victory. Meanwhile, reduce the pressure in the moment by finding ways to express your energy physically so it doesn't bottle up inside. Creating a healthy outlet for your emotions is the best tactic to eliminate the potential for any unnecessary ego skirmishes."
aquarius,2016-09-13,"A clash of strategies between you and your coworkers might end up in a deadlock today. Nevertheless, you could perform miracles if you redirect your energy and focus the intensity of your feelings on manifesting your dreams instead of living up to other people's expectations. In fact, your current nemesis is likely an internal saboteur that you must tame by finding the creative key that unlocks your full potential. But don't wait for divine inspiration or a better time. As Sufi poet Rumi wrote, ""If all you can do is crawl, start crawling."""
pisces,2016-09-13,"You could run into a rough patch today if everyone takes extreme positions in a disagreement. Even if you know what you want, you might be sorry if your ambitions drive you too hard now that the Sun squares aggressive Mars in your 10th House of Social Status. Ultimately, traversing the current unstable emotional terrain requires you to discuss all the various points of view with everyone involved. Defuse the tense situation any way you can and apply your resolve to harmoniously moving forward rather than battling over the past."
aries,2016-09-14,"You act as if you are a free-spirited being today, but once you swing into motion you are confronted with unexpected resistance. At first, you're certain that your allies will applaud whatever you choose to do. Nevertheless, you see signs that your support system isn't as strong as you expected. Although you might be annoyed that your friends aren't standing by you now, consider the possibility that you are simply pushing the limits too far. Sometimes, when others can't keep up with you it's best to slow down."
taurus,2016-09-14,"You may have recently adopted a whole new set of professional goals that set you off in a different direction. Unfortunately, you might not see the difficulties associated with your chosen path until you're already well on your way. Ironically, the better an opportunity looks now, the more problems you could encounter. For the biggest decisions, wait until after the Solar Eclipse on Friday. In the meantime, reevaluate your priorities and modify them as needed, even if it means a departure from your previous agenda."
gemini,2016-09-14,"Try as you might, you can't get rid of a crazy idea about embarking on a journey of a lifetime. It could begin with something you learn about another culture or a philosophy from a different civilization. In any case, a passing curiosity can turn into a full-blown obsession. Don't try to overpower it with logic; instead, surrender to the excitement. Whether or not your adventure ever materializes is not important at this time. Continue your explorations by mentally pursuing every possible avenue until Mercury turns direct later this month."
cancer,2016-09-14,"Big ideas and high hopes capture your imagination at work today. Although emotions may fully envelop you like water, you can approach your feelings from a detached intellectual perspective now. You might seem as if you're not fully engaged in the moment, but a more cerebral mindset gives you the ability to analyze all the nuances of interpersonal dynamics before committing to a specific plan. Don't be in such a hurry to set your agenda in stone. Giving yourself some leeway in how you react improves your chances for success."
leo,2016-09-14,"Don't be concerned if your friends and associates appear to be a bit aloof today. It's a mistake to take their coolness personally, since chances are it's really not about you. Instead of counterbalancing the awkward tension by trying to close the emotional gap, allow it to widen without resistance. There is a normal process occurring that's like the inhalation and exhalation of your breath. The Aquarius Moon encourages independence and allowing it to flourish ensures that interdependence will follow."
virgo,2016-09-14,"You have ingenious new ideas that you want to bring to the workplace today, but you're not sure how others will react to your out-of-the-box concepts. Luckily, you might be quite surprised with the positive reactions you receive. It's as if everyone is rooting for you because they know that your success will ultimately benefit them, too. But don't worry about their motives now; just free up some time and space to begin working on the realization of your dreams while you are lucky enough to have the support of the universe on your side."
libra,2016-09-14,"You're attracted to the concept of going deeper in a current relationship or starting up a new romance. However, stern Saturn can be a bit of a spoiler now, demanding that you manage your life in the three-dimensional world before taking your search for meaning into more irrational realms. It's not wise to ignore Saturn's cool-but-effective approach to life by trying to do an end run around your responsibilities. As Gandhi said, ""Action expresses priorities."""
scorpio,2016-09-14,"You might choose to stay at home today on the assumption that you can still accomplish your fair share of work. Nevertheless, it's quite difficult to get motivated now, especially if you like the quiet comfort of your own familiar surroundings. And although this sweet serenity may sound enticing, you'll likely grow bored once you settle into a contemplative state of mind. Don't get trapped by your expectations of a perfect life. Martin Luther King said, ""We must accept finite disappointment, but never lose infinite hope."""
sagittarius,2016-09-14,"The road ahead appears unobstructed today, but you instinctively already know that this heightened clarity won't last. However, you can learn an important lesson as you realize the milestones you use to measure your progress are created within your mind. Although you're given a reprieve now, budget your time wisely. Instead of scattering your energy, pick a goal and make it happen. Focus on whatever you want to do and don't let the bright lights distract you from your true destiny."
capricorn,2016-09-14,"You might think that distinguishing yourself at work will be easy, but it seems as if others are angling to be major players, too. Luckily, you have an uncanny ability to combine original thinking with a cautious conservative approach. Your current uncharacteristic eclectic style is right on point now, even if you are overly concerned that someone will judge you by your appearance. But don't let your worries about the approval of anyone else stop you. Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf wrote, ""If your dreams do not scare you, they are not big enough."""
aquarius,2016-09-14,"Your easygoing nature is your greatest strength now while the receptive Moon is camped out in your social sign. But you're not interested in wasting time; there are too many responsibilities weighing on your shoulders and you want to get to work before you lose your chance. Don't slow down to make apologies when you could be using your talents to actually finish up an incomplete job. There will be plenty of opportunities for fun in the days to come if you stay on track and fulfill your promises. Work now, play later."
pisces,2016-09-14,You may be caught in a web of complicated emotional dynamics that make your interactions with others a bit awkward today. You might even pull off a disappearing act that would make Houdini look twice while others wonder where you went. But your work is not about satisfying anyone else's curiosity now; your job is to take care of your own well-being by setting limits on your accessibility. A lack of boundaries invites a lack of respect.
aries,2016-09-15,"Relationships at work may feel quite unstable today, making it tough to know where to place your allegiance. The Sun in your 6th House of Employment forms an uneasy aspect to disruptive Uranus, triggering a reshuffling of political alliances. Nevertheless, remaining reasonable when you deal with someone's inconsistent behavior can make the difference between war and peace now. Concentrating your efforts on your own long-term goals helps to reduce the pressure as long as you're not simply trying to escape from your current reality."
taurus,2016-09-15,"You may feel as if a relationship has reached a turning point and you must take action to reestablish a healthy balance between intimacy and independence. Although you might be ready for nearly anything, the Sun's misalignment with surprising Uranus can still catch you off guard when you realize there isn't a quick fix for this current stress. If you are eager to head off on your own, remember you'll be even more successful if you're functioning as part of a group. Teamwork makes the dream work."
gemini,2016-09-15,"Relationship dynamics that seem to be out of your control push you one way and then suddenly pull you another. You may be surprised by events at home, especially if you get swept up in someone else's drama. You're particularly sensitive to the feelings of those close to you today, motivating you to do whatever you can to help calm the storm. Ultimately, your smartest strategy is to seek a sweet spot between holding onto the way things are now and being open to positive change. Time heals what reason cannot."
cancer,2016-09-15,"Making a tough decision today is all the more challenging because the facts keep changing. Obviously, you still don't have all the information you need now that Mercury is retrograding through your 3rd House of Learning. Give yourself enough time to assimilate the incoming data and work out the contradictions internally, instead of striking out or reacting too hastily. Sometimes you learn the most by just sitting back and observing the behavior of others. Lao Tzu wrote, ""Silence is a source of great strength."""
leo,2016-09-15,"Problems with a business partner may become disruptive today, sending you back to the drawing board to sort out your finances. You really want to establish stability in your cash flow, but it's nearly impossible while the Sun in your 2nd House of Money forms an anxious aspect with chaotic Uranus. Remember, an extreme position won't likely lead to a resolution now, so use your diplomatic skills to find a middle ground. Greek philosopher Epicurus wrote, ""Be moderate in order to taste the joys of life in abundance."""
virgo,2016-09-15,"Relationship issues are front and center in your life now.

aquarius,2016-09-17,"Your genius for coming up with original solutions and unconventional methods when faced with a problem is evident today. Luckily, an activating trine between pioneering Mars and brilliant Uranus plants the seeds for breakthroughs to complications that have stumped you in the past.

Although you may be dealing with an emotionally intense person, gentle Venus in your accommodating sign blesses you with a calming touch now. Thankfully, you're able to actively pursue what you want without appearing overly eager or desperate. Putting your heart on the line is the only way to find out what is real."
scorpio,2016-09-18,"You may have to decide between the goodies offered by a particular relationship today and the privilege of self-determination.

pisces,2016-09-20,"You're likely to push forward in your pursuit of knowledge and make your points with an unwavering determination today. You are impatient with someone else's inability to keep up with your logic. You can cut to the core of a complex issue, analyze it effectively and quickly move toward a solution as clever Mercury forms a productive Grand Earth Trine with the stubborn Taurus Moon and perceptive Pluto. Author Napoleon Hill wrote, ""Ultimately action is the real measure of intelligence."""
aries,2016-09-21,"Sometimes you leave too many things for the last minute yet there are only so many hours in the day to be productive. Nevertheless, you might actually believe you can breeze through your chores in the flash of a moment. Unfortunately, if you buy into this premise today, you will end up annoyed with your bad judgment call while others will be disappointed with your performance. Instead of playing a losing game of ""Beat the Clock,"" create a more realistic delivery schedule and inform everyone of your plans before you bump up against the deadlines. Be proactive, not reactive."
taurus,2016-09-21,"The baton is being passed to you and you're eager to run your leg of the race. If you are involved in a group project at work, it might be your turn to step up and do your part. Thankfully, you could surprise everyone with your mental and physical agility today. But don't commit to any more than you can accomplish. In fact, it's healthier to underestimate your ability and dash your associate's hopes early on than waiting until later. Your motto for the day is promise less, deliver more."
gemini,2016-09-21,"Your moods may swing one way and then the other while the dualistic Gemini Moon is bouncing around in your versatile sign. However, you can't shake the notion that nothing matters and any action you take today will be for naught. But nothing could be further from the truth as your key planet Mercury appears to stop his backtracking, readying to turn direct tomorrow. This is a pivotal point and although you might not see immediate results from your work, everything you do now opens a portal into your future. Small acts are catalysts for big change."
cancer,2016-09-21,"You're happy to work quietly behind the scenes today, knowing that your efforts will have the intended impact. At times you need immediate acknowledgment from your peers or you grow insecure about your role. However, you're confident that others appreciate your contribution now, even if you aren't in the spotlight. Just continue on your present course without trying to impress anyone because your actions speak louder than words. President Harry S. Truman said, ""It is amazing what you can accomplish if you do not care who gets the credit."""
leo,2016-09-21,"You might not be finished with a project, but that fact won't stop you from gazing far off into the future. All the signs today tell you to focus on the details so you can finally be done with your previous commitments. Nevertheless, the Moon's shift into your 11th House of Long-Term Goals keeps calling your imagination away from the present moment as you visualize all the possibilities ahead. However, you are in control of your destiny whether or not you realize it. Each time you drift in an unproductive direction, redirect your thoughts back to the here and now. Clear your plate to make room for more."
virgo,2016-09-21,"You are weary of running around in circles, wondering if you're making any progress at all. It's as if you are Ulysses, fighting the many-headed Hydra; each problem you solve is replaced by two more. Nevertheless, mischievous Mercury in your detail-oriented sign ends its retrograde dance tomorrow, freeing you from the endless red tape entangling your world. But celebrations will need to wait; there's still another fire or two that must be contained before you are allowed to move on. Be a warrior, not a worrier."
libra,2016-09-21,"Others see you as a wide-open book, but you are probably harboring secret tales that cannot yet be shared. Although you're quite adept at being discreet when necessary, you're tired of monitoring every little word while the Sun and retrograde Mercury wreak havoc in your 12th House of Invisibility. Thankfully, the Sun struts into your sign tomorrow and Mercury turns direct, giving you clearance to share the untold story. In the meantime, put all your ducks in a row so you're ready to take center stage when the curtain finally opens."
scorpio,2016-09-21,"One of your strengths is your ability to talk about issues that others avoid. The chatty Gemini Moon's current stay in your 8th House of Deep Sharing allows you to approach a sensitive topic in a light and easy manner so others are not frightened off. Although it's tempting to stall a few more days before you initiate a much-needed discussion to clear the air, your window of opportunity could close faster than you expect. Take advantage of this planetary energy before the Sun slips into your 12th House of Privacy tomorrow. Don't wait for the perfect moment; instead, take the moment and make it perfect."
sagittarius,2016-09-21,"Everyone seems to be acting unpredictably today and it's hard to tell if they are flakey or if it's you that is fickle. Nevertheless, the changeable Gemini Moon is floating through your 7th House of Others, creating the illusion that you can't rely on anyone. You don't know what to think if someone is overly serious one minute and then lost in a whimsical fantasy the next. In fact, the noise of the outer world complicates any decision you must make now. However, you'll know when something is real when the confusion vanishes and the truth suddenly seems so obvious it smacks you in the face."
capricorn,2016-09-21,"You possess a surplus of secret weapons in your arsenal and you're willing to use them when needed. Although quick fixes might seem impossible, you can pull a rabbit out of a hat today. However, there's no magic involved -- just your impressive ability to accomplish a job in a timely manner. But don't push your luck by setting unrealistic goals now; you can make miracles happen only if you focus on solutions and not the problems."
aquarius,2016-09-21,"Trying to meet all your commitments is an uphill battle today, especially if you're captivated by one intriguing idea after another. Although your mind is in exploration mode, you're still expected to apply yourself to the tasks on your list. You can fulfill your obligations, but it will take an exerted effort to follow the path leading to completion. In the words of Alexander Graham Bell, ""Concentrate all your thoughts upon the work at hand. The Sun's rays do not burn until brought into focus."""
pisces,2016-09-21,"Replaying precious moments from your past takes you on a sentimental journey today, but the urgency of unfinished business could be a rude awakening. The Moon's current visit to your 4th House of Roots brings solace from a trip down Memory Lane while distracting you from the inescapable pressures of your career. Balancing the inner and outer worlds is tricky, especially if you try to do it alone. Sharing your dilemma with someone you trust may lead to a surprising breakthrough. The emotional support of a friend might be all you need to get back on track."
aries,2016-09-22,"Although you might feel as if you're at the end of your rope, there is actually plenty of time to manifest the grand changes you seek. But don't look the other way if you're offered a glimpse of what's wrong with your current plans. The Sun's entry into your 7th House of Partnerships draws creative, confident and charming partners your way. Unfortunately, you may not enjoy the depth of emotions you're currently experiencing, but relationship magic can only happen if you're willing to go the distance."
taurus,2016-09-22,"Unfinished conversations about your work and your creative ideas are back on the table as you pick up where you left off several weeks ago. But just because you're anxious to move forward  today, settling for less than what you want will likely increase your resentment over time. Face the fear of rejection now and speak up for yourself. The Sun moves into harmonizing Libra and your 6th House of Employment, reminding you to balance work with play. Progress, rather than protection, should be your measure of success; even baby steps will advance your interests in a positive direction."
gemini,2016-09-22,"Weeks of intense reevaluation and reflection come to a close today as Mercury turns direct in your 4th House of Security. Tie up as many loose ends as possible, for the Winged Messenger pushes forward over the days ahead, requiring you to bond without the luxury of revisiting familiar places. Fortunately, you're ready for change now; your heart starts to sing, heralding a new season for personal pleasure and creative expression. Aiming for the sky is exhilarating when you're fueled for the journey and blessed with the necessary support system to ensure a successful experience."
cancer,2016-09-22,"A near-perfect opportunity for relationship review and analysis recently allowed you to be more discerning when clever Mercury backpedaled in organized Virgo. Mercury's direct turn encourages you to take immediate initiative, but don't jump the gun just yet. Accepting the power of your deepest desires prompts you to act on them with discretion. You are being granted a chance to benefit from your actions without exposing your vulnerabilities. Nevertheless, altering your attitude enables you to see things in an entirely different light."
leo,2016-09-22,"Ideas that you've been cultivating over the past month are now ripe for sharing, in the hopes of inspiring others to want to change restrictive work conditions. Thankfully, the Sun's move into socially astute Libra and your 3rd House of Communication enables you to present your suggestions in a charmingly persuasive manner. Messenger Mercury's direct turn prompts you to discuss whatever is on your mind, but its current square to the emotional Moon pulls in feelings of insecurity. Joseph Campbell wrote, ""Opportunities to find deeper powers within ourselves come when life seems most challenging."""
virgo,2016-09-22,"You're likely to communicate with an uncharacteristic intensity that empowers everything you say today as analytical Mercury turns direct in your sign, motivating you to reveal your thoughts. Meanwhile, the Sun moves into diplomatic Libra and your 2nd House of Values, encouraging you to be fair and objective when you judge yourself or others. Be gentle in your approach, rather than pushing too hard or too fast to achieve your desired goal. A simple act of kindness can create ripples of positivity."
libra,2016-09-22,"Although you're naturally more comfortable when operating in the rational realms, it may be time to leave logic behind and learn to trust your feelings today. You find intellectual solutions more workable in theory than in actual practice when Mercury turns direct in your 12th House of Spirituality, requiring you to take a leap of faith. Meanwhile, the Sun's entry into your friendly sign raises your profile and boosts your self-confidence. Focus on your needs and act as the initiator in relationships for the best results."
scorpio,2016-09-22,"Your plans are right on target today as Mercury turns direct in your 11th House of Groups. However, the Trickster's trine to incisive Pluto could still be slightly overwhelming because you must exhibit punch, passion and persistence to overcome internal or external resistance. Find a healthy activity you can sink your teeth into now; otherwise, you might waste this powerful force in fruitless battles. Don't let anyone stop you from pursuing a metaphysical path if you so choose. Balancing the mundane circumstances of life with your ongoing search for spiritual purpose is key to your self-actualization."
sagittarius,2016-09-22,"Luckily, you're able to express yourself assertively today without being overly aggressive. Mercury's direct turn helps you to consider how to put your best ideas into motion to accomplish your ambitious goals. Nevertheless, it's a delicate dance between going for what you want and coming on too strong. Navigating your way through this minefield of emotions requires ongoing vigilance; applying the right amount of passion to your message could be a challenge now. Speak softly and carry a big stick."
capricorn,2016-09-22,"The cork that holds your emotions in place may pop today, especially if you continue to bottle up your feelings of frustration about the direction of your life. Cerebral Mercury turns direct in your 9th House of Higher Truth, allowing you to move past petty distractions and fix your mind on your highest aspirations. A potential shakeup of long-term plans can cast your job in a different light. You won't reach your goals overnight; however, you're making more progress than you realize. Slow down long enough to appreciate your accomplishments. Gratitude unlocks the abundance of the universe."
aquarius,2016-09-22,"Although you may be caught in a gigantic undercurrent right now, there still seems to be forward movement in your life. Big changes are already underway, even if you can't see the whole picture yet as rational Mercury goes direct in your 8th House of Transformation. Meanwhile, you possess a new passion for adventure now that the Sun is shining in your 9th House of Travel and Education. Expanding your mind expands your horizons."
pisces,2016-09-22,"It is critical now that everyone knows the rules of the game because misunderstandings can lead to regrettable actions or misplaced anger. Curious Mercury's direct turn in your 7th House of Relationships initiates conversations that help you find the answers you need. Your clarity when stating what you want from someone doesn't guarantee that you'll get it, but it certainly improves your chances. Honestly discussing your expectations, concerns and objectives with an open mind and heart makes working and living with others more enjoyable for everyone."
aries,2016-09-23,"Separating what you want from what you need can be quite useful today because there's more occurring than meets the eye. Nevertheless, you're eager to learn whatever it is that you previously failed to understand about power politics at work. In fact, you are more than ready to explore the shadows of your own motivations now, which can ultimately enhance your professional relationships as well as your capacity for intimacy. Within the mystery there is a hidden treasure; it's your job to find it."
taurus,2016-09-23,"It seems as if everyone wants your time, money, love or whatever else they can get from you today. However, trying to satisfy anyone else's needs at your own expense will not build trust in the long run. Negotiate what you're willing to give and what you expect in return. Relationships are built on honest dialogue and compromise, even if you're not sure it's okay to express your desires in the open. The returns can be richer than you imagine if you're willing to meet others halfway."
gemini,2016-09-23,"Impressing people is easy today because your curious nature is matched by a genuine interest in the happiness of others. However, a well-kept secret could find its way to the surface, which can be both painful and liberating at the same time. Remember, the mutual trust you share with someone depends upon how carefully and discreetly you use this powerful information. Nevertheless, respect for privacy is more important than ever now, and any truth you uncover should be handled with great care."
cancer,2016-09-23,"Restraining your desires is unnecessary today because your kind heart will ultimately steer you in the right direction. However, you may be so sensitive to people's emotions that you remain silent about what you really want. Overcoming your fear of revealing too much allows you to be more open about your needs. Even if you're shy about sharing your feelings now, there's no valid reason to let your insecurities stand between you and your goal. If you don't ask, others won't know what to give."
leo,2016-09-23,"You are stepping into unexplored territory, and the journeys that call you in the external world might be overshadowed by the inner voyage you are embarking upon now. Powerful planetary tides fire up your passions, challenging you with intense feelings that cannot be put into actions or words. Courage may be your greatest strength, but you also benefit from a strong dose of humility today. Even the King of the Jungle must step down off his throne every once in a while."
virgo,2016-09-23,"You are locked into a pattern of introspection that deepens your thoughts and raises your emotional intensity. Delving into fascinating metaphysical studies might be a departure from your regular interests as you're driven to explore the hidden parts of your psyche now. However, you may be more suspicious of others today because your probing mind knows you don't have all the information you need. Playing detective and studying the mysteries of life can uncover interesting facts. But in the end, you must feel the truth to know it."
libra,2016-09-23,"After an extended period of feeling like you were lacking in money or love, it seems as if the rewards you've long coveted are finally within reach. Your charm is working on overdrive now that jovial Jupiter is back in your sign, and others are responding to you with warmth and affection. However, laziness or a sense of complacency can hijack your day. Don't be a couch potato; if you wait for the good times to find you, you might be napping when they arrive. Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity."
scorpio,2016-09-23,"You sense a gathering of cosmic forces, strangely bringing you a feeling of invincibility. Without much effort you can magically turn a perfectly normal scene into one filled with mythic intensity. However, your desire to merge with someone you love or to deepen your connection with a friend is complicated if you want to do it only on your own terms. Although you crave intimacy, you're quite capable of entertaining yourself now if the available company is not up to your standards. Aristotle wrote, ""Happiness belongs to the self-sufficient."""
sagittarius,2016-09-23,"Although boundaries are less distinct and your vision extends far into the distance, you're not likely to stand up on a soapbox and make a speech today. Your ideas may be fantastic, but you're willing to work behind the scenes now and leave the grand gestures to someone else. You currently have access to a bottomless well of information, as though you are being initiated into some kind of secret order. But putting what you're receiving into words can be extremely difficult -- a good thing since most people would not understand anyhow. Sometimes silence is more accurate than the truth."
capricorn,2016-09-23,"Long-term strategizing is one of your greatest skills, enabling you to plan for the future by setting priorities and sticking to them. Ironically, you're less interested in events of the real world now as your desire to reach toward something more meaningful pulls your attention inward. Thankfully, your unwavering persistence will pay off, even if you're not getting the desired results yet. Although practicing patience is still required if you want to capitalize on a current opportunity, new horizons are closer than you think."
aquarius,2016-09-23,"Fortunately, your efforts toward achieving success are close to culmination and the future is calling you with important clues about your new direction. Although the recognition you deserve is waiting, you must pay attention to the signs in order to reach your destination. You might think you can rest upon your laurels now, but one more push may be necessary. Don't be afraid to strut your stuff at work so others see you at your best. It's time to collect your rewards and then move on toward your next adventure. Dream big and live large."
pisces,2016-09-23,"Relationships are buzzing with major intensity today as your passion rises in temperature. Communicating with powerful emotional depth convinces others to see things your way. If you are already involved with someone, invest your energy in reigniting your romance. If you're single and looking, polish your image and get ready to play the dating game. Aim for fun rather than a long-term commitment -- and you could wind up with both."
aries,2016-09-24,"You may encounter some hurdles and some helpers along your way today as you're pushed to a breaking point. You feel so much pressure to make your next move that you're ready to split, abandoning your responsibilities entirely. However, obstacles are meant to provoke a reassessment of your professional goals and family obligations. With a little luck and a lot of patience, you can tap into unused resources and unmet desires to create a new set of priorities. Sometimes it takes a breakdown to have a breakthrough."
taurus,2016-09-24,"You can't help but wonder if it's worth the effort as you try to patch up a disagreement today. It might feel as if the energy is unfairly stacked against you and there is no way to escape the heat. Nevertheless, an unexpected development in communication later this evening can catalyze exciting changes if you are willing to take a risk and express your deepest feelings. Telling the whole truth may not win you a lot of friends, but it will always get you the right ones."
gemini,2016-09-24,"You're eager for changes in your financial situation, but you might be hitting a logistical wall now. You may need to reorganize debt, reduce expenses or renegotiate an agreement before you get to cash in on the potential rewards ahead. You realize that improvement won't come overnight, but demanding Pluto is pressuring the Moon in your 2nd House of Self-Worth and it feels as if you must take drastic measures right away. Benjamin Disraeli wrote, ""Diligence is the mother of good fortune."""
cancer,2016-09-24,"Although your self-esteem can suffer if you don't get what you want, your tenacity motivates you to fight for what you think is yours. It has been said that the most distinguishing feature of the Crab is its pincers that don't easily let go. However, sometimes releasing the past is necessary, though it's particularly challenging with the Moon back in your sign. Win or lose, your eyes are opened today in a way that radically shifts your frame of reference and propels you into the future."
leo,2016-09-24,"Tensions at home may bog you down in a power struggle today. Unfortunately, trust is elusive as the sensitive Cancer Moon opposes possessive Pluto. Nevertheless, you can avoid a major conflict if you're willing to face the root cause of your discontent instead of simply blaming others. Most significantly, resolving an issue now might just permanently eliminate an irritating obstacle. You are not what has happened to you in the past; you are what you choose to become in the present."
virgo,2016-09-24,"You might have felt deprived of emotional satisfaction last week when trying to build bridges just created frustration. The gulf between you and others seems to widen today, but the gift of resolution is lurking in the shadows. Unfortunately, the odds are not yet on your side. However, progress becomes more likely throughout the day if you're brave enough to aim directly into the center of the fog that separates you from the truth. The way out is the way through."
libra,2016-09-24,"You are in for an intense surprise when a routine conversation leads to an irksome disagreement at home or at work. It's no fun if you feel less appreciated than you deserve. Nevertheless, it's healthier to address issues directly with the patience and maturity that's necessary to correct any current misunderstandings or previous mistakes. Although you can't go back and change your past, you can commit to do your best in the present moment. Mark Twain said, ""Continuous improvement is better than delayed perfection."""
scorpio,2016-09-24,"Things get off to a slow start today, but you can build momentum if you stick with your original agenda. You might feel personally rejected if you think your opinions are not being heard. Resentful Pluto's opposition to the Moon raises additional friction, potentially sending you into a tailspin if you begin to doubt yourself. Your uncertainty may make you nervous, especially if you play your cards prematurely. Fortunately, these stressful days can empower you to turn lead into gold if you doggedly persist with the difficult process of self-examination."
sagittarius,2016-09-24,"Your patience with an authority figure is extremely limited today, prompting you to stand up for your rights or those of someone else. Expressing your beliefs might feel dangerous, yet the price of silence may be even greater than you realize. Although people appreciate your kindness, don't let their needs influence what you tell yourself. One hundred percent honesty requires acknowledging what others try to avoid."
capricorn,2016-09-24,"You're unusually sensitive to rejection now, but can gain a new perspective on love by softening your resistance. Still, relationships are strangely foreboding as Pluto opposes the Moon in your 7th House of Partnerships. Unexpected upsets or sudden twist of fate may derail your plans later this evening when the Moon squares unpredictable Uranus. Your best strategy is to cultivate flexibility and shake off the need to be in control. Sometimes what you're looking for comes when you're not looking at all."
aquarius,2016-09-24,"Your cautious optimism draws you out into the real world. But you don't particularly enjoy the pressure brought upon you by powerful Pluto today. Surprisingly, the stress may be relieved as you leap over the stubborn obstacles by adopting a radically new perspective. Your optimistic slant enables you to be a beacon of confidence for others, even when the going gets tough. Walt Whitman wrote, ""Keep your face always toward the sunshine and shadows will fall behind you."""
pisces,2016-09-24,"People seem to oppose your ideas for no apparent reason today and cooperation grows more and more elusive. But don't fold under someone's insistence, because it's better to reconnect with your inner strength and push harder now for what you believe is right. Hold your ground; if you can overcome your hurt feelings and lower your expectations, the outcome will still be an amazing one. When the world says, ""Give up,"" hope whispers, ""Try it one more time."""
aries,2016-09-25,"Your high hopes may be justified today as others arrive with good news or much-needed assistance. However, it's tempting to confuse the messenger with the message, creating an instant attraction that might be so exciting you toss caution to the wind. Fortunately, the buoyancy you're feeling can lead to an exciting opportunity if you believe in your dream. Don't be afraid to go public with a visionary idea or pursue a personal relationship. Just remember that making a promise is easy, yet turning it into reality still requires a concrete plan and consistent follow-through."
taurus,2016-09-25,"You're ready to take on the world today and are eager to start by making big changes to your lifestyle. The confident Sun-Jupiter conjunction lands in your 6th House of Daily Routine, encouraging you to believe you will improve your well-being by simply shaking up your health regimen. However, you may be overestimating how much you can transform all at once. Although you can't control everything in your environment, you're capable of managing the details of your life. Attending to the little things now makes the larger things easier to handle."
gemini,2016-09-25,Romance is in the air today and your exuberance opens the doors to new possibilities with nearly everyone you meet. Your effervescence spills out into the world as the Sun joins limitless Jupiter in your 5th House of Love and Creativity. You can make a strong case for anything if you don't overwhelm others with too much information. It's easier to get what you want when you don't clutter the conversation with extraneous details. You can't miss as long as you consider your audience.
cancer,2016-09-25,"Your ambitions may be larger than life now, so you must be careful not to let your optimism get out of hand.

You can't help but smile now because on a deep level you know that anything can be accomplished if you believe in yourself. Author Paulo Coelho writes, ""It's the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting."""
leo,2016-09-25,"Your heart is swelling with emotions and your brain is bursting with big ideas today. However, it may be tricky to turn your current positivity into something of lasting value. A busy day that's buzzing with social interactions can be a lot of fun now. In fact, your enthusiasm is contagious as the Sun joins jovial Jupiter in your 3rd House of Information. But don't put so much attention on external events that you lose touch with your own magic. As Maya Angelou wrote, ""Nothing can dim the light which shines from within."""
virgo,2016-09-25,"You might believe that you're unstoppable today, even if you don't have all your facts straight. Fortunately, the buoyant Sun-Jupiter conjunction in your 2nd House of Self-Worth empowers you with enough swagger that others may not even realize something isn't quite right. Oddly enough, trusting your instincts now won't betray your lack of solid information. For once, don't sweat the small stuff; the sky is the limit."
libra,2016-09-25,"Your optimism soars today, expanding your vision and opening your heart to the potential beyond the limits that normally shape your life. The Sun's annual conjunction to auspicious Jupiter occurs in your sign, marking the beginning of a new opportunity cycle. Rather than thinking about situations that may be impeding your progress, focus on the distant horizon and project the best possible scenario you can imagine into your future. Your positive attitude protects you against self-doubt and allows you to ride a rising tide to greater joy and recognition."
scorpio,2016-09-25,"One phase of your spiritual growth is coming to a close, preparing you for the next round of metaphysical explorations. A propitious Sun-Jupiter party in your 12th House of Destiny transforms a casual meeting into a life-changing event. Respond to the energetic shifts with confidence, but remember that you're not invincible. This is no time to get lazy, even if everything seems to be under control. Don't miss this rare opportunity to set the stage for what's ahead. Good things come to those who earn it."
sagittarius,2016-09-25,"Your star is on the rise now as a result of gaining critical support from old colleagues and making vital new connections. Finding more joyful ways of expressing yourself comes naturally while the Sun joins good-natured Jupiter in your 11th House of Social Networking. You are an inspiration to others and your contribution to your community can garner respect and cast you in a leadership position. This is truly a time that you help yourself by helping others. Fortunately, the more you give, the more you receive in return."
capricorn,2016-09-25,"You may see amazing opportunities everywhere you look today. But the best news is you can actually turn your thoughts into reality as the Sun bumps into lucky Jupiter in your 10th House of Status. You are extremely persuasive now when you combine your charm and pragmatism to get what you want. Unfortunately, it's all too easy to be distracted by so many choices. Minimize the stress associated with big changes by focusing on one single goal and keeping your eyes on the prize. Simplification is never as simple as it sounds."
aquarius,2016-09-25,"Your vision of the future extends well beyond the limits of the horizon now. A joyful conjunction of the radiant Sun and boundless Jupiter takes your imagination somewhere over the rainbow. However, this effervescent planetary party in your 9th House of Faraway Places may lack practicality unless you consciously keep reminding yourself of the difference between reality and fantasy. French poet Paul Valery wrote, ""The best way to make your dreams come true is to wake up."""
pisces,2016-09-25,"It appears as if the universe is offering you the support you need to pursue a persistent dream. A benevolent Sun-Jupiter conjunction occurs in your 8th House of Shared Resources, granting you the money and expertise required for a pet project or to achieve a long-term goal. What others do to come to your aid will not attract overdue attention now, but serves you in a way that will impact your life for months to come. Author Jim Rohn wrote, ""Happiness is not something you postpone for the future; it is something you design for the present."""
aries,2016-09-26,"You're not ready to head back to work or school today, even if you must be responsible and show up. In fact, your focus will likely be on more frivolous activities as the jovial Sun-Jupiter conjunction stresses the playful Leo Moon in your 5th House of Fun and Games. Luckily, you can probably get away with an occasional flight of fancy now, as long as you keep up appearances. But don't push the boundaries too far or you will attract unwanted attention. Sometimes it's wise to fly under the radar when you want to stretch your wings."
taurus,2016-09-26,"It takes serious self-discipline to develop new skills today, especially if it feels like a requirement rather than your own choice. Sometimes, consciously choosing growth as an option is your smartest path to success. Nevertheless, you might prefer the course of least resistance, putting changes off for another time. Ironically, being in over your head brings good fortune now by forcing you to step up to the plate. Once you gain enough momentum to move beyond the status quo, you'll be glad you made the effort."
gemini,2016-09-26,"There's plenty of pressure to perform today and you might feel as if you're faking it even if you put on a good show. Thankfully, even the trickiest problems can be untangled because you are blessed with luck now when you act like a leader. Adopting a positive attitude is crucial as you eliminate outmoded aspects of your life in preparation for what's ahead. Concentrate on the potential of the future instead of mourning a loss of the past."
cancer,2016-09-26,"You may be ready to take a risk today, but a good idea doesn't necessarily mean it's a practical one. Make sure your feet are solidly on the ground before you reach for the stars. Although you might be required to jump through some complicated emotional hoops now, your heroic efforts will be rewarded with the security you ultimately seek. Satisfaction is extra sweet when you accomplish what others say you cannot."
leo,2016-09-26,"You are prone to exaggeration today, which fans the fires of disagreement even if there is no substantial reason for conflict. The childlike Leo Moon creates anxious aspects with the bombastic Sun-Jupiter conjunction, prompting you to express your opinions as if they were facts. Unrelenting attitudes can be great for moving mountains, but delicate egos are easily bruised by the barrage of words. Look within to understand, rather than trying to prove your beliefs to anyone else. Respect is a two-way street."
virgo,2016-09-26,"You continue to surf a wave of self-confidence, although you still choose to keep your feelings to yourself today. It seems as if there are no limits to what you can accomplish, leading you to bite off more than you can chew. Ultimately, you might be overwhelmed by all that you promised, making it difficult to know where to start. You have no shortage of good ideas but could fall short of your lofty expectations. Don't let frustration get the best of you; using your clever time management skills helps you cross as many things off your list as possible."
libra,2016-09-26,"You might see yourself as the leader of the pack today, but group dynamics are unpredictable when the Moon in your 11th House of Crowds forms an anxious aspect with the propitious Sun-Jupiter conjunction. You have a renewed sense of purpose, but that alone isn't enough to inspire others to follow your call. Thankfully, you may finally receive some well-deserved recognition now, motivating you to play a more expansive role in changing the world around you. The secret of getting ahead is getting started."
scorpio,2016-09-26,"Your dreams seem so close today that you can almost reach out and touch them. The proud Leo Moon is at odds with the bountiful Sun-Jupiter conjunction that activates your 12th House of Fantasy, offering you a direct connection with the supernatural realms. Instead of chasing material goals by acquiring possessions, you will find greater rewards in spiritual pursuits. Fortunately, you can attain almost anything if you're willing to make the effort. Albert Einstein wrote, ""The true sign of intelligence is not knowledge but imagination."""
sagittarius,2016-09-26,"You don't need to have a plan in mind today in order to reach your goals. People appear to understand your ideas without much effort on your part. Luckily, they continue to show up with exactly what you require to achieve satisfaction. However, it's tough to maintain a healthy perspective if you get carried away by your own big ideas. Even if everything seems great, blind faith can also land you in hot water with your support network. You may be on a roll now but you still must practice humility in order to succeed."
capricorn,2016-09-26,"Be careful of any lingering insecurities that lead you to promise more than you can deliver. It's wiser to express yourself frankly when it comes to complex relationship dynamics now that the stressed Leo Moon is hiding out in your 8th House of Intimacy. Remember, others are responsible for their reactions to your disclosure, so be kind but honest. The more you expect harmony at this time, the harder it is to accept dissension from those who know you best. Nevertheless, respect your right to your own emotions, whatever they are, rather than trying to justify your intentions to anyone else."
aquarius,2016-09-26,"You may feel like a caged bird today if your routine seems too boring. However, this is no time to fly off into the sunset without a well-defined map. Your desire to expand beyond the bounds of your current relationships could just be a yearning for greater meaning, so you don't be quick to step out and turn your world upside down. Instead, commit to broadening your perspective with a new course of learning that opens career paths or travel that stretches your mind. Exploring your options is a delightful adventure in itself."
pisces,2016-09-26,"Demonstrating your concern for someone at work could earn you a new level of admiration. However, whatever you offer today may still be construed as not enough. Thankfully, you can be the most generous person in the world as long as you receive pleasure from giving; unfortunately, your magnanimous behavior will be for naught unless it comes directly from your heart. Expressing your feelings with no expectations really means you expect nothing in return except for your message to be heard."
aries,2016-09-27,"You are finally ready to dig in your heels and take on whatever additional hard work is necessary to complete the tasks you previously started. Your desire for immediate gratification begins to lessen now that physical Mars enters cautious Capricorn. Conserve your energy by maintaining a healthy perspective on any tensions that surface at this time. As much as you desire excitement in your life, the work you do must also set the stage for the future. Give your dreams the opportunity to manifest."
taurus,2016-09-27,"Travel becomes more likely, especially for business or educational purposes, while energetic Mars moves through your 9th House of Distant Horizons. Caution is replaced by confidence now, empowering you to organize and manage big projects. Fortunately, you can assimilate new information and gain the clarity you need to make healthy decisions for the future. Nevertheless, you still could jeopardize your imminent success if you are too easygoing about the current course of events. Abe Lincoln said, ""Commitment is what transforms a promise into a reality."""
gemini,2016-09-27,"There isn't much that can restrain you these days from reaching for the stars. Your heart and mind are no longer in the present moment. Instead, you are fascinated by the prospects of achieving your goals, dreaming about making a statement with your accomplishments. You have plenty to say today and your tongue wags faster than your tail. Fortunately, you possess the common sense to finish up old business before allocating your time to anything new. Bark less, work more."
cancer,2016-09-27,"Although your family and friends can make your situation more complex, they must be taken into consideration now as you develop your plans. Mars enters ambitious Capricorn in your 7th House of Relationships, granting you the fortitude to keep moving forward even when you face adversity. You are unwilling to give up even if change appears to be in the air. Although you may feel dependent upon someone else's expectations and judgments, what you need is more important than how anyone else reacts."
leo,2016-09-27,"You Lions are known for your extreme loyalty and your reliable word, but you may need to make some adjustments now to a recent promise. You are very realistic in your assessment of an overdue and unfinished project. Fortunately, assertive Mars enters your 6th House of Work, empowering you to knuckle down and settle into a groove. Nevertheless, feeling constrained by a rigid timetable isn't any fun, but the structure motivates you to become more efficient and productive than anyone expects. Self-discipline is your friend."
virgo,2016-09-27,"Your confidence begins to return today as you realize how easy it will be to combine work and play in the weeks ahead. Red-hot Mars moves into well-organized Capricorn and your creative 5th House of Spontaneity, helping you regain a sense of control over your life. You possess an uncanny understanding of when to push with passion and when to let go. Eliminating the clutter that fills your day frees you from the distractions that take more from you than they give. Energy flows where attention goes."
libra,2016-09-27,"Balancing your personal and professional spheres is likely to grow into a major issue now as  fulfilling your dreams of a successful career can have a negative impact on your home life. Nevertheless, domestic issues demand your attention once Mars moves into responsible Capricorn and your 4th House of Family. Make sure to take time for rest and meditation; it's wise now to step back from the hectic pace of life to avoid exhaustion. As the Dalai Lama says, ""If your mind is scattered, it is quite powerless."""
scorpio,2016-09-27,"Something is different in your immediate environment today, requiring you to take a more calculated approach to accomplishing your goals. It seems as if you can finally get down to business now that Mars in disciplined Capricorn is controlling your 3rd House of Distractions. However, you can become so compulsive about your ambitions that you forget others may not feel as intensely. If necessary, go off by yourself until your emotions mellow; surrounding yourself in silence might be all you need to regain a healthier perspective. Picasso wrote, ""Without great solitude, no serious work is possible."""
sagittarius,2016-09-27,"A shift in the cosmic winds lands you back on the ground today, encouraging you to trade in your adventurous spirit for a more industrious attitude. Active Mars enters result-oriented Capricorn and your 2nd House of Money, triggering ambitious yet practical ideas about substantially increasing your income. However, there is no room for pie-in-the-sky fantasies because concepts will be harshly measured against reality very quickly now. Paradoxically, Dr. Kalam, Past President of India, said, ""You must dream before your dreams can come true."""
capricorn,2016-09-27,"Your ability to prioritize the tasks at hand is excellent now, as is your intuition to accurately assess risk. What seems like a gamble to someone else can be almost a sure thing in your steady hands once action-hero Mars kicks into your calculating sign today. Thankfully, you possess the self-confidence to jump into the unknown and still land on your feet. Pursue your ambitions and express your honest opinions, as long as you're willing to follow up with discipline and dedication. As Thomas Jefferson said, ""The harder you work, the luckier you get."""
aquarius,2016-09-27,"Although you might choose to rely on your imagination when developing a plan of attack for a major project, you are standing on a solid foundation built on your previous achievements. Assertive Mars enters ambitious Capricorn and your 12th House of Endings, providing you with the chance to stop and pause to look back one more time. However, don't linger in the past too long before taking an exciting quantum leap into your future where your dreams are the seeds of reality."
pisces,2016-09-27,"Of course, it's prudent to maintain control whenever possible today, but it's also smart to accept the fact that practical thinking often grows out of chaos. Passionate Mars marches into your 11th House of Friends and Associates, pressuring you to be part of the team while restricting your free time with too many demands. Proving that you can take care of business earns you recognition and raises your social status. But don't lose sight of your emotional needs, regardless of how much others ask of you. Self-preservation isn't selfish; it's a necessity."
aries,2016-09-28,"Your frustration is quick to show if people are either unclear or unreliable today, prompting you to possibly lose faith in them. If you're unhappy about a lack of support from your coworkers, don't let despair lead to finger-pointing; instead, allow your thoughts to simmer before sharing them with others. The harder you push for clarity now, the fuzzier your reality becomes. Although you might feel discouraged by the process, there's no reason to give up hope. Refine your dreams, readjust your sites and alter your tactics; you're closer to satisfaction than you think."
taurus,2016-09-28,"You're all too aware of the gulf between your romantic fantasies and the current reality of your relationships. Although you may be motivated to communicate exactly how you feel today, it's tricky when the stable ground begins to shift. Don't let annoyance get the best of you; remember that your attitude will impact the coming events in ways that you cannot yet understand. Your best strategy now is to surrender control and trust the process that you began earlier in the month. Keep calm and have faith that things will work out for the best."
gemini,2016-09-28,"You can make measurable headway today while addressing a persistent issue if you're willing to confront a difficult situation. You may feel overwhelmed by the circumstances, but rest assured the large waves of change will settle down in the weeks ahead. Relationships act as an anchor for you now, offering you something to hold onto as your foundations dissolve. You might be a little less confident exploring your feelings, but this is a rare opportunity to learn more about your heart."
cancer,2016-09-28,"Adhering to a healthy diet and a steady exercise routine may seem like an elusive goal now, but one that will be quite rewarding if you make a sincere effort. A wide variety of physical activities and delicious foods to choose from allow you to jump from one to another whenever you feel like it. Although you can improve your well-being by changing your habits, limiting your exposure to negative vibrations could be even more important today. Protect yourself by withdrawing from pessimistic people before you feel energetically drained by them. Your boundaries, your choice."
leo,2016-09-28,"Although you fiery Leos enjoy the spontaneity of play, this is no time to make snap judgments in your personal life. You may think you possess enough information to make a decision with clear purpose and direction while you're in this period of twists and turns. However, you are wise to treat your biggest dreams with the utmost care now. Be patient and let reality squeeze the life out of old delusions to make way for new inspiration. Have faith in your goals and hold onto them in spite of any doubts you might experience."
virgo,2016-09-28,"You might feel restricted by domestic responsibilities today but, paradoxically, you're also freer to use your imagination to step beyond all the constraints. Expect more of yourself, but be gentle enough to feel the pleasure of growth, rather than setting goals which you then must drive yourself relentlessly to achieve. Nevertheless, it's still wise to be discriminating when you share your ideas with others because they could feel threatened by the breadth of your vision. Talk less; dream more."
libra,2016-09-28,"You are caught in a time warp today as discouragement from earlier in the month returns to dampen your ambitions. You may not realize that your trajectory is still on the rise as the most solid bedrock temporarily turns into shifting sand. Thankfully, there is a higher spiritual purpose to the changes you are now experiencing. Remember, even if you haven't reached your destination yet, you are still gaining wisdom along the way. Instead of wallowing in self-doubt, gather your thoughts and create new dreams to inspire the next chapter of your life."
scorpio,2016-09-28,"You may have reached an impasse in a disagreement and feel as if you need to take drastic action today. You are driven by a desire for stability, but are painfully aware of all the emotions you suppress to maintain harmony in personal and business relationships. Something needs to give, for you can't sustain the illusions that have carried you to this point any longer. You have seen fascinating glimpses of what the future might bring; telling the truth inspires others to do the same."
sagittarius,2016-09-28,"Old dreams and persistent illusions hit the end of the road today as new opportunities allow you to put your ideas into motion. You may be at a point of no return, increasing your concern about completing a project. However, your dilemma is more complicated than just meeting a deadline; you could doubt your own ability to deliver the goods. Those people and institutions you normally trust might not be very dependable now. Although careful analysis of the facts can send you in one direction, it's best to follow your feelings even if they indicate a different path."
capricorn,2016-09-28,"You're on a mission now and are blessed with the energy and resources to reach your goal. Although you're all charged up and ready to go, you still might experience a twinge of uncertainty today as the Moon stirs conflict between your concrete ambitions and your nebulous dreams. If you doubt a decision you made earlier in the month, draw comfort from the knowledge that clarity will return in the days ahead. In the meantime, reconnecting with your most supportive friends gives you the boost of enthusiasm you need to keep moving forward."
aquarius,2016-09-28,"There is little room for self-deception now, especially if there are unresolved money matters still on the table. Perhaps you thought you could maintain your idealistic values, only to realize they may need to be adjusted in light of changing circumstances. No matter how your emotional or financial fortune plays out, authenticity is more important than anything else. Author Brian Tracy says, ""Confidence on the outside begins with integrity on the inside."""
pisces,2016-09-28,"You're excited about the prospects at work these days, but you may also be experiencing an underlying uneasiness if you're unsure of how to meet your obligations. The value of a relationship could be called into question as the ground continues to shift beneath your feet. The energy is particularly tricky to navigate now because you're uncertain about how to best assert your individuality. Don't let your fear of the judgement of others get in the way of your honesty. Be true to yourself and you will ring true to the world."
aries,2016-09-29,A coworker may be a powerful catalyst for your emotional healing today. A casually delivered comment might be all it takes to send you down a rabbit hole as you recall a moment from the past that you haven't thought about in years. But don't just shift your focus back to the noise of the present moment because there could be an important message buried in this memory that pertains to your current situation. Sometimes you need to pause long enough to hear the truth.
taurus,2016-09-29,"You can be so set in your ways that you often miss out on the fun because it's different from what you expect. Thankfully, the practical Virgo Moon empowers you to make discriminating choices today, especially with respect to extracurricular activities. But you don't need to be irresponsible to find pleasure now; enjoying what you do moment by moment is a deliberate choice. Improve your day by consciously appreciating what you have instead of coveting what is lacking. Why pursue happiness when you can create it?"
gemini,2016-09-29,"Taking care of yourself isn't always an act of selfishness. In fact, the Moon's current visit to your 4th House of Security is a powerful reminder of the benefits of healthy habits. Nevertheless, it's wise to pay attention to where your needs are at cross-purposes with someone else's. If conflicts come to light, don't just back down for the sake of convenience. A compassionate discussion about the difference of perspective should create a viable path toward establishing common ground."
cancer,2016-09-29,"Talking about your feelings can take you through tricky territory today, especially if your desires make others uncomfortable. Nevertheless, there's no reason to skirt around the issues. In fact, burying your feelings does more harm than expressing them. However, making another person responsible for your happiness is not a viable strategy. Deepak Chopra says, ""When you blame and criticize others, you are avoiding some truth about yourself."""
leo,2016-09-29,"A minor clash of personal values could send you on a little journey of self-examination today. But instead of reinforcing your boundaries to protect you from someone else's beliefs, open your heart and try to understand another person's point of view. You don't have to change your mind to appreciate that there are multiple ways to approach a subject. As Dr. Seuss wrote, ""Why fit in when you were born to stand out?"""
virgo,2016-09-29,"Your expectations may run into trouble today if you set the bar too high. Naturally, you're unwilling to settle for less just to avoid conflict, but your changing moods can make you overly sensitive at times while the emotional Moon is camping out in your sign. Rather than judging others by whether or not they conform to your preferences, just acknowledge what each person brings to the table. Author Stephen Covey writes, ""Strength lies in differences, not in similarities."""
libra,2016-09-29,"Balancing your acceptance of others with your criticism of those whose spiritual beliefs are divergent from yours can turn into an undeniable problem today. Ironically, as optimistic as you are these days, it's still annoying when you learn something about someone that triggers your negativity. Fortunately, there's nothing that must be resolved now; you can each honor your individual perspectives as long as you maintain respect for one another. Stretching your philosophical boundaries builds bridges in the most unusual places."
scorpio,2016-09-29,"Your perceptions are sharp enough to see right through someone's thick smokescreen today. Although people continue to act as if everything is fine, you intuitively know when something is amiss. Nevertheless, you're not required to play your hand according to anyone else's rules or show any cards unless you choose to do so. Trust your gut instincts and set boundaries whenever it seems appropriate. The deeper your self-love, the greater your protection."
sagittarius,2016-09-29,"Putting your best foot forward comes so naturally to you that everyone just expects you to be the perpetual bearer of good news. However, you're weary of holding that same sunny position all the time, especially if you don't feel it in your heart today. Nevertheless, you're still likely to bury any negativity that might create trouble at work. Rest assured that your honesty is appreciated, even if it's not what people want to hear. Ultimately, it's not your smile but your integrity that is your most admirable trait."
capricorn,2016-09-29,"You tend to look at your future through a practical lens but your common sense could get in your way today. The very same logical approach that usually contributes to your success might be the very thing that currently prevents it. Instead of reminding everyone at work of all the problems that need to be addressed, focus on the success stories and those activities that bring the greatest rewards. Beautiful things happen now when you distance yourself from negativity and follow your intuition."
aquarius,2016-09-29,"You're like an outsider in your own community today because you're not ready to go along with the party line. It's as if all the others in your group drank the same Kool-Aid while you feel like the little boy in the ""Emperor's New Clothes."" Nevertheless, you can't convince everyone that they are wrong and you are right -- even if you are. Although you don't have to remain silent so they can stay comfortable now, there's no advantage to taking on the whole world, either. Charles de Gaulle said, ""Silence is the ultimate weapon of power."""
pisces,2016-09-29,"Someone may be picking on you today and it doesn't seem fair because you haven't done anything to elicit such a critical response. Nevertheless, the perfectionist Virgo Moon in your 7th House of Others is opposing distressed Chiron in your sign, reminding you of a previous failure. Keep in mind that you might be supplying more emotional charge to the situation than actually exists in the current moment. Acknowledge your memory without letting it distort the present. There's no reason to allow the past to ruin the future."
aries,2016-09-30,"You are so driven to resolve a relationship issue that you could appear overly aggressive to others now. Compromise sounds like a good idea on paper, but it's not easy to make a deal with your emotions while the Libra New Moon squares warrior Mars from your 7th House of Partnerships. Luckily, your optimism will likely outweigh any negativity as you try to assess the pros and cons of the solutions on the table. Just remember to soften your approach; social graces are important if you wish to be taken seriously."
taurus,2016-09-30,"A normally comfortable relationship with your coworkers is more awkward now as your long-term goals clash with those around you. The creative Libra New Moon touches down in your 6th House of Employment, helping you focus your mind on the tasks ahead. However, a dynamic square to impatient Mars can make your job feel oppressive if you don't have enough leeway to work at your own pace. Nevertheless, as Henry Ford said, ""If everyone is moving forward together, then success takes care of itself."""
gemini,2016-09-30,"You might appear to be a party in motion, brightening up any place you go now. You're assertive but not offensive; however, you must pay attention to the reactions of others and adjust your rhetoric accordingly so you don't push an issue too far. Nevertheless, the Libra New Moon mingles with indulgent Jupiter in your 5th House of Fun, encouraging you to play before you work. Turn peer competitiveness into an enjoyable game to cultivate a sense of camaraderie. There will be plenty of time to dig in and do the hard work later when everyone is on the same page."
cancer,2016-09-30,"Don't expect to be fully rational when explaining your motives to others, even though you're trying to empathize with both sides of a family squabble. The fair-minded Libra New Moon agitates your 4th House of Roots, encouraging you to stabilize interpersonal dynamics. Ultimately, your best strategy is to develop a logical framework that people close to you can understand. However, be ready to incorporate whatever information comes to you in an intuitive flash. Trust the wisdom of your soul; it knows the way to your happiness."
leo,2016-09-30,"Keeping things simple is an uphill battle now as your mind is cluttered with stories that complicate communication and impede cooperation. Although the evenhanded Libra New Moon in your 3rd House of Learning opens your eyes to new ways of looking at the world around you, its square to contentious Mars is like a dark cloud following you around wherever you go. Although gathering information that clashes with what you already know may create as many problems as it solves, your curiosity can also lead to the discovery of innovative solutions."
virgo,2016-09-30,"A more objective picture of your current financial situation begins to emerge as the equitable Libra New Moon lands in your 2nd House of Possessions. However, the proximity of expansive Jupiter blesses you with a number of opportunities. Fortunately, you can hone your creative skills with patience and discipline to increase your sense of self-worth, and perhaps your income as well. Novelist Chetan Bhagat wrote, ""Be so busy improving yourself that you have no time to criticize others."""
libra,2016-09-30,"A surge of creativity feeds your optimism and inspires you to overcome obstacles. The social Libra New Moon brings marvelous possibilities from its close association to propitious Jupiter in your 1st House of Self. However, your inherent ambivalence may impede your progress, reflecting your desire to make choices that are best for everyone involved. You're hesitant to decide one way or another because you can see potential in all the options. There's no need to overreact now; instead of making an arbitrary decision, adapt and adjust to maintain harmony in a changing environment."
scorpio,2016-09-30,"If you've been patiently waiting for the clouds to clear, the fair-minded Libra New Moon's presence in your 12th House of Destiny could offer you the answers you seek. The Sun-Moon conjunction to wise Jupiter may bring a spiritual teacher or motivational mentor to enlighten your perspective. Psychologist Carl Jung wrote, ""Your vision will become clear only when you look into your heart. Who looks outside, dreams. Who looks inside, awakens."""
sagittarius,2016-09-30,"Powerful waves are washing over you as extravagant Jupiter joins the gracious Libra New Moon in your 11th House of Dreams and Wishes. You might, as William Blake wrote, ""See infinity in a grain of sand,"" but it's healthy to seek moderation, since you're operating at full speed now. No matter how eager you are to reach your goals, you're better off slowing down and working as part of the team for everyone's benefit. Nevertheless, cheerfully looking ahead rather than gazing wistfully behind allows you to vividly visualize your unrealized dreams."
capricorn,2016-09-30,"The company you keep at work is more important than ever while the diplomatic Libra New Moon emphasizes your 10th House of Career. How you connect with your colleagues influences your current trajectory, so shore up your alliances before making any major moves. Fortunately, energetic Mars in your hardworking sign blesses you with the stamina to follow through on anything you start. Just remember that considering the needs and desires of others now will also help you enlist their cooperation in promoting your ambitions. Teamwork makes the dream work."
aquarius,2016-09-30,"You may be quite content in your own bubble, so preoccupied with theory that you miss the more practical considerations. Although the creative Libra New Moon dances in your 9th House of Big Ideas, it's critical to bring your thoughts down to earth if you want to accomplish something real. Even if you can see amazing possibilities everywhere you look, you must rein in your imagination and place your feet firmly on the ground. Reevaluate your current circumstances, dream of what's around the next corner and find a healthy medium between what you have and what you want."
pisces,2016-09-30,"Relationships take center stage, so brace yourself for some excitement in both personal and professional alliances. The ambivalent Libra New Moon occurs in your 8th House of Intimacy, provoking partnership problems, while its square to argumentative Mars can turn minor differences into major events. Buttons are pushed that may upset the status quo. Be clear about your intentions and conscientious in your commitment. If complications arise, don't give up on working with someone who's willing to grow with you. Change is easier when shared."
aries,2016-10-01,"You're hopeful that your idyllic fantasies will morph into reality today, but complicated emotional interference might sidetrack your intentions for a while. Naturally, you prefer bliss to conflict, even if it seems elusive. Let your feelings guide you as sensual Venus in your 8th House of Intimacy harmonizes with spiritual Neptune. But don't spend too much time drifting in your dreams. Making magic in the real world is more satisfying than anything you can do in your imagination."
taurus,2016-10-01,"Romantic feelings and daydreams of happily-ever-after float through your mind today. A mesmerizing Venus-Neptune trine sweetens the atmosphere, so make sure to set aside some time to taste the delights of good company, fine food, music, art or nature. But be careful not to misuse your charm or fall under someone else's spell because desires can slip beyond the bounds of reason now. It's healthy to enjoy moments of escape when your heart takes flight as long as you return to reality when needed."
gemini,2016-10-01,"You may think you have a handle on your career path as you imagine where your current situation is leading. However, your sense of what's happening might not be accurate while delusional Neptune in your 10th House of Public Life trines beautiful Venus. Ultimately, you're more interested in chasing dreams than addressing practical realities. Giving yourself permission this weekend to wander freely among your fantasies can provide a much-needed break, but keep your mind focused on the bottom line when it comes to critical issues."
cancer,2016-10-01,"The proverb, ""Home is where the heart is"" packs a special punch for you today because you're probably vulnerable enough to share your feelings in a safe environment. Although conversations may grow intense, you are securely anchored to the belief that everything will turn out for the best in the end. However, acting on your passions might be a mixed blessing that enables you to ride on the wings of love or return to earth, dazed and confused by the difference between reality and fantasy. Protect your heart; although love can be magical, sometimes magic can be an illusion."
leo,2016-10-01,"Although a stormy disagreement might start your day on a difficult note, the energy smooths out as long as you don't overreact. A soothing Venus-Neptune trine allows you to calmly hold a vision of your ideal relationship, whether or not you choose to do something about it. But any form of deception will lead to disappointment and disillusionment today. Fortunately, you can capture the hearts of others with your captivating charm and enchanting stories. A sweet and tender love connection is possible now, but you must be vigilant about staying honest if you want it to last."
virgo,2016-10-01,"Letting go of your logical analysis isn't the easiest thing in the world for you clear-headed Virgos. However, taking more time to carefully consider new ideas before putting them into motion won't necessarily increase your satisfaction now. Your feelings are more important than facts today as accommodating Venus makes beautiful music with empathetic Neptune. Others can introduce you to delightful experiences and relationships grow warmer as practicing forgiveness helps you forget old grievances. William Shakespeare wrote, ""Pleasure and action make the hours seem short."""
libra,2016-10-01,"People seem to be genuinely appreciative of the recent improvement in your attitude and their reactions, in turn, have a positive effect on you. But don't fool yourself about love or money while creative Venus in your 2nd House of Self-Worth trines confusing Neptune. You might believe that everything will turn out fine with no effort on your part today. Nevertheless, consciously visualizing your ideal future helps to clear a path to the best possible outcome. Let your dreams be your guide, but anchor your logic to reality."
scorpio,2016-10-01,"Your feelings flow easily today and trust grows along with your faith in the generosity of the universe. In fact, your antenna is attuned to the channel of peace and love as magnetic Venus in your sign conspires with metaphysical Neptune in your 5th House of Creativity. You are blessed with the ability to give and receive without keeping score because you know that the joy you're experiencing now is beyond measure and without limit."
sagittarius,2016-10-01,"You might be convinced that manifesting your visions will be a piece of cake. A smooth trine from delicious Venus to sympathetic Neptune fills your heart with compassion and inspires random acts of kindness. Undoubtedly, the cosmos is serving you up a dream where others make you feel special. But you may be so sensitive to their issues that you forget about your own needs. The bad news is that the rose-colored glasses won't always keep your daydreams from crashing to earth. The good news is you can be happy no matter what happens, for it's your attitude that creates the real magic."
capricorn,2016-10-01,"Beauty is fleeting today; you could fall in love with someone or something, only to be disappointed if your experience doesn't live up to your expectations. Although you may have concrete plans, keeping them real can be a challenge. You might even get lost in your dreams now that alluring Venus in your 11th House of Long-Term Goals trines illusory Neptune, blurring the line between fact and fiction. No matter how you choose to work with this cosmic magic, it's crucial to stay present so you don't wander too far off course."
aquarius,2016-10-01,"You have high hopes for your romantic liaisons today as your dreams spill over into your daily life. An inspirational Venus-Neptune trine hooks you with temptations of love and lust. Although surreal Neptune can evoke promises that are based more on hope than reality, it also distracts you with endless visions of pleasure. For now, a temporary escape into your fantasy world might be the catalyst you need to make the real-life changes you desire."
pisces,2016-10-01,"Dreams that have been on the edge of your consciousness are beginning to come into sharper focus. Life is sweet while a romantic Venus-Neptune trine adds so much magic to your day. You're aware of love's presence everywhere you look. This free feeling of connection can happen with a partner, a passing stranger, or even alone through your spiritual practice. Instead of resisting the unknown potential of the moment, be grateful that the cosmos is sprinkling fairy dust over your world and putting everyone in a mellower frame of mind. The best way to multiply your happiness is to share it."
aries,2016-10-02,"It's smarter to do one thing with all your heart than to spread yourself too thin today. Although sudden inspiration reveals new and unusual ways to tackle a tough job, originality only goes so far. If you are over committed, take a deep breath and consider your options before blindly pushing ahead. There's no reason to waste your energy trying to move forward in a straight line while confusing cosmic messages turn you around in circles. You can't depend on your eyes when your imagination is out of focus."
taurus,2016-10-02,"You may think it's the perfect time to start a pet project, but unaccommodating circumstances raise questions about your decision. Unfortunately, a challenging Sun-Neptune aspect seduces you into believing that your fantasies are real. Additionally, the presence of unorthodox Uranus encourages you to look for answers outside of the box. Don't be discouraged by unplanned events that slow your progress. Instead, think of these obstacles as lessons that allow you to hone your skills and improve your chances for success."
gemini,2016-10-02,"A single stroke of genius empowers you to leap over doubts today and discover shortcuts to achieving your goals. However, applying your brilliant insights is tricky while the willful Sun in your 5th House of Self-Expression is misled by slippery Neptune. You might feel dejected when you realize you're no longer on the right track, triggering thoughts of self-defeat. However, you have an opportunity to advance and evolve if you overcome your fear and adopt a beginner's mind to explore the unknown territory ahead."
cancer,2016-10-02,"Your unsatisfied needs for emotional security are triggered by memories of unsuccessful attempts to get what you want. Although you must be specific when talking about your plans today, it might be uncomfortable to share them with others. Whether you are embarrassed by your current desires or just afraid of rejection, pushing past your own resistance now is the first step toward realizing your eclectic goals. Eleanor Roosevelt said, ""Nobody can make you feel inferior without your consent."""
leo,2016-10-02,"Your thoughts can slip out unexpectedly today, shocking others with your apparent lack of empathy or confusing them with your radical point of view. But even if you are the one to upset the apple cart, you still might assume a kind-hearted individual will come to your aid. Instead of flaunting your neediness, make time to pamper yourself without relying on anyone else. Once you have taken responsibility for soothing your own weary soul, you're more likely to feel compassion for everyone else."
virgo,2016-10-02,"A few poorly chosen words might be all that's necessary to start an argument today. A stressful aspect from talkative Mercury to explosive Uranus in your 8th House of Deep Sharing puts everyone on edge. Fortunately, brilliant concepts will emerge from the storms of clashing ideas if you  maintain an even temper and a healthy sense of humor. Minor adjustments may save a relationship now, even if you think that drastic changes are the only way to keep it from falling apart. You have two ears and one mouth so you can listen twice as much as you speak."
libra,2016-10-02,"Satisfying your need for intellectual stimulation doesn't necessarily require a partner while cerebral Mercury is visiting your 12th House of Inner Peace. Quiet time for reflection or prayer is emotionally satisfying and revitalizes your spirit. Nevertheless, your current lack of motivation can drain your energy. Thankfully, innovative Uranus kicks in with a sudden spark of inspiration. Sometimes, flying solo is best because you don't have to communicate your every move with anyone else. George Washington said, ""It is far better to be alone than to be in bad company."""
scorpio,2016-10-02,"Your intentions may wobble today if you lack the control or direction you desire. Unfortunately, talking to a trustworthy person won't necessarily bring you the stability you seek while chatty Mercury in your 11th House of Friends misaligns with unpredictable Uranus. Nevertheless, your hopes are high and you're eager to regain your balance now. However, tackling everything at once won't produce the expected results. Instead, narrow your focus and concentrate on the specific issues at hand; save the delights of dream-time until you complete this simple exercise in self-discipline."
sagittarius,2016-10-02,"You could be obsessed with taking a creative or romantic risk today. However, your judgment may be clouded, leaving you lost in a daydream as the distance between you and reality grows wider. Although an inventive resolution might seem obvious in a spontaneous flash of genius, don't push your luck. Going to extremes can provoke a negative reaction; tone your rhetoric down a bit, or you might agitate unnecessary conflict. Keep the faith, even if it's difficult at first to tell whether you're slipping backward or making real progress."
capricorn,2016-10-02,"Your apparent nonchalance is misleading now and others may be quick to judge your uncharacteristically cavalier behavior. However, you might just be feeling like you can't get anything right, so there's no point in even trying. You're ready to make false assumptions about a close friend or partner without asking the necessary questions. It's difficult to know where to establish boundaries today, yet it's better to err on the side of caution. Remember, everyone has moments of doubt and confusion. As author Margaret Atwood writes, ""When nothing is sure, everything is possible."""
aquarius,2016-10-02,"Your current behavior has the potential to change the shape of your professional relationships, even if you don't interact with anyone in person today. You're passionate about creating new connections or bringing original ideas into an ongoing partnership. You're being offered a rare opportunity to try combining your sense of excitement with the security that you crave. Sufi poet Rumi wrote, ""Life is a balance of holding on and letting go."""
pisces,2016-10-02,Radical thinking propels you toward new and exciting destinations today. Ingenious Uranus and imaginative Neptune reveal alternative avenues that lead you to exploration and experimentation. This spontaneous dance with curiosity can work wonders as long as you're into sincere discovery and not into controlling the end results. Approach life like a mountain climber who is well secured by a rope and always has an escape route nearby if needed.
aries,2016-10-03,"Letting go of an unrealistic dream may be the last thing you want to do today because you don't want to admit defeat. Although others might still be encouraging you to continue fighting for what you want, you're beginning to see what's possible and what is not. But your current self-doubt doesn't need to result in surrendering your aspirations when there's still so much potential ahead. Be firm about your ultimate destination, but flexible about your methods."
taurus,2016-10-03,"Your coworkers seem extra friendly today yet you're not sure why everyone is being so nice to you. However, there's no advantage to searching for the motives behind their generosity. Although a charming Moon-Venus conjunction sweetens your 7th House of Others, you are hesitant to trust your own observations now. Simply take your perceptions at face value and graciously accept the support from your associates however it appears. A grateful heart is a magnet for miracles."
gemini,2016-10-03,"If everything seems too perfect at work today, chances are there really is something amiss. Seeing the most positive attributes wherever you look can be taken to an extreme now, leading to bad judgment calls. Instead of automatically saying yes to someone's lucrative offer, sit with your indecision for a day or two before re-examining your feelings. It's not in your best interest to respond with an answer right away. Entrepreneur James Altucher says, ""Infinite patience gets you immediate results."""
cancer,2016-10-03,"You're riding a creative high as the Moon moves through your 5th House of Self-Expression, connecting artistic Venus with imaginative Neptune. Although your fantasies can be profound as they touch the symbolic depths of your awareness, it might not be all that simple to turn them into reality. Forgive yourself for your shortcomings in technique or your lack of follow through; you are just as human as everyone else. Hold the vision; trust the process."
leo,2016-10-03,"You're not completely forthcoming with your feelings today, even if others pressure you to show your true colors. However, you might believe that your emotions are private and aren't necessarily anyone else's business. You prefer to put on a happy face if you think that it will lead to a better business deal or even improved working conditions. But don't completely shut yourself off from your heart just because it seems to be a more productive strategy. Life without passion is like a body without a soul."
virgo,2016-10-03,"You may go out of your way to get along with others today, believing that lighthearted communication will set the stage for more intense interactions later on. But your impatience can get the best of you while clever Mercury is still trading brilliant insights with unconventional Uranus. A sudden epiphany isn't as awesome as you think; there are no shortcuts or free lunches now. Author Gordon Hinckley wrote, ""Without hard work nothing grows but weeds."""
libra,2016-10-03,"Although you might not go so far as to think the world owes you a living today, you're pretty sure you deserve a solid break. You know exactly what you bring to the table now that the reflective Moon joins valuable Venus in your 2nd House of Self-Esteem. You may feel empowered by the special skills you have to offer, but don't assume that your contribution is irreplaceable. C.S. Lewis wrote, ""Humility is not thinking less of yourself, it is thinking of yourself less."""
scorpio,2016-10-03,"Your senses are usually keen enough that you have little problem telling the difference between reality and fantasy. However, surreal Neptune intoxicates the moody Moon and sexy Venus in your intense sign today, confusing your thoughts with your dreams. Although you might not be able to understand what's happening in the world around you, you can certainly spot your own biases. Judging others doesn't define them; it defines you."
sagittarius,2016-10-03,"You can turn a difficult situation into a memorable tale today. Fortunately, this sleight of hand works to your advantage because others see the lighter side of the situation when they hear your slant. However, your optimism might backfire if you overplay your cards. Exaggerating for the sake of the story may be acceptable if you're aware of when you are bending the truth. But ignoring the facts won't change the circumstances. Nevertheless, sometimes we need a little fantasy to survive reality."
capricorn,2016-10-03,"You are extremely appreciative of your friends today, especially if they demonstrate their willingness to support you beyond the call of duty. However, you might find it awkward accepting their help because you don't want to be in their debt. Although you like to keep score in a game to see who wins, this is not a competition. Let go of your desire to quantify the give and take of your relationships and just let the energy flow without judgment. Cicero wrote, ""Gratitude is not only the greatest of virtues, but the parent of all others."""
aquarius,2016-10-03,"Your position at work seems to be solid now and you might even be in line for a promotion or raise. There is a cosmic confluence of positive events happening that confirms your optimism about the future. Nevertheless, making assumptions about what you think you deserve won't improve your chances for success. To the contrary, unrealistic expectations will only set you up for disappointment. Keep an open mind and count all the little blessings that come your way."
pisces,2016-10-03,"Dreaming about a wonderful adventure ahead won't actually make it happen, but it can open a door that wasn't previously there. Using your fantasies to stretch your horizons enables you to step beyond old self-imposed limits now. Lateral thinking is easier when your ideas don't have to be tied to reality. Astronomer Carl Sagan wrote, ""Imagination will often carry us to worlds that never were. But without it we go nowhere."""
aries,2016-10-04,"You Rams often run full speed into walls thinking that your brute force irresistible charm will allow you to bust through to the other side. However, respecting the rules and acting with a little conscious self-restraint enables you to build a foundation that's likely to last. Nevertheless, taskmaster Saturn's unforgiving presence leaves little room for error. Although you may feel inspired by a higher calling, be cautious unless you're absolutely certain that your bold actions will succeed."
taurus,2016-10-04,"Smooth sailing is a clear sign that you're heading in the right direction today. However, any problems that arise now are indicators of where your life still requires work. You may have all the proper tools you need to reach your destination, but an unexpected plot twist can tilt your world out of balance without warning. Remember that keeping the peace is not as important as keeping your sanity."
gemini,2016-10-04,"Your current tendency to play it safe will be rewarded, even if you're temporarily upset about missing out on some major fun today. The fact of the matter is you have more critical things to do and can let down your hair later. The Sun's harmonious sextile to stable Saturn can help settle your edgy emotions, ground you in reality and pave the way for real progress. You attract success when you set your priorities right."
cancer,2016-10-04,"You're not a stranger to emotional intensity, but you often keep your most extreme feelings to yourself. However, you may feel comfortable enough today to express your complex feelings in a straightforward manner. Nevertheless, you must get out and circulate with others or you could waste the great potential inherent in this moment. Stress can be a powerful motivational force rather than something to eliminate if you channel it in a healthy manner."
leo,2016-10-04,"You may appear to be in your element, but strong feelings are brewing internally that could boil over into a confrontation. Thankfully, a constructive sextile between the willful Sun and ambitious Saturn helps you direct your energy into generating positive change. You have a strong sense of purpose now, as well as the experience to manage people and resources with creativity and wisdom. Galileo wrote, ""Passion is the genesis of genius."""
virgo,2016-10-04,"You can cash in on your recent originality thanks to your current ambitious nature and unwavering diligence. Furthermore, you're able to capitalize on a powerfully stabilizing Sun-Saturn sextile that strengthens your endurance, motivating you to follow through on any project you start. Nevertheless, a wonderful opportunity could slip by without even making a ripple unless you take the bull by the horns and make something happen. You are always responsible for how you act, no matter how you feel."
libra,2016-10-04,"No matter how familiar a situation may seem today, there are subtle nuances that make this moment unlike any before. Unfortunately, you can't wrap your mind around the information that doesn't quite fit into the bigger picture today. However, your patience enables you to untangle complex messages and demystify the confusion, even if you must explain yourself repeatedly. Nevertheless, the most complicated issues can be communicated while the Sun in your sign illuminates dependable Saturn, bringing determination and discipline that strengthens alliances and earns you respect."
scorpio,2016-10-04,"Although the inner workings of your mind are quite complex and not easily understood, you're under no obligation to share these private thoughts now. Instead of getting lost in a complicated head trip, demonstrating your ability to organize your ideas and complete tasks on schedule is your most sensible objective today. The support of an efficient Sun-Saturn sextile motivates you to get all your ducks in a row before jumping into a project without a plan. Thankfully, you possess a quiet self-confidence and a feeling of pride in all that you do."
sagittarius,2016-10-04,"Although you're surfing great waves of optimism, the currents can get tricky today. This is no time to be complacent, so remain vigilant to the subtle messages from the cosmos that are reminding you how your thoughts influence reality. Thankfully, you are being supported by the Sun in your 11th House of Long-Term Goals as it collaborates with pragmatic Saturn in your sign. By applying your newfound strength and wisdom to your everyday life, you'll quickly see the positive impact that metaphysical ideas can have on your world."
capricorn,2016-10-04,"A rising tide of enthusiasm inspires you to make another round of plans for your future, yet you have the common sense to know it's not quite time to leap into action. Nevertheless, there's plenty for you to do as a stable Sun-Saturn sextile requires you to build trust in your professional relationships. Instead of making a mad dash to the finish line today, put your efforts toward establishing a solid base of operations that will be able to sustain the many changes ahead."
aquarius,2016-10-04,"A shift in the prevailing winds steers you into more practical territory today. Although you may be receiving signals from other dimensions that hold the key to a current dilemma, the voices are speaking in an unintelligible alien tongue. As intriguing as the messages might sound, you quickly lose interest when you realize their meaning is lost. Instead, ask what you can do right now to consolidate recent gains and increase your effectiveness at work. President Theodore Roosevelt said, ""Believe you can and you're halfway there."""
pisces,2016-10-04,"You may be swept up in feelings of political or religious fervor today as powerful emotions provoke you to broadcast your opinions. But instead of spouting ideas based upon your personal preferences, use authoritative Saturn's presence in your 10th House of Public Responsibility to help you gather the information you need to back up your words. Mark Twain quipped, ""Get your facts first, and then you can distort them as much as you please."" However, denying the truth doesn't change reality."
aries,2016-10-05,"Major conflict can grow out of a minor issue today, making it necessary to tame the flames of aggression if you want to avoid a fight. A high-energy square between macho Mars and bombastic Jupiter gets your temperature rising, delivering the courage to knock on doors and ask for what you want -- even if you were previously refused. Your fierce capacity for selling your ideas may be overwhelming to others, so avoid being overly insistent if you encounter opposition. Knowing when to stop is an admirable skill that greatly improves your chances for success."
taurus,2016-10-05,"No matter how cool, calm and collected you remain, the pace at work may get a little crazy today. Red-hot Mars forms a stressful square to expansive Jupiter, magnifying a powerful release of energy that shakes your world. But avoid getting dragged into someone else's dispute since taking sides can be a dangerous business now. Your key to applying this potent force constructively is to change your own behavior, rather than trying to alter anyone else's. Sudden surprises are nearly inevitable; it's how you handle them that counts."
gemini,2016-10-05,"Your enthusiasm about a potential relationship requires expression today, but strong convictions can trigger fights or competition that could get out of hand. A dynamic square between impetuous Mars and adventurous Jupiter may push you to share more than you intended, but you're intrigued to see how far you need to go to elicit a response. Although there might not be a reason to keep your feelings to yourself, reining in your emotions just a little allows you to maintain control. The view is much better when you take the high road."
cancer,2016-10-05,"You could be overwhelmed with a seemingly endless list of chores today. In fact, you may take on so much that your schedule does indeed fall apart -- but you can turn this sense of chaos to your advantage. Of course, it's crucial that you extinguish any brush fires, but don't get distracted from your long-term goals. Although you might be chasing lofty ambitions, you needn't resolve every issue that arises now. Journalist Sydney Harris wrote, ""The time to relax is when you don't have time for it."""
leo,2016-10-05,"Your judgment may be clouded by a wave of restlessness at work today. Although you already have your agenda in place, you might be eager to express your latest and greatest ideas. Go ahead and speak your piece, but do it in a thoughtful manner that doesn't negatively impact your positive frame of mind. Your broad perspective sharpens your sense of strategy, allowing you to clearly assess opportunities and chart a course to fame and fortune. Begin this next phase of your journey with purpose and determination; it will take a valiant effort to make your dreams come true."
virgo,2016-10-05,"You possess an I-can-do-anything attitude today, but there are still formidable hurdles to overcome. Consciously resisting the temptation to set your sites too high increases your odds of finding satisfaction. Overspending, over-indulging and over-committing are traps that could result in negative consequences later on. Instead of stressing about how to fix everything all at once, reevaluate your situation and develop a strategy to preserve what's already working. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush."
libra,2016-10-05,"You are on a mission to expand your mind and deepen your understanding of the complexities of the universe. But an irrepressible square from super-hero Mars to extravagant Jupiter in your sign can skew your judgment, making everything sparkle with awesome potential. You are all over the emotional map today but, ironically, still might try to keep your intentions secret. Don't waste too much energy in your attempt to hold back the tide. Maintaining a sense of humor while keeping your head above water enables you to enjoy the wild ride."
scorpio,2016-10-05,"Working to establish equilibrium between your personal needs and your commitments to others isn't always easy. Putting your life in balance is even more complicated while rowdy Mars squares lavish Jupiter. Nevertheless, the cosmos blesses you with enough common sense now to moderate any overindulgence. However, you might need some time alone today to process your feelings and choose the best course of action. Daniel Webster penned, ""Liberty exists in proportion to wholesome restraint."""
sagittarius,2016-10-05,"Impulsive or reckless acts are inviting today, but aren't likely to turn out well. The Moon's return to your sign, coupled with the overreactive Mars-Jupiter square, inspires inflationary thinking that could lead to blind optimism. Nevertheless, your key planet Jupiter is the king of bigger, better and more -- and is so convincing in his exuberance now that it's difficult to know when to stop. If you don't exercise enough self-control, unexpected consequences might make your extravagance quite costly."
capricorn,2016-10-05,"Loading up on luxuries is a luxury you can't afford now. Nevertheless, taking an emotional risk can be a spontaneous and pleasantly surprising event. However, you must be careful about acting on every whim because the inflationary Mars-Jupiter square encourages you to believe you can get away with just about anything these days. Heightened anxiety may propel you to do something foolish, but don't move too quickly just to impress someone else. Believe it or not, less is more."
aquarius,2016-10-05,"Choices made now are likely to create long-term ripples in your life, especially regarding education plans and travel. The enthusiastic Mars-Jupiter square can be a cosmic catalyst that reminds you to act with patience not with haste. In fact, the bigger the commitment, the more cautious your approach should be now. Nevertheless, paying attention to all the details prevents you from facing discouragement when the outcome doesn't meet your expectations. Containing your excitement enables you to direct it with clear purpose and maximum control."
pisces,2016-10-05,"Although you may be distracted from your current objective, a highly energized square between insistent Mars and opportunistic Jupiter blasts you forward, even if you're not heading in the right direction. You're passionately driven by strong opinions that could provoke unnecessary clashes now. However, playing the role of an observer changes everything today. Quiet your mind and keep a light hand on the wheel; the road will tell you which way you need to turn to safely reach your destination."
aries,2016-10-06,"You are distracted with unrealizable fantasies that divert energy from your main purpose. However, a crisis may arise as you belatedly realize you've gone too far or too fast. But an obstacle or a setback is simply the universe's way of letting you know that there is more work to be done. Avoiding your responsibilities is not a wise option today, so tie up any loose ends before moving on. Zig Ziglar said, ""Where you start is not nearly as important as where you finish."""
taurus,2016-10-06,"You could wake up today with a nagging feeling  that you are spending your time chasing rainbows. Unfortunately, pursuing an elusive dream or stretching yourself too far can undermine your credibility; stop over-committing your resources, especially at work. You can't satisfy everyone simultaneously, so make your priorities clear right from the start. Keep in mind that letting go of old ambitions that don't correspond with your current needs enables you to increase your productivity in the long run."
gemini,2016-10-06,"Although you can visualize your goals within your mind's eye today, you still might not know exactly how to attain them. Fortunately, your self-confidence goes a long way to compensate for your lack of a good plan. You're eager to swing into action, even if you're uncertain about your direction; nevertheless, a coworker's criticism could dampen your enthusiasm in a moment. Luckily, slowing down may be the best thing you can do to develop a workable strategy for success. Time has a wonderful way of showing you what really matters."
cancer,2016-10-06,"You have temporarily misplaced your regular sense of caution, enabling you to ardently pursue your dreams without restraint today. However, you may feel underappreciated at work, leading you to overcompensate with reckless behavior. Stretch your limits, but stay within the bounds of reason. A bold move is a smart idea now as long as it's accompanied by sufficient planning. Preparation is the secret to your success."
leo,2016-10-06,"Unbridled enthusiasm can carry your attitude over the top today, but an unplanned reality check from a friend might send you down the rabbit hole of pessimism. Fortunately, you're quite capable of making rapid midcourse corrections as needed. Nevertheless, you could be flooded with so much information that you skip sorting out data that may be faulty. A little research goes a long way now; verify your facts twice before jumping to any conclusions. The truth will set you free."
virgo,2016-10-06,"You might actually believe the sky is the limit now. Unfortunately, you have so many good ideas you can't decide which ones to pursue and which ones to cast aside. Making a list of the pros and cons for each opportunity allows you to quickly narrow your choices. Go ahead and run with one thought as far as you can. Just remember that serious planning and consistent hard work are necessary ingredients to achieving any goal that is worthy of your attention."
libra,2016-10-06,"A serious case of self-doubt could catch you off guard if you set your hopes too high today. Confusion comes and goes as you swing between a heightened sense of enthusiasm and increased uncertainty. You may be swept up by the fear of making a bad decision, which prevents you from arriving at any conclusion. Paradoxically, you might be happily surprised when a minor setback brings sudden resolution. Confidence is like a muscle; the more you use it, the stronger it gets."
scorpio,2016-10-06,"You are motivated by a high level of enthusiasm today, but your excitement may be misdirected. You could even set yourself up for exhaustion if you over-commit your time. There's no reason to struggle for approval now, especially if your self-esteem falters. Avoid letting guilt talk you into giving more than you can. Fortunately, you're quite adept at shifting gears once you come up with a clever solution that removes you from an awkward situation. Motivational speaker Les Brown says, ""Change is difficult but often essential to survival."""
sagittarius,2016-10-06,"You could make a poor choice today, especially if you react too quickly. Nevertheless, everything should turn out fine if you can keep your energy within reasonable bounds. Your key planet Jupiter is still quite active, making everything appear better than it actually is in reality. Unfortunately, you can't look to your coworkers for advice now because they'll only encourage you even further. Take what everyone else says with a big grain of salt. The current cure for nearly everything that ails you is to keep it simple."
capricorn,2016-10-06,"Your new lighthearted attitude won't be enough to calm your nerves for very long today. It might feel as if there's a lot at stake professionally and you're struggling to maintain a positive perspective. You don't like being lost in confusion, even if it's for a short period of time. Nevertheless, taking a disciplined approach at work makes it possible to reset your compass and put yourself back on track. When all else fails, climbing the mountain is what you Goats do best."
aquarius,2016-10-06,"Wasting your time with misplaced efforts can hijack your day today. Nevertheless, stretching your boundaries by exploring new activities is helpful as long as you don't lose touch with your basic goals. If you're on the edge of frustration or anger, take a break until you regain emotional equilibrium. Walking around your neighborhood is a better idea now than going on a flight of fantasy. Keep your feet on the ground when your head is in the clouds."
pisces,2016-10-06,"You may grow impatient with yourself or with anyone else who doesn't follow through on a promise. Unfortunately, more isn't necessarily better today. If you manage your energy poorly, it might lead to exhaustion or bad judgment. Little differences blow up into major disputes unless you practice self-control. Direct the current waves of change with careful attention so you can adjust your course before landing somewhere you don't want to go."
aries,2016-10-07,"An exchange of heartfelt words can escalate into an unexpected drama today. Mercury's presence in reflective Libra encourages you to see yourself in the mirror of relationships rather than simply viewing other people as an extension of yourself. However, the Sun squares off with powerful Pluto, instigating conflicts within a personal or business partnership. Since it's difficult to back down once words have been spoken or actions taken, it makes sense to approach a delicate topic with the care it deserves. Emily Dickinson wrote, ""Saying nothing sometimes says the most."""
taurus,2016-10-07,"You're likely to fight back today if someone at work demands more than you can deliver. Unfortunately, the Sun's dynamic square with domineering Pluto can maneuver you into an uncomfortable corner. Although you might be in a tenuous position, the real threat to your security is if you lose your temper, raising the stakes all the way around. Remember, burying your anger isn't the answer if you want to develop a stronger support network. However, persistent diplomacy allows everyone to express their feelings so you can navigate through a tough situation together."
gemini,2016-10-07,"You've been patiently waiting for the right moment to say something important to a close friend or partner. You might unintentionally release a flood of emotions when talkative Mercury enters your 5th House of Self-Expression, triggering the Sun's dynamic square to transformational Pluto. Suppressing your frustration is not an option now; your irrational feelings will not take no for an answer. Share what's on your mind as kindly as you can and remember that the situation is probably not as dire as it seems. Honest hearts produce honest actions."
cancer,2016-10-07,"What appears obvious may be far from the truth today when it comes to dealing with authority figures and meeting your obligations. A sneaky Sun-Pluto square hides answers that take unwavering determination to find. If you're struggling with a person who is preventing your progress, step back and look at the whole situation from a completely different angle. Changing your perspective can reveal the key that helps unlock this complex puzzle."
leo,2016-10-07,"You might encounter a new kind of resistance today that isn't just a simple roadblock. In fact, you may be facing a formidable opponent at work while the Sun squares vengeful Pluto in your 6th House of Employment. Rather than engaging the issue directly now, make a plan that allows you to diffuse the conflict while also demonstrating your ability to handle complexity. Use your creativity and courage to turn a fight to the finish into a win-win situation."
virgo,2016-10-07,"You could lose face in an emotional exchange where your integrity is questioned. Nevertheless, this crisis turns into a transformational opportunity as the Sun in your 2nd House of Self-Esteem squares Pluto in your 5th House of Self-Expression. Don't struggle to hold onto what you have when you can free up creative resources by letting go. A dramatic metamorphosis leads you to something or someone better if you let it. A comfort zone is a beautiful place, but nothing ever grows there."
libra,2016-10-07,"You must brace yourself today because it's time to face your deepest desires and hidden fears. Shadowy Pluto creates an intense square with the radiant Sun, possibly provoking ego skirmishes, sowing seeds of mistrust and undermining your sense of self-worth. Thankfully, you can tap into a rich vein of resources that transform losses into gains if you honestly recognize what you need over what you want. Since you can't control the irrational behavior of others, focus on managing your own life the best you can."
scorpio,2016-10-07,"You can easily be drawn into a protracted battle with someone who is just as stubborn as you, even if you think you're being more than fair now. You might want to consider searching for an escape route today, because the Sun's tense square to ruthless Pluto makes compromise elusive. The simplest solution to circumventing conflict is to minimize your contact with individuals who cost you more than they're ultimately worth."
sagittarius,2016-10-07,"An interesting turn of events sheds light on the continuing conflict between your current situation and your long-term goals. However, a shift of focus from the present moment to future possibilities becomes problematic when unrelenting Pluto squares the willful Sun in your 11th House of Dreams and Wishes. You may be able to envision what's around the next bend, but you must push through someone's resistance before you can run off to pursue your dreams. Your willingness to be brutally honest is the key to your success."
capricorn,2016-10-07,"You may stretch your limits and see how far you can push yourself or someone else as you strive to reach your goals. You face a challenging choice when the Sun crosses paths with obstinate Pluto. It may not be obvious whether you are trying to end something or just testing the resilience of a relationship. It's risky to force negative feelings to the surface now, yet working through your emotions with honesty and kindness is a great way to clear the air. Taking extreme measures activates your creative channels and opens your heart."
aquarius,2016-10-07,"You might realize you're being drawn into powerful emotional currents that can precipitate a showdown. Although turbulent waters are likely when the Sun squares obstinate Pluto in your 12th House of Destiny, forcing the issue won't bring you any closer to happiness. Even if your sense of well-being seems threatened, the chances of real danger are minimal. Nevertheless, memories of a situation gone sour can evoke an intense response. Let go of old patterns and find the strength to keep on loving, no matter what."
pisces,2016-10-07,"Your relationship world is in flux and you must determine who is on your side and who is not. It's tempting to deny the issue or delay any action but the Sun's terse square with unrelenting Pluto pushes your buttons to elicit your reaction now. Although Mercury shifts into peace-seeking Libra today, even your sweetest phrases may not avert a battle for control. Profound dissatisfaction bubbles beneath the surface, eroding trust and confidence. Nevertheless, as Carl Jung wrote, ""Everything that irritates us about others can lead us to an understanding of ourselves."""
aries,2016-10-08,"Intense feelings are triggered as you encounter someone who attempts to thwart your intentions today. You might not want to be confrontational at work or at home, but realize you must take direct action anyway. Expressing your truth is healthy; just don't overreact or you'll be busy unraveling a drama over the days ahead. Remember, there's no reason to share your position with everyone. Talking to the right person at the right time is essential to get your message across."
taurus,2016-10-08,"You think you know what someone else is saying until you notice that you're receiving multiple streams of information simultaneously. You can't discern one signal from another today, making it nearly impossible to hear any of them clearly. Nevertheless, you may be embroiled in a conflict that makes it impossible to just walk away. Although relationship dynamics might be more complicated now than you prefer, skirting around the intensity creates more problems than it solves. Dance with the uncertainty until your clarity returns."
gemini,2016-10-08,"You might be compelled to defend your feelings today or apologize for inadvertently overstepping your limits. In either case, you're swimming in deep waters that put you in touch with existential fears. You may feel a bit out of your element now, yet you still respond immediately if your efforts are being criticized. Taking a stand is a sensible strategy as long as you don't invest too much energy in seeking a final resolution. Be a warrior, not a worrier."
cancer,2016-10-08,"You are driven to connect with your deepest desires today, even if you're not sure what to do about them. You may be required to process repressed family-related issues to further understand your feelings. Nevertheless, an air of suspense can be disconcerting because you don't have the complete picture now. Confronting old failures is your ticket to successfully navigating the current emotional obstacle course. Voltaire wrote, ""Judge a person by his questions rather than his answers."""
leo,2016-10-08,"You want more joy from your relationships now, but something seems to be holding you back. Unsettling alignments with the heavyweight outer planets prompt you to seek stability and excitement at the same time. In particular, uncomfortable aspects to suspicious Pluto provoke feelings of jealousy or resentment, making it difficult to relax. Nevertheless, tackling the present challenges can transform you into a better person if you remember to treat those around you with compassion. Author Ziad Abdelnour wrote, ""Seek respect, not attention; it lasts longer."""
virgo,2016-10-08,"The cosmos pushes some powerful emotional buttons today that bring buried fears and desires to the surface. Your newfound awareness threatens to rock your world unless you're willing to accept your past and make a detailed plan to move toward the future. However, there is little allowance for error now, making it very important to be precise as you inform others of your intentions. As Albert Einstein said, ""If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough."""
libra,2016-10-08,"You might be engaged in a no-win situation today, unless you're willing to back away from the heat of conflict. Although retreat may be more complicated than you wish, you can effectively play the mystery card now by keeping a secret -- even if it seems as if you are telling the whole story. Dreaming about a lovely outcome is one thing, but planting your feet firmly on the ground is still required. Surprisingly, your desired destination isn't somewhere over the rainbow; it's right in front of you if you open your eyes."
scorpio,2016-10-08,"Although your creative energies are running strong today, you become uncomfortable if someone challenges your integrity or doubts the veracity of your facts. Nevertheless, you may try to prevail in an argument, but you could get caught up in an intense drama as you clash over values. Do not become attached to temporary emotions; just flow with them until they dissipate. Instead of weaving a web of intrigue, work toward manifesting deep transformations that convert negativity into love."
sagittarius,2016-10-08,"New and unusual desires could place you in a strange set of circumstances today. However, rather than pursuing these radical feelings, you're more likely to let go of a delightful distraction now that stern Saturn in your sign is squaring the karmic Lunar Nodes. You might even find yourself embroiled in a passionate battle with someone who disagrees with your priorities. But you could overreact if anyone tries to change your viewpoint by questioning your core beliefs.  Don't make a permanent decision based on a temporary feeling."
capricorn,2016-10-08,"You could remember events now that you wish to forget. Attend to a gnawing concern related to unfinished business with friends and relatives; don't let it linger in silence and undermine trust within your family tree. Believe it or not, facing skeletons in the closet can bring enormous relief, freeing up your mental and emotional resources to create a better future. But don't move too quickly; temper your strong sense of urgency with a more restrained approach to change. In the end, you'll only regret the chances you didn't take."
aquarius,2016-10-08,"A complex mix of cosmic energies can unleash power struggles in relationships today, but they also set the stage for positive change. Disagreements over matters of principle could become so important that everything else is temporarily set aside. You may feel like a volcano that's ready to erupt as pressures intensify, and you might not consider the consequences of your actions now. Unfortunately, your current lack of patience makes it challenging to be nice to those around you unless you can find a healthy outlet for your stress. Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle."
pisces,2016-10-08,"Your sixth sense is on fire today, especially when it comes to reading the hidden motives of others. Reality and imagination weave a magical fabric that reveals patterns to you that no one else can see. However, you must share your insights discreetly or you could annoy someone needlessly. Naturally, you have the right to speak your truth, but it's more productive if you do it carefully to avoid instigating unnecessary conflict. Listen to the little voice in your head when it tells you to call it quits."
aries,2016-10-09,"You might feel as if you're caught between a rock and a hard place today when you want to do one thing and your friends want to do something else. Maintaining a cheerful attitude is difficult when people change their mind at the last minute, leaving you stuck with nowhere to go. Nevertheless, there's no reason to blame others for your position. Instead, honestly sharing your frustrations strengthens communication and eases the stress. Freedom is yours when you learn to take nothing personally."
taurus,2016-10-09,"On one hand, you want to stick to your regular routine no matter who pressures you to do something different. On the other hand, you can't suppress your urge to break free from the status quo when the Moon squares volatile Uranus. Simple statements trigger strong reactions today, especially when you're unsure of what you really need. Nevertheless, taking a risk by inventing new ways to express yourself is more rewarding than trying to fit into someone else's box. An original is worth more than a copy."
gemini,2016-10-09,"Change seems to come out of the blue today, initiating a process that brings you greater freedom of expression. But first you must find your way through the complicated emotional maze or you may reach a breaking point that can alter the course of a relationship. If your need for independence is greater than your hunger for closeness, it may be healthier to take time to reinvigorate a partnership with conscious intent than to let your emotions explode. Instead of allowing negative feelings to spiral out of control, focus on the facts to assure the best possible outcome."
cancer,2016-10-09,"Your agenda might not match everyone else's expectations today. You could overreact to what others say if you don't like the advice you receive. Conflict is possible now, especially if you're unwilling to compromise. However, choosing flexibility over stubbornness allows you to maneuver around emotional landmines while tactfully suggesting solutions. Cultivate constructive discussions in search of common ground, rather than insisting there is only one right answer. Japanese author Satoro wrote, ""Individually, we are one drop. Together, we are an ocean."""
leo,2016-10-09,"You could work yourself into a corner today by clinging to your fixed views. However, relief may come quickly if you're willing to roll with the changes instigated by the Moon's square to unstable Uranus. Nevertheless, you might feel overloaded with too many challenges as you attempt to eliminate the old in order to make way for the new. Paradoxically, jumping into a fire by choice is actually safer than holding yourself back to avoid complications."
virgo,2016-10-09,"It's unnecessary to settle for less today just because things don't seem to go as you planned. In fact, disruptive Uranus can open your mind to a radically different notion about your true life's purpose. However, you may have to step outside of the logical box that usually works in your favor. Thinking about the alternatives beyond the limits of your current situation empowers you with a surge of creativity. Sometimes it's imperative to go to the extremes of self-expression in order to succeed."
libra,2016-10-09,"Your diplomatic approach to conflict is put to the test today when people act in unexpected ways. Although your day may be turned upside down by someone's shocking behavior, you're exhilarated once you take off your kid gloves. However, you don't need anyone's permission to make radical positive changes. Fortunately, you can stand up for your beliefs even against great odds without letting your emotions get the best of you now. As Leonard Nimoy said, ""Logic is the beginning of wisdom, not the end."""
scorpio,2016-10-09,"Although your heightened sense of urgency makes it nearly impossible to hide your frustration, risky behavior won't necessarily make you feel any better. Unfortunately, your mouth can move faster than your ability to moderate outrageous comments today. What you think is an acceptable statement may trigger an unfriendly response from someone close to you. If you find yourself in the midst of a conflict with a friend or relative, retreat in the name of love. Practicing the art of compromise is better than winning the battle and losing your happiness."
sagittarius,2016-10-09,"A casual remark could alter the course of your day in ways you can't predict. Conversations may suddenly veer off in odd directions today, leaving you perplexed about your next move. Therefore, it might be smarter to wait until your emotions settle down before saying what's on your mind while the moody Moon squares erratic Uranus in your 5th House of Spontaneity. Nevertheless,  articulating your position clearly and calmly alleviates the current tension without upsetting the status quo."
capricorn,2016-10-09,"Domestic tranquility may be elusive today if your impatience motivates you to say and do anything to make your case. It's useless to pretend that you're willing to submit to someone else's point of view now that the Capricorn Moon squares radical Uranus in your 4th House of Home and Family. However, it's unnecessary to recklessly take a chance to find the freedom you seek. For now, the most peaceful way to handle the potential volatility is to just smile and walk away. Greek philosopher Euripides wrote, ""Silence is true wisdom's best reply."""
aquarius,2016-10-09,"You're not interested in following someone else's arbitrary rules and are quite willing to rattle your saber today in order to let them know you're the boss. A rebellious Moon-Uranus square provokes you to tell others what you want, even if you must break with tradition to get your message across. Taking an entirely different approach allows you to let go of the past to create a more harmonious yet stimulating future. American suffragist Susan B. Anthony said, ""Independence is happiness."""
pisces,2016-10-09,"Speaking your truth is not always appreciated in family politics, but being honest with yourself about your priorities helps to keep your spirits  alive. Although you might decide to bury your feelings today, unexpressed emotions still find their way to escape and create conflict. Thankfully, the Moon's current visit to your 11th House of Community emphasizes the value of building support among your family and friends. Henry Ford said, ""Working together is success."""
aries,2016-10-10,"Don't be surprised if every little thing seems to fall into place today without much effort on your part. Luckily, you encounter very little resistance in your interactions with others. In fact, it seems as if your coworkers show up in a variety of ways to support you as you strive to achieve your goals. However, there's no reason to fall into the trap of demanding too much or the positive vibes around you could disappear as fast as they materialized. Sometimes we create our own heartbreaks through expectation."
taurus,2016-10-10,"You have plenty of leeway at work today, prompting you to think about how you can improve your efficiency. You Bulls usually take the familiar route because you like the reliability of knowing exactly where you are and when you will reach your destination. However, you're more inclined to meander off the beaten path new, creating opportunities to discover new ways to approach the same old tasks. Necessity is the mother of invention."
gemini,2016-10-10,"You're like a kid in the sandbox today and, happily, everything you do seems like recreation. However, being in a playful mood doesn't necessarily mean you are shirking your responsibilities. In fact, your childlike approach to even the most boring task has others wondering how you make everything look like fun. Unfortunately, you don't possess a secret formula that can be taught to anyone else. You just know that you have a choice and you choose to be happy now. Whistle while you work and see who sings along."
cancer,2016-10-10,"Obviously, personal and business relationships are quite important to you, but you need some room to explore your own interests these days. Fortunately, you can talk about your feelings now without being controlled by them. Your current philosophical approach allows others to express themselves while still maintaining autonomy. If you've been waiting for a better time to broach a delicate discussion, don't let this moment pass you by."
leo,2016-10-10,"Everyone seems to be attracted to your upbeat manner today while simultaneously remaining oddly aloof. They appear to be happy, chattering away with small talk about trivial matters. Ironically, people also discuss big picture topics about global issues and cosmic themes. However, for some unknown reason, no one is willing to participate in a heartfelt interaction. It's as if a memo was distributed that put personal emotions on a do-not-discuss list. Fortunately, you can buck the trend and tell someone how you feel as long as you don't expect the same in return."
virgo,2016-10-10,"You see the potential to increase your income everywhere you look today. However, like a child sitting in front of a bowl of ice cream, your eyes may be bigger than your stomach. This means that cashing in on an opportunity may require more time and energy than you have at your disposal. It's all too easy now to underestimate what it will take to bring an idea to fruition. Small opportunities are often the beginning of great achievements."
libra,2016-10-10,"You're not ready for the weekend to be over yet as you head back to your job or school. You might spend more time at the water cooler or on your cell phone today than attending to the tasks at hand. Although you may successfully get away with being unproductive for a while, your irresponsibility will catch up with you as the day progresses. Don't set yourself up for a headache by leaving everything until the last minute. Instead of avoiding work to have fun, find ways to enjoy yourself while meeting your obligations. Procrastination is not your friend."
scorpio,2016-10-10,"Establishing clear boundaries with friends and coworkers is a high priority today. It's crucial for everyone to know that you are quite happy doing your own thing and you don't want anyone else's expectations to affect your current decisions. Unfortunately, someone might misread your signals, interpreting your behavior as a personal rejection. Although nothing could be further from the truth, you're not interested in justifying your motives to anyone else at this time. If people characterize you by your actions, they'll never be fooled by your words."
sagittarius,2016-10-10,"People may wonder where you get your abundant energy from as you incessantly talk away the day. Granted, you have a lot to share but you seem to require lots of extra words to say the simplest things. Nevertheless, your big ideas light the fire of inspiration in the hearts of your friends and colleagues. Surrounding yourself with those who believe in your dreams creates a network in which you can thrive."
capricorn,2016-10-10,"You have great expectations about what you can accomplish today and are eager to share your plans with anyone who will listen. Paradoxically, your quest for emotional security leads you to climb the ladder of success, as if achieving social status will make your heart happy. Obviously, there's nothing wrong with distinguishing yourself professionally; in fact, it can bring deep satisfaction. But don't assume mastery of the outer world will automatically improve your feelings of self-worth. Fame and fortune can't buy you love."
aquarius,2016-10-10,"You possess a light and easy touch in your interactions with others today while on your personal quest for truth. Many people who embark on this kind of journey become so wrapped up in their path that they judge others negatively if they choose a different route to enlightenment. Nevertheless, the trap is always present and you are caught as soon you think your way is the only way. Continue on your search and be open to those you encounter. As spiritual teacher Matthew Fox wrote, ""It doesn't matter where you dig the well; you will still reach the same water."""
pisces,2016-10-10,"It might seem as if you have fairies and elves coming to your aid today, but your good luck is probably well deserved and hard earned. Nevertheless, everything seems like a Rubik's cube and you want to know all the facts so you can solve the puzzle. Unfortunately, some information is so well hidden that you won't likely uncover it right away. Don't give up; the secrets of the universe are yours for the asking once you learn the magic word."
aries,2016-10-11,"Let someone who enters your life now show you what you've been missing. Talkative Mercury joins broad-minded Jupiter in your 7th House of Others, widening your horizons of thought and opening vistas of infinite possibilities. There's no reason to be resistant to new ideas, even if you think you know better. Ultimately, what you learn today will be beneficial in ways you cannot yet realize as long as you rein in your current tendency to exaggerate. The best teachers are students for life."
taurus,2016-10-11,"Your mind expands with big ideas today, but too much information coming at you too fast leaves you dizzy. Multiple streams of incoming data can be overwhelming, so don't expect to understand everything right away. Your inclination to over-explain adds confusion when brevity would help you make your point. In fact, you can create the strongest impact now by tempering your enthusiasm enough to maintain a practical approach to everything you do."
gemini,2016-10-11,"A noticeable change in the cosmic weather widens your perceptions, allowing you to see opportunities you previously missed. Your confidence grows as waves of excitement invite you to explore new methods of self-expression. Logical Mercury's collision with buoyant Jupiter inspires you to be optimistic about your future. You have no problem imagining how your life can improve now, so share your story with people who can help you achieve your dreams. Mahatma Gandhi said, ""The future depends on what you do today."""
cancer,2016-10-11,"Recent disappointments quickly fade into the past as clever Mercury joins lucky Jupiter to tell a happy tale. Thankfully, you can make your case with an imaginative flare as long as it rings true with your feelings. This joyful conjunction activates your 4th House of Roots, attracting you to memories of your past. However, you may feel uncertain until you integrate your history with the potential of the present moment. Remember, it's not about where you begin, but where you are going. Rather than replaying old tapes, create a new playlist for your next big adventure."
leo,2016-10-11,"Your generosity of spirit creates enough space to discuss conflicting beliefs in an open-minded way today. Nevertheless, a chatty Mercury-Jupiter conjunction in your 3rd House of Communication prompts you to justify your intentions, although you may add more confusion than clarity. Even if you have all the facts at your disposal to prove your theory, you could inundate others with too much information. If you realize you're not making headway today, back off until you settle down emotionally. Being selective in your presentation is more effective than saying everything at once."
virgo,2016-10-11,"Optimism overrules common sense today, but it's not enough to simply believe you are right. A bombastic Mercury-Jupiter conjunction insists that you tell others everything you know but you may grow less confident of your conclusions as the day unfolds. Share what's on your mind while visionary Jupiter is still brushing away any doubts, enabling you to clearly communicate your highest ideals. In order to succeed, you must first believe you can."
libra,2016-10-11,"You can readily break down complex subjects into simple concepts today, making you an exceptional student and a highly effective teacher. The communication planet Mercury joins outspoken Jupiter in your sign to kick your thinking up another notch. Routine tasks may become especially boring as you seek intellectual stimulation from innovative ideas. People will listen when you speak as long as you tailor your comments to their level of interest and ability. Every performer knows how important it is to connect with the audience to create a memorable experience."
scorpio,2016-10-11,"Grandiose ideas flow quickly, making it difficult to miss the positive inspiration that you bring to others now. However, analytical Mercury's conjunction with philosophical Jupiter can make you more opinionated than ever. If you're looking for a good debate, then speak up today. However, Jupiter tends to inflate your feelings, so small slights can feel like major insults. Nevertheless, your generosity and idealism shine through your words if you concentrate on spreading love and kindness."
sagittarius,2016-10-11,"Changing your attitude now is the simplest way to improve your future. You are blessed with an irrepressible desire to manifest your dreams as intellectual Mercury joins jolly Jupiter in your 11th House of Long-Term Goals. Even if you don't have a specific plan, you believe that everything will work out for the best. Just remember that overconfidence can easily lead to arrogance today, possibly stirring up opposition from those who would be better allies than enemies. A grateful mind keeps your ego in check."
capricorn,2016-10-11,"Your mental landscape is brilliant but erratic now as wonderful insights combine with totally outrageous ideas. You're swamped with wild speculations about your career potential, even if the details of your plans are still sketchy. Pushing the limits of your potential can feel awkward today at first, but that doesn't mean it's the wrong thing to do. Remember that you're not out to prove your point, but to effect change as best you can. Your power of persuasion is strong as long as you're able to temper your optimism with realism."
aquarius,2016-10-11,"The last vestiges of discouragement dissipate today, and once again you can clearly see where you are going. Nevertheless, intelligent planning is key to your current success. Although you want others to play a role in your agenda, you're not prepared to share too many details. Too much information makes it harder for anyone to know where to jump in; rambling on only dilutes your important message. William Shakespeare wrote, ""Brevity is the soul of wit."""
pisces,2016-10-11,"Sometimes it's better to let go and start all over than to stick with a plan whose time has passed. Thankfully, fresh ideas enable you to leave old ones behind when mental Mercury joins positive Jupiter. Your capacity to understand new concepts about intimacy may be enhanced by a skillful teacher since this conjunction occurs in your 8th House of Deep Sharing. Ultimately, your enthusiasm convinces others to surpass their own limits, infusing more passion into any partnership."
aries,2016-10-12,"Although you're excited about all the possibilities ahead, your desires overcome your reason today, leaving you dazed and confused. A disillusioning Venus-Neptune square can even throw you into a temporary state of despair as you try to narrow down your choices. But you could be easily fooled in your current idealistic frame of mind. If you choose to make yourself vulnerable to another person, first ensure that he or she is worthy of your trust."
taurus,2016-10-12,"The path to happiness is an elusive one today, even if you're convinced that your honorable intentions are enough to make everything turn out okay. However, charming Venus squares fuzzy Neptune from your 8th House of Intimacy, leading you to confuse an unrealistic fantasy with true love. Trust your recent decisions and just keep heading in the same direction, even if you grow discouraged. Don't worry if you feel like you're losing your way; a temporary mist can obscure even the clearest mind. Opportunity is often delivered in a fog of uncertainty."
gemini,2016-10-12,"Your compassion and imagination are stronger than your common sense today while attractive Venus dynamically squares fantasy-prone Neptune. Opening your heart to others is fine as long as your expectations aren't set so high that you end up disappointed. You're more likely to pursue a dream and overlook reality, seeing people as you wish them to be rather than as they truly are. Nevertheless, surfing an emotional wave adds excitement to your day, and adding a little bit of caution can prevent you from losing your balance and wiping out."
cancer,2016-10-12,"If something seems too good to be true today, it probably is. Thankfully, you're able to retreat from the unrelenting pressure of needing to make choices while persuasive Venus in your 6th House of Daily Routine creates a stressful square with intoxicating Neptune. Although you are so optimistic that you could overlook the facts, your fascination is so convincing that it's difficult to maintain a healthy perspective. Even if you're ready to give a project the go ahead, delay major decisions for a few days until you have a more realistic outlook."
leo,2016-10-12,"You could convince yourself that nearly anything is real today as long as it's something you want badly enough. However, you're treading on dangerous ground as a romantic Venus-Neptune square paints reality with your imagination, weakens your will and distorts your judgment about a person or a purchase. Although you may be able to justify your actions, sacrificing yourself for love or money could end up being much more expensive than you think if you let your desires exceed the limits of logic."
virgo,2016-10-12,"It's all too easy to misread others today, especially if your fantasies distort your perceptions. An imaginative Venus-Neptune square makes it tough to know what's real, even if the exacting Virgo Moon enables us to discern individual bits of data. Instead of trusting your intuition in vague generalities, zoom into the smallest details and build the truth from there. Using your astute powers of concentration can prevent you from believing that all is well when in fact it is not."
libra,2016-10-12,"You long to escape the routine of everyday life and will ignore practical considerations today to enable your dreamy voyage. A magical moment of delight may inspire creative endeavors and romantic pursuits by stimulating your imagination. However, your reasoning could be skewed while a magnetic Venus-Neptune square pulls you off course now and leads you down a garden path. Don't make any promises you can't keep; a sober assessment will convince you to lower your expectations and prepare you for the inevitable return of reality by the end of the month."
scorpio,2016-10-12,"It's as if you've fallen into a hypnotic trance and are compelled to chase an unrealistic dream. A misleading Venus-Neptune square prompts you to give in to escapist behavior. Unfortunately, your plan could backfire when you realize you've fallen down a surreal rabbit hole and you don't know the shortest route back to the surface. Nevertheless, recognizing your limits before you exceed them prevents you from losing your center of gravity and stops trouble before it even starts."
sagittarius,2016-10-12,"Untangling the threads of illusion from the colorful tapestry of life is a monumental project today because fact and fiction have tied themselves into a lover's knot. A romantic Venus-Neptune square inspires your dreams while clouding the truth, especially when you project your desires onto someone else. Your infatuation may not be grounded in reality, so enjoy the experience without making any serious commitments. Thankfully, fantasy help us survive in the mundane world."
capricorn,2016-10-12,"Your ideas invest people and objects with more value than they may possess, making it wise to spend your love and money with caution now. Illusory Neptune forms a stressful square to romantic Venus in your 12th House of Fantasy, prompting you to confuse your dreams with reality. You may be overcome with desire, risking what you've gained simply for the exhilaration of a passing pleasure. If your expectations are too high you will need to rein in your dreams before you believe them to be real. Thankfully, your willingness to forgive yourself and others empowers you to heal even the harshest of wounds."
aquarius,2016-10-12,"It's not easy to balance your dreams with the concrete needs of others today. Romantic fantasies can be particularly alluring yet disorienting as sweet Venus in your 11th House of Friends forms a confusing square to nebulous Neptune. Nevertheless, your ultra-sensitive to others now and one offhand comment might be enough to trigger your insecurities. Fortunately, a softer side of you is revealed in a tender moment when all is forgiven."
pisces,2016-10-12,"Concentrating on mundane work tasks can be quite a challenge when you're so inspired by romantic dreams, beautiful objects and fascinating ideas. Desirous Venus squares glamorous Neptune, stimulating your imagination while weakening your sense of practicality. Your current attractions may be ill advised because you could be vulnerable to deception now. Allowing yourself to imagine the possibilities of love in your life is healthy unless you make the false assumption that all your dreams will come true."
aries,2016-10-13,"Your psychic radar is hypersensitive, making it easy to quickly jump to a wrong conclusion today. Allowing more time between your gut reaction and your actual response is wise because a dynamic Mercury-Mars square can instigate conflict. A simple misunderstanding might provoke angry words if you're unable to hold your tongue. Avoid arguments over insignificant differences while staying alert to deeper power struggles that could develop over the days ahead. Nevertheless, protecting your territory may not be as constructive as cultivating peace."
taurus,2016-10-13,"Sticking to the specific issues at hand today enables you to overcome nearly any obstacle. Your key question is whether to hold onto someone or something that no longer satisfies your needs. Unfortunately, mischievous Mercury brings problems rather than solutions when it squares Mars in your 9th House of Future Vision. Keep in mind that this energetic aspect is better used to provide much-needed perspective than to discuss delicate matters with intelligence and grace. Author Charles Buxton wrote, ""In life, as in chess, forethought wins."""
gemini,2016-10-13,"You can be quite the persuasive diplomat these days when defending an emotional position. Your social charm serves you well while witty Mercury flies through gracious Libra and your 5th House of Self-Expression. However, your current vulnerability complicates things now, and managing your anger is crucial to your happiness. For the best results, consciously work to alleviate hostilities before they escalate into a crisis. A stitch in time saves nine."
cancer,2016-10-13,"Dramatic words have an enduring influence now, so watch the tone of your voice when responding to someone's manipulative behavior. Talkative Mercury is spinning an emotional web with warrior Mars, making it even more critical to contain your negativity. Push yourself to a higher level of creativity rather than expecting others to speak your language. Your attitude is everything today, so use the strength of your emotions to attract what you desire and repel what you no longer want. Seeking serenity on the inside helps to create calmness on the outside."
leo,2016-10-13,"Balancing your own needs with those of someone at work can be especially tricky today. It may be difficult to get any traction in a serious discussion when communicator Mercury in ambivalent Libra is so determined to avoid conflict. Unfortunately, your charm alone is not sufficient to minimize the potential drama. Much to your chagrin, even the best-laid plans can fall apart now. Nevertheless, perseverance is the antidote to compensate for your current tendency to break through the resistance and happily move on. You can't change what you refuse to confront."
virgo,2016-10-13,"A mild disagreement today might grow into a serious conflict in the near future as your current impatience is ignited by a pushy Mercury-Mars square. However, the depths of your thinking and precision of your words establish a path to awareness and compromise if you can stay calm. Nevertheless, facing your own fear of failure may be an uphill battle now, tempted as you are to force an issue. Instead of overplaying your hand, employing patience is your safest bet. If you create your own storm, don't get upset when it rains."
libra,2016-10-13,"The noise of everyday communication takes center stage today while chatty Mercury tensely squares contentious Mars. But life gets complicated when you are required to take care of others now that Mars is heating up your 4th House of Family. Even if you're disappointed by the current circumstances that are restricting your freedom, don't waste time wallowing in self-pity. Show up with a positive attitude, continue working on your plans and prepare to shift your focus to your own agenda as soon as the opportunity arises."
scorpio,2016-10-13,"It's absolutely necessary to carefully handle any conflict that surfaces today, because even your kindest comments may sound harsh to the wrong ears. An argumentative Mercury-Mars square exacerbates the stressful conditions, turning conversations into verbal combat before you know it. Raising deep issues can be highly productive, but only if done with a conscious intent to heal. Don't let your annoyance get the best of you; making your point passionately is admirable as long as you keep your emotions under control."
sagittarius,2016-10-13,"Barbed words can fly out of your mouth without thought today, wounding others while unintentionally revealing your hidden frustration. However, addressing repressed feelings is healthy if you can accompany it with good-natured humor and a generous spirit. Instead of expressing your anger without regard for the consequences, apply your emotional intensity to an intellectually challenging task now. A busy mind is a happy mind."
capricorn,2016-10-13,"Your emotions might lead you into turbulent waters today. Vivid dreams overflow into your waking life to reactivate a struggle between your personal fantasies and your professional commitments. Mental Mercury and physical Mars engage in a cosmic skirmish that can unravel a relationship as anxious fears overwhelm your cool logic. Although words spoken in the heat of the moment could meet a hostile response, conscious kindness prevents a meltdown from turning nasty. Thankfully, things smooth out quickly if you don't insist on having your own way. Cooperation beats competition every time."
aquarius,2016-10-13,"You can't wait to tell everyone about your escape plan but your spirit of adventure may clash with your more responsible ambitions today. Some things are better left unsaid, especially while loquacious Mercury in your 9th House of Big Ideas forms a combative square with warrior Mars in your 12th House of Secrets. Although you might find it tough to suppress your urge to speak up, patience works better than pushing now. Fools rush in where angels fear to tread."
pisces,2016-10-13,"You're not interested in subduing your feelings today for the sake of making peace in a relationship. The moody Moon's presence in your sign adds to your emotional sensitivity and vulnerability, but a challenging square between trickster Mercury and militant Mars packs an extra punch into every word you speak. Nevertheless, if you're unable to resolve a difference of opinion quickly, it may be smarter to retreat for a few days in order to let your emotions cool off. If you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all. A moment of compassion prevents a lifetime of regret."
aries,2016-10-14,"You want everyone to get along today, but all is not well in the land of cooperation. You can't relax while the ever-changing Moon and freedom-loving Uranus are wreaking havoc in your sign. Meanwhile, several planets create more tension from your 7th House of Partnerships by confronting you with someone else's needs. No matter how much you wish for relationship stability, you're unsure if you're able to pay the required emotional price now. Be mindful with your words; once spoken they can only be forgiven, not forgotten."
taurus,2016-10-14,"You are exceptionally effective in organizing all the pieces that need to fit into your master plan today. Nevertheless, the Sun's looming opposition to ingenious Uranus in your 12th House of Privacy is already sparking unconventional thoughts that provoke you to reveal hidden feelings. Nevertheless, telling your secrets could ignite a couple of days of emotional turmoil, making it crucial to think before you spill the beans. Don't rock the boat unless you're willing to get wet."
gemini,2016-10-14,"Breaking free from a close friend or associate can change the dynamics of a relationship now. Finding yourself attracted to a person who is not your usual type feels dangerous but exciting as unorthodox Uranus opposes the radiant Sun in your 5th House of Romance. However, if you need to pull back, go ahead and do it without a second thought even if this seems to contradict your intentions. Marcel Proust wrote, ""The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new lands but seeing with new eyes."""
cancer,2016-10-14,"Taking steps to ease tensions doesn't accomplish as much as you wish today, possibly leaving you feeling as if your efforts are in vain. You might have thought you found safe harbor, only to belatedly realize you are in the midst of another storm. Unexpected events at work demand your attention while you grow frustrated because you prefer to be putting out fires at home. Trust your instincts when it comes to juggling your priorities; life will return to normal once the cosmic weather settles down."
leo,2016-10-14,"Your relationships may feel tenuous today as circumstances release stored-up resentments and unexpressed emotions. An unpredictable confrontation is triggered by electric Uranus as it opposes the Sun in your 3rd House of Communication. However, the real danger comes from your fear of change rather than change itself. Trying to suppress the brewing discomfort only feeds its intensity. Even if you're tempted to cling to the status quo, keep in mind that opportunities for growth will follow once the air is cleared of lingering negativity."
virgo,2016-10-14,"Someone may speak to you in a way that provokes an explosive reaction from you today. Whether people's comments are critical or humorous, you're not likely to be in the mood for laughing when you hear what they think of you. Fortunately, revolutionary Uranus opposes the Sun in your 2nd House of Possessions, setting the stage for a breakthrough in your understanding about a personal or financial partnership. If another person isn't bringing out the best in you, find someone who will."
libra,2016-10-14,"The glaring light of awareness is suddenly shining on a touchy relationship issue. You must be willing to confront anything that keeps you from your highest purpose now. Whatever makes you feel awkward needs to be dragged out into the open where you can deal with it in plain view. But don't get trapped by the restrictions of logic; do anything that might activate your imagination today. Stepping outside of your comfort zone could make you a bit nervous, but the future will be brighter if you trust the truth that exists beyond words."
scorpio,2016-10-14,"Although you're not likely to waste too much energy trying to revitalize your social life today, you're still ready for substantial growth in your relationship world. The truth is the wild Sun-Uranus opposition suggests this is no time to stick with the status quo. In fact, if you're forced to play nicely in a boring situation you might just get up and leave. If the current circumstances don't challenge you now, they won't change you tomorrow."
sagittarius,2016-10-14,"There is more happening now than meets the eye, making it nearly impossible to just go along for the ride. Although you might be dealing with a minor annoyance at work, your inflexibility could contribute to complicating matters even more. The solar opposition to irrepressible Uranus enhances your physical energy and increases stress in personal relationships as you obsess about your lack of independence or what you have sacrificed for love. Ronald Reagan said, ""The price of freedom may be high, but never so costly as the loss of freedom."""
capricorn,2016-10-14,"Your mind is solidly grounded today yet ambiguity could cloud your thinking when encountering rapidly changing circumstances. Your moods shift as quickly as a spring breeze while the Sun's opposition to electric Uranus shocks your 4th House of Security. On the positive side, this cosmic lightning is excellent for clearing out the cobwebs in your brain and awakening you to new experiences. If you have grown bored recently, receiving unexpected news is bound to grab your attention. Your time as a caterpillar is over; stretch your wings and fly."
aquarius,2016-10-14,"It's wonderful to be blessed with an abundance of optimism now, but your positivity could prompt you to overlook something very important. You may be disappointed with yourself when you first realize that your goals are not as near as you thought. Revising your plans as soon as you gather all the facts prevents you from wasting time trying to reach the wrong destination. Scaling back your expectations just a bit enables you to feel proud when you exceed them."
pisces,2016-10-14,"You might believe there's been enough unexpected twists and turns already, but it appears that reality still has a few tricks up its sleeve. The tension is palpable and resolution is not likely because you're unable to find the source for your discomfort. Fulfilling your wish to escape the drama by taking a day or two of rest seems further away than ever. But even if you think the script is already written, the Sun-Uranus opposition sets the stage for surprise endings. Make changes now or they will be made for you."
aries,2016-10-15,"A failure to address an existing relationship issue can suddenly turn into a major kerfuffle today. A menacing Mercury-Pluto square could undermine trust, while an extreme Sun-Uranus opposition inspires you to ignore all warning signs and blast ahead anyhow. Although you may want to flee if you don't find any obvious answers, letting go of your fixed expectations leads to the breakthrough you seek. Whatever the problem, choose to be part of the solution."
taurus,2016-10-15,"Chasing a fascinating idea might take you on a scenic route today, but this detour can turn into a wild ride if you try to fight the inevitable. Unfortunately, you set yourself up for a day of unpleasant surprises unless you possess a little faith and a good deal of flexibility. However, staying open to the possibilities may be all it takes to unlock a stagnant relationship issue. Set your fears aside now and delve into the unknown since you could encounter answers that ordinary logic would never find."
gemini,2016-10-15,"It's as if the cosmos is inviting you to play a game of Truth or Dare, requiring you to be honest to a fault. But the rules state that you can't distort the facts, even if your disclosure upsets the proverbial apple cart. In fact, tiptoeing around the edges of a touchy subject won't be enough to prevent an unstable house of cards from tumbling down. You might experience a few uncomfortable exchanges today in your quest for transparency. Thankfully, this cathartic process could bring much-needed closure, freeing you to head into the future joyfully unencumbered of any emotional baggage."
cancer,2016-10-15,"You might not be able to skirt around conflict today as unresolved fears lead to a verbal showdown. Nevertheless, open confrontation isn't the best response to your current concerns. Of course, denying your feelings isn't helpful either; avoidance only increases the dissension in the long run. Think carefully before you speak and use your innate emotional sensitivity to build bridges rather than to tear them down."
leo,2016-10-15,"Someone close to you may have an agenda that's at odds with yours today, creating an impasse in finalizing your plans. Unfortunately, this isn't a light and easy disagreement that you can just disregard. You have abruptly come to the end of a road and can't determine where to turn next. Thankfully, the Sun's opposition to Uranus in your 9th House of Future Vision is a harbinger of evolution. Take advantage of this opportunity to resolve large issues that pit sensible caution against reckless abandon. The rules of the game have changed; anything is possible if you believe in yourself."
virgo,2016-10-15,You can feel the pressure to hold your ground today even if a part of you wants to run away from everyone and everything. Your innate tendency to do what's right is challenged by the Sun's revolutionary opposition to Uranus in your 8th House of Transformation. Saying less is better than trying to convince others that your way makes more sense at this volatile time. It's best to acknowledge your core values and use them as a moral compass to guide you through circumstances you cannot control.
libra,2016-10-15,"You take pride in your even-handed approach to disagreements but your gut feeling makes you suspicious of what others are selling you today. You're eager to put this matter behind you, but it's nearly impossible now to tell whose facts are the correct ones. The tension is palpable, motivating you to untangle the variables in this crazy situation, respond accordingly and move on. Rather than focusing on making a decision, concentrate on discerning what's real. Your sincerity is the key to restoring the balance you so desperately need."
scorpio,2016-10-15,"Unresolved issues could escalate in an unexpected moment of emotional drama or, preferably, in a sudden urge for total honesty. Communicator Mercury's dynamic square to your key planet Pluto is a great opportunity to initiate an open dialogue about a sensitive subject. However, your volatile feelings might cause a scene you later regret. Choosing compassion over vengeance allows you to sleep at night. Aesop wrote, ""No act of kindness, however small, is ever wasted."""
sagittarius,2016-10-15,"Finding common ground between those who resist change and those who insist upon it requires someone with extraordinary vision -- and today the job might be yours. The stormy skies are electric with tension as the Sun opposes reactionary Uranus in your 11th House of Community. Unfortunately, people seem to be easily offended by your radical honesty, suggesting that a little discretion works in your favor. Choose your words carefully for minimum damage and maximum impact."
capricorn,2016-10-15,"You may be overwhelmed with professional or personal pressures, tempting you to escape from your responsibilities today. Nevertheless, don't let fatigue or frustration dictate your actions because they can keep you from achieving your goals. Unfortunately, you might be swept up in someone else's battle or find yourself torn between sticking to your plan and running off to join the circus. Don't succumb to unnecessary distractions; taking a well-considered path to freedom could be enough to provide you with the excitement promised by wild Uranus."
aquarius,2016-10-15,"Unexpected events require you to refocus your energy today and take the reins, even if everything seems out of control. This paradoxical mix of energy stems from the Sun's opposition to unstable Uranus in your 3rd House of Immediate Environment, tempting you to cut loose and follow your every whim. Resist turning your world upside down in an impulsive attempt to alleviate boredom. The quicker you can learn from your mistakes now, the easier it will be to move on."
pisces,2016-10-15,"A sudden change in your financial condition might originate from an unplanned expenditure today. Whether you're required to repair something that is no longer working or considering a major purchase, the need to make a decision could come out of the blue. In either case, avoid overreacting while the Sun opposes uncontainable Uranus in your 2nd House of Self-Worth. Your perceptions are sharp and your analysis of the situation is accurate. Nevertheless, waiting a day or two before taking action will better your position in the long run."
aries,2016-10-16,"Relationship insecurity could sap your vitality today as you exert your need for independence. The feelings of a significant other can be a major source of concern as the Full Moon in your impulsive sign opposes the Sun in your 7th House of Partnerships. Hopefully, you've already made significant decisions that are positively affecting your personal life. Now it's time to take things to the next level. If you're bogged down in an emotional funk, shift your thinking. If you can't change the situation, change your attitude."
taurus,2016-10-16,"You may be more tempted to flee than to fight when the spontaneous Aries Full Moon lights up your 12th House of Escapism. However, it's far healthier to lead than to follow when it comes to conflict resolution. Ultimately, the message is simple: stay conscious of the impact of your actions before making your move.  Maintaining your cool in the midst of a struggle that threatens your long-term plans is the best way to stay on track. Keep in mind the quickest route is not necessarily a straight line."
gemini,2016-10-16,"You're inclined to take a risk before considering all the ramifications of your current actions, leading to an unscheduled lesson in instant karma if you extend too far. You're eager to take charge of your life as the incorrigible Aries Full Moon highlights your 11th House of Long-Term Goals, pushing you forward whether you're fully prepared or not. However, you could lose your sense of direction if you move too quickly. You know you're on the right path when you become uninterested in looking back."
cancer,2016-10-16,"Unexpected changes in your daily routine are best met with short-term solutions now. Try not to overreact if your status at home or in the community feels threatened. Take whatever time you need to fully assess a situation that's still in flux. Although the Aries Full Moon brings instability to your 10th House of Career, making your home a more peaceful place creates a firm foundation on which you can build the next phase of your life. When you are unable to find tranquility within, it's useless to seek it elsewhere."
leo,2016-10-16,"Complications at work and at home won't likely be simplified until you reveal your new personal vision for the future. Nevertheless, you must handle any misunderstandings that arise before you can take complete advantage of the fearless energy of the Aries Full Moon that shines in your 9th House of Big Ideas. As hard as it is to be aware of the potential in every difficult situation, your positive thinking carries more influence than you realize. What consumes your mind, controls your life."
virgo,2016-10-16,"Intense discussions with a business or personal partner tend to gravitate toward financial topics today. A heated debate may reopen old wounds and, hopefully, release their toxic effects once and for all. A reassessment of jointly held property may be required as the Aries Full Moon rattles your 8th House of Shared Resources. An unstable relationship might be pushed right to the edge, yet you can seal the deal at the very last minute if you consciously express your willingness to take things in a new direction. Open your mind before your mouth."
libra,2016-10-16,"Although it might seem as if you're standing still, the powerful tides are actually changing directions. The enterprising Aries Full Moon energizes your 7th House of Partners, revealing an entirely new path that you can take into your future. Unfortunately, it's not yet clear where the current circumstances are leading. Nevertheless, your negotiating skills are being called into action as you attempt to settle an old score. It's time to bring relationship issues to the front burner while you are motivated by a commitment to your own agenda. Self-sacrifice is often much easier than self-realization."
scorpio,2016-10-16,"You may be highly sensitive to invisible forces as conversations deepen, sending your thoughts inward to unravel the mystery of relationships. A clear sense of your identity is your foundation for learning what you need from others. However, a crisis in awareness is in the making when the pioneering Aries Full Moon occurs in your 6th House of Health and Habits, revealing lifestyle choices that need to be adjusted. Retreating from the world for a while can provide you with the objectivity necessary to recognize your strengths and weaknesses. Self-reflection is the school of wisdom."
sagittarius,2016-10-16,"Participating in new forms of merriment and self-expression is exhilarating as long as you don't upset your friends and colleagues by ignoring their immediate concerns. The spontaneous Aries Full Moon brightens your 5th House of Love and Play, tempting you to leap before you look. If your restlessness makes you too impatient to get along with others, work independently until the dust settles. The more you love your decisions, the less you need others to love them too."
capricorn,2016-10-16,"Wild ideas and chaotic communication continue to spike your nervous system, leaving you so wired that it's impossible to relax. A squabble with a relative is possible as the combative Aries Full Moon lands in your 4th House of Home and Family. Thankfully, a quantum leap in awareness can clear the decks of outmoded dreams, making way for exciting new ones. The potential shakeup of long-term plans casts your career path in a different light. Nevertheless, don't make a choice just yet; there are still a few surprises ahead that could redirect your trajectory."
aquarius,2016-10-16,"It may be wise to stick to your position today, but you can inadvertently put everything at risk if you attempt to take advantage of someone else's weakness. Holding your ground requires diligence now that the Aries Full Moon destabilizes your 3rd House of Communication. But don't raise the stakes on the game by turning an inconsequential skirmish into an unpleasant confrontation. Wayne Dyer wrote, ""How people treat you is their karma; how you react is yours."""
pisces,2016-10-16,"Trouble surfaces when a stark contrast between your priorities and those of someone you trust is brought to light. Money matters could come to a head when the reactive Aries Full Moon illuminates your 2nd House of Income. If you recently rushed into a financial commitment, it may be cheaper to back out now than to push your luck further. Economic independence is an admirable goal yet this lunation's opposition to the Sun in your 8th House of Shared Resources suggests you shouldn't try to go it alone. Competition makes you faster; collaboration makes you better."
aries,2016-10-17,"Although you seek stability today, you may discover that you're standing on shifting sands. You might believe what you hear until you realize something is amiss. It seems as if reality is slipping out of your grasp and you'll try anything to get to the truth. Even if you're enjoying the perspective of having your head in the clouds, it's still a smart strategy to balance your dreams with a healthy dose of pragmatism."
taurus,2016-10-17,"Relationships are not simply about getting your needs met now; they are about the profound impact that you have on others and how you are, in turn, affected by their stories. However, you must be careful about making incorrect assumptions based upon your interpretation of what they tell you today. The Moon's current visit to your no-nonsense sign is a blessing that enables you to untangle your achievable goals from the distractions of your fantasies. The distance between your dreams and reality is called action."
gemini,2016-10-17,"Maintaining consistency in your actions isn't easy today as you vacillate between your need for privacy and your desire for attention. The Moon's visit to your 12th House of Privacy reveals the value of escaping from people and responsibilities so you can recharge your batteries. Nevertheless, you are also motivated to creatively reveal what's in your heart and you naturally want others to acknowledge what you express. Fortunately, you are quite skilled in shifting mental gears between these two approaches."
cancer,2016-10-17,"You are in tune with your network of associates today and are blessed to receive their ongoing support. Fortunately, your sensitivity to your colleagues' talents makes you a respected teammate. However, your lack of boundaries could drain your energy if you don't pay attention to your limits. Believing in others who don't live up to their promises can cost you precious resources, so don't make any commitments without further research. If you remain realistic, success could be within easy reach."
leo,2016-10-17,"Solid information is coming your way today, requiring you to assimilate what you learn into your current beliefs. Although you try to discern the most important facts, a foggy Sun-Neptune connection can lead you to overlook significant details or ignore sound advice. No matter how far you wander off track, remember to adjust your course on a regular basis so you don't go too far out of bounds. Nevertheless, remember that dreams become reality when you put your heart and soul to it."
virgo,2016-10-17,"You are safe to go ahead with your plans today because even your most outrageous ideas are likely grounded in reality. However, your friends may confuse you with their perspectives because they take your good ideas and blow them out of proportion. If you listen to others now, you may become so confused that you lose track of your own priorities. Trying to force an answer to an unclear question will only make matters worse, so let the energy settle back down on its own before you make any commitments you can't take back."
libra,2016-10-17,"You may be confused by coworkers who complicate your life today when the Libra Sun misaligns with irrational Neptune in your 6th House of Employment. Inspiring connections are wonderful as long as you realize that what you're hearing may be pipe dreams. Nevertheless, you aren't likely to be deceived because your reality filter is strong enough now to compensate for any mixed messages you receive. Be ruthless when eliminating bad ideas, but hold onto those that have even a hint of potential; maybe one of them will make the difference that could change your life."
scorpio,2016-10-17,"Your logically sound disclosure could be entirely misconstrued today as illusory Neptune distracts others from your true message. You may jump through hoops in order to get people to understand what you're saying, but your efforts may be for naught. However, the upside of your current journey is that it helps you organize information in ways that could make an impossible dream come true. Remember, your truth doesn't have to be describable to have personal meaning for you. The best answers lie within and can't always be put into words."
sagittarius,2016-10-17,"Your visions of a better tomorrow exacerbate your natural tendency to overlook the details. Your spirit soars when dreamy Neptune connects with the radiant Sun in your 11th House of Long-Term Goals. However, you could lose sight of practical considerations in a fog of fantasies that leads to a costly decision, possibly even making you look foolish. Enjoying delicious moments of escape is delightful as long as you don't build your entire future on them. Luckily, the no-nonsense Taurus Moon enables you to cut through the veils of illusion, enabling you to see the simple facts."
capricorn,2016-10-17,"You want to believe that you're the master of your own destiny and able to delay gratification in order to accomplish your goals. But you worry about deviating from the facts when a whimsical Sun-Neptune configuration warps your sense of proportion. It's true that making important decisions is tricky today because your sense of reality is bent out of shape by your creative dreams. Nevertheless, it's still wise to give your inner child permission to play without fear or guilt. The emotional territory you explore now could change your life for the better."
aquarius,2016-10-17,"Your horizons grow wider today and your professional aspirations lead you further than before. Starry-eyed Neptune's awkward alignment with the Sun in your 9th House of Higher Truth could have you chasing unicorns, falling for someone's sob story or spreading yourself too thin. It's wiser to let go of those illusions that impede your progress than to hold on to an unreachable dream until you're exhausted. Recognizing the difference between a passing fancy and an enduring passion will help you step back from plans that have little likelihood of fulfillment."
pisces,2016-10-17,"Psychic connections and imaginary conversations can seem so real today that you mistake them for the truth. Although you could get lost in believing a daydream, you are blessed with the skill and the stamina to separate fantasy from reality. Don't try to overcompensate by putting on a false air of authority or making impractical promises. Although you're tempted to brush reason aside now, doubters won't respect your ideas unless you back them up with solid data. As Fran Tarkenton said, ""Ignoring facts does not make them go away."""
aries,2016-10-18,"Your current wanderlust has an uplifting effect on your entire life, offering the possibility of new friendships and even romantic love. Your spirit is more adventurous now, both in emotional and financial matters, as Venus in happy-go-lucky Sagittarius sparks your ignition. However, there may be a darker side to all this lovely news if your enthusiasm encourages you to take on commitments that you can't fulfill. People with good intentions make promises, but people with good character keep them."
taurus,2016-10-18,"You can be quite conservative and determined when you're working to meet your basic needs, especially while the Moon is still in your obstinate sign. However, Luna's shift into adaptable Gemini changes your attitude and lifts your spirit. Your caution is further eroded when Venus sashays into extravagant Sagittarius, encouraging you to spend time, money or energy even when the returns are unclear. Although  you're willing to speculate now, remember that big goals require careful planning. Keep your eye on the details and build a foundation solid enough to support your dreams."
gemini,2016-10-18,"A weight has been lifted from your shoulders and you're eager to channel your newly discovered exuberance into a relationship as flirtatious Venus surfs into your 7th House of Others. Nevertheless, you know that hard choices still need to be made if you're to succeed in the Department of Love. Thankfully, the planet of pleasure becomes a major player in your world now, helping you attract people who open your heart as well as your mind. Life is short; do what makes you happy."
cancer,2016-10-18,"Emotional satisfaction is tangible now and your love light radiates even brighter as you gaze toward the future. Your energies shift and the clouds dissipate as the Sun leaves the dark waters of Scorpio and heads for the adventurous lands and blue skies of Sagittarius. Reconnecting with your inner child rekindles a sense of spontaneity and joy. Author Tom Robbins wrote, ""It's never too late to have a happy childhood."""
leo,2016-10-18,"Although people may arrive bearing gifts today, their offerings are in the form of opportunities, not packages. However, you must pay close attention or you could miss a wonderful chance to improve the quality of your life. Nevertheless, it's your heartfelt experiences that put you in closer touch with your dreams now. Sweet Venus dances into your 5th House of Romance and Creativity, boosting your hope and raising your spirits. Do whatever you can to reestablish your connection with the playful and flirtatious side of your personality. Resistance is unnecessary; just say yes."
virgo,2016-10-18,"Settling into the comforts of family activities brings you great pleasure today, counterbalancing your current busyness at work. Sweet Venus takes up residence in farseeing Sagittarius and your 4th House of Domestic Conditions, sweetening your experiences at home by helping you look beyond the current limitations and visualize a more rewarding future. You're no longer constrained by the old list of rules. Believing is seeing."
libra,2016-10-18,"Your psychic antenna is readjusting to the changing cosmic landscape as you tune into new interests today. Friendly Venus slips into your 3rd House of Immediate Environment, amplifying your curiosity in people, places and things. Your dreams can motivate you to reach too far, but don't be too hard on yourself if you fall short of your lofty expectations. Although you want more than reality is offering now, your lesson is about finding satisfaction right where you are. Author Mandy Hale writes, ""The key to happiness is letting each situation be what it is instead of what you think it should be."""
scorpio,2016-10-18,"A fresh round of optimism helps you cast aside doubts, inspiring you to dream about bigger rewards ahead. It makes sense to pay more attention to your finances while enriching Venus visits your 2nd House of Resources. Luckily, you can garner recognition that pumps up your self-esteem and reinvigorates the flow of moneymaking ideas. Your earning potential is integrally connected to the faith you have in yourself and the passion you feel for your work. Pleasure and profit make an ideal mix now because cash will come more easily when you're having a good time."
sagittarius,2016-10-18,"Satisfaction might be within reach today but you must take the initiative before receiving the fruits of your labor. Happily, beautiful Venus waltzes into your sign, inviting you to open the curtains wide and let the world in on your secret. Exhilaration replaces fear when you're not withholding your true emotions. When you feel good, everyone around you will benefit from the joy you  exude. No doubt, laughter is the best medicine, no matter what ails you."
capricorn,2016-10-18,"You might want to treat this workday as an occasion to play. Your mind is set on less professional goals now because vivacious Venus enters cavalier Sagittarius, lighting up your heart with sweet thoughts. Nevertheless, you appear quite serious on the surface, confusing others as they misread your intentions. Although you might not reveal your desire for affection, attending to your own needs is a high priority. As Maharishi Mahesh Yogi said, ""Be happy, healthy, and let all that love flow through your heart."""
aquarius,2016-10-18,"Your professional ambitions are not as captivating now that magnetic Venus floats into adventurous Sagittarius and your 11th House of Networking. Instead of striving to climb the ladder of success, you want to participate in group-oriented activities. You could be the life of the party as you're drawn into social situations where you can have fun instead of just furthering your career. Be open to the appreciation you receive from your peers. It's perfectly acceptable to seek companionship among like-minded individuals, since you can enjoy yourself now without worrying about emotional complications."
pisces,2016-10-18,"The pleasure of pursuit takes center stage as your search for memorable experiences becomes as important as their discovery. But persuasive Venus moves into freedom-loving Sagittarius and your 10th House of Public Status, sending you on a wild goose chase if you set your sites too high. Your artistic abilities and people skills garner new respect that increases your sense of self-worth, making you even more popular. A grateful heart is a magnet for miracles."
aries,2016-10-19,"Putting your words into action can't be delayed any longer. Talk is cheap, but it won't solve any problems now as you try to get ahead at work. You might even feel as if your survival is at stake when combative Mars joins ruthless Pluto in your 10th House of Career. Your coworkers may mistakenly believe your urgent need to win means they must lose, fueling a struggle for dominance. Fortunately, you can prevent conflict by building your success on shared power rather than force."
taurus,2016-10-19,"You could surprise yourself with the intensity of your feelings today if someone questions your goals or your motivation. An impassioned conjunction of contentious Mars and Pluto may provoke unexpectedly strong reactions. What is a game to you can seem like mortal combat to others, so choose your playmates carefully. Good judgment about the company you keep makes it safe to be sassy without inviting negative consequences."
gemini,2016-10-19,"Enthusiasm turns sour today if you give your emotions too much power. Your passion rises to a crescendo now that ardent Mars runs into powerful Pluto in your 8th House of Deep Sharing. Nevertheless, hold your temper if someone steps out of line to oppose you. You can't win this battle by fighting fire with fire. Nevertheless, a well-thought-out strategy enables you to apply analytical thinking in a calm and constructive manner rather than acting as if you're maneuvered into a corner with no option but striking back."
cancer,2016-10-19,"Tough talking escalates into an open disagreement today, especially if an ambitious person challenges your progress. You may be particularly opinionated now, prompting you to take initiative in a relationship or attracting aggressive people if you say nothing at all. Either way, militant Mars and potent Pluto are stirring up a storm in your 7th House of Others, requiring you to stand your ground when dealing with someone who prefers control over quality. Eleanor Roosevelt said, ""Courage is more exhilarating than fear, and in the long run, it is easier."""
leo,2016-10-19,"There is no need to panic today if your plans start to unravel. It's tempting to roar like a Lion but a show of power won't necessarily help to keep your life in order. You might be so convinced you're doing the right thing that you overcompensate, only to make matters worse. Whether you're trying to improve your lifestyle or make progress on a project at work, you're stepping into unfamiliar territory that could feel like quicksand. Don't struggle; graciously back down and remove yourself from the situation instead of fighting to the finish."
virgo,2016-10-19,"Your words are so sharp today that you could inadvertently hurt someone you meant to help. Nevertheless, your practical analysis of the situation enables you to see through most misunderstandings and deceptions as you cut to the chase. But apply a dash of diplomacy when making your case because some people may be more sensitive than you realize. If you encounter irrational resistance, postponing a discussion until common sense returns will work to your advantage. Don't push the river; it flows by itself."
libra,2016-10-19,"Uneasy dynamics on the home front strengthen your convictions and intensify conflicts with family members. In fact, you may think you've been thrown into a transformational cauldron of alchemical change, which can rock the foundations of your emotional world. Unfortunately, some of your current discomfort is likely tied to nearly forgotten memories from your past. You might not enjoy being so embroiled in a melodrama, but you're able to recover buried treasures if you stick with the process. As Winston Churchill quipped, ""If you are going through hell, keep going."""
scorpio,2016-10-19,"People appear to be on edge today and their extreme reactions seem out of proportion with the current circumstances. Paradoxically, someone's anger or resentment might be aimed in your direction if you attempt to bottle up your emotions. A volatile Mars-Pluto conjunction destabilizes your 3rd House of Communication, possibly generating a perfect storm of reactive passions. Nevertheless, channeling your fierce energy into a constructive outlet enables you to be incredibly productive without any collateral damage."
sagittarius,2016-10-19,"You are a person on a mission today, eager to do whatever is necessary to reach your goals. Your stamina is a godsend as assertive Mars joins unstoppable Pluto to push you forward. Unfortunately, you could overreact if you think your success is being threatened in any way. The crisis may be real but you can transform a stressful situation into a beneficial one as long as you don't try to take on the entire world. Music executive Allen Klein said, ""A little perspective, like a little humor, goes a long way."""
capricorn,2016-10-19,"You might have to face your fears today if you encounter people who push your buttons. On the other hand, you could accidentally upset someone else if you let your feelings of discontent or mistrust slip out. Nevertheless, this is an opportunity to recognize what you need to do to find satisfaction. Letting go of an attitude that impedes your success may be necessary now; the bigger your goals, the more patient and persistent you must be in your pursuit. Simmer your best ideas on the back burner while you handle the most immediate tasks in front of you."
aquarius,2016-10-19,"You try every possible option just to sidestep a difficult conversation, but your avoidance has already likely contributed to the current drama. You're probably not very happy about running into an emotionally intense person today as cranky Mars hooks up with passionate Pluto in your 12th House of Destiny. Nevertheless, taking responsibility for your role in the conflict minimizes the discomfort all the way around. If you're willing to confront the truth prior to letting go of your past, you'll end up making room for a more positive relationship in your future."
pisces,2016-10-19,"Intense conversations with colleagues and friends may delve into psychologically profound territory today. Memories of old emotional conflicts raise unnecessary fears that fuel a disagreement. Unfortunately, you might turn your feelings into anger in order to defend your position even if you're not being attacked. It's only worth the energy to argue if you are moving through new ground instead of picking at familiar old wounds. Demonstrate your strength of will now instead of downplaying your authority to placate someone else. Wisdom is knowing the right path to take; integrity is taking it."
aries,2016-10-20,"Maintaining your composure is no easy feat today because someone is getting under your skin. Everything seems to be in a state of change and you don't want to miss your chance to make your two cents known when it comes to your needs. Something you previously overlooked can explode into awareness now, freeing you from previous illusions and thrusting you into a new relationship dynamic. Instead of succumbing to fear and striking out, use the diplomatic Libra Mercury to establish common ground where once there was none."
taurus,2016-10-20,"Your highly charged nervous system puts you on red alert today as work-related stress shakes your confidence. However, you might also become overly defensive to comments or criticism that could be more helpful than hurtful. Mental Mercury's opposition to weird Uranus inspires strange ideas and provokes disturbing conversations but you can create the stability you seek by turning your attention toward more spiritual thoughts. Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""Nothing can bring you peace but yourself."""
gemini,2016-10-20,"The more you talk today, the more complicated everything becomes while verbose Mercury in your 5th House of Self-Expression opposes erratic Uranus. Your thoughts are spinning so fast that you might believe you can dance circles around everyone else. However, your brain is already working at its maximum and it feels as if one additional interruption could send you over the edge. Instead of trying to win a debate, stop arguing and start cooperating. It's amazing how much you will accomplish when you're not wasting time and energy participating in unnecessary drama."
cancer,2016-10-20,"Impatience may prompt you to overplay your hand today. Flying by the seat of your pants isn't your normal style, but your charm and diplomacy could overcome any resistance to your creative ideas and romantic desires now. Temporarily saying goodbye to logic enables you to charge conversations with your contagious excitement as the electric Mercury-Uranus opposition drives you to discover answers in unconventional ways and unexpected places. Russian author Boris Pasternak wrote, ""Surprise is the greatest gift which life can grant us."""
leo,2016-10-20,"You're eager for change now that you are incorporating new ideas into your life as suddenly as they appear. Unfortunately, you're so quick to respond to everything that it's impossible to know exactly what to think while analytical Mercury opposes independent Uranus. Your mind is racing so fast today that you can't even keep up with yourself. You may be a tad defensive or jumpy in your reactions because of the electric tension in the air. Thankfully, you can use the cosmic instability to your advantage by taking a calculated risk. If you win, you'll be happy; if you lose, you'll be wise."
virgo,2016-10-20,"A moment of clarity reveals so many new options today that you need to take time to write down your thoughts before they fade. Your ingenious ideas are unconstrained by reason while quicksilver Mercury opposes electric Uranus. But you still may feel isolated or undeserving of love, dampening your excitement about the future. Nevertheless, it's crucial to look beyond the petty differences in a relationship and only focus on what matters the most now. Otherwise, unexpected conflicts might turn the smallest disagreements into major meltdowns. Embrace diversity or be left behind."
libra,2016-10-20,"Nervous tensions may reach a crescendo today, requiring you to balance logic and intuition. Thankfully, one of your greatest attributes is your ability to be fair and you will need all the objectivity you can muster for what's ahead. Whether or not your diplomacy is successful, you believe you have the skills to navigate through anything life sets in your path. But this is no time to follow conventional patterns because the freedom to come and go as you wish is a high priority. Rajneesh said, ""To live in relationship and yet remain independent, that is what courage is."""
scorpio,2016-10-20,"A private conversation can give you a fresh outlook on politics at work. If you're worried about taking the wrong side in a developing drama, you might seek the advice of someone you trust. However, you really don't appreciate it when others try to tell you right from wrong. Listening to your heart while also tending to your responsibilities gives you a better handle on the current situation. A change in your perspective can turn an ordeal into an adventure."
sagittarius,2016-10-20,"Distractions seem to keep you from important obligations today, yet your openness to new experiences strengthens your spirit and improves your chances for success. However, you may be confronted with a friend's shocking revelation. You could end up in hot water by speaking too quickly since witty Mercury opposes unruly Uranus. Clever repartee can help you smoothly sidestep an overdue discussion for now, but evasive tactics will not work for long. Demonstrate your courage by starting a conversation that truly matters."
capricorn,2016-10-20,"Although there may be clear sailing at work, friends or relatives still could question your tactics while destabilizing Uranus opposes curious Mercury in your 10th House of Career. Luckily, three planets in fair-minded Libra allow you to see each situation from everyone's point of view. Nevertheless, the current lack of support dampens your spirits. Approach each task with a beginner's mind, even if you have plenty of experience and are confident about your skills. Your performance will continue to improve, enabling you to do your job better in less time and with less effort."
aquarius,2016-10-20,"Your unconventional thinking can shake the foundations upon which you build solid relationships. Wild Uranus releases extraordinary amounts of energy rather suddenly, especially when emotions have been buried in order to maintain the peace. Critical Mercury's volatile opposition to Uranus sets the stage for a torrent of words to spill forth with pent-up intensity. Your ideas may be so far ahead of the times that you must clearly spell them out or keep them to yourself to avoid confusion. It's been said that simplicity is the ultimate form of sophistication."
pisces,2016-10-20,"You may be sitting on the edge of your seat today, anxious to add your opinion to almost any discussion. Mercury's tense opposition to unpredictable Uranus can test your patience with a friend who seems to be stuck in his or her own position. But instead of taking the bait, several planets in diplomatic Libra encourage you to wage peace whenever possible. Even if an unexpected twist leads a conversation awry, staying cool, calm and collected while under pressure earns respect from those who mean the most to you."
aries,2016-10-21,"Responsibilities weigh heavily on your shoulders today, but there's a part of you that doesn't really care. You want to do what you Rams do best: speed up and plow through the obstructions without looking back. You believe the way out of your current frustration is to break through the bonds of doubt with sheer force. But some blockages don't respond to a full frontal assault. Instead, slow down long enough to listen to those who have your best interests at heart. Following useful advice could prove to be more beneficial in the long run than you think."
taurus,2016-10-21,"It might feel as if someone is raining on your parade today as a burst of creativity runs into the wall of reality. Colorful ideas and images may fill your mind, whether or not they are practical. However, a tenacious Sun-Saturn struggle puts the halt to your fantasies, allowing only the most pragmatic concepts to survive. Make certain to give new ideas enough time to germinate before relegating them to the trash bin. Confucius warns that ""everything has its beauty but not everyone can see it."""
gemini,2016-10-21,"Negotiations about what you are willing to give for what you want in return are likely to be productive today. The Sun's aspect to serious Saturn in your 7th House of Relationships is a signal to be clear about what you expect to accomplish with others. It might not feel romantic or generous to be so definitive about your needs now, but building a solid foundation ensures the development of trust in the long run. Honesty is the highest form of intimacy."
cancer,2016-10-21,"You may be upset if an authority figure reads you the riot act today for no apparent reason. However, you might be missing a real opportunity if you take criticism personally now. Although you could be rather thin-skinned while the Moon is visiting your emotionally sensitive sign, don't force a showdown until you discuss the matter with people you can trust. There's no reason to let your tender feelings run away with your day. Words of wisdom that inspire a healthy sense of self-restraint are worth their weight in gold."
leo,2016-10-21,"Braking for speed bumps isn't the easiest thing to do when you have your destination in sight and time is running out. However, you may have little choice today when the willful Sun crosses paths with karmic Saturn in your 5th House of Self-Expression, testing your patience. The obstacles that appear now are probably symptoms of sloppy work or shortcuts that didn't pan out as expected. Heed the warnings and overcome any self-perpetuated resistance to your success with discipline and diligence."
virgo,2016-10-21,"Stop to take a long hard look at your real motives for accomplishing a specific task today. A harsh Sun-Saturn connection might have you thinking that someone is furtively working against you. However, diffusive Neptune rattles rational Mercury, making you miss the mark when explaining your intentions. Quietly retreat, regain your footing and try again in a few days when clarity returns. Thomas Carlyle wrote, ""The greatest of faults is to be conscious of none."""
libra,2016-10-21,"You may overreact to some adversity today that probably isn't as difficult as it seems. In any event, your strength is tested as the Sun shines its light in your sign only to be blocked by stern Saturn in your 3rd House of Communication. A minor setback at work might reinforce your fear of failure or, at least, challenge your self-confidence. Instead of focusing on this as a personal defeat, take it as a cosmic assignment. Without some stress now and then, there is little gain."
scorpio,2016-10-21,"Your creative urges are stifled by someone's lack of support today, but it may be your own fears that prevent you from moving mountains. There is a deeper lesson to learn if you find yourself involved in a struggle with others. The real work now is internal because overcoming self-doubt is ultimately your greatest challenge. Fortunately, you can reaffirm your resolve to continue forward by remembering previous accomplishments. Poet Khalil Gibran wrote, ""And God said, 'Love your enemy.' So I obeyed him and loved myself."""
sagittarius,2016-10-21,"If your persistent efforts have led to pleasure, recent successes could be replaced with perplexity today. The Sun's stressful alignment with austere Saturn is a constrictive influence that can tangle you up in knots. If you are encountering difficulties when expressing yourself, your aggravation may force you to clarify your intentions and commit to a new set of goals. Although you might feel the need to alter your current direction, don't be in a hurry to make a critical decision. Give your thinking a chance to stabilize before finalizing your course of action."
capricorn,2016-10-21,"You may believe invisible forces are conspiring against you today, but you can't find the source of the negativity. Nevertheless, someone is likely impeding your progress and making unreasonable demands upon you. You might want to give up, but quitting is not advisable now. The good news is that this frustrating Saturn transit is short-lived. Drastic changes are not required in this moment, only the passage of time. Saint Frances de Sales wrote, ""Have patience with all things, but first of all with yourself."""
aquarius,2016-10-21,"It might seem as if someone is purposefully complicating your life now, but the truth is the trouble may originate within you. Don't be like Don Quixote and fight with windmills when the solution is more readily found by modifying your own behavior. Paradoxically, you could be unconsciously creating difficult predicaments so you can prove to yourself and others you're capable of putting in a solid performance when overcoming obstacles. A head full of fears has no space for dreams."
pisces,2016-10-21,"An odd mix of serious work and serious foolishness can make for a strange day. No matter how much you try to concentrate on your job, your thoughts keep drifting in and out of fantasy while mischievous Mercury crosses paths with dreamy Neptune. However, Saturn the Taskmaster still demands concrete results. Don't take the easy way out today; show the world your determination by valiantly handling your current responsibilities as best you can. No one questions the creativity of your imagination, but character counts now more than anything else."
aries,2016-10-22,"It seems as if time is running out, prompting you to make a last-minute effort to reveal your thoughts now. Unfortunately, your message might expose your inner turmoil as you worry about how much to bring out into the open. Instead of wasting energy in logical analysis, just speak from your heart today. Even if your words create confusion, they catalyze a transformational process that will continue over the next few days. Don't worry about your destination yet; just take the first few steps and figure out the rest along the way."
taurus,2016-10-22,"Someone might drive you up the wall today because you want closure on a relationship issue and your friend or partner remains indecisive. You could try everything in your bag of tricks to elicit a real commitment, but gentle prodding, logical debate and even your emotional appeal seem to fail. It's as if others discovered that their evasive tactics actually weaken your authority now. Thankfully, your patience pays off later in the day when the Sun and the Moon both shift into fixed signs, solidifying everyone's positions. Good things come to those who wait."
gemini,2016-10-22,"Waking up on the wrong side of the bed today could be enough to start your day on the wrong foot. You want to tell others how you feel but you're not interested in stirring up any trouble. Nevertheless, you can only keep quiet for so long. Naturally, your message is important but so is your delivery. It will be easier to put all your cards on the table once the first one is played. But don't wait for someone else to speak up; the window of opportunity will close sooner than you expect."
cancer,2016-10-22,"You might feel like a Crab out of water today because your emotions don't seem to fit anywhere you try to put them. However, difficult aspects require you to downplay your needs until the Moon leaves your sign and blasts into lively Leo. Luckily, cosmic help is on the way this afternoon, once the Moon shifts into your 2nd House of Self-Esteem. A wave of confidence empowers you to reveal your feelings without worrying about the consequences. You can't control other people's actions, but you certainly can control your reactions."
leo,2016-10-22,"The longer you hold onto your tension, the harder it is to let it go. Nevertheless, the Moon's move into your extroverted sign today creates a cosmic opportunity to get something off your chest. Keep in mind that your passionate revelation might be more than your friends and family can handle now. Naturally, you want to give your solo performance one hundred and ten percent, but you'll make more of an impact if you scale the drama back just a bit. President Harry S. Truman said, ""Intense feeling too often obscures the truth."""
virgo,2016-10-22,"You wish you could go into hiding today, even if your social calendar draws you out to mix and mingle. Thoughts of solitude lure you away from the maddening crowds and into the confines of your own mind. Ironically, going inward enables you to simultaneously travel outward, all the way to distant galaxies. You may be intrigued with the process of contemplation yet nervous about losing your footing. Joseph Campbell wrote, ""The cave you fear to enter holds the treasure you seek."""
libra,2016-10-22,"You're reaching the end of one chapter and must tie up any loose ends that you don't want to carry into the next. Nevertheless, you may be torn between taking care of your own needs now and nurturing those you love. Resolving this conflict might seem impossible until you experience a critical moment today when everything suddenly becomes clear. Don't hesitate once you see the light; your uncertainty could return if you wait too long to make your move. Action has more value than intention."
scorpio,2016-10-22,"You are standing at the edge of a precipice with your future opening before you. You intuitively know that yesterday's fantasies will become tomorrow's reality, amplifying your anticipation along with your fears of failure. But this is no time for your faith to waver because your current thoughts are the most powerful influence on whatever happens next. Author Miasha writes, ""Don't dream your life, live your dreams."""
sagittarius,2016-10-22,"Exceeding everyone's expectations can be exhausting at times, but you inadvertently play a significant part in creating your larger-than-life presence. Although you may be ready for some downtime now, it's difficult to convince others that you're serious about slipping out of the spotlight to rejuvenate your soul. You might be temporarily lured back into the fray today, but it's not your responsibility to assume the role of social director. Novelist May Sarton penned, ""Solitude is the salt of personhood. It brings out the authentic flavor of every experience."""
capricorn,2016-10-22,"People seem overly clingy today, prompting you to distance yourself from them. It's not that you're insensitive to their needs; rather you're afraid of being pulled into someone's personal drama that's so deep you can't climb out. Establishing your boundaries feels like a necessary step in helping anyone else now but it can also create an unnecessary gulf between you and those you love. Nevertheless, you are not required to set yourself on fire to keep others warm."
aquarius,2016-10-22,"Quietly go about your business on your own today, instead of spending too much time worrying about what others think. Participating in a group activity is often exhilarating because so much can be accomplished when people work together for a common cause. Nevertheless, you're more effective now running errands and crossing items off your to-do list without coordinating your efforts with anyone else. Sometimes, those who fly solo have the strongest wings."
pisces,2016-10-22,"You know what your happiness depends on, but believe you shouldn't have to tell anyone today. Those who love you should know what you need without you saying a word. Unfortunately, harboring romantic illusions based on self-imposed silence doesn't lead to satisfaction. There's no reason to set yourself up for failure by refusing to communicate. Take Oprah Winfrey's words to heart: ""You get in life what you have the courage to ask for."""
aries,2016-10-23,The extroverted side of your personality takes over today while the Moon is traveling through animated Leo. But the Sun's shift into secretive Scorpio and your 8th House of Intimacy reminds you to temper your spontaneity with empathy for others. Teaming up with the right people will add power and passion into your life. Acknowledging their gifts and respecting their limits create lasting and rewarding relationships. Enrich your life by expanding your community.
taurus,2016-10-23,"Although you strive for objectivity in communication, you can't deny your strong feelings about someone. You're able to see both sides of an issue, but the Sun's visit to possessive Scorpio and your 7th House of Others signals a deepening passion for partnerships that is anything but rational. Unfortunately, this inconsistency is not ideal for making decisions, especially since your intuition could be off target now. Will Rogers said, ""Good judgment comes from experience and a lot of that comes from bad judgment."""
gemini,2016-10-23,"The temptation to micromanage your affairs is compelling today because you want others to see you in the best light when it comes to fulfilling your promises. Fortunately, you are busy focusing on the details now that the Sun is moving through penetrating Scorpio and your 6th House of Self-Improvement. There isn't much room in your life for fun and games now, so take care of what's on your plate and stick to your daily routine. Your priorities are your character."
cancer,2016-10-23,"Barriers to obtaining what you desire start to crumble, encouraging you to be more direct when expressing your needs. Happily, the Sun's radiance enlivens your 5th House of Self-Expression while it's moving through magnetic Scorpio. Although you are more open to deeper emotional and physical interactions today, attempting to please everyone is a mistake. Direct your creative skills outward where they will have the greatest impact. Poet Maya Angelou wrote, ""Try to be a rainbow in someone's cloud."""
leo,2016-10-23,"Lending your emotional support to a friend or relative today can have a positive influence on a difficult situation. You are exceptionally empathic while the receptive Moon is traveling through your sign. Additionally, the Sun's shift into passionate Scorpio and your 4th House of Emotional Security shines the spotlight on personal responsibilities. Taking the time to strengthen your family relationships and fulfill your domestic obligations enables you to build an enduring foundation for the future. A person never stands so tall as when they lean down to help one in need."
virgo,2016-10-23,"Your imagination may be favored over common sense today as conversations wander aimlessly into Fantasyland. You're attuned to the slightest ripples of negativity while the Moon hangs out in your 12th House of Spiritual Mystery. Your heightened sensitivity invites emotional intimacy while also encouraging you to overreact to casual comments. The extreme Scorpio Sun takes your thinking to another level as it plunges into your 3rd House of Communication. Everyone is deep, but most people are afraid to dive."
libra,2016-10-23,"There is little room for self-doubt in your life now, so put your unwavering faith into making your dreams come true. Moneymaking opportunities are on the rise while the Sun is warming Scorpio's emotional waters and illuminating your 2nd House of Finances. Thankfully, a weight has been lifted from your shoulders, but rather than celebrating, employ your newfound sense of freedom to build the future you want. Although there is so much in flux, pick something to focus on and make a stand. Be who you want to be, not what others want to see."
scorpio,2016-10-23,"The Force is with you now as the blindfold is removed from your eyes and your destination is in plain sight. Confusion fades, whether the news is good or not, allowing you to choose which path to take next. The brilliant radiance of the Sun is shining in your sign, motivating you to act with greater confidence. Thankfully, your optimism is tempered with a vulnerability that enables you to accept help when it is offered. Letting down your guard allows more love and light to flow into your life."
sagittarius,2016-10-23,"You want to establish your personal space today as you retreat from group activities to reconnect with your faith and idealism. You're highly inspired to continue working for positive change in your life and in the world. Although a community of friends and colleagues urge you to pursue your dreams, something has changed now that the Sun in mysterious Scorpio has begun its month-long stay in your 12th House of Secrets. Your grand sense of camaraderie is diminished by an immediate need for privacy and the time to sort through issues you prefer to keep confidential. Wisdom comes from reflection."
capricorn,2016-10-23,"Collaborating with others today makes it feasible to transform entire organizations, resurrect a discarded project or produce events that strengthen your community. The Sun's entry into relentless Scorpio and your 11th House of Social Networking feeds your ambition as you tap into the resources all around you. Nevertheless, a competitive Mercury-Saturn alignment may create friction as you struggle for control. Even if you feel uncomfortable expressing your opinion, tensions will subside once everyone knows the score. In union there is strength."
aquarius,2016-10-23,"Endless analysis gives way to clear decisions, prompting you to walk your talk without further concern about an overall strategy. In fact, it's your integrity and not your plan that is your primary strength now. The Sun's shift into powerful Scorpio and your 10th House of Career is a sign that it's time to think less about your personal needs and more about your professional life. A battle with internal demons may be necessary to maintain a healthy perspective today. Dig in your heels and concentrate on long-term change rather than immediate gratification."
pisces,2016-10-23,"You may be inflexible when it comes to matters of principle now, especially if others are pressuring you to change. The unyielding Scorpio Sun is plowing through your 9th House of Higher Truth, adding conviction to your beliefs and passion to your presentations. Fortunately, an obsessive need to know can motivate you to explore religion, philosophy or politics through study and travel. Educator Ken Robinson says, ""Curiosity is the engine of achievement."""
aries,2016-10-24,"If you've been playing the waiting game in the emotional arena, it could be time to turn your anticipation into action. You're riding high on the energy of the playful Leo Moon in your 5th House of Romance. However, the urgency to free yourself from complicated entanglements standing between you and your happiness might prompt you to overreact. Instead of taking a risk, exercise a small dose of caution so you don't do something you regret. A new kind of love may be within reach, but you still have work to do before it's yours."
taurus,2016-10-24,"You may be excited and uneasy at the same time today, not quite knowing what to do with desires that don't fit your usual patterns. You might have the opportunity to participate in a social event involving eccentric people that stretch your mind. You're not even sure why you're tempted by exotic food, weird music or unconventional art. A sudden attraction to someone who isn't your type or boredom with your current situation can shake your world now. Nevertheless, staying open-minded could turn your day into one you'll never forget."
gemini,2016-10-24,"Your mental intensity takes your conversations to a place you rarely go. However, your unusually penetrating perception could also introduce distrust while Mercury swims in Scorpio's tumultuous waters, turning your mind's eye inward to uncover the root causes of your current dilemma. Unfortunately, a sudden wave of desire doesn't necessarily correspond to your intentions. Allow plenty of time to sort out the differences between what you feel in your gut and what your mind is telling you before making a major move."
cancer,2016-10-24,"On one hand, you yearn for the comfort of being with someone who accepts you as you are. On the other hand, you might sacrifice your true feelings to maintain stability so that those close to you may not even know the real you. Don't be afraid of changing your style and shocking someone with a personal disclosure today. If you are open and honest about your truth, your relationships will develop to reflect your integrity. Discomfort is often the source of growth."
leo,2016-10-24,"Your adrenaline surges today as unfamiliar emotions whisk you into new relationship territory. However, interactive Mercury's presence in mysterious Scorpio and your 4th House of Foundations prompts you to delve deeper into your psychological, spiritual and emotional roots. While you may be fearful of what you don't understand and can't control, you're willing to explore the unknown because you believe stability is waiting on the other side of the fence. Sigmund Freud wrote, ""Out of your vulnerabilities will come your strength."""
virgo,2016-10-24,"Volatile emotional dynamics can set your nerves on edge today. It's more than likely that you will pursue connecting with a free-spirited person or revitalizing the flagging energy in an existing relationship. But you may be more suspicious of others now that curious Mercury is taking up all the oxygen in your 3rd House of Data Collection. Your current hunger for answers could be annoying if you turn it into an interrogation, so ease up on your investigation before you alienate those around you. In the words of Plato, ""You can discover more about a person in an hour of play than in a year of conversation."""
libra,2016-10-24,"A sudden jolt of awareness can be upsetting, but only if you try to hold onto your previous agenda. Plans with a friend or partner may be disrupted today as the sparks fly, highlighting shocking Uranus in your 7th House of Others. Although you are known to step into the role of  peacemaker, you're no pushover now as communicator Mercury sinks into fixed Scorpio. Rather than waiting for something to happen, take control and turn the tables. Be the revolution, declare your independence and let freedom ring."
scorpio,2016-10-24,"Your laser-like mental radar sees through people's charades and hones in on the facts. Your discernment powers are strong now that cerebral Mercury is camping out in your perceptive sign. However, you might erratically jump to an incorrect conclusion even if you have solid information at your disposal. Your desire for excitement is irrepressible today and could influence your behavior. Even if you believe you know the truth, let your emotions settle before you say something you can't take back. Thinking before acting is wisdom but acting before thinking is regret."
sagittarius,2016-10-24,"A sudden change in the emotional landscape can push you to the edge in a relationship now. Your urge to express what's in your heart is so persistent that you might open up to a complete stranger if you have nowhere else to share your secrets. Although impulsive actions could inadvertently create distance with an existing friend or lover, your real goal is to demonstrate your passion for life. Discussing your feelings instead of acting them out leads to solutions rather than problems."
capricorn,2016-10-24,"Anything goes as unusually deep feelings bump up against external resistance today. Nevertheless, you're likely to express your desires no matter how odd they may sound. In fact, remaining open to new forms of pleasure can bring unexpected rewards. Just as easily, your love life could be turned upside down when sweet Venus runs into reactionary Uranus, upsetting your plans or radically altering the direction of a relationship. Honest communication leads to understanding, intimacy and mutual appreciation."
aquarius,2016-10-24,"Very little escapes your incisive thinking now; your perceptions are on point and you are a force to be reckoned with in your interactions with others. Nevertheless, a simple flirtation can heat things up so quickly that you don't take time to logically consider the consequences of your actions. Making decisions in the spur of the moment might feel empowering but may lead your heart into an emotional briar patch. Let your desire for truth override your need for pleasure and your heart will be happier in the long run."
pisces,2016-10-24,"You may act impulsively one moment and freeze with fear the next. Or you might attract people whose behavior is as bewildering to you as yours is to them. Cerebral Mercury enters penetrating Scorpio and your 9th House of Higher Truth, empowering you to go the distance in your thinking. Unfortunately, your good sense could be short-lived as sudden attractions to new people, things or ideas turn into major distractions. Ben Franklin advises, ""If passion drives you, let reason hold the reins."""
aries,2016-10-25,"There's an amazing array of possibilities right at your feet, but your desires overcome your reason today, leaving you dazed and confused. A disillusioning Venus-Neptune square can even throw you into a temporary state of despair as you try to narrow down your choices. But you could be easily fooled in your current idealistic frame of mind. If you choose to make yourself vulnerable to another person, first ensure that he or she is worthy of your trust. Nevertheless, giving others the benefit of the doubt offers you the chance for a true heart-to-heart connection."
taurus,2016-10-25,"The path to happiness is an elusive one today, even if you're convinced that your honorable intentions are enough to make everything turn out OK. However, charming Venus squares fuzzy Neptune from your 8th House of Intimacy, leading you to confuse an unrealistic fantasy with true love. Trust your recent decisions and just keep heading in the same direction, even if you grow discouraged. Don't worry if you feel like you're losing your way; a temporary mist can obscure even the clearest mind. Opportunity is often delivered in a fog of uncertainty."
gemini,2016-10-25,"Your compassion and imagination take the driver's seat today while vulnerable Venus dynamically squares fantasy-prone Neptune. Opening your heart to others is fine as long as your expectations aren't set so high that you end up disappointed. You're more likely to overlook reality now in your pursuit of a dream, seeing people as you wish them to be rather than as they truly are. Nevertheless, surfing an emotional wave adds excitement to your day while employing caution can prevent you from losing your balance and wiping out."
cancer,2016-10-25,"If something seems too good to be true today, it probably is. Thankfully, you're able to retreat from the unrelenting pressure of making choices while indulgent Venus in your 6th House of Daily Routine creates a stressful square with intoxicating Neptune. Although you are so optimistic that you could gloss over the facts now, your fascination with pleasure is so overwhelming that it's difficult to maintain a healthy perspective. Even if you're ready to give a project the green light, delay major decisions for a few days until you have a more realistic outlook."
leo,2016-10-25,"You might convince yourself that nearly anything is real today as long as it's something you want badly enough. However, you're treading on dangerous ground as a romantic Venus-Neptune square paints reality with your imagination, weakens your willpower and distorts your judgment about a person or a purchase. Although you can justify your actions, sacrificing yourself for love or money could end up being much more expensive than you think if you let your desires exceed the limits of logic."
virgo,2016-10-25,"It's all too easy to misread others today, especially if your fantasies distort your perceptions. An imaginative Venus-Neptune square makes it tough to discern the truth, even if the exacting Virgo Moon enables you to isolate individual bits of data. Instead of trusting the vague generalities of your intuition, zoom into the smallest details and build the truth from there. Using your astute powers of concentration can prevent you from believing that all is well when in fact it is not."
libra,2016-10-25,"You long to escape the mundane routine of everyday life and will ignore practical considerations today to justify your dreamy voyage. A magical moment of delight may inspire creative endeavors and romantic pursuits by stimulating your imagination. However, your reasoning could be skewed while a magnetic Venus-Neptune square pulls you off course and leads you down a garden path now. Don't make any promises you can't keep; a sober assessment will convince you to lower your lofty expectations and prepare you for the inevitable return of reality by the end of the month."
scorpio,2016-10-25,"It's as if you've slipped into a hypnotic trance and are compelled to chase a phantasmagorical dream. A misleading Venus-Neptune square prompts you to give in to escapist behavior today. Unfortunately, your plan could backfire when you realize you've fallen down a surreal rabbit hole and you don't know the shortest route back to the surface. Nevertheless, recognizing your limits before you exceed them keeps you from losing your center of gravity, stopping trouble before it even starts."
sagittarius,2016-10-25,"Untangling the threads of illusion from the colorful tapestry of life is a monumental project today because fact and fiction have tied themselves into a lover's knot. A deceptive Venus-Neptune square fuels your dreams while clouding the truth, especially when you project your desires onto someone else. Your infatuation may not be grounded in reality, so enjoy the experience without making any serious commitments. Thankfully, fantasy can help you survive in the mundane world as long as you know when to be real."
capricorn,2016-10-25,"You may overestimate the value of people and objects today, making it wise to spend your love and money with caution now. Illusory Neptune forms a stressful square to accountable Venus in your 12th House of Fantasy, prompting you to merge your dreams with reality. You might be overcome with desire, risking recent gains for the exhilaration of a passing pleasure. If your expectations are too high you will need to rein them in before you make a fool out of yourself. Alexander Pope wrote, ""To err is human; to forgive divine."""
aquarius,2016-10-25,"Balancing your dreams with the tangible needs of others is a complicated puzzle today. Romantic fantasies can be particularly alluring yet disorienting while sweet Venus in your 11th House of Friends forms a confusing square to surreal Neptune. Nevertheless, you're ultra-sensitive to others now and one offhand comment might be enough to trigger your insecurities. Letting go of old fears empowers you to embrace the present moment with confidence."
pisces,2016-10-25,"Concentrating on monotonous work tasks can be quite a challenge when you're so inspired by vivid dreams, beautiful objects and fascinating ideas. Sensual Venus squares glamorous Neptune, activating your imagination while weakening your sense of practicality. Your current attractions may be ill-advised because you could be susceptible to deception now. Imagining all the possibilities of love in your life is healthy unless you make the false assumption that every dream will come true."
aries,2016-10-26,"Although responsibilities continue to pile up at work today, you're still tempted to skip out for a long lunch or a walk in the park. You may dream and scheme about running away even if it's not a smart idea. Thankfully, the closer you get to your planned escape, the more you doubt the wisdom of your move. You don't need to do anything drastic to find pleasure now. Sometimes, just visualizing a serene setting is enough to reduce the pressure. Poet Wallace Stevens wrote, ""Imagination is the power of the mind over the possibilities of things."""
taurus,2016-10-26,"You find it easier to take a positive stance on nearly any question today. However, it would be a mistake for someone to judge you as being overly optimistic. Although you wish there was a silver lining to every cloud, you lean toward a more pragmatic perspective. You can't get away with pie-in-the-sky thinking now; everything must crystallize into reality or you're not interested in spending your time or money on it. Philosopher Albert Camus wrote, ""Life is the sum of all your choices."""
gemini,2016-10-26,"You might take a professional obligation seriously only after kicking and screaming in protest. But whether or not you put on a show to convey your displeasure, you're unlikely to be happy about having to narrowly focus your attention and make specific things happen. Unfortunately, being a grown adult comes with its responsibilities and sacrifices. Stop complaining and get to work. A bad attitude is like a flat tire, you can't go anywhere until you change it."
cancer,2016-10-26,"You don't have to venture very far to find satisfaction today. Although your home and family life rewards you with a strong source of connection to your soul, tentatively stepping out may be the best thing you can do. Nevertheless, it's crucial to stay within your comfort zone now, because it will be harder to relax if you're trying to manage many complicated variables. But going too far too fast can create a backlash that could send you to the nearest couch to take a nap. Mystic Thomas Merton wrote, ""Happiness is not a matter of intensity, but of balance, order, rhythm and harmony."""
leo,2016-10-26,"You can effortlessly turn on the charm now and those around you will fall under your spell. Nevertheless, giving your plan some forethought today enables you to muster support from the very same people who were previously talking behind your back. It's fine to confront an issue directly as long as you don't slip into an interrogator or prosecutor role. Paradoxically, you gain strength by adopting a gentler approach. Sincerity is your secret weapon for success."
virgo,2016-10-26,"You may be more fastidious than anyone else you know, but your willingness to let go of your need for perfection can be the catalyst for a magical day. Instead of wasting hours on the tiniest details, use your judgment skills to decide what is possible today. Naturally, you don't want to sign off on sloppy workmanship, but there is a point-of-no-return when your eye for quality overwhelms common sense. Rein in your desire to be overly critical; everyone will thank you for it in the long run."
libra,2016-10-26,"You can't miss today when it comes to setting your goals. In fact, your charismatic manner captivates the imagination of everyone you encounter and easily enrolls their assistance in your latest project. But you might leave out some of your story when soliciting other people's participation because you want the support of the community. However, one insignificant white lie will, inevitably, lead to others. You don't have to remember anything if you tell the truth from the start."
scorpio,2016-10-26,"You possess the magic keys to the door of prosperity today; all you need to do is open the lock and step through the portal. Making money is simple when you first become involved, however, the work begins once you're on the other side and accept the new opportunity. What appeared to be Easy Street turns out to be No-Free-Lunch Boulevard. Grit your teeth, hunker down and keep your eyes on the prize. Your intention is the most powerful tool at your disposal, so use it with care and precision."
sagittarius,2016-10-26,"Your social life is a source of joy these days, especially if your friends go out of the way to express their love or affection. But something is brewing behind the good news and you feel its presence, whether or not you can discern its origin or form. Denial is not advised today, but neither is digging too deep. If you start lifting up rocks to see what's under them, you're going to find something unpleasant sooner or later. Curiosity is a double-edged sword."
capricorn,2016-10-26,"Rewards at work arrive without any sort of warning today, catching you off guard. However, once people start to recognize your ongoing contributions, you begin to grow uncomfortable with the prospect of needing to deliver more of the same. Your optimism in the here and now might be soaring, but your ponderous concern about the next wave of events has you secretly worried. Instead of focusing on the unknown future, demonstrate your positivity in the present moment."
aquarius,2016-10-26,"It's as if you're a wolf in sheep's clothing today. The words you speak reflect your current air of self-confidence but they don't paint the entire picture. You could talk about an unpleasant subject and others still might walk away smiling. They hear what you say in a context that puts a shiny surface on your analysis now. Nevertheless, your messages are like metaphysical time bombs that amplify power until they release the pent-up tension. As President Theodore Roosevelt said, ""Speak softly and carry a big stick."""
pisces,2016-10-26,"No matter how critical people are when judging your work performance today, you still might see things from a wider perspective. But your ability to sense the universal energy doesn't take away from the value of the feedback you receive now. Rather than assuming a defensive posture, open your heart and listen. If you can feel the love instead of focusing on your mistakes, the chances for personal growth improve. Maya Angelou wrote, ""Do the best you can until you know better. Then, when you know better, do better."""
aries,2016-10-27,"You are tired of all the personal and political unrest and may finally decide to do something about it today. You might believe that the best place to start is to address a relationship issue directly. Unfortunately, your well-intended words could have a surprising impact, leaving you rattled and unsure of your next move. Go ahead and share your perspective, but avoid needless accusations and extreme solutions. Control what you can and confront what you can't."
taurus,2016-10-27,"Your efforts to make amends with your coworkers go a long way today toward settling any unpleasant dynamics. However, soothing words are not enough to fix the underlying issues that will still need to be sorted out in the days ahead. Nevertheless, anything you can do now to bring people on the opposite sides of a conflict closer together is certainly worth your time. As human rights activist Dorothy Thomas said, ""Peace is not the absence of conflict but the ability to cope with it."""
gemini,2016-10-27,"Separating your personal needs from the larger problems that are brewing is no easy task today. The Moon's shift into your 5th House of Self-Expression compels you to over-personalize your experiences. Your emotions are significant signals that demand your attention, but there are times when it's wise for the head to overrule the heart. John Churton Collins wrote, ""Half our mistakes in life arise from feeling where we ought to think, and thinking where we ought to feel."""
cancer,2016-10-27,"You're not sure who to believe now because you can see both sides of an emotional squabble. However, you want to support one person or another because you're not fully at ease with the ambiguity of sitting on the fence. You might even reach a point where you're ready to pick an ally even if you're not convinced that your choice is the right one. You just want resolution at any cost. Nevertheless, Emily Dickinson advised, ""Dwell in possibility."" Resist your urge to settle the tension before the time is right."
leo,2016-10-27,"You are an ambassador of goodwill today as the friendly Libra Moon hangs out in your 3rd House of Communication. You are prepared to step into the middle of a verbal storm in order to negotiate an equitable outcome. Nevertheless, your own feelings could flip dramatically if someone inadvertently pushes your emotional buttons. Do whatever you can to cultivate peace, but observe your reactions in the process. Staying balanced in the midst of chaos requires self-awareness and a healthy sense of humor."
virgo,2016-10-27,You can put your sharp analytical skills to work today by examining all the possible options for increasing your income in the weeks ahead. Your clarity is your ally because you can see things as they exist now rather than how you wish them to be. The Moon's visit to your 2nd House of Money gives you the disciplined perspective that's required to make intelligent choices. But don't put off a decision or the moment of truth will pass you by.
libra,2016-10-27,"You might be worried that there are some difficult days looming in the immediate future and you can imagine the worst-case scenarios all too clearly. Fortunately, you could do something now that will minimize any struggles ahead. But don't waste time analyzing all your alternatives when you can still take proactive measures. As Jim Morrison sang, ""The time to hesitate is through."" Any positive actions today will go a long way to creating a better tomorrow."
scorpio,2016-10-27,"You are a force to be reckoned with today, even if your confidence is flagging. The Moon's presence in your 12th House of Invisibility might prompt you to bury your head in the sand and hope everyone just leaves you alone. However, an incisive Sun-Mercury conjunction in your perceptive sign gives you the power to use your words like sharpened weapons. Fight for peace, not war; victory is yours if you put your mind to it."
sagittarius,2016-10-27,"You might not trust your intuition when it's giving you contradictory messages. On one hand, you're feeling the energy lighten today and can't quite wipe the smile off your face. On the other hand, there's a sinking sensation in the pit of your stomach that tells you not to be distracted by the good news. Both perspectives are likely true. Accept the current wave of optimism without taking your eyes off the main event. You'll come out of this with flying colors if you expect the best and prepare for the worst."
capricorn,2016-10-27,"You want your coworkers to know how much you respect them and that you are willing to do whatever you can to support their endeavors. But there are specific tasks that must be completed and responsibilities won't disappear just because you're feeling emotionally vulnerable. Fortunately, you can work both ends of the spectrum now. There's no need to deny your feelings; you can demonstrate compassion while still being an effective leader or team player. Author Janine Benyus writes, ""Cooperation is the most natural thing in the world."""
aquarius,2016-10-27,"You may harbor dreams of escaping your current obligations and heading out on a great adventure. However, you are so needed by others at home or work that you cannot possibly go anywhere at this time. Oddly enough, you might not feel as your family and associates appreciate your contributions. Don't fall victim to your own doubt or you might notice things to support your negativity. Just keep on task and you will see the results of your current determination soon enough. Remember, you can't live a positive life with a negative mind."
pisces,2016-10-27,"You want to get to the bottom of a mystery today, but something tells you it's better to leave a sleeping dog alone. Nevertheless, you may need to traverse some rough emotional water to reach the smooth seas ahead. There's no reason to talk yourself out of taking a journey into the depths of your subconscious, even if you're afraid of what you might discover. The devil you know is more easily tamed than the devil you don't."
aries,2016-10-28,"The energetic imbalances of the day have your name written all over them. Everyone seems to be reminding you that it's your high-strung nervous system that's wacky, not the world. But you already know better than to push the blame back on others. Consciously channeling your energy toward a work project or a creative endeavor enables you to achieve impressive results. As author Eve Sawyer wrote, ""Never underestimate the power of passion."""
taurus,2016-10-28,"The temptation of embarking on an amazing adventure is particularly enticing now, but most of you Bulls might still prefer to stay home where your creature comforts are readily available. Nevertheless, the idea of doing something extraordinarily different lingers in the back of your mind, even if you choose not to share your thoughts with anyone. However, it isn't in your best interest to suppress actions that could bring you happiness. Rather than taking an all-or-nothing approach today, find a way to express your freedom without upsetting the applecart."
gemini,2016-10-28,"You are bursting at the seams with restlessness, making it a chore to concentrate on work today. But your jumpy nerves must be contained so you can follow through on your commitments. There are two possibilities; blow off your obligations and let the chips fall as they may or use your willpower and refocus on the task at hand. Thankfully, you possess a deep reserve of determination now if you're willing to make the effort."
cancer,2016-10-28,"You can't rely on others to follow your script today, even if they promised to play a supporting role in your movie. It's as if reality is testing you to see how you will respond when someone changes the plot without consulting you first. But this twist may be good news in a misleading package. Instead of worrying about what might be lost, think about what could be gained as you are freed from unnecessary restraints. Galileo wrote, ""Passion is the genesis of genius."""
leo,2016-10-28,"You appear more committed than ever to accomplish your objectives today, but your strong intentions could backfire if you're not flexible in your methods. Changing circumstances prompt you to realize that finishing your work will be more challenging than you thought. Anxiety may lead to panic, tempting you to overreact or take an unnecessary risk. The truth is that it's better to be methodical and fall slightly short of your destination than to act impulsively and miss your target completely. Entrepreneur Jim Rohn wrote, ""Success is steady progress toward one's goals."""
virgo,2016-10-28,"You are willing to go the extra mile today in order to demonstrate your competence in everything you do. But unknown forces seem to be messing with your progress, requiring you to work even harder to get anything done at all. Don't get discouraged or you might lose precious ground. Keep a positive attitude no matter how many lemons life hands you now. Your unwavering focus on your goals will prove what you can do once you make a solid commitment. When the going gets tough, the tough get going."
libra,2016-10-28,"Plans involving someone else might unravel today when a coworker or partner goes rogue without prior notice. Once you recover from your initial shock, you must decide what to do. Your goals may remain the same, but your route needs to change since the old path is gone. The sooner you let go of the idea of a creative collaboration, the sooner you can get down to business. You'll make more progress if you go it alone now; it's better to walk by yourself than with a crowd going in the wrong direction."
scorpio,2016-10-28,"Surprisingly, hidden agendas are out in the open today. It's like you were happily working in a dark room and then suddenly a bright light is turned on without warning. Don't waste energy denying what everyone can see in plain sight. Instead, embrace your dreams with such gusto that others can't help but support your aspirations. You're more likely to reach your goals if you have a team on your side, even if the process is unexpected. Sometimes what you're looking for comes when you're not looking at all."
sagittarius,2016-10-28,"What you see is not what you get today. Your future appears promising while the Moon dances with propitious Jupiter in your 11th House of Long-Term Goals. But erratic interference can temporarily waylay your dreams of Utopia. Nevertheless, it's not as bad as it seems at first if things fall apart. Don't squander your energy by trying to stop the inevitable. Instead, laugh when the house of cards tumbles down. It's better in the long run to rebuild from scratch now than to bolster a structure that was inferior from the beginning."
capricorn,2016-10-28,"It's rather effortless to remain emotionally detached from a specific outcome at your job because you can see things from multiple points of view now. However, unpredictable Uranus squares warrior Mars in your methodical sign, indicating your professional trajectory could change in ways you can't imagine. Avoid the trap of playing it safe by holding onto the past. The alarm is sounding today; the future is calling. Answer the phone before the moment passes."
aquarius,2016-10-28,"People may be annoyed with you today because your behavior is so unreliable. Unfortunately, their cautionary words or emotional manipulation can't alter your actions. You are being informed from a deep and resonant place within your subconscious. You're tired of feeling like there's something more beyond the comfortable rut of daily repetition. You're just waiting for someone to give you a good reason to make your move. However, you can't justify biding your time any longer. Strike while the iron is hot or live with a tinge of regret."
pisces,2016-10-28,"Working as part of a team can be a mixed blessing now. Others seem to have their minds made up and you don't necessarily agree with them. In fact, you might feel as if your core values prevent you from supporting the current direction of the group. Although speaking your truth will be inconvenient, it is necessary to clear the air so everyone knows exactly where you stand. Take the moral high ground by giving others the benefit of the doubt."
aries,2016-10-29,"Although you're known for initiating action without a lot of fanfare, setting your plans into motion seems like an uphill battle now. Only yesterday you couldn't find a reason to say no; today you might not be able to say yes. Your current self-restraint is a blessing as long as you don't take it too far. Thoughtfully consider all the logical reasons to keep your big ideas to yourself. But continue to feed your dreams for they will still fuel your next great adventure when you're ready."
taurus,2016-10-29,"What seems like a simple financial decision grows more complicated if a partner or friend voices disapproval of your current priorities. But it's not just someone's negative judgment that bothers you now, because it feels as if their emotional support is being withheld, too. There's no reason to overreact by turning this minor disagreement into a major drama. In a few days you won't even be able to remember what happened if you don't stir the pot today."
gemini,2016-10-29,"A significant relationship might be going through an emotionally volatile phase now as adjustments are being made to accommodate a change in circumstances. It feels as if you can't count on the love and support from someone you believed to be a close ally. However, it's your reaction to their behavior that could have the greatest negative impact. Don't aggravate the situation by withdrawing out of fear. Psychologist Brene Brown writes, ""Vulnerability is the most accurate measure of courage."""
cancer,2016-10-29,"Making healthy improvements in your lifestyle doesn't have to be as overwhelming as you imagine. Don't toss the baby out with the bathwater and change so much at once that your daily routine is thrown into chaos. Instead, take advantage of restrictive Saturn's alignment with sweet Venus by eliminating one unhealthy indulgence of your choice. A single modification that endures is better than many that don't."
leo,2016-10-29,"A day of recovery and integration follows a recent opening of your heart in a vulnerable situation. Needless to say, reestablishing boundaries may be necessary, but doesn't feel as warm and fuzzy as tearing them down. It's not easy to express your emotions while a constrictive Venus-Saturn conjunction subdues the energy in your 5th House of Romance. Nevertheless, you can learn an important lesson  if you're willing to listen to the universe now; sometimes waiting for long-term satisfaction is more fulfilling than short-lived gratification."
virgo,2016-10-29,"Feeling at home is challenging today, even if your domestic situation is a happy one. Little disagreements with a family member are distracting; unexpressed emotions create hidden vortexes of energy that can pull you down. Trying to overcome unspoken negativity is like fighting your way out of quicksand. Stop struggling and accept where you are. Slow and purposeful movements are more productive than madly kicking and flailing your arms around like a panic-struck victim. Everything improves as soon as you change your frame of reference."
libra,2016-10-29,"It's one thing to create a grand life plan; it's something else to explain your ideas to another person today. Sobering Saturn squashes vulnerable Venus in your 3rd House of Communication, stopping you from saying anything about your dreams for the future. You might struggle to find the right words, only to realize they can't convey your vision the way you see it unfolding in your mind's eye. Believe it or not, the only limits you have are the limits inside of your head."
scorpio,2016-10-29,"There's no question at all about where you stand on a particular matter today. When push comes to shove, you're willing to demonstrate your commitment to your core values without regard to the emotional price you might have to pay. Honoring a strong conviction is admirable as long as it doesn't create an insurmountable schism between you and those you love. Reassess your needs and compare them to your beliefs before making choices that are not easy to undo."
sagittarius,2016-10-29,"Your friends and relatives may wonder if you're okay today if you seem more somber than your regular free-spirited self. Stoic Saturn prevents romantic Venus from showing her playful side now; lighthearted flirtation is replaced by heavyweight philosophy. However, what others think of you is less important than how you feel about yourself. Don't fall into Saturn's steel trap by alienating your closest allies. Find ways to show your serious nature without making your loved ones feel responsible for your happiness."
capricorn,2016-10-29,"You might feel the weight of the world on your shoulders today, but have no particular reason for taking on all this heaviness. It's as if you can't separate your personal feelings from global problems. Instead of just moping your way through the weekend, take some time to delve into your malaise to figure out what's wrong. Confronting the negativity may be enough to banish it from your current experience. There's no magical fix if your perceptions are accurate, but you'll be surprised at how quickly the sky clears once you change your attitude."
aquarius,2016-10-29,"Unfortunately, you lose touch with your own sense of purpose when you feel cut off from your support network. Today's austere Venus-Saturn conjunction lands in your 11th House of Community, placing an artificial wall between you and your coworkers, friends and family. But retreating from the crowd only feeds into your lack of confidence. Acknowledge the current social limitations while realizing they are only temporary restraints. The moment you let go is the moment you will find freedom."
pisces,2016-10-29,"Although you might have the weekend off to relax, you could end up obsessing about a difficult change of dynamics on the job. Perhaps a recent shift in the political landscape has left you feeling insecure about your future. Or, maybe you're just realizing how much work it will take to accomplish your career objectives. Your assessment is probably accurate, but your reaction is likely based on an irrational fear of failure. Let your dreams outgrow the shoes of your expectations."
aries,2016-10-30,"You are hitting the restart button today to align an intimate partnership with your dreams. Although a new direction is favored, it's possible to begin with a clean slate while still in a familiar relationship. Unlike the leopard that can't change its spots, you can alter your position on an important subject or emotionally transform within an existing structure. The passionate Scorpio New Moon triggers your 8th House of Deep Sharing, prompting you to seek more spiritual channels of expression in all facets of your life. Picasso wrote, ""The meaning of life is to find your gift. The purpose of life is to give it away."""
taurus,2016-10-30,"You might overreact to someone's emotional intensity today without even realizing that your feelings are so rigid. However, you can make progress toward reaching your dreams if you have the courage to entertain alternative possibilities. The fixed Scorpio New Moon occupies your 7th House of Others, making it look like someone else is the one who is so obstinate. Nevertheless, taking responsibility for your own role in any relationship improves the chances for a satisfactory outcome."
gemini,2016-10-30,"No matter what anyone tells you, imagining a healthier lifestyle isn't enough to manifest one. However, envisioning a daily schedule that includes proper diet, sufficient exercise and mental relaxation can set you off in the right direction as long as you're willing to take the next steps. Fortunately, the Scorpio New Moon falls in your 6th House of Routine, empowering you to stabilize the patterns you put into motion now. A Yiddish proverb warns, ""Bad habits are easier to abandon today than tomorrow."""
cancer,2016-10-30,"Your imagination can transport you to magical places that raise the stakes in the game of life. Your fantasies are the driving force behind all that you do today, yet they also set the tone for the days ahead. The Scorpio New Moon activates your 5th House of Self-Expression, but rather than telling it like it is, you're more apt to share what you see for the future. Paradoxically, looking into the shadows is not a dark experience because the light of your awareness empowers you to co-create your future according to your highest hopes."
leo,2016-10-30,"It's tempting to look at your past through a warped lens today, remembering those interactions that left a lasting emotional imprint. But your memory is altering the events, glorifying the toughest times and or turning other moments into melodramas. Nevertheless, the Scorpio New Moon's presence in your 4th House of Roots is not about getting distracted by gazing in the rearview mirror. Taking one more glance back at your origins is most useful if you learn from your history and apply the lessons where they are relevant now."
virgo,2016-10-30,"Managing your daily schedule now creates stress because you prefer to fly by the seat of your pants than write everything down as you are usually known to do. But attending to details is not your modus operandi when surreal Neptune trines the Scorpio New Moon in your 3rd House of Communication. Rather than trying to keep up the appearance of accuracy, give yourself permission to drift off into your dreams, for they are creating the colorful threads that will be woven into your future."
libra,2016-10-30,"Although you may be recovering from an emotionally difficult experience, you can bounce back with great resolve today. The transformational Scorpio New Moon converses with talkative Mercury in your 2nd House of Self-Esteem, encouraging you to share your inner process with someone you trust. Involving others lifts your spirits by allowing you to spin an imaginative story around the actual facts. Reframing your recent developments helps you see them in a more positive light."
scorpio,2016-10-30,"You are no stranger to the far reaches of your own subconscious. The evolutionary Scorpio New Moon energizes your 1st House of Self, touching you with emotional intensity that fuels profound change. But its connection with spiritual Neptune pulls you out of your personal story and sets you into a more universal framework where everything has cosmic significance. However, you are still the central character in your play, so bring the focus back to your heart. You are growing and morphing in ways you do not yet understand. Don't give up; significant shifts take time."
sagittarius,2016-10-30,"You have a suspicion that the current events in your life are more important than they seem. In fact, you might believe that your behavior could ensure your happiness or prevent it. However, it's tricky to know what's really happening while the mysterious Scorpio New Moon intensifies your 12th House of Destiny. You're only capable of seeing your dreams, whether you're awake or asleep, so don't confuse your vision with the truth. Nevertheless, as author Colin Wilson wrote, ""Your imagination should be used not to escape reality but to create it."""
capricorn,2016-10-30,"Although there are numerous forks in the road, you have a one-track mind as you stare at the top of the mountain. The insistent Scorpio New Moon highlights your 11th House of Long-Term Goals, motivating you to cling to your vision without regard to the circumstances you encounter. Nevertheless, it turns out that your own imagination is more of a distraction than you realize. Dreaming your future is a viable plan as long as you know where the truth ends and your fantasies begin."
aquarius,2016-10-30,You're fiercely ambitious about achieving an important life objective over the coming weeks and you're not willing to settle for less. Your powerful intentions are you secret weapon as the magnetic Scorpio Moon energizes your 10th House of Public Recognition. Don't allow anyone else's negativity interfere with your dreams. Trust your psychic powers to steer you in the direction you need to go.
pisces,2016-10-30,"You can believe in something with such an unwavering intensity that your intention alters the fabric of reality. Clever Mercury aligns with the unwavering Scorpio New Moon in your 9th House of Big Ideas, inflating your plans until they are too grand to fit into your life. However, visionary Neptune is working behind the scene, setting the stage for real magic to occur. Belief in your own dreams is such a powerful force now that nothing can prevent them from coming true."
aries,2016-10-31,"You can conjure up a fantastic future by using creative visualization today. In fact, your thoughts possess the power to positively influence current events as long as you stay acutely aware of the difference between fantasy and reality. Grounding your hopes in truth anchors them to the present moment. Planting practical seeds in the fertile soil of your imagination is an act of magic, but placing your faith in the unattainable will only lead to disappointment. Arthur Ashe said, ""Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can."""
taurus,2016-10-31,"Someone may deceive you today, but on closer analysis you realize it was your own desire for a happy outcome that led you astray. You hear what you want to believe, causing you to misunderstand a straightforward message. Thankfully, accepting the truth quickly minimizes the potential damage. Make whatever modifications are required before your assumptions pull you too far off track. Heed the proverb, ""Listen to advice and accept correction; then, in the end you will be wise."""
gemini,2016-10-31,"Balancing your playful approach to life with more serious concerns at work can be quite stressful today. Perhaps your desire to deepen a professional partnership creates an awkward situation if the other person is less committed than you. Or, maybe your fear of getting in over your head in an intimate relationship adds to your anxiety. In either case, acknowledge the undeniable facts by engaging in an honest dialogue. Your willingness to explore unknown territory now will advance your standing with those you love and respect."
cancer,2016-10-31,"Although you may take yourself pretty seriously, your role at work is multidimensional today. Naturally, demonstrating your responsible nature is beneficial for your reputation, but the interpersonal dynamics are in flux. Meeting your obligations is your first call of duty yet being a good employee or boss doesn't preclude having a little fun, too. New possibilities beckon on the horizon, but you still must meet your previous commitments. Nevertheless, instead of fretting about what you should or shouldn't do, just take care of business before expressing what's in your heart."
leo,2016-10-31,"Your work schedule is overbooked with so many things to do that you don't have much time to pursue more creative endeavors. You might need to temporarily resign yourself to curtailing your activities, even if it means keeping to yourself today. Thankfully, your fantasies offer you a pleasant escape route even if they're not the same as reality. Slip away and enjoy your daydreams without making a big deal about it now. Just remember that the real world and all your responsibilities await your return."
virgo,2016-10-31,"You might encounter a situation that makes you doubt your own logic today. Since you favor an analytical approach when it comes to forming your conclusions, it may surprise you that you are placing so much emphasis on your intuition now. Unfortunately, validating a gut feeling can be tricky, causing you to question your own assumptions. Listen to your inner voice for guidance but weigh and balance the bottom line against the known facts for the best results."
libra,2016-10-31,"Although you may believe your life trajectory is right on target, you're also aware that you're not as certain about your core values as you once thought. You might try to justify old beliefs that no longer serve you, but you could miss an unexpected opportunity today if you're stuck in the past. Don't look back; start writing the next chapter of your life by honoring your dreams and progressing toward them page by page."
scorpio,2016-10-31,"You're inclined to keep silent today if someone complains about the volatile financial climate or political issues beyond their control. However, your reticence to engage in a discussion about social matters is not a reflection of your lack of interest. Rather, you're so deeply concerned that you attempt to avoid the subject because it gets your blood boiling. Thankfully, the news of the day doesn't restrain the magical wanderings of your imagination, so share your positive visions rather than whining about current problems. Your uplifting dreams of change inspire others more than you realize."
sagittarius,2016-10-31,"Juggling other people's expectations with your need for meaning can be an impossible feat today. It feels like a familiar old story when your friends assume something's wrong because you don't want to join in the fun. But you're not interested in arbitrarily shifting into party mode just to satisfy someone else's wishes. Nevertheless, if you believe a social engagement will provide an opportunity to establish a meaningful connection, say yes before the chance slips through your fingers. Eckhart Tolle wrote, ""Realize deeply that the present moment is all you ever have."""
capricorn,2016-10-31,"The future is looking brighter day by day, yet you're still unable to jump into the next big thing until you've wrapped up old business. Your imagination is working overtime, but it could be more of a hindrance now than a source of inspiration. Contributing to a complex project behind the scenes may be your most strategic move because it sets the stage for your transition into something new. Envision the life you wish to experience, but be ready to follow through with the necessary sweat equity to make your dreams come true."
aquarius,2016-10-31,"You are still drifting in and out of your fantasies today, but at least you can now discern the difference between your unrealistic wishes and concrete realities. Your current gift is your ability to paint in the specific details of your future in your favorite colors, without confusing your dreams with the mundane issues on your plate. Nevertheless, you're the artist and only you can decide what to create. If you choose carefully, your masterpiece will determine the texture of your life."
pisces,2016-10-31,"Your experiences are tinted by your desires today, substantially altering your perceptions. Unfortunately, you may be unable to see your world in a clear light. Instead, you can easily confuse your own thoughts and feelings with objective reality. Nevertheless, your daydreams are rich with signs and symbols about your future, so don't discount your psychic visions prematurely. Setting aside a specific block of time to lose yourself in your imagination can revitalize your spirit for the more serious work at hand."
aries,2016-11-01,"You're back in your own element today, but your enthusiasm could take you for a wild ride before you know it. It's as if you've finally escaped from your cage and are so overjoyed that you're ready for anything. However, you are so quick to react that you might jump to erroneous conclusions based on your wishes rather than the actual circumstances. Optimism is healthy when warranted, but it makes more sense now to step back from the edge of the cliff so you're not tempted to try your hand at flying. Setting new goals solidifies your zest for life."
taurus,2016-11-01,"You might lose touch with your common sense today if you think you are invincible. Normally, you're more cautious in your assessment of the future, but your fantasies have taken on a life of their own and may be indistinguishable from reality now. Set aside a few minutes to reestablish your center of gravity by remembering your determined Bullish nature works best when you're focusing on your basic needs. Simplicity is beautiful."
gemini,2016-11-01,"You are torn between your ambitious plans and someone's more cautious approach today. You are aware of the potential in an opportunity, but it may be more a product of your imagination than the actual circumstances. Nevertheless, pessimism doesn't serve you well because you could miss a chance to grab the brass ring. Follow the middle path that makes the most of the current situation without building it up into the greatest thing since the invention of sliced bread. As author Gary Zukav wrote, ""Practice moderation in all things except love."""
cancer,2016-11-01,"You are emotionally secure in your inner world today yet you're eager to extend outward into new territory. Oddly, taking on a larger-than-life project isn't intimidating now. In fact, your confidence is soaring, possibly leading you to accept more responsibility than you can manage. There's no need to push yourself to extremes to prove your competence. Acknowledging your limitations is healthier than setting yourself up for failure."
leo,2016-11-01,"You're not so driven to be in the spotlight today, which blesses you with some much-needed privacy. You're actually relieved if everyone's eyes are not following your every move. Flying beneath the radar can be exhilarating because it relieves you of the responsibility of needing to justify your actions. This invisibility cloak is a gift from the cosmos, so use it wisely. Plan a luxurious excursion into the realm of fantasy so you can gather sufficient inspiration to fuel another successful round in the mundane world."
virgo,2016-11-01,"There's a certain freedom associated with your inner journey now that the independent Sagittarius Moon is traveling through your 4th House of Home and Family. But your unwillingness to share your feelings can create an entirely new set of problems. Everyone has assumptions about what makes a perfect relationship, but someone else's projections don't necessarily support your needs. Take a calculated risk and initiate a discussion about your unexpressed emotions. Talking about your desires opens the door of opportunity that leads to heartfelt satisfaction."
libra,2016-11-01,"It's apparent that you can't fit much more into your day, but that's not going to stop you from trying now. Unfortunately, you might encounter the straw that breaks the camel's back if you continue to stack activities one on top of another today. Recognizing your current penchant for fantasy helps you bring your life back into proper perspective as you consider the limitations of the clock. Time -- or the lack of it -- has a wonderful way of showing us what really matters."
scorpio,2016-11-01,"Not only does your confidence return today, it soars on the wings of your thoughts. However, you want to remain connected with the more profound issues that touch your heart now. Thankfully, you can hold multiple views of reality simultaneously while balancing on the edge between reason and imagination. Leaning too far one way or the other warps your perspective and prevents you from establishing equilibrium. Living in two worlds keeps you whole."
sagittarius,2016-11-01,"The restraints that tethered you to an intense emotional issue have finally been cut. But your newfound independence comes with a hidden cost, especially now that the evocative Moon is back in your sign, reminding you of your past. You might feel as if you've already paid the price and should be totally free to pursue your new adventures. Unfortunately, you're still more attached to unfulfilled desires than you thought. As Paulo Coelho wrote, ""It takes a huge effort to free yourself from memory."""
capricorn,2016-11-01,"Continuing your methodical climb to the pinnacle of success becomes more complicated today because you might lose interest in your worldly goals. Dreams of material prosperity are temporarily replaced by visions of enlightenment as the reflective Moon trips into your 12th House of Spirituality. You must make choices now about which path to follow, but don't succumb to the passionate drive of red-hot Mars since his certainty is not to be trusted now. Keep your priorities straight. It's not about how much you accumulate, but how much you enjoy life that creates happiness."
aquarius,2016-11-01,"You are no longer living in the present moment since the adventurous Sagittarius Moon is humming in your 11th House of the Future. Your vivid fantasies encourage you to dream large about where your current job will eventually lead. Making plans is half the fun now, since you can attend to the mundane parts of your life while still thinking about all the amazing possibilities down the road. Visionary activist Caroline Casey says, ""Imagination lays down the tracks for the reality train to follow."""
pisces,2016-11-01,"You are as happy as a fish swimming in the safety of a school today, even if you are normally a solo act. Not only do you gain emotional security when surrounded by so many like-spirited members of your community, it truly feels ecstatic when you can joyfully lose yourself in a crowd. As long as you keep up appearances, you're free in your mind to go anywhere you want. Jean Jacques Rousseau wrote, ""The world of reality has its limits; the world of imagination is boundless."""
aries,2016-11-02,"Although the central plot of your story may be unfolding as expected, you still need to take the time to reassess your plans for the next few months. You can no longer avoid an inconvenient truth that keeps you from moving forward. There's a point at which whatever you were trying to escape finds you anyhow. Stop running and see what you can discover once the noise settles down. Too much looking often blinds the eye that seeks yet never finds."
taurus,2016-11-02,"You might think you can cleverly skip over the most intense parts of a conversation with your close friend or lover. However, reality has other plans for you today. The cosmos requires you to attend to the deeper issues that are simmering close to the surface before pursuing more pleasurable experiences. Eventually, you will realize that there's a lesson for you to learn, but you still need to dig for the truth now; it won't come to you on its own. Taking personal responsibility is the most reliable path to success."
gemini,2016-11-02,"It's no fun when someone you respect fails to support your actions. You might misread the signals and believe that he or she is on your side only to uncover a significant source of negativity. Although you may think that the best way to overcome this resistance is to dance around it, it's better to confront the problem directly. But rather than wasting energy defending yourself today, just reevaluate your plans, make the necessary corrections and try again. You can improve your game now if you listen to the valuable feedback you receive and act on it decisively."
cancer,2016-11-02,"Maintaining your daily rhythm is more critical now if something isn't going just right. It's not the time to experiment with alternative methods or turn your world upside with a radical solution to a lingering problem. Fall back on your regular routine whether you are chasing wild geese, running into obstacles or just feeling a bit under the weather. Not only will you gain comfort from familiar patterns, you'll emerge stronger and more determined to reach your goals."
leo,2016-11-02,"You have an important message to deliver today and won't let anyone stand in your way. Your creativity may seem stifled as the reflective Moon conjuncts austere Saturn in your 5th House of Self-Expression. You might be short on presentation magic, but your performance can still be awesome if your information is in order. Don't let the lack of fiery energy derail your success now. Set your intentions by establishing specific milestones and concentrating on manifesting your destiny."
virgo,2016-11-02,"You might hold your feelings a little closer to your chest today. Your insecurities are peaking at a critical point; your anxiety can actually prevent you from being as effective as you imagine. But self-restraint also works in your favor because emotional expression pulls you away from your regular duties. As long as you're busy defending your passions, you're not working productively on the job. Proactively putting your softer side on display empowers you to take responsibility for your feelings. Vulnerability is the gateway to intimacy."
libra,2016-11-02,"Your morning will likely be totally different than your afternoon. Expansive energy encourages you to initiate lots of activity early in the day, but the Moon's hookup with sobering Saturn restrains your 3rd House of Communication, closing down conversations and impeding your overall productivity. Don't wait for a better time to deliver your message; the sooner you clear the air, the better everyone will feel. The early bird gets the worm."
scorpio,2016-11-02,"You can be your own harshest critic, especially if you fall short of your plans to finish a specific project this morning. You may have too many things you want to accomplish, only to see the list grow longer rather than shorter throughout the day. In either case, you're not happy with your own performance today. But your self-criticism reaches a point where it's not helpful. You can decide to cut yourself some slack for your human failings or continue to beat yourself up. Nevertheless, it is said that out of suffering comes the strongest souls."
sagittarius,2016-11-02,"Your current moodiness gets on everyone's nerves today as you swing from hot to cold and right to left. But you actually believe that nothing is different and others are making a big deal out of a minor issue. Sooner or later you realize it's in your best interest to change some variables on your trajectory. Revealing your vulnerability can help, but it also could backfire if you say too much now. Share your fears with an appropriate audience, but stop before you take it to the point of no return."
capricorn,2016-11-02,"Your current malaise is not apparent to those closest to you. In fact, the heavy Saturn-Moon conjunction falls in your 12th House of Invisibility, masking your emotions from the world. But you still may not know how to keep the negative energy from bottling up beneath the surface. Sometimes direct action is required; however, taking things out is the simplest solution to this irritating dilemma. Save your dramatic behavior for later; honesty is almost always the best policy. A good relationship starts with good communication."
aquarius,2016-11-02,"You may think that your friends aren't living up to their end of the deal now while they might believe everything is copacetic. Unfortunately, interrogating others won't help you learn anything useful; it's probably better to just back away from social interactions until tomorrow if you're not feeling welcome today. Most of the time, an honest discussion bridges an emotional gulf, but now it's better to announce a temporary retreat. Start fresh again after you're feeling on top of your game."
pisces,2016-11-02,"Showing your enthusiasm at work isn't easy if you're not feeling aligned with your daily grind. You've been ruminating on the purpose of life lately, and may be concerned that your current job isn't supporting your overall life goals. But don't make any changes impulsively. It's wiser to stick it out for now while you continue to consider all your options. The results won't be favorable if you initiate action too soon. Make sure you have your plan locked in place before turning your life into a chaotic mess. Timing is everything."
aries,2016-11-03,"You are off and running again without much to impede your progress today. However, you could sugarcoat reality, thinking you can get away with nearly anything now. You're tempted to evade a discussion about a sensitive topic so as to keep the momentum on your side. If you maintain integrity, your plans might just flow without so much as a speed bump. But if you push your luck or try to take an unproven shortcut, everything could fall apart pretty quickly. Honesty plus hard work equals success."
taurus,2016-11-03,"Someone might be rather demanding today when requesting your participation in a conversation that doesn't concern you directly. Your first inclination is to stay far away from drama, but you're aware of the service you could provide simply by being emotionally present. Fortunately, you're clear enough about your role as a helper that you won't likely get dragged in any deeper into the fray. Show up as an observer and give everyone a chance to air their grievances without interruption. Bob Marley said, ""The greatness of a man is not in how much wealth he acquires, but in his ability to affect those around him positively."""
gemini,2016-11-03,"You're often the first one to say yes to someone's crazy idea, but today it's everyone else who seems to be too cavalier in their judgments. You think that you are exercising common sense, only to be confronted by the over-permissive attitude of people who have nothing to lose in the situation. You're unsure if others are seeing the entire picture and worry they might make bad choices based upon their wildly optimistic outlook. You would prefer to stick with the safe bet and keep a low profile as you progress on your path. There isn't an easy answer to this dilemma; in reality, the truth is likely somewhere in between."
cancer,2016-11-03,"It's all too easy to rearrange the facts at work today and make a decision that leads you into trouble. You want to take advantage of every possibility because changes are necessary and you believe this moment of opportunity will not last. Your perceptions might be true, but you still have more time than you think. Instead of rushing into a new project or radically redirecting your career path, step back and take a few deep breaths first. Allow a full week to contemplate your next move. The additional time will give you an advantage that will make a big difference later on."
leo,2016-11-03,"It's your day to shine by expressing exactly where you stand on a controversial issue. You might not stir up as much excitement as intended, but your words will carry enough power to change people's minds. However, don't tell others what to do; just state the facts as you know them and let everyone decide on his or her own terms. Moderate your eagerness to incite your audience to action. Planting thought bombs that explode old ways of thinking is more useful than pushing anyone to do anything drastic in the spur of the moment."
virgo,2016-11-03,"You might resist the urge to believe what you're told today even if the news is positive. You know that there is more to the story than meets the eye and want to gather more data before jumping to conclusions -- especially if everyone else already agrees upon the truth. Don't just hop onto the bandwagon because it's fun to be part of a joyful parade. Utilizing your skills of discernment helps you find the right answer, even if it's not the popular one. Pretty words are not always true, and true words are not always pretty."
libra,2016-11-03,"Someone may share a totally off-the-wall idea and normally you would just acknowledge it and move on. However, this scheme could actually sound enticing enough today that you want to join in the fun. Nevertheless, what begins as a joyful journey could run into difficulties sooner than you think. It still might be the right decision but only time will tell. Just be prepared to work harder to make your collaboration a valuable experience for everyone involved. Hall of Famer Babe Ruth said, ""It's hard to beat a person who never gives up."""
scorpio,2016-11-03,"Money may not grow on trees, yet you could plant seeds today that bear financial fruit. Whether a bold thought strikes with the suddenness of lightning or your inspiration comes from developing old ideas, you can turn a stroke of genius into profit if you are determined enough to take a calculated risk. However, rest assured you are not being offered a free lunch; you will need to work for what you now stand to gain."
sagittarius,2016-11-03,"If you can quiet your mind enough to hear someone else's voice today, your chances for success improve dramatically. However, you have a lot of creative notions and may attempt to pursue nearly all of them within the confines of your imagination. Nevertheless, there's a price to pay now if your own thoughts are loud enough to drown out those of your coworkers and friends. Listen with care and you might just learn what you need to know. Everyone you meet has something to teach you."
capricorn,2016-11-03,"You can rely on your friends to tell you the truth today, even if you don't like what you hear. Nevertheless, knowing exactly what's happening empowers you to make better decisions throughout the day. Even if you are tempted to withdraw into your shell so you can work without distraction, don't create unnecessary distance between you and your staunchest supporters. The help you receive from those who really want the best for you can make all the difference in the world. It's not happiness that brings us gratitude; it's gratitude that brings us happiness."
aquarius,2016-11-03,"Your motives aren't apparent to others now, but you're sure of your intentions, nonetheless. Instead of understanding your true nature, your coworkers are distracted by the breadth of your vision. They're excited by your unwavering optimism, but might not look hard enough to see past the surface. Meanwhile, you're on a mission with your heart set on accomplishing your goals, no matter what the cost. Your dedication is even more useful if it inspires your peers to strive for success. But ultimately, who you are is best revealed by what you do."
pisces,2016-11-03,"Your current career objectives are highly ambitious, yet some of them might not be grounded in reality. Paradoxically, it may not matter that your dreams are larger than life now, because there's a bit of magic blowing in the air that could give you a lift if you spread your wings. Don't be afraid of failure; you will never know what is possible unless you try. Life doesn't have a rewind button. Author Lewis Carroll wrote, ""In the end, we only regret the chance we didn't take."""
aries,2016-11-04,"The pressure is turned up several notches because you want to show others what you can do today. You are usually ready to fight against anyone who questions your intentions, but you might not know what to do when you discover your biggest enemy now is you. Thankfully, you can change your attitude to reflect the fact that a past failure is not indicative of a current one. Most dreams don't happen overnight; if you believe in yourself anything is possible."
taurus,2016-11-04,"A slight loss of confidence isn't enough to deter your progress today because your unflappable determination enables you to hold onto your dreams through thick and thin. Nevertheless, someone's harsh criticism of your work might reawaken the residual pain from an early childhood rejection. Seeking approval from others is a waste of your precious time and energy. Your success is the sweetest revenge."
gemini,2016-11-04,"You're not the easiest person to get along with today, even if you decide that cooperation is a smart business strategy. Nevertheless, this no-nonsense approach sums up your current plan for success; you calculate every detail in your mind and then you act according to your best interests. Although a rational analysis of the facts is useful, it doesn't reveal all you need to know. Author Stephen Covey wrote, ""The key is not to prioritize what's on your schedule, but to schedule your priorities."""
cancer,2016-11-04,"You need to choose your own direction today, rather than letting everyone else tell you what to do. The problem is that it would be easier to fit into someone else's plans than to reinvent the wheel and make up your own. However, conforming to another person's agenda isn't as satisfying as acting on creative impulses from within. Dr. Martha Friedman wrote, ""Success based on anything but internal fulfillment is bound to be empty."""
leo,2016-11-04,"You're sure that you can achieve your goals now by sticking to your amazing new plan. You put a lot of effort into developing this sound strategy, but the real work is still in front of you as you attempt to turn an idea into reality. Don't panic if something slips out of your sphere of influence. Nevertheless, quitting is not a viable option, even if you run into a wall. Moderation on all fronts works to your advantage now. Rumi wrote, ""The middle path is the way to wisdom."""
virgo,2016-11-04,"You're quite hopeful about the possibility of working with someone you admire today. But their bright light may shine in a different dark corner than yours, leaving you to continue on your mission by yourself. Don't worry about what might have been; it's a moot point. Bring yourself back to the current reality for a check up on the viability of your aspirations. Put your ideas into motion without thinking about them forever. Author H. Jackson Brown, Jr. wrote, ""Opportunity dances with those who are already on the dance floor."""
libra,2016-11-04,"You are standing on a solid foundation today and are capable of building the tallest tower without danger of it falling down. Nevertheless, negative self-judgments can steal your opportunity for success before you have the chance to make something big happen. Start slowly and methodically; continue to strengthen your base while you add on to your original idea. Bob Marley said, ""You never know how strong you are until being strong is the only choice available."""
scorpio,2016-11-04,"You could do something at work today that others think is crazy. Nevertheless, the last laugh is yours because your unorthodox solution to a problem might just be the one that saves the day. Unfortunately, you will have to go against the grain to demonstrate the efficacy of your resolution to the current dilemma. Don't be afraid to stand up for your beliefs. No matter how it turns out, you will derive lasting satisfaction from doing what's right."
sagittarius,2016-11-04,"You're content to fall back and rely on your charm now that friendly Venus is in your sign. Unfortunately, her square to vulnerable Chiron in your 4th House of Family indicates a lack of support from those closest to you. Nevertheless, you can still turn this tricky situation around and even make some money in the process. But don't wait for others to rush to your assistance. They might eventually answer your request for help, but you'll already be done with your work if you play your cards right. Being your own hero is gratifying to your soul."
capricorn,2016-11-04,"You're a bit hesitant to take a risk today, even if your calculations show that you have a great chance of beating the odds. Instead, you might hang back and wait until your possibilities improve. Don't just make a plan and execute it exactly as conceived. Listen carefully to your intuition while the Moon is in your sign. Your emotions are a bellwether for the future. If something feels right in your gut now, then act on your instinct before the moment passes."
aquarius,2016-11-04,"Your identity is wrapped up in your career now, which has grown in ways you never imagined just a few short years ago. You may have a significant decision to make about your main source of income. Unfortunately, you might have to disagree with the thinking of your socially astute friends, which is a real dilemma since you don't want to alienate them. Nevertheless, as Gandhi said, ""It's easy to stand with the crowd. It takes courage to stand alone."""
pisces,2016-11-04,"You might not believe you deserve the current success you're experiencing at work these days. But this kind of self-effacing thinking isn't useful; in fact, it's probably not even true. Try to find the origin of your negativity and then make the connection with the present moment. However, you must also acknowledge what's different now. Once you see how the past doesn't control the present, you'll be free from it."
aries,2016-11-05,"Exploring new territory with a friend or lover can be invigorating and could even pump new life into your relationship if it's lost some of its spice. You are in the mood to experiment while innovative Uranus in your pioneering sign stimulates pleasurable Venus in your 9th House of Adventure. Although your day won't likely go as planned, delightful events could arise unexpectedly if you're willing to stretch your limits. In the words of Peter Pan, ""To infinity and beyond!"""
taurus,2016-11-05,"It might not be such a simple task to keep your feelings in check today. In fact, you may be on the lookout for new forms of emotional connection when progressive Uranus trines sexy Venus. Fortunately, the practical Capricorn Moon can bring you back down to earth, but it may not be enough to convince you to accept the status quo. Author Arthur C. Clarke wrote, ""The limits of the possible can only be defined by going beyond them into the impossible."""
gemini,2016-11-05,"Freethinking friends make perfect allies in activities that can ultimately energize your spirit. Luckily, a harmonious trine between delicious Venus and maverick Uranus allows you to establish valuable connections without losing your sense of independence. Regrets are easily left behind today as you are released from previous agreements, giving you a chance to exercise your right to work and play in ways that are meaningful to you. Step outside the box; being different means you're courageous enough to be your authentic self, regardless of what others think."
cancer,2016-11-05,"Your friends may be extremely surprised by your unconventional behavior if you don't suppress some of your passions today. Nevertheless, you're being challenged by your unfulfilled needs to step out into the open in full view of others. Although you might take your own sweet time to reveal your feelings, you can't resist the desires of your heart for long, even if you wish you could remain anonymous. Thankfully, expressing yourself confidently wins you the respect of others."
leo,2016-11-05,"You can make your radical ideas seem more compelling today by putting your heart into your presentation. People will praise you for your originality as you explore new forms of self-expression, fueled by a smooth trine from unorthodox Uranus to playful Venus in your 5th House of Creativity. Sketching a rough outline of your major goals gives you a strong foundation upon which to build your future. Nevertheless, trying to fill in too many details too soon slows you down. There's no reason to hold back when being innovative now; taking a chance enables you to spread your wings and soar."
virgo,2016-11-05,"You are very clear about what you want today. Although you wish everyone would intuitively know what you need while the Moon is moving through your 5th House of Love, you must come up with the words to explain your position. Nevertheless, the presence of vulnerable Venus in your 4th House of Home and Family encourages discretion rather than communication. But life is too short to hide your feelings; don't let logic stand in the way of your heart."
libra,2016-11-05,"You're open to unusual forms of play today and your uninhibited approach attracts new people who find your fun-loving personality alluring. The cosmos is giving you permission to experience pleasure without commitment now. You can live comfortably in the moment and share your newfound sources of joy with equally open-minded individuals. C.S. Lewis wrote, ""For the present is the point at which time touches eternity."""
scorpio,2016-11-05,"You're eager to explore new ways to break up the routine of your daily life and free yourself from old patterns. However, the earthy Capricorn Moon helps to settle your energy in spite of your current rebellious attitude. Nevertheless, the unfulfilled potential for positive change fills the air and encourages you to take a chance and reinvent yourself. The only real risk today is doing nothing at all."
sagittarius,2016-11-05,"You are all set to break a few social rules today because you believe you can have a blast without getting into too much trouble. A smooth trine from sensual Venus in your sign to wild Uranus encourages you to experiment with your sense of identity. Radically changing your appearance might attract extra attention and make your day more fun. Although you may think anything goes, instant karma could strike without warning if you aren't considerate of the feelings of others. Oscar Wilde wrote, ""The smallest act of kindness is worth more than the grandest intention."""
capricorn,2016-11-05,"You're excited to sink into your fantasies today, but tend to keep your mental explorations to yourself. Seductive Venus in your 12th House of Secrets harmonizes with wild and crazy Uranus, activating desires that are normally suppressed. A long-standing romantic possibility can spark the air with excitement even without saying a word. Although you might be attracted to something or someone that exists only within your mind, don't relinquish your dreams until you check out their viability in the real world."
aquarius,2016-11-05,"You are quick to respond to unconventional sources of fun and are willing to try an irreverent approach to overcome someone's resistance. A brilliant Venus-Uranus trine inspires you to seek the enthusiastic support of your peers. Experimenting with alternative ways of interacting with others could produce surprising results today. Humanitarian Albert Schweitzer wrote, ""Do something wonderful; people may imitate it."""
pisces,2016-11-05,"Unexpected twists and turns can lure you off the beaten path today as unusual desires inspire your spontaneity. You might enjoy defying the rules now, but a momentary pleasure might cost more than you want to pay. Nevertheless, you're likely to enjoy yourself while the fun lasts as vivacious Venus forms a sweet trine with rebellious Uranus. Although irrepressible cravings embolden your behavior, you could astonish yourself and others with your current appetite for pleasure unless you set reasonable limits and stick to them."
aries,2016-11-06,"You have a choice to make every time you open your mouth today. People take your words to heart so readily that your logic hits home more than you realize. Fortunately, a calm and measured approach soothes others while a more emotional message can be agitating or even upsetting. But don't try to convince anyone your plan will work for anyone else. Let each person decide their course of action without your outside interference. There are many paths up the mountain, but the view of the Moon from the top is the same."
taurus,2016-11-06,"You're wondering about your place in the world today and whether or not your life has a purpose beyond your little local sphere. You might attempt to demonstrate your wisdom to your friends by telling them what you would do in a similar situation. But don't be surprised if no one seems interested in hearing your suggestions now. The old proverb, ""Never give advice unless asked"" makes plenty of sense if you want to cultivate peace instead of conflict."
gemini,2016-11-06,"Trying to keep your mouth shut may be a losing battle today because every time someone says something, you have more details to add to the story. Unfortunately, your facts might not be relevant, even if you think it's necessary for everyone to know the truth. Oftentimes, he who has the most valuable information wins. Albert Einstein wisely said, ""ninety-nine percent of genius is knowing what's important."" All data is not created equal."
cancer,2016-11-06,"Your anger is stirred when someone tries to elicit your help today. Your reaction can be confusing to others because they don't understand the source of your annoyance. They expect you to jump right in with a practical perspective that sheds light on their dilemma. But you're upset that people think you should drop everything and bail them out with your expert advice. Nevertheless, it's wise to assist others in their time of need the best you can. You never know when you might need that shoulder to lean on."
leo,2016-11-06,"It's as if you are using x-ray vision today to see right through someone's carefully constructed smokescreen and into their heart. Unfortunately, you may need to keep the truth to yourself if there's no one trustworthy you can lean on. Sometimes, it gets very lonely when you have no choice but to share a secret with a casual acquaintance. Nevertheless, you possess the determination to breakthrough barriers and reestablish solid connections with those closest to you. The power of love creates miracles."
virgo,2016-11-06,"The less deviation from your routine today, the easier it is for you to stay on track. You might even spend your time cleaning up a mess you made yesterday now that the storm has passed. It seems as if everyone wants you to tell them your plans for the future. Your tendency is to oversimplify a complex array of known facts, but today's interpersonal dynamics remain complicated. Luckily, your persistence solves the puzzle and leads to the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow."
libra,2016-11-06,"No matter how many unfinished chores linger on your plate today, you can't explore the exciting lands of relationship karma until you untangle the busyness of the day. Unfortunately, communication dynamics are blocked, increasing the level of difficulty you encounter when trying to explain your intentions to others. But don't just repeat your story if you're not understood. Let the ambiguity stand for now and try again once clarity returns tomorrow."
scorpio,2016-11-06,"People are drawn in by your magnetic charm without realizing the intensity of your message. Mysterious cosmic currents empower your words with magical healing properties. But some of the power is derived from your lack of specificity today, forcing others to fill in your descriptions with details of their own. Ben Franklin wrote, ""Tell me and I forget. Teach me and I may remember. Involve me and I learn."""
sagittarius,2016-11-06,"It's tempting to spend your entire day on one soapbox or another because your words just seem to flow eloquently today. As much as you can sway the opinions of others, you might stir up more of a commotion than you intend. You want everyone to support your positions now, but you expect them to fall in line behind you. You're quite surprised when you see that so many people want to start their own parade instead of joining you in yours. Nevertheless, keep marching to the music inside your head; that's what counts the most."
capricorn,2016-11-06,"It's as if your finger is on the zeitgeist of your network of friends and family today. You're not doing anything special, but your heightened sensitivity enables you to perceive the thoughts and feelings of others. You have a responsibility to use your psychic powers for the good of all, rather than for personal gain. As Lao Tsu wrote, ""A good traveler has no fixed plans, and is not intent on arriving."""
aquarius,2016-11-06,"You can feel the stress in your stomach beginning to churn and there doesn't seem to be anything you can do that will stop this process. You're stepping up to the mic and speaking publicly today on issues that concern you, your community and the environment. But you can be so dedicated to your cause that your extremist position could alienate the very same people you want as allies. Paradoxically, you will receive even more support when you speak from your heart and not from your head. Rumi wrote, ""With life as short as a half-taken breath, don't plant anything but love."""
pisces,2016-11-06,"You're aiming toward the future and are determined to mold it to your liking. Your main weapon is your ability to communicate and you're not afraid to rock the boat while delivering your message. Nevertheless, motivating others to think just like you is an exercise in futility. Everyone needs to bring their own perspective to the party and your job is to remind people to be true to themselves. Set an example by saying what's on your mind without diluting the truth."
aries,2016-11-07,"You may be grinning from ear to ear today, even if you don't know why. Jolly Jupiter encourages your optimism by making everything appear better than it is in reality. However, you ultimately remain a pragmatist. You have the gift of heightened charm now, along with the ability to follow through with deliberate action. You are a force to be reckoned with in business or in love. Unfortunately, you could lack motivation, so don't let your present complacency lull you into laziness. You could miss an amazing opportunity because it looks like work."
taurus,2016-11-07,"Your social skills are on point now and your responsible approach to relationships enhances your personal life. Your desire to create art, establish a new enterprise or organize a special event can fill you with irrepressible passion. Whatever attracts you now becomes a significant inspiration that brings you lasting pleasure while also earning you well-deserved respect. Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""Nothing great was ever achieved without enthusiasm."""
gemini,2016-11-07,"You might feel more accepted and appreciated now than you think you deserve. But don't allow a little snag of insecurity to ruin a wonderful experience today. Although a magical connection between resourceful Venus and joyous Jupiter blesses you with an abundance of what you love, you can't escape from the deeper issues that lurk behind everyone's smile. Nevertheless, the spirit of generosity is strong, so try to overlook your worries that cast a cloud on this otherwise magical day. As Monty Python sings, ""Always look on the bright side of life."""
cancer,2016-11-07,"Luck is on your side today and you don't even need to wave a magic wand to make your wishes come true. Charming Venus stimulates auspicious Jupiter now, bestowing your life with harmony and grace. Fortunately, relying on common sense works effectively as you establish the authority needed to further your cause. People respond to you in a friendly manner, encouraging you to share more of yourself than usual. Helen Keller wrote, ""Be happy with what you have while working for what you want."""
leo,2016-11-07,"You can't help but whistle a happy tune today whether you experience the loveliness of life through beautiful music or art, magical romance or the feeling of sweet satisfaction that comes from a job well done. Although sensual Venus combines with joyful Jupiter to create many memorable moments, an intense Sun-Pluto sextile adds gravity to an otherwise lightweight event. You are not content to indulge in pleasure without also delving into the shadows. Francis Bacon wrote, ""In order for the light to shine so brightly, the darkness must be present."""
virgo,2016-11-07,"The temptation of excess might distract you from your real work today, so it's crucial to find a balance between enjoying yourself and fulfilling your obligations on the job or at home. Even if your feelings are still developing, go ahead and express them anyhow. Sensual Venus holds the key to your current happiness; trust your instincts and move sensibly towards that which attracts you. Thankfully, you're safely swimming in protected emotional waters, so it's likely that a lovely encounter will manifest as financially profitable or romantically delicious. No risk, no reward."
libra,2016-11-07,You seem to possess the Midas touch today and can turn perfectly normal situations into lucrative ones. A creative connection between valuable Venus and propitious Jupiter also arouses your desires and is likely to bring you the sweet rewards of love or other sensual delights. But issues of money or love are more complex while passionate Pluto is also in the picture. Revealing your innermost fears and longings can create a strong foundation for a new relationship or repair damage in an existing one. Intimacy begins with conversation.
scorpio,2016-11-07,"A desert of emotional dryness can magically transform into a fertile meadow of comfort and fulfillment today. Fortunate Jupiter in your 12th House of Destiny feels the sweet vibes from flirtatious Venus, favoring a romantic or financial situation. However, excessive force is ill advised because you could overestimate your ability to make something happen in the moment. You needn't hurry now if you keep everything moving along in anticipation of what is ahead. Motivational coach Michael Altshuler wrote, ""The bad news is time flies; the good news is you're the pilot."""
sagittarius,2016-11-07,"The cosmos encourages you to take a chance on love or in business today and, fortunately, a gambling heart might just win as long as your intentions are honorable. A lucky Venus-Jupiter alignment sets the stage for a pleasurable gathering of friends or an intimate encounter with the object of your affection. Although pushing your luck appears to be a safe bet, pay attention to others for cues that tell you if you're overstepping your bounds. In the absence of warning signs, you're probably not going far enough."
capricorn,2016-11-07,"Asking for what you want today is the first step toward reaching your goals. Positive conditions for successful business dealings are likely while enriching Venus magically connects with bountiful Jupiter in your 10th House of Profession. Meanwhile, powerful Pluto in your sign favors risk-taking while preventing you from going overboard. Just be aware that others may need to be more cautious and might not be able to keep up with you now. Sometimes you must disconnect to express your true nature; eagles fly alone."
aquarius,2016-11-07,"The world is your oyster today, and the windows of opportunity are open wide. However, you may feel lazy with the moody Moon hanging out in your sign. Friendly aspects to generous Jupiter prompt you to expect rewards with little effort on your part. Nevertheless, it's crucial to start now even if it feels like there's no reason to rush. The Dalai Lama says, ""Happiness is not something ready-made. It comes from your own actions."""
pisces,2016-11-07,"You may be the lucky recipient of someone's appreciation today as an indulgent fantasy of yours teeters on the edge of becoming real. You're ready to celebrate the spiritual connection between loving Venus and buoyant Jupiter with a beautiful gift, a delectable feast or even a romantic tryst. Although you're apt to feel adored in your personal life or admired at work, it's crucial to be aware of the possibility of exaggeration or conceit. Thomas Merton wrote, ""Pride makes us artificial and humility makes us real."""
aries,2016-11-08,"Wrapping your mind around another strange twist of fate seems nearly impossible today, but you simply don't have a choice. You are being blown around on the fickle winds of change, preventing you from sinking into your feelings in any one spot. Take each surprise as it comes now, instead of resisting the entire string of them. As soon as you block your true destiny, you cut off your connection to your creativity. Hindu Guru Yogananda said, ""Life should be a continuous source of inspiration."""
taurus,2016-11-08,"Relationship issues are on the table today but you aren't willing to say the correct words just to placate your partner. Dreams of perfect love are meant to inspire you rather than bring you down. Falling short of your ideals is natural when you set your expectations so high. Be gentle with your heart and try not to let someone else's insensitivity influence your self-worth. Nevertheless, treating everyone with compassion -- including yourself -- adds a touch of the divine to all that you do."
gemini,2016-11-08,"You aspire to reach high for your dreams today, but it's hard to make a rational decision with illusions about your professional ambitions floating around your head. You must stay alert to keep up with all the surprises. Your normal agility serves you well now because you may have to change your tune in a moment's notice. Forget about long-term plans. How well you respond to current challenges sets the stage for the days ahead. You can do anything but you can't do everything."
cancer,2016-11-08,"You're called to push the limits of relationships today as previous assumptions about personal and professional connections are stripped away. A collaboration may reach the end of its road and recognizing that it's no longer serving a purpose could mark a turning point in a significant alliance. However, this is not an emotional issue, but a practical one; calmly consider your long-term goals before deciding whether to cut ties or develop them more deeply. If a partnership doesn't make you want to be a better person, you're in the wrong one."
leo,2016-11-08,"A blend of sweet and weird describes the events of the day as old dreams fade, projects are completed and a new cycle of social activity begins. Uncharacteristically, hiding under the covers is a more likely response to a misunderstanding today than working hard to make yourself heard. Unfortunately, self-pity isn't healthy for the soul and blaming someone else is just as futile. An environment where the truth can be expressed safely is ideal. Share your feelings with a supportive individual and you'll soon be on the fast track to healing whatever ails you."
virgo,2016-11-08,"You can see right through people's stories as you work your way toward the truth today. Although secrets may be revealed in intimate conversations, it's still difficult to tell what's most important. You tend toward indecisiveness now, so don't let someone else's negative opinion overrule your best instincts. Once you take the next step, support is likely to come from unexpected sources. Either you wake up now and start working for what you want or you let your dreams stay as dreams."
libra,2016-11-08,"Your emotions continue to pick up additional intensity today, but you could let your mind wander off without even realizing what happened. It's impossible to gauge the relative significance of any one idea with so many subtle cosmic influences coming at you from different directions. Thankfully, focusing on your feelings rather than your thoughts can help you successfully navigate through this confusing day. When the storms of change swirl around you, it's your challenge to find your way back to the center where you can restore your balance."
scorpio,2016-11-08,"Knowing where you stand in a relationship can be tricky now. Conversations may take on an edge of anxiety if you're afraid that time is running out. Even your smoothest moves might be interrupted by unexpected events today, so be prepared to make quick adjustments to remain on course. However, the more you try to keep things the same, the more stress you will encounter. Exercising flexibility instead of fearfully resisting the future is your best bet. Embracing change is an essential component of personal growth."
sagittarius,2016-11-08,"You're standing between two worlds today with one foot comfortably planted on familiar ground and the other ready to step into the unknown. You long for emotional connection, but you must proceed with caution because moving too quickly is just as bad as doing nothing at all. Even if others think they know all your tricks, you have more going on now than they realize. Fortunately, there's nothing wrong with keeping some of your plans to yourself. Work hard in silence; let your success be your noise."
capricorn,2016-11-08,"Following a plan could lead you to waste valuable time on activities that leave you in a state of frustration. Maintaining an adaptable attitude and adopting flexible expectations lower your levels of stress and give everyone room to breathe. Even if your day looks like it's careening out of control, find the presence of mind to keep things from flying off the rails. Buddha said, ""Stay centered; do not overstretch. Extend from your center; return to your center."""
aquarius,2016-11-08,"You might see a murky financial picture now, but your lack of clarity is likely more about self-doubt than money. Although your 2nd House of Income is a bit stressed today, your imagination can open a door where there was once only a wall. Nevertheless, envy and jealousy may bubble to the surface, making it difficult to escape the consequences of your actions. Instead of pushing for final resolution now, stay on your toes while allowing events to unfold naturally. President Theodore Roosevelt said, ""Comparison is the thief of joy."""
pisces,2016-11-08,"Your head and heart are wide open today, putting you in touch with multiple dimensions beyond this one. Keep in mind that the current cosmic pattern isn't great for self-restraint and common sense. In fact, you're able to justify irrational actions now and may prefer to leave reality in the dust. However, it's your job to find inspiration and encourage others to recognize the metaphysical magic behind the facade of the material world."
aries,2016-11-09,"You are boarding a fast train to the future only to discover that it stops at every station along the way. Emails and voicemails flood your inboxes today as energetic Mars rushes into intelligent Aquarius and your 11th House of Social Networking. However, just as you find your groove, stern Saturn appears to take your ticket and demands that your papers are in order. Instead of giving up out of frustration, confront the weakest link in your chain and fix it before it becomes a major problem. Buddha said, ""The trouble is, you think you have time."""
taurus,2016-11-09,"You are driven to excel in your career now, but might find making progress is more complicated than you prefer. You may visualize what success looks like but each step you take toward your destination seems to be blocked by circumstances beyond your control. Fortunately, you possess the ability to quickly change the dynamics by changing the rules of the game. Others are surprised by your radical tactics but they will likely pitch in to help once they see your new approach. Although a leopard can't change its spots, you can."
gemini,2016-11-09,"Doors are opening, showing you all the places you would like to go. Although distant horizons appear closer now that action-hero Mars charges into your 9th House of Faraway Places, obstacles pop up in your mind as fast as you can imagine your next adventure. Fortunately, you have time to make your dreams come true if your willpower is operating at full strength. Begin small, make sensible plans and then work toward manifesting your vision. The secret of getting ahead is getting started."
cancer,2016-11-09,"The dynamics of interpersonal relationships are harder to untangle now because your need for emotional connection conflicts with a growing desire for independence. Modifying your behavior prevents you from finding yourself back in a similar position down the road. Assertive Mars enters intellectual Aquarius today, allowing you to see your personal drama more objectively. At first, it may feel as if your stability unravels, but if you continue working on your inner resolve, you could see positive results sooner than you expect. If you want to be taken seriously, be relentless in your pursuit of the truth."
leo,2016-11-09,"Your attention is drawn away from your center and toward others now. However, a powerful undercurrent places a firm grip on your enthusiasm, preventing you from being washed away by the excitement of so many options. People seem more determined than ever to support your dreams while stabilizing Saturn grounds warrior Mars in your 7th House of Partners. Nevertheless, you must first confront your limitations in order to realize your future potential. Your past need not limit the possibilities ahead."
virgo,2016-11-09,"A new assignment may require a period of adjustment, so don't expect smooth sailing now. You are longing for a taste of freedom which inevitably increases the overall tension on your job. Although you might overreact by doing something extreme, there are brilliant solutions available that can produce positive change without needless disruption. Buried resentment could surface and undermine trust. However, you will discover the necessary resources to repair any damage if you simply focus on one issue at a time. No one can fault you when you take full responsibility for your behavior."
libra,2016-11-09,"It's rather annoying when prior commitments stop you from following your heart's desire. Passionate Mars blasts your 5th House of Spontaneity, motivating you to take charge of your day by making it more fun. However, your inner child is restrained by stern Saturn in the form of a parent, your boss or some other authority figure who demands that you meet your obligations before you do anything else. Abraham Lincoln said, ""You cannot escape the responsibility of tomorrow by evading it today."""
scorpio,2016-11-09,"You're driven to share the truth today without concern for the consequences. You are cleansed from your past experiences while impulsive Mars moves through your 4th House of Foundations, empowering you to tackle what's next as long as you start with the basics. Nevertheless, repressive Saturn steps into the picture, cautioning you to keep your intentions to yourself. You want to embrace the future, yet feel damned if you do and damned if you don't. Novelist Simon Van Booy writes, ""Every moment is the paradox of now or never."""
sagittarius,2016-11-09,"You're running around faster than ever today yet you struggle to accomplish even the simplest of tasks. You are incredibly busy thanks to powerhouse Mars's shift into high-frequency Aquarius and your 3rd House of Immediate Environment. But things are not what you expect, especially if you jump to conclusions before having all the facts. Unfortunately, you may find your trust shaken as authoritative Saturn intensifies the conflict between spontaneous self-expression and cautious suppression. Life is a balancing act; keep calm and carry on."
capricorn,2016-11-09,"Your focus is redirected to personal gains today. You might be thinking how you can increase your income, improve a relationship or gain new freedom at work. However, obstacles block your path to emotional satisfaction now. You may believe you need to attend a boring social function for the sake of appearances. Thankfully, you have a choice; you're not required to fake a happy face while ignoring your own needs. Your position will be strengthened in the long run as long as you are clear about what you're getting and what you wish to receive in return."
aquarius,2016-11-09,"It's nearly impossible to contain your excitement today. However, you quickly figure out how to keep cool so you don't shock people with your unorthodox behavior. You can feel the conflict internally as aggressive Mars enters your sign, prodding you into action. However, an unavoidable connection from strict Saturn threatens radical behavior with unwanted consequences. Welcome to the Karma Cafe where there is no menu; you will get served what you deserve."
pisces,2016-11-09,"You are longing to wrap yourself up in a cocoon because you have important self-improvement work to do that requires total privacy. Combative Mars morphs into a spiritual warrior as it slips into your 12th House of Invisibility. Unfortunately, you can't fully escape your worldly responsibilities while taskmaster Saturn is on your case. But this is no time to wallow in indecision, caught between conflicting cosmic messages. Push through your resistance and fulfill your obligations. Retreat to a secluded place later; in the meantime, growth and transformation can still happen in the light of day."
aries,2016-11-10,"You might not be happy about the intensity of your current feelings today, yet embracing them can bring you face to face with an important truth. It's often easier for you action-oriented Rams to be in motion rather than sitting still with your emotions. Instead of distracting yourself with busy work, focus your attention inward, follow the spiral of your thoughts and see where it leads. Sometimes, we don't learn by doing; we learn by reflecting on what we've done."
taurus,2016-11-10,"Someone you know may have an ax to grind today and you could be swept up in a melodrama that isn't even yours. For example, a business associate who shares a grievance with you might expect your support when negotiating with other people. Although this request puts you in an awkward position, there is no easy way to avoid it now. Thankfully, your even-tempered presence is a positive influence on all involved. Be the rock in the midst of the storm."
gemini,2016-11-10,"Navigating your way through an uncertain political climate at work is easier if you rely on intuition today rather than logic. However, your feelings may continue to develop and change throughout the day. Although you normally like to have an abundance of information at your disposal before making a decision, the data doesn't tell the whole story now. Nietzsche wrote, ""There are no facts, only interpretation."""
cancer,2016-11-10,"You have something important to get off your chest today, and you won't let an uncomfortable situation prevent you from speaking your truth. Although it's wise to consider the consequences before you say anything, it's just as important to be detached from the outcome. Although you may be cool, calm and collected when delivering your message, it's likely more radical than anyone might expect. Don't ramble on about nothing; step back and give others space to react. Your words are a powerful catalyst and can change the course of events."
leo,2016-11-10,"You are unusually sensitive today and may need to retreat from social activities to protect your heart. Normally you roaring Lions project more energy than you receive, but your compassion is so compelling now that it's difficult to maintain healthy boundaries as you pick up signals from others. It might even be impossible to tell if a feeling is yours or if it's coming from someone else. Nevertheless, it's not wise to dwell on your current confusion. Alan Watts wrote, ""Muddy water is best cleared by leaving it alone."""
virgo,2016-11-10,"You don't have the whole picture and, thankfully, you're acutely aware that there is more going on than meets the eye. People are hard to read because it seems like they're saying one thing while actually feeling something else. Instead of struggling to rectify the apparent inconsistency, just accept the ambiguity for now. What you're missing today will likely become apparent tomorrow."
libra,2016-11-10,"You are so certain about your own beliefs today that you can be an anchor for someone else. There is little doubt in your mind that you're able to see through other people's games; their clever stories and distracting shenanigans won't likely throw you off course. Nevertheless, it's still tricky to put your perceptions into words because the more you say now, the more confused everyone becomes. An Apache proverb advises, ""It is better to have less thunder in the mouth and more lightning in the hand."""
scorpio,2016-11-10,"Although you know exactly what you need to do today, it's not clear how best to initiate action. You can explain your ingenious ideas to your coworkers and they will likely encourage you to follow your dreams. But your comrades are of little help now when it comes to converting your thoughts into operation. Fortunately, your path will clear and your next step will be obvious tomorrow. In the meantime, put all the pieces of your plan in place in preparation for the launch of your big adventure."
sagittarius,2016-11-10,"Your internal process seems more important than external circumstances now, prompting you to slip in and out of daydreams instead of fully applying yourself at work. Although you can put on a good enough show that no one suspects anything is amiss, you could judge yourself rather harshly if you're not living up to your own expectations. Nevertheless, you will have a greater impact than you realize today if you just continue to dance with one foot in each world."
capricorn,2016-11-10,"Your long-term goals currently extend beyond your immediate career objectives. Although your individual success is usually a strong motivating factor, you are now more inclined to consider the needs of those around you. Fortunately, your altruism pays off because your personal satisfaction is tied to the fulfillment of those in your immediate environment. Dr. Mark Hyman writes, ""The power of community to create health is far greater than any physician, clinic or hospital."""
aquarius,2016-11-10,"You might begin your journey today with low visibility and without direction, as if you are lost in a storm cloud. Unfortunately, it's frustrating when you're unable to get your bearings or decide on a destination. However, the sky clears enough for you to see your way and set a path, even if it's slow-going at first. Your physical energy is on the rise, adding to your momentum throughout the day. Take your time to plot your course; things that start fast end fast."
pisces,2016-11-10,"You are like a psychic sponge, soaking up the vibrations from those around you. While many people are sympathetic and understanding, you are empathetic and can feel what others are experiencing. Your antennae are so sensitive now that you pick up every little ripple of emotion in the atmosphere, challenging you to stay focused on what's most important. Inspirational speaker Iyanla Vanzant says, ""Trust yourself enough to know who you can trust."""
aries,2016-11-11,"Adrenaline surges throughout your body today as you receive an extra boost of vitality. The Moon's presence in your sign encourages you to take a risk in a relationship by sharing your feelings, even if you're unsure where the conversation will lead. Divergent goals may produce heated conversation but the situation can resolve itself quickly when the Sun forms a creative connection with result-oriented Mars. Transforming the anger into constructive action smooths out the rough edges."
taurus,2016-11-11,"It's tempting to push your point home today, but your persistence can turn an interaction personal, which is something you don't necessarily want to do. Your audience won't be bullied into making a decision; back off once you make your case and allow time for your message to sink in. Resistance will fade quickly if you stay cool. Your boss, partner or potential investor will come around as long as he or she doesn't feel pressured by you. Silence speaks when words can't."
gemini,2016-11-11,"Unfiltered honesty can get you into hot water today. To speak the truth is almost always a good idea, but tempering it with diplomacy means the difference between provoking a laugh and starting a fight. You might try to light a fire under a sluggish friend or you could attempt to get a rise out of your partner just for the fun of it. Tread cautiously now; you may be ready to jump but it's hard to tell where you will land."
cancer,2016-11-11,"Although communication problems may create numerous headaches today, you are blessed with the tools to handle any misunderstandings that arise. Whether you are gathering with friends or spending the day at home, rest assured that most situations will unfold according to your plan -- even if you must step in and nudge things along. Go ahead and dream the impossible dream, but keep in mind that magic doesn't happen without plenty of hard work."
leo,2016-11-11,"You might be feeling so good-natured and effervescent today that a quiet evening at home is too laid-back for your liking. An exciting connection between the sparkling Sun and ardent Mars reintroduces you to your inner child. Invite a few buddies over for a last-minute party or go out dancing on the town; whatever stirs the pulse of the crowd will surely make your heart beat faster, too. Your bubbly personality and warm generosity leave a lovely lasting impression."
virgo,2016-11-11,"You have a lot of new facts at your disposal today, but your current tendency is to fall back on old familiar patterns. You could even start an argument just to prove that you're right, but it's healthier to simply acknowledge there are multiple points of view and move on. Too many commitments can get you into trouble if circumstances beyond your control delay your progress. Charles Darwin wrote, ""It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is the most adaptable to change."""
libra,2016-11-11,"You may wonder if your ideas are worthy of pursuit today as your brain buzzes with innovation and inspiration. However, someone could act as a catalyst to accelerate the pace of change, bringing both excitement and instability into your life. Thankfully, you are fully motivated with more-than-enough energy to rise to the occasion when the radiant Sun shines on macho Mars. Norman Vincent Peale wrote, ""Shoot for the Moon. Even if you miss, you'll land among the stars."""
scorpio,2016-11-11,"Impatient thinking combines with sloppy logic today, adding extra tension to complex interpersonal relationship dynamics. Before a passionate discussion turns into an outright battle, make sure that everyone is talking about the same issue. Although the cosmos gives you plenty of juice to defend your point of view, there's no sense in wasting it now by going around in circles with someone. Desmond Tutu instructs, ""Don't raise your voice. Improve your argument."""
sagittarius,2016-11-11,"You may struggle to assimilate new information and integrate it into a single picture today. You're so eager to show off what you know that you could make outrageous statements now, which can't be verified when push comes to shove. Balancing your high hopes with the basic facts can be tricky if you say more than you should. Overstating your position leaves you out on a limb; making your case in a low-key manner earns you the trust and respect you seek."
capricorn,2016-11-11,"It feels as if you've been playing the waiting game for a long time and now you're finally ready to make your move. Unfortunately, your judgment isn't very clear while Mercury forms an anxious aspect with inflationary Jupiter in your 10th House of Authority. However, you're advised by your friends to throw your usual caution to the wind. Allow yourself the luxury of unrestrained optimism since you possess the strength to go after what you want, and the innate common sense to know when to quit."
aquarius,2016-11-11,"Your nerves are on edge today as you're pulled back and forth between high anxiety and low stress. An uncomfortable Mercury-Jupiter connection clouds your thinking and tempts you to exaggerate the facts, especially if you're trying to sound practical. But a responsible Moon-Saturn trine enables you to apply your skills steadily while building a strong foundation. Thankfully, your persistent efforts will be rewarded, irritations will fade and your clever ability to influence others with the truth will return."
pisces,2016-11-11,"You are susceptible to emotional hyperbole, unrealistic promises or information overload today. Messenger Mercury's stressful alignment with gregarious Jupiter can make you very chatty or possibly even indiscreet. Be careful talking about friends or colleagues, since even an innocent remark may be perceived as gossip. Nevertheless, your enthusiasm bubbles over, empowering you to be a strong motivator and an effective champion for your ideas. Promote what you love instead of bashing what you hate."
aries,2016-11-12,"Expressing your feelings is unavoidable now as your version of reality is communicated in both refreshing and potentially embarrassing ways. You are quite busy projecting your thoughts into the future once interactive Mercury enters your 9th House of Higher Truth. Honesty only hurts when intentions are less than honorable, so speak from the heart. Integrity is choosing your actions based on values rather than personal gain."
taurus,2016-11-12,"It might be wise to ignore the incoming information if you find yourself totally overwhelmed. Turn off your mind and just let your body take over for a while when Mercury kicks off its visit to your 8th House of Deep Sharing. People's ideas are likely to keep you buzzing but instead of conversing, find a quiet place to sit alone and meditate. Talking can be enjoyable, but it's more superficial than substantial today; it's a means to get you moving rather than your destination. Ultimately, what you do matters more than what you say."
gemini,2016-11-12,"Expect plenty of conversation with lots of laughs today, and maybe even an argument or two thrown in the mix. You can't avoid intense interactions when mischievous Mercury enters your 7th House of Others, where it quickly runs into an anxious aspect with suspicious Pluto. However, maintaining your sense of humor allows for disagreements without unpleasantness. Not only is there a great opportunity to network, but also to move forward with a pet project. If a door was closed to you before, this is your chance to knock it down, present your case anew and get your point across. Fortune favors the bold."
cancer,2016-11-12,"There are too many things happening today and not enough hours to keep up with all of them. Your intentions are clear from the beginning and the outcome looks favorable, but you can grow weary of  trying to manage your conflicting emotions. Your vision broadens and you're willing to go wherever your mind takes you now. Even if you're a stay-at-home kind of person, the urge to get out and explore becomes irrepressible. J.R.R. Tolkien wrote, ""The greatest adventure is what lies ahead."""
leo,2016-11-12,"A flood of information rushes through your brain, deluging you with new ideas today. Conversations move along so quickly that it's difficult to keep up with the flow. Cerebral Mercury shifts into your 5th House of Self-Expression, drawing the spotlight in your direction. A simple nod or smile can seem threatening to someone who doesn't know your flirtatious style, so rein in your usually friendly nature in unfriendly territory. Learn self-control and you can master anything."
virgo,2016-11-12,"Ideas pop up in random conversations today and reveal a totally different way to look at your situation. Trickster Mercury's three-week visit to optimistic Sagittarius encourages you to cast aside your customary discretion and freely express your opinions. Keep an open mind even when solutions seem off-the-wall. However, accepting or rejecting them right away can be a trap. Watering your thoughts with patience will help to reveal which ones can take root and merit your attention."
libra,2016-11-12,"Nostalgia draws you back into the past, but the call of the future is loud once conceptual Mercury enters visionary Sagittarius. Even if emotions linger behind your thoughts today, your mind can lead you ahead as people show up with radical plans and unusual perspectives. Although your feelings may not fade away yet, you don't have to repeat history. An attitude adjustment consciously turns your life in a new direction. Mindfulness professor Jon Kabat-Zinn writes, ""You cannot stop the waves, but you can learn to surf."""
scorpio,2016-11-12,"Decisions you make now concerning your long-term goals impact your future in ways you can't yet imagine. Logical Mercury's shift into your 2nd House of Values emphasizes your desire for financial security. Meanwhile, the Moon's conjunction with independent Uranus in your 6th House of Work urges you to escape from the restraints of a job that's not aligned with your inner purpose. Of course, you need enough money to cover your expenses, but there's more to life than material success. Balance your professional ambitions with spiritual practices that resonate with your soul."
sagittarius,2016-11-12,"Breaking free of old habits enables you to discover new expressions of creativity. Innovative ideas enter your awareness with great regularity today, making it difficult to choose which ones are the most valuable. You are likely to become even more outspoken and try to share every thought that crosses your mind while chatty Mercury travels through your extroverted sign. Although you might be delighted with this mental boost, sensitive people may respond better to a less frenetic approach. You are like spicy food; for some people your brand of enthusiasm is an acquired taste."
capricorn,2016-11-12,"Your sensible calculations often lead you to wait for the perfect moment before starting something new. You might finally feel ready for the next phase of your journey as messenger Mercury enters adventurous Sagittarius, accentuating your 12th House of Endings. You can see the path ahead if you don't worry excessively about the roadblocks ahead. Author Nishan Panwar writes, ""If you live in fear of the future because of something that happened in the past, you will end up losing what you have in the present."""
aquarius,2016-11-12,"You are less concerned with receiving recognition today and more excited about participating in a group. Your interests are merging with those of a larger community now that adaptable Mercury is visiting your 11th House of Social Networking. It's as if you are leaving personal worries behind in order to become a part of the human collective. Fortunately, your optimism about where this new road leads inspires others to join you on your journey. Paradoxically, it's possible to maintain your individuality while going along with the crowd. In the long run, others will respect you for your authenticity and your unique outlook on life."
pisces,2016-11-12,"Too much pressure creates anxiety today, eventually prompting you to let off some steam. You might believe that being brutally honest will get things moving in the right direction. But it's also possible to make a positive impact on an influential person by passionately selling yourself or your favorite idea. Mercury's shift into buoyant Sagittarius can carry you away with impractical beliefs. Inspirational author William Arthur Ward wrote, ""The pessimist complains about the wind; the optimist expects it to change; the realist adjusts the sails."""
aries,2016-11-13,"Letting down your guard without thinking about the possible consequences is asking for trouble today. Depending upon your willingness to respond to change, the Sun's awkward aspect to surprising Uranus in your sign will either show you a viable escape route or unexpectedly turn your world upside down. Nevertheless, knowing when to reveal your vulnerability can be a magical key that enables you to successfully navigate through a difficult transition in a relationship. Dr. Joyce Brothers wrote, ""The best proof of love is trust."""
taurus,2016-11-13,"You're in no mood to negotiate with anyone today because you know exactly what you need now to be happy. However, you may be so fixed in your assumptions that you're willing to cut off your nose to spite your face. Unfortunately, your stubbornness can be costly if you refuse to move beyond your old conclusions. Stating your position is easy while the reflective Moon is hanging out in your earthy sign, but try not to back yourself into a corner. Listen carefully to the feedback you receive so you know where you can soften your stance. You gain more strength by bending than by breaking."
gemini,2016-11-13,"You are ready to face the music and do whatever is required to resolve a conflict on the job, but your behavior could elicit unexpected reactions. Although the Sun's presence in your 6th House of Work keeps you busy, you can't put off the inevitable. Just remember that your judgment may be slightly off today, so hedge your bets and, if necessary, change your mind later. Don't let frustration get the best of you. Even if you can't see your progress yet, a metamorphosis has already begun. Wayne Dyer wrote, ""Transformation literally means going beyond your form."""
cancer,2016-11-13,"Managing your energy is tricky business because you might have to make several abrupt about-faces throughout the day. Unfortunately, the mellow Taurus Moon urges you to resist sudden change today. You don't mind modifying your agenda now as long as it's done on your terms. Controlling your creative force empowers you to tackle the big issues with a good balance of hope and logic. President Theodore Roosevelt said, ""With self-discipline most anything is possible."""
leo,2016-11-13,"Unnecessary extravagance stirs up a hornet's nest of trouble today. Let caution be your guide since it might be challenging to negotiate for what you want. Being generous is one thing, but going overboard with lavish gifts or outrageous promises isn't helpful right now. Your magnanimity may prompt a misunderstanding. Although your mind might be racing with bright ideas, one careless word can provoke an irrational reaction that only escalates the tension. If you want to be appreciated, give something money can't buy."
virgo,2016-11-13,"You can transform your ideas into action now without running into resistance, especially if you receive support from encouraging friends and generous allies. However, conditions begin to shift unexpectedly as a messy alignment from the Sun to erratic Uranus turns your day wonky. Stay light on your feet so you're able to move quickly under these rapidly changing conditions. Psychologist Timothy Leary wrote, ""If you want to change the way people respond to you, change the way you respond to people."""
libra,2016-11-13,"You receive mixed signals from the cosmos today and may need to switch gears to match the various rhythms of colleagues and friends throughout the day. Concentration is required in all that you do, leaving little margin for error. You might believe you're on target now, but an edgy Sun-Uranus aspect might prompt you to blow up at someone or run for the hills without warning. Demonstrate your strength of character by using this high-frequency energy to invent new ways to increase your productivity at home or at work."
scorpio,2016-11-13,"There's plenty of time to recover from the destabilizing cosmic forces that recently rocked your world. Awkward relationship dynamics are not fully resolved, but there's time to regroup before you need to jump into the fray again. Although explosive Uranus is on the scene trying to shake things up, the reliable Taurus Moon graces you with enough common sense that you won't risk too much. French novelist Gustave Flaubert wrote, ""Be steady and well-ordered in your life so that you can be fierce and original in your work."""
sagittarius,2016-11-13,"You possess the stamina to overcome almost any obstacle but directing your efforts today takes a heavy dose of discipline. Nevertheless, you can't slow down now or you'll attract Uranus the Awakener to shock you back to reality. The urge to do things in your own way may overpower your willingness to compromise. Wounded feelings can provoke angry responses, so do your best to sidestep conflict whenever possible. Plant seeds of peace and watch them grow."
capricorn,2016-11-13,"Seeing a situation in a fresh light makes a world of difference today. Once your perspective begins to change, go out of your way to talk about your new point of view with anyone who will listen. Fascinating ideas are stimulated by wild Uranus now, but adapting your solutions to the slower pace around you is more productive in the long run. Author Joyce Meyer wrote, ""Patience is not the ability to wait, but the ability to keep a good attitude while waiting."""
aquarius,2016-11-13,"Although you may experience bouts of self-doubt today, you still have all the necessary resources to reach your goals. However, an electrifying Sun-Uranus misalignment can throw you for a loop, demanding your full and immediate attention. But your thinking might be too progressive now, revealing that being ahead of the curve isn't always the place to be. As noted in the Irish proverb, ""A good retreat is better than a bad stand."""
pisces,2016-11-13,"Minor differences of opinions can grow larger today, making cooperation difficult even in the friendliest of circumstances. But sticking to your methods brings results; changing horses midstream is not advised now because you could end up heading in the wrong direction. Methodically handling one specific problem at a time is far more likely to be successful than turning an emotional crisis into an endless debate. Sherlock Holmes said, ""Never theorize before you have data. Invariably, you end up twisting facts to suit theories instead of theories to suit facts."""
aries,2016-11-14,"Although you might long for peace and quiet, you probably can't relax with so much going on in your life. The Taurus Full Moon shines in your 2nd House of Personal Resources, offering a stabilizing antidote for the complexities that arise now. However, if the tension of your daily routine becomes overwhelming, take some time to remember the higher truths and divine delights that bring you solace in the midst of a storm. A healthy dose of self-reflection enables you to affirm recent choices and empowers you to be more optimistic about reaching your goals."
taurus,2016-11-14,"You can be so single-minded that others can't get past your bullheadedness. Nevertheless, the Taurus Full Moon lands in your 1st House of Personality, reminding you to remain practical in a world that seems to have lost touch with reality. Unfortunately, expecting too much from others can lead to grave disappointment. Words are meaningless without intent and follow-through, so avoid wasting time and energy on people who are all talk and no action. There's no need to be a leader or a follower if you're blazing your own path."
gemini,2016-11-14,"Commitments recently made at work may be challenging to fulfill unless you carefully reassess your resources and allocate the time required to finish the job. Unfortunately, your heart may be somewhere else as the pastoral Taurus Full Moon lights up your 12th House of Spirituality. Your current metaphysical orientation leaves you more interested in otherworldly pursuits than meeting your mundane obligations. Finding time to recharge your batteries is good for the soul, but does not relieve you of your responsibilities. As in most things in life, balance is the key to happiness."
cancer,2016-11-14,"Relationships may be so complicated now that you long to get back to your roots. Fortunately, the Taurus Full Moon brightens your 11th House of Networking, reminding you to reestablish your priorities and reconnect with your friends, instead of concentrating on only one person or project. You may even feel like a social butterfly as you explore your need for connections within your community. Nevertheless, the difference between success and failure seems to depend on the amount of support you receive from others. More than ever, it takes a village to create the world you want."
leo,2016-11-14,"Your current determination reflects your unwavering desire to bring recent changes at home to fruition. But the Taurus Full Moon illuminates your 10th House of Public Life, shifting your focus back to your career. Your mind is brimming with practical solutions to meet your obligations at work so you can return to your personal life. Tackling the toughest tasks first will ultimately give you the widest range of freedom to take advantage of all the opportunities that lie ahead. To paraphrase Napoleon Hill, shine your own light and don't worry about the darkness, for that is when the stars shine brightest."
virgo,2016-11-14,"You desperately need a break from the pressures of your regular routine now. The practical Taurus Full Moon spotlights your 9th House of Higher Education, suggesting you could improve your work prospects by taking a class or attending a job-related seminar. No matter how you choose to widen your horizons, expanding the scope of your activities can be constructive, as long as you're realistic about your schedule. Visualizing your future exactly as you desire is a great start, but you must follow through with determination and diligence if you want to manifest your destiny."
libra,2016-11-14,"Moderating your enthusiasm is part of an overall strategy to keep things simple now. The pragmatic Taurus Full Moon highlights your 8th House of Shared Resources, inspiring you to team up with responsible people who can help you achieve your vision of success. Relying on someone you can trust provides a reassuring sense of solidarity, but if your companion doesn't deliver on his promises, be prepared to reevaluate the arrangement. Martin Luther King said, ""We must accept finite disappointment, but never lose infinite hope."""
scorpio,2016-11-14,"You might be required to work extra hard to meet the expectations of others now. The dependable Taurus Full Moon energizes your 7th House of Partnerships, leaving very little room for ambiguity in personal and professional relationships. Nevertheless, don't be fooled by a manipulative person because you are swimming in strong emotional currents now. Even if you think you know what you want, your feelings are still in flux. What appears as someone else's instability may in fact be a reflection of your own."
sagittarius,2016-11-14,"Maintaining your satisfaction on the job can be more work than it seems at first glance. Although the Taurus Full Moon accentuates your 6th House of Employment, its opposition to the Sun in your 12th House of Fantasy is quite confusing. In fact, there may be a great chasm between your dreams and the tasks at hand. Consider all your options before making a final decision about your new direction. Franklin Roosevelt said, ""The only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today."""
capricorn,2016-11-14,"Your desires are straightforward now, prompting you to ask for exactly what you want. Nevertheless, the Taurus Full Moon activates your 5th House of Romance, triggering powerful feelings and foolish actions. Although your emotions aren't necessarily convenient, try not to suppress them or pressure may build until it suddenly erupts. Intimacy in a relationship can lead to jealousy while the evocative Moon forms difficult aspects with sensual Venus and possessive Pluto. Rather than turning molehills into mountains, focus on the simple pleasures that create enduring memories. Love is best given without expectation."
aquarius,2016-11-14,"You are being buffeted around by complex cosmic currents now, so your best course of action is to simplify your life as much as possible. In fact, the earthy Taurus Full Moon emphasizes your 4th House of Domestic Conditions, encouraging you to seek comfort in sweet pleasures. Your tendency to lean on your friends and family now may be effective in the short-term, but it's hard to deny the excitement you feel as the path to your future opens before your eyes. Keep in mind, the loftier the building, the deeper the foundation must be laid."
pisces,2016-11-14,"Oddly enough, you find great satisfaction now in creating your schedule and adhering to it as closely as possible. The sensible Taurus Full Moon settles in your 3rd House of Immediate Environment, requiring you to establish a healthy balance between pursuing your dreams and managing the logistics of everyday life. Although you might feel torn by these contrasting paths, the Moon's opposition to the enigmatic Scorpio Sun helps you realize that taking care of routine tasks gives you a solid base from which you can seek a higher purpose."
aries,2016-11-15,"It's all too easy to drift off course today, favoring fantasy over reason. Although the antsy Gemini Moon intrigues you with a variety of options as you create your schedule for the day, your best ideas may be blocked by circumstances out of your control. However, if you encounter resistance, don't continue to force the issue. Navigating around problems is the most efficient way to get what you want now. Just remember that avoidance is not the same thing as resolution."
taurus,2016-11-15,"Your thoughts are smoothly transformed into deeds today, making this a great time to initiate action. Don't wait for a better moment to start a new project, since warrior Mars is ready to fight on your behalf. All forms of communication are emphasized now, but be extra careful when discussing finances. Although the flighty Gemini Moon can distract you from your real work, a little extra vigilance goes a long way to keep you on track. Inventor Alexander Graham Bell wrote, ""Concentrate all your thoughts upon the work at hand. The Sun's rays do not burn until brought to a focus."""
gemini,2016-11-15,"You are inspired to put your best ideas into motion now, especially if your current goals are motivating you to do something you've never done before. It's one thing to have a creative vision about your future, yet it's particularly exciting when you can execute a plan so easily. But even if you have no specific destination in mind, it may be time to playfully explore new avenues of adventure in the most spontaneous ways possible. Aldous Huxley wrote, ""The secret of genius is to carry the spirit of the child into old age."""
cancer,2016-11-15,"There may be a flurry of activity in your life today, even if it's hidden from view. The chatty Gemini Moon is visiting your 12th House of Secrets, tempting you to share your innermost fantasies with someone you admire. But you make everything appear less complicated than it is now if you're playing a shell game with reality. A feeling arises, you say something about it and then you pretend it never happened. However, there are some things better left unsaid. Even if you choose to withhold your intentions from others, at least don't hide them from yourself."
leo,2016-11-15,"You're able to take command with such style and grace today that you make work seem like child's play. In fact, your life can feel like a celebration, filled with playful conversations and social invitations. But you may be secretly suffering in silence now if you're struggling to meet your deadlines. The good news is that asking for help isn't a sign of weakness. It requires more courage to admit you can't do something on your own than to fake competence. Teamwork makes the dream work."
virgo,2016-11-15,"Although you might be quite impatient today, your perseverance will pay off as long as you don't lose sight of your ultimate destination. The Gemini Moon typically diffuses your energy, but a supportive Mercury-Mars sextile gives you enough endurance to complete whatever you start. Nevertheless, you may be confounded by too many choices. Concentrate your efforts on the most vital tasks even if you must temporarily ignore other obligations. Remember, you don't have to be perfect at everything to be successful."
libra,2016-11-15,"Expressing your fantasies through artistic creations or romantic love can take up a significant chunk of your time now. You may even wonder how to make your dreams come true while the curious Gemini Moon floats through your 9th House of Adventure. Nevertheless, your capacity to imagine is currently greater than your ability to integrate fantasy with reality. Be selective when deciding which goals to pursue or you could end up chasing your tail instead of your destiny."
scorpio,2016-11-15,Connections with new people are only alluring if they are interesting enough to hold your attention after the first round of casual communication. You're not interested in superficial conversations that demonstrate someone's cleverness while the Moon hangs out in your 8th House of Deep Sharing. You yearn to explore the mysteries of the dark shadows and the unknown recesses of the mind with someone who is willing to go as far as you. An intellectually provocative and emotionally mature person can be just what the doctor ordered to spice up your life.
sagittarius,2016-11-15,"Your emotional flexibility and nonjudgmental attitude attract intriguing people who motivate you personally and professionally. There's no denying the fact that relationships take center stage while the Moon camps out in your 7th House of Partnerships. Fortunately, harmonious aspects to the lighthearted Gemini Moon ensure meaningful communication if you're willing to engage your heart fully. Balance your interpersonal activities by taking time for self-reflection, since the most important work you do now may be  behind the scenes."
capricorn,2016-11-15,"You're lost in the contradiction between work and play, uncharacteristically unable to tell one from the other now. Your tendency is to contract and act responsibly when required, but the flirtatious Gemini Moon in your 6th House of Employment encourages more frivolous activities. Indulging in your fantasies is not a wasteful pastime, especially if it motivates you to try something you've never experienced. A Japanese proverb states, ""Vision without action is a daydream. Action without vision is a nightmare."""
aquarius,2016-11-15,"Although you're able to accomplish more than you expect today, you may have more opportunities for pleasure than time to enjoy them. The carefree Gemini Moon's presence in your 5th House of Romance arouses playful feelings. The innocence of your heart could even bring moments of foolishness, but it's better to be naive and awkward now than to protect yourself by closing down to avoid mistakes. In the end, you only regret the chances you didn't take."
pisces,2016-11-15,"Exploring previously suppressed emotions can help you rediscover your true purpose and give you the strength you need to reach your goals. The inquisitive Gemini Moon's presence in your 4th House of Roots entices you to dig even deeper into the origins of your current thoughts and feelings. Although you may become a data scavenger as you gather information now, at some point you must make a crucial decision before the overload of facts strains your nervous system. Sufi poet Rumi wrote, ""The inspiration you seek is already within you. Be silent and listen."""
aries,2016-11-16,"It's one thing to dream about jumping on an airplane for a quick weekend getaway, but it's something quite different to actually do it. Although plotting this type of escape might be a fun pastime, you'll likely think about it in a more practical manner later in the day. Nevertheless, impulsively buying tickets -- or doing anything irresponsible -- is probably not a great idea at this time. Enjoy getting lost in the fantasy but see how you feel about it in a few days to avoid the consequences of buyer's remorse."
taurus,2016-11-16,"You have mixed emotions about revealing your innermost secrets today -- even to people you trust. But you're not as worried about someone else's reactions to your disclosure as you are about your next move. You don't know if you're ready to follow through on your intentions now, but you realize that you won't be able to take back what you say. Tread carefully while continuing to consider your options. However, in the end, you're less likely to regret the things you've done than the things you didn't do when you had the chance. Tony Robbins says, ""It is in your moments of decision that your destiny is shaped."""
gemini,2016-11-16,"Your cerebral antennae are fully extended today as you scan your environment for something new and exciting to fill your day. Unfortunately, your calendar might already be so overloaded that there's no time for extracurricular pursuits. Nevertheless, your restlessness may be so acute that you're willing to deal with an awkward situation later in order to satisfy your boredom now. Thoreau wrote, ""Success usually comes to those who are too busy to be looking for it."""
cancer,2016-11-16,"Maintaining a consistent outlook on life is tricky today because one moment you think you can do anything you set your mind to and a few minutes later you believe you'll fail at even the simplest task. Obviously, neither of these two extremes are true. Instead of allowing your confidence to ebb and flow with arbitrary emotional tides, take control of your day by establishing realistic goals and striving to achieve them. However, the fastest way to build self-esteem is to do exactly what you're afraid of doing. Fear looks, faith jumps."
leo,2016-11-16,"You're the go-to person that everyone likes now because they think you have all the answers. However, you're less interested in finding the solution to someone else's problems than you are in escaping your own. Although you know that you can't avoid your obligations forever, you're still eager to test the limits if you can find others to join you in your little adventure. Keep in mind the words of Winston Churchill, ""The price of greatness is responsibility."""
virgo,2016-11-16,"An unresolved family issue lurking in the shadows of your consciousness might suddenly explode into a full-blown melodrama today. Although it shouldn't be a surprise, it's still shocking when you realize the complexity of the situation. You can see many possible scenarios as you contemplate the various ways in which the current events could unfold. Naturally, you want to take everyone under your wing and save them from drowning in bad choices. Nevertheless, adopting a more detached approach enables you to be the calm in the center of the storm while empowering others to make their own decisions."
libra,2016-11-16,"Blaming someone else for your current anxiety isn't the healthiest way to deal with your fears. Granted, irresponsible behavior can be quite upsetting if you assume that everyone will do exactly as promised. Unfortunately, you are likely to be let down today when reality doesn't match your expectations. However, other people are just triggers, reminding you of painful memories from long ago. There is no reason to give your power away needlessly. Stop cheating on your future with your past."
scorpio,2016-11-16,"Concentrating on your work is challenging when there are so many other things that seem more interesting in the moment. Although exploring the complexity of human emotions in a relationship is fuel for your soul, there are pressing mundane issues that are currently fighting for your attention. Thankfully, you possess the power to aim your thoughts in any direction you choose. J.P. Morgan wrote, ""The first step toward getting somewhere is to decide that you are not going to stay where you are."""
sagittarius,2016-11-16,"You are excited about the potential you see in nearly everything that happens today. People around you are extremely talkative and you're intrigued by what you hear. Nevertheless, you have more ideas than you know what to do with now; however, your inspiration could easily be drowned out by the intellectual noise of your interactions. Consciously limiting your social interactions is the best thing you can do to increase your current productivity. Stephen Covey reminds us that we're not the product of our circumstances; we're the products of our decisions."
capricorn,2016-11-16,"You prefer to start on one task and stick with it until every last detail is complete. However, you won't likely have that luxury today with so many different activities vying for your time. Although you might try to simplify your schedule, there isn't very much wiggle room on your calendar. Instead of wasting resources attempting the improbable, surrender to the complexity of the day with a smile. After all, the difference between success and failure is your attitude."
aquarius,2016-11-16,"You are eager to hang out with your colleagues in a social setting today, even if it means that you're a little less productive than you planned. It's not that you're avoiding work; you're simply reevaluating your life in a context larger than your job. Relying on friends to give you honest feedback is an important part of your current thinking process as you explore a variety of possible plans that can take you in very different directions. Remain neutral for now; Thomas Jefferson said, ""Delay is preferable to error."""
pisces,2016-11-16,"You might expend quite a bit of energy defending your professional goals today because you actually believe them to be achievable. However, even your most sensible idea becomes unrealistic once it's over-inflated. It's tempting to take a simple plan and make it so complicated that you could not possibly execute it. Unfortunately, figuring it out as you go along isn't a wise strategy, either. Take a step back, clear your mind, and refresh your perspective before moving forward."
aries,2016-11-17,"Putting your life into perspective is a formidable challenge now. However, opening your heart makes more sense than allowing discouragement to turn into anger. The sensitive Cancer Moon's harmonious trine to compassionate Neptune softens your antagonistic approach and increases your patience with others. Don't be disappointed by a lack of progress if you end up having more time to solidify your plans. Motivational Guru Ralph Marston writes, ""What you do today can improve all your tomorrows."""
taurus,2016-11-17,"Imaginative friends and coworkers cook up ideas that inspire your dreams or confuse you with inaccurate information. Your sense of compassion deepens as spiritual Neptune encourages greater participation in altruistic activities. You can take charge and be a charismatic leader now or, perhaps, fall under the spell of the charming charlatan. Applying some good old-fashioned Taurus common sense tempers fantasy with reality. Keeping your head in the game allows you to enjoy the best of both worlds."
gemini,2016-11-17,"You may be disillusioned with your chosen life path today, dreaming about switching your occupation to a more meaningful pursuit. Talking about your dissatisfaction can elicit constructive feedback while your fantasies inspire you to reach beyond the ordinary now. But don't waste your energy or anyone else's time by endlessly whining about things you have no intention of changing. Louse Hay writes, ""I do not fix problems. I fix my thinking. Then problems fix themselves."""
cancer,2016-11-17,"Making your dreams come true feels impossible today while you're flooded with feelings that can't be put into language. It's as if you want to float balloons of hope, yet your words fall short of communicating what you wish to say. It's difficult to stay grounded when your head is in the clouds, yet maintaining contact with reality enables your unwavering faith to lead you to create a more fulfilling vision of the future. Finding answers to personal questions through spiritual insights is possible if you're willing to do the work."
leo,2016-11-17,"It takes quite a bit of effort to keep reality and fantasy separate, but taking time to tell the difference can be used to your advantage. Your relationship expectations continue to grow more idealistic today, yet the profound effects of nebulous Neptune are quite subtle. A pattern of disillusionment followed by re-enchantment seems to be a recurring theme these days. Although you might feel unsteady when emotions overtake logic, it's safe to trust your intuition now. Your heart knows things your mind can't explain."
virgo,2016-11-17,"You are both the source and recipient of compassion that flows all around you today if doubt and fear are not standing in the way. Your uncharacteristic comfort with vulnerability allows the walls of protection to come tumbling down. Softness becomes your strength when you take the lead and open up to individuals you can trust. The current planetary emphasis on your 7th House of Relationships indicates that meaningful collaboration is more rewarding now than success on your own. Bertrand Russell wrote, ""The only thing that will redeem mankind is cooperation."""
libra,2016-11-17,"You might notice a shift from inspiration to perspiration now that you're required to work harder to achieve your goals. You may be torn between artistic pursuits and more mundane obligations, but you know that methodically working on routine tasks is your most practical path to success. Nevertheless, daydreams and fantasies stimulate your best ideas. Ultimately, your current challenge is to use your creativity to increase your efficiency. Vincent van Gogh wrote, ""Normality is a paved road: It's comfortable to walk, but no flowers grow on it."""
scorpio,2016-11-17,"Honoring your dreams is essential now because they are the outlines of your future that you can color in with your actions. Luckily, there is real magic in the air while the evocative Moon dances with ethereal Neptune in your 5th House of Creativity. Nevertheless, concentrate on the distant horizon, where the petty problems of daily life fade into the clouds of hope and expectation. Finding time away from your regular grind motivates you with fantasies that reveal the unrealized potential ahead."
sagittarius,2016-11-17,"You wish you could slip away and escape from the world to spend more time closer to home tending to matters involving family and friends. Lunar aspects to mystical Neptune in your 4th House of Roots invite you to embark on an inner journey. However, don't confuse the dream realms with the three-dimensional world; your pragmatic attitude minimizes the chances for disappointment later on. Meister Eckhart wrote, ""What we plant in the soil of contemplation, we shall reap in the harvest of action."""
capricorn,2016-11-17,"Facts get lost in the clouds of illusion today as your rational mind is tickled into submission by fuzzy Neptune in your 3rd House of Communication.

Pay attention when the cosmos reminds you that magic can occur even in the most ordinary setting. Confucius wrote, ""Everything has its beauty but not everyone can see it."""
aquarius,2016-11-17,"Although you may experience financial uncertainty now, your due diligence regarding money matters should help to clear things up. Unfortunately, your experience with the material world might not live up to your expectations, so remember that the purpose of your dreams is to open your mind to something greater. There's no reason to feel sorry for yourself if reaching your goals takes longer than you wish. German author Goethe wrote, ""In all things it is better to hope than to despair."""
pisces,2016-11-17,"The difference between inspiration and illusion is elusive now. A series of aspects to surreal Neptune in your sign feeds the fire of fantasies with goals that aren't necessarily rooted in reality. Nevertheless, dreams are being seeded, so nourish them with compassion and faith. The thoughts you nurture now can grow into enduring expressions of your highest ideals. Keep calm and plant something wonderful."
aries,2016-11-18,"Deeply rooted passions fuel your desire to connect with someone you love today. However, it may be tricky to articulate exactly what you want; you could miss your opportunity if you can't put your thoughts into words right now. But be wary of fabricating an emotional pipe dream because you might end up fooling yourself more than anyone else. Flights of fancy can be fun, but they're not a substitute for the truth. Keep it real when it comes to matters of the heart."
taurus,2016-11-18,"Contradictions abound today, making it exceptionally difficult to find your way as you drift through uncharted waters. Logical Mercury's square to indefinite Neptune widens the gulf between your ideals and the practical world in which you must exist. No matter what happens now, open your mind to imagine new goals, even if your actions are currently restrained. Aerosmith sang, ""Dream on. Dream until your dreams come true."""
gemini,2016-11-18,"Explaining your thought process can be particularly problematic today, especially if you're talking with a pragmatic person who wants you to deal strictly in numbers and facts. However, imagination is at the forefront of your world as psychic images and fleeting impressions flood your mind. If your creative ideas aren't given an enthusiastic reception now, hold onto them until someone arrives who is capable of understanding your bold vision. French author La Rochefoucauld wrote, ""Narrow-minded people generally condemn what is beyond their comprehension."""
cancer,2016-11-18,"It's easy to misread a situation today and accept responsibility for more than you can handle. Mental Mercury on its journey through farseeing Sagittarius squares illusory Neptune, inspiring you to make grandiose promises that you struggle to keep. You are itching to speak, even if you're unsure of your intentions. Beginning a heartfelt conversation could be a blessing if you're motivated by a deep desire for the truth. But if you are expressing dissatisfaction, you might push someone away. You don't need a pile of instructions when your intuition will work better than the facts."
leo,2016-11-18,"Your optimism about a creative project may be off the charts today, but you could be overstating your position simply to make your point. You might confuse your coworkers if you sound more certain than you actually are now. But it's not your responsibility to manage everyone else's expectations. Be true to your heart and give others enough room to do the same. Respect people's feelings; even if it doesn't mean much to you, it could mean everything to them."
virgo,2016-11-18,"A small difference of opinion can balloon into a major disagreement today. Unfortunately, the communication planet's square to fantasy-prone Neptune promotes exaggeration when feelings are presented as facts. Nevertheless, you're able to keep your head in the clouds if your feet are solidly planted back on earth. Warren Buffett said, ""I don't look to jump over seven-foot bars; I look around for one-foot bars that I can step over."""
libra,2016-11-18,"Make sure you stick to the facts today because cerebral Mercury's confident square with confusing Neptune lures you into the least certain realms of your imagination. Unfortunately, your unbridled enthusiasm can trick you as well as others. Your sense of perception might be warped and you won't even know it until you check out your conclusions with someone you trust. Futurist Elon Musk wrote, ""I think it's very important to have a feedback loop, where you're constantly thinking about what you've done and how you could be doing it better."""
scorpio,2016-11-18,"Your stories might have very little in common with reality today, yet you could go on denying that something is amiss. However, your outlook on life is distorted by fantasy while Mercury the Winged Messenger flies through adventurous Sagittarius and squares blurry Neptune. What you say and what you hear now is likely disconnected from the truth. Nevertheless, you know what you want and imagine that your satisfaction will be found just around the next corner. Don't worry if people misjudge you; you'll be fine as long as you hold onto your integrity."
sagittarius,2016-11-18,"You could lose your temper today if you believe that someone recently undermined your efforts. However, it's nearly impossible to prove that others don't have your best interests at heart. Thankfully, the pieces begin to fall into place when a close friend steps forward to help you see the current situation in a more positive light. Finally, you gain the motivation to transform lingering fear of the unknown into trust in the cosmos. Author Victor Hugo writes, ""There is nothing like a dream to create the future."""
capricorn,2016-11-18,"Someone may awaken you to the inspiration potential of your imagination when communicator Mercury in your 12th House of Soul Consciousness squares illusory Neptune.

Author Gary Zukav wrote, ""What is behind your eyes holds more power than what is in front of them."""
aquarius,2016-11-18,"No matter what kind of action you take now, it either feels like you aren't doing enough or like you're doing too much. It's nearly impossible to know the amount of pressure to apply to influence reality in your favor. Oddly, you might have trouble getting your bearings but there's no reason to be overly concerned. The outcome of even the simplest conversation is unpredictable today, because everything twists and turns in unexpected ways. Author Roald Dahl wrote, ""Those who don't believe in magic will never find it."""
pisces,2016-11-18,Discriminating between wishful thinking and realistic possibilities is the most important task before you now. Your judgment is blurred by your own dreams as a magical mystical weekend starts off with an enchanted evening. Don't make any major commitments or take what you hear today too seriously. Promises made in the heat of the moment may not stick long enough to matter in the long run. Indulge your imagination without doing anything you might later regret.
aries,2016-11-19,"You might think you have your facts in order today, only to discover you've landed on Fantasy Island without anyone who understands your plight. Perhaps your comprehension is so extensive that your perspective doesn't fit into a normal conversation now, leading people to misinterpret your intentions. Nevertheless, your world is tinted with rose-colored hues. Don't give up trying to get your point across just because the escape route seems so inviting. Author Virginia Woolf wrote, ""You cannot find peace by avoiding life."""
taurus,2016-11-19,"Hearing innocent comments as if they were critical remarks can complicate conversations with friends today. Fragile feelings make you extra sensitive to the opinions of others, so doublecheck your impressions before jumping to conclusions that undermine trust.

gemini,2016-11-19,"You're more intrigued with what you can't see in the shadows today than what you can see in the direct sunlight. Magnetic Venus is collaborating with misty Neptune in your 10th House of Authority, casting a soft focus over what you think you know.

In the meantime, remember the words of author Joe Meno, ""Imagination is the place where all the important answers live."""
cancer,2016-11-19,"You may be quite willing to cut someone some extra slack today, allowing them to escape from the consequences of their actions. It's not that anyone is pulling the wool over your eyes; in fact, you know exactly what's going on now that the illusions are fading to reveal the unadorned truth. Nevertheless, your current spiritual inclinations inspire you to see the silver linings, even in the darkest of storm clouds. A compassionate heart is a powerful heart."
leo,2016-11-19,"Old grievances fade away as forgiveness replaces blame. Nevertheless, you can't rely on your words to convey what's in your heart now because your logic is overpowered by your compassion. You might seek safety by trying to stick with the facts, but this evasive tactic will not keep you out of trouble today. When in doubt, take the high road; the view is better and the karma is sweeter."
virgo,2016-11-19,"You come across more forcefully to others today than you realize. Your measured enthusiasm may be perceived as outright aggression by those who don't understand your need for perfection. Thankfully, there is sweet magic in the air when beautiful Venus and metaphysical Neptune inspire creativity and romance. Nevertheless, if impatient Mars takes over and gives rise to competitive feelings, insecurity and jealousy can rear their ugly heads. Kahlil Gibran wrote, ""Beauty is not in the face; beauty is a light in the heart."""

However, the lunar connection to irrepressible Uranus suddenly reveals too many choices to pursue. You won't have any problems if you watch your boundaries. Nevertheless, you'll never know your capabilities unless you push past your fears. If the sky is the limit, there wouldn't be human footprints on the Moon."
libra,2016-11-20,"Accidentally spilling the beans may prove to be socially embarrassing, so monitor what you say and keep a playful conversation from turning too serious. Nevertheless, even the most innocent flirting could stir fearful emotions and provoke a jealous response today.

A smooth Moon-Saturn trine empowers you to accomplish a lot without working too hard or turning into an arrogant authoritarian. Self-discipline is the key to managing even the fastest-moving situations with calm confidence."
aquarius,2016-11-20,"A well-considered evaluation of your goals offers real possibilities for success ahead. The expressive Leo Moon creates easy trines with methodical Saturn and spontaneous Uranus, inspiring you to balance these opposite planetary principles to maximize your chances for satisfaction. Work toward building structures that will endure, for Saturn rewards extra effort. But don't wait around forever or you'll lose the singular power of now."
pisces,2016-11-20,"A brilliant move on your part might inflate your self-esteem, encouraging you to take on more than you can handle. Thankfully, the demonstrative Leo Moon trines inventive Uranus, enabling you to rush to the rescue at the very last moment with unconventional solutions. Fortunately, an emotionally constructive Moon-Saturn trine provides additional strength as long as you maintain integrity in all that you do. Do what is right and not what is easy."
aries,2016-11-21,"You are ready and able to commit to expanding your life in new directions today. Your vision for the future has meaning and there's nothing holding you back. Thankfully, the strength of your convictions makes your message inspiring to others and your persuasive skills help you explain your mission clearly. Your mind is made up and you're not interested in compromising now. However, an overactive Sun-Jupiter combination entices you to expend your energy foolishly. Instead of overwhelming your allies with your unchecked exuberance, control your passion to advance your cause."
taurus,2016-11-21,"Your view of the world seems so certain now that you don't hesitate in your pursuit of your goals. However, the Sun's shift into expansive Sagittarius motivates you to widen your vision and move beyond pragmatic objectives. But don't rest on your past actions when there's still so much more to do. Creating a simple plan without a lot of bells and whistles can vastly improve your professional and personal relationships while moving you closer to your destination. Proper preparation prevents poor performance."
gemini,2016-11-21,"Your appetite for food, fun or fame may be extreme today as you head down the path of excess. However, the Sun's shift into uplifting Sagittarius brightens your 7th House of Relationships, bringing adventurous people into your life that open doors to new avenues of growth. Although you might be overwhelmed as high-spirited friends kick up a bit of excitement now, it could fall on you to set your own limits. Motivational speaker Dave Ramsey says, ""Sometimes you have to tell yourself no so later you can tell yourself yes."""
cancer,2016-11-21,"Signals are mixed today as the cosmos tells you to narrow your focus while simultaneously expanding your horizons to take in the entire picture. The Moon's shift into fastidious Virgo reminds you to doublecheck details and cautiously curb your expectations while concentrating on completing one task at a time. Meanwhile, the Sun shoots into optimistic Sagittarius, encouraging you to stretch your boundaries and demonstrate your enthusiasm at work. Paradoxically, once you accept things just as they are, then you are free to choose what you do next."
leo,2016-11-21,"Exercising the right amount of self-restraint needs to be top priority today. The growing influence of planets in fiery Sagittarius traveling through your 5th House of Self-Expression lifts your spirits and provokes acts of spontaneity. However, an indulgent Sun-Jupiter connection tempts you to overstate your case or overstep your limits. Although your future is looking bright now, stern Saturn's presence is a strict reminder that you must walk before you run. It doesn't matter how much progress you make at first as long as you do not stop."
virgo,2016-11-21,"You want nothing more than to bring your life back into balance as the Moon returns to your earthy sign. However, you can't help but set your sites far into the distance when the Sun shifts into inspirational Sagittarius, drawing out your inner visionary. On one hand, you're only interested in the practical applications of your analytical thinking. But on the other hand, you're not overly concerned with the machinations of the real world now. Let your thoughts roam, partake in philosophical discussions, and delay initiating action while you further develop your plans."
libra,2016-11-21,"You are bound to be distracted by one thing after another today, even if you do your best to focus on your assigned tasks. The Sun's shift into energetic Sagittarius and your 3rd House of Communication encourages you to speak the truth as you see it, even if it ruffles someone's feathers. It might be easier to remain silent and do your job, but you're probably willing to pay the price in order to claim your power. Doing the right thing brings true satisfaction."
scorpio,2016-11-21,"You're eager to make a bold move to improve your finances today. Unfortunately, an exuberant Sun-Jupiter alignment can trick you into seeing opportunity where there is none. Exercise caution when starting anything new because you may attract exaggerating partners who don't live up to their promises. Verifying credentials before you invest your faith or money could make the difference between failure and success. Forewarned is forearmed."
sagittarius,2016-11-21,"You are fully aware of how much work there is to do yet you may encounter internal resistance before you even start. The efficient Virgo Moon's presence in your 10th House of Career improves your chances for professional success by encouraging sound methods over rash actions. However, your popularity skyrockets when the radiant Sun enters your extroverted sign, giving you extra energy and a sunny disposition. Everyone sees what you appear to be, but only a special few experience who you truly are."
capricorn,2016-11-21,"Although you are as interested as ever in getting ahead in your career, personal growth becomes as important as external achievements now. The Sun's move into adventurous Sagittarius and your 12th House of Spiritual Mystery invites you to go on a metaphysical quest. A new wave of curiosity opens windows of awareness and increases your sense of connection with the cosmos. However, your expanded interests can be too much of a good thing. Although it seems like limiting your options will make your life less complicated, narrowing your focus actually facilitates going deeper into your exploration of sacred spaces."
aquarius,2016-11-21,"Your attention is shifting away from concrete career objectives and toward more community involvement. A newfound sense of idealism is entering your life just in time for the holiday season. If you recently placed all your eggs in the basket of work-related success, you can now count your chickens and see where there is need for improvement. It's time to move on; your future is calling in ways that you cannot refuse."
pisces,2016-11-21,"Aim high professionally and push the envelope by promoting yourself more aggressively now. The Sun's entry into your 10th House of Career brings opportunities for advancement and recognition. Don't let modesty constrain your ambition. If you're not reaching further than you think you should, you're probably not trying hard enough. Anything is possible when your faith is bigger than your fears."
aries,2016-11-22,"Although you are generally upbeat about your future today, danger still lurks in the dark corners of your mind. You believe that you're ready for nearly anything, but could find yourself in over your head if you underestimate the amount of work it will entail to complete a job. Sloppy thinking leads to misjudgment, so be careful what you take on now. Although someone may ride to your rescue with a wonderful plan, their intentions might also be better than what they can deliver. Start small; finish big."
taurus,2016-11-22,"You are in luck today if you're looking for positive recognition at work. Within reason, nearly anything you want now is yours while quick-witted Mercury titillates auspicious Jupiter in your 6th House of Employment. You are capable of presenting information in a way that others won't find offensive at all -- even if you're saying something they don't want to hear. Use your charisma wisely. A single truth can shine through a million lies."
gemini,2016-11-22,"You are blessed with the ability to persuade people to your point of view today without making them feel pressured in any way. You don't even need to itemize the pros and cons to convince others to follow your lead. Your ideas about improving efficiency are so innovative that everyone immediately knows you're right. Although you're at the top of your game now, don't let self-confidence turn into hubris. Arrogance is a sign of weakness; humility is a sign of greatness."
cancer,2016-11-22,"Your optimistic thoughts overpower your pessimistic doubts, triggering dreams of a better life ahead. Recent struggles fade into the past as you look forward to a productive week at work, even if you're approaching a major deadline. Positive thinking brings measurable results quicker than you expect. Nevertheless, be ready for some good old-fashioned family fun when the opportunity permits. Author William Feather wrote, ""Plenty of people miss their share of happiness, not because they never found it, but because they didn't stop to enjoy it."""
leo,2016-11-22,"Although an unexpected surge of good feelings encourages you to start new projects now, you might also experience a secondary wave of emotions that waters the seeds of doubt. This wild ride is sponsored by a buoyant Mercury-Jupiter alignment and a suppressive Sun-Pluto connection. Thankfully, your fixed sense of purpose enables you to transform negativity into positive action. Today's determination leads to tomorrow's success."
virgo,2016-11-22,"You are enthusiastic about developing an ambitious strategy to make money today, but you could run into trouble turning your ideas into reality when you get hung up on minute details. Naturally, you prefer to put blinders on so you're not distracted by unrelated noise and irrelevant facts. However, an exuberant Mercury-Jupiter sextile boosts your ability to inspire others with your far-reaching plan now. Your intellectual prowess overcomes your instinct to stay safely within the box. Life is too short not to try something new."
libra,2016-11-22,"You might have a specific agenda now but it's possible to get carried away with your own excitement. In fact, loquacious Mercury forms a cooperative sextile with excessive Jupiter in your sign, compelling you to say more than you intended. Unfortunately, you can't rewind time and take your words back. Thankfully, you may be able to do sufficient damage control if you are willing to apologize. Nevertheless, it's still more efficient to think twice before you utter another sound. Instead of talking your way into trouble, channel your enthusiasm into your work."
scorpio,2016-11-22,"You are usually able to keep your feelings hidden from others by putting up a stoic front. Nevertheless, you're now tempted to throw caution to the wind and let everyone know what you need while talkative Mercury harmonizes with boundless Jupiter. Your thoughts are carried far beyond their usual orbits, prompting you to be less practical and more philosophical. Nevertheless, it might be quite embarrassing when you must publicly acknowledge what you said in anticipation of a warm reception. The smarter you get, the less you speak."
sagittarius,2016-11-22,"Smart and caring friends seem to know the right words to untangle your emotional knots today. Jovial Jupiter supports communicator Mercury in your 1st House of Personality, enabling you to engage in an intense discussion in a calm manner. Positive energy stimulates your intuition, pulling information and ideas from your subconscious. Fortunately, you can present an idealistic plan with confidence and clarity now. Remember, you will make a greater impact with a whisper than a shout because your message touches people's hearts as well their minds."
capricorn,2016-11-22,"Although you inspire people with your ambitious ideas, you could also be the brunt of their criticism because they think you're so disorganized now. However, you are working harder than anyone realizes to put the pieces of your plan in order. Mental Mercury harmonizes with expansive Jupiter in your 10th House of Career, encouraging you to extol the virtues of positive thinking. Nevertheless, the more you try to exert control, the more your opponents will struggle against you. Claim your power, but not at the expense of anyone else."
aquarius,2016-11-22,"You see good news on the horizon as you project your current job prospects onto your vision of future prosperity. However, your view is biased and it's tempting to overlook potential problems. But you're not concerned about such things now if you are doing well. Paradoxically, broadening your thinking will allow you to change directions, even if you believe your professional trajectory is aimed at success. Nevertheless, do your homework before you speak your mind. Your advanced planning will be appreciated more than you know."
pisces,2016-11-22,"You possess ample wisdom to express your ideas intelligently, no matter how shaky you might feel today. If you are faced with an intense situation, your all-encompassing perspective gives you the vision to handle the emotional turmoil. While you might not resolve all your concerns right away, at least you can begin to think about the issues in a constructive manner. You'll have more to give others if you take care of your own needs first. Author Paulo Coelho writes, ""The world is changed by examples, not by opinions."""
aries,2016-11-23,"A clear purpose and a tight focus inspire you to use your intellect for a higher purpose. Thankfully, you're unlikely to be overwhelmed by the drama today because everyone seems to be doing their best to maintain a sense of civility and rationality. Messenger Mercury delivers a much-needed reality check as it runs into authoritative Saturn, but you might try to ignore it if you are convinced your beliefs are correct. Thomas Dewar wrote, ""Minds are like parachutes -- they only function when they are open."""
taurus,2016-11-23,"Confusing optimism with denial will likely lead you down a path that takes you to the wrong destination. Rational Mercury joins up with confining Saturn today, demanding that you pay close attention to the details, especially with respect to your core values and how they conflict with someone else's. It's tempting to work yourself into a corner by fearfully clinging to an old habit or belief. Nevertheless, assuming a non-confrontational position allows for multiple points of view. Acknowledging another person's truth is not the same as embracing it."
gemini,2016-11-23,"Maintaining your confidence is nearly impossible today if people are being overly critical of everything you do. Just as you strike up the marching band to play your happy song, someone comes along and rains on your parade. Your happiness suffers when glib Mercury encounters austere Saturn, forcing you to ponder the more serious side of life. You might even consider solitude as a viable alternative to the never-ending uncertainty of relationships. Nevertheless, you know what to do; start squeezing those lemons to make the best batch of lemonade anyone's ever tasted."
cancer,2016-11-23,"Shaking off your lingering negativity is an uphill battle today. You may be discouraged while quick-witted Mercury opposes pessimistic Saturn, but focusing on the issue at hand enables you to turn a bleak situation into a successful endeavor. Although there are heavy responsibilities resting on your shoulders now, you must reconsider your priorities so you can stand up and deal with a potentially frustrating set of circumstances. Examining your resistance is the first step to putting your life back on track."
leo,2016-11-23,"Although a wave of discouragement is washing through your life, you can seize this opportunity to assess which commitments are worth keeping, and which ones need to end. This is an excellent time to manifest your heart's desire into reality by talking about your personal goals. However, concentrating on one specific field of interest may require you to say no to others. The good news is you truly understand the consequences of your current decisions. Clarity is power; the clearer you are about what you want, the more your brain knows how to get there."
virgo,2016-11-23,"You're tempted to shut down and withdraw from communication now, but avoidance will cause much greater problems later on. The gravitas of these times is confirmed when contemplative Mercury joins authoritative Saturn, giving you the impression that your mental meanderings will lead you to the truth. Unfortunately, relying on the logic of your brain diminishes the message of your heart. Honoring your feelings empowers your decisions if you're also willing to remain open-minded to the needs of others."
libra,2016-11-23,"Your fantasies come to an abrupt ending today as someone in your immediate environment reads you the riot act. It may seem as if their criticism lacks understanding and empathy. You might retreat emotionally as your fear of rejection rears its ugly head. Breaking into new ground is not easy to accomplish now, but pushing forward is your smartest strategy. The cosmos is instructing you to be as specific as you can about your desires before striving to fulfill them. There are forces at play that are greater than you, waiting to help you reach your dreams."
scorpio,2016-11-23,"Focusing on solutions instead of problems puts you in a positive place where people can respond to you more favorably. Although the course of least resistance is alluring now, don't let your one-dimensional thinking turn into self-doubt when philosophical Mercury conspires with critical Saturn. Thankfully, your natural curiosity drives you to get to the bottom of a mystery today. You are at the edge of a significant breakthrough if you are ready to move on from outmoded ideas and discover new ones that will better serve your interests. Nelson Mandela said, ""It always seem impossible until it's done."""
sagittarius,2016-11-23,"Your mind can shut down the vagaries of your heart so fast today that it leaves your head spinning. Nevertheless, your best ideas are still challenged by nearly everyone that you bring into your inner circle as contentious Mercury strategizes with obstinate Saturn in your very social sign. Thoughtfully consider your next move or you will find yourself backpedaling sooner than you think. Listen to those around you; applying self-restraint now is more effective than doing damage control later on."
capricorn,2016-11-23,"Although you're looking for solid answers, people probably give you weak excuses if you try to pin them down. If you're not receiving the approval you desire today, or if others disappoint you in some other manner, don't take it so personally. It's all too easy now to see everything in a negative light as perceptive Mercury hooks up with cold Saturn. This sobering conjunction lands in your 12th House of Inner Peace, rattling your confidence while you yearn for something greater than material satisfaction. Moshe Dayan said, ""Freedom is the oxygen of the soul."""
aquarius,2016-11-23,"You may feel restrained by the necessity to work as part of a group today. However, your position is different than everyone else's and you're compelled to share it regardless of the consequences. The stakes of the current conflict are raised and then raised again; power struggles are symptomatic of repressed anger that needs to find constructive expression. Nevertheless, consider the cost of doing battle before you start a fight that escalates tension instead of resolving it."
pisces,2016-11-23,"It doesn't seem right if your best ideas are shot down today before they are even heard. However, messenger Mercury's conjunction with strict Saturn is likely to reveal the weakest links in your chain of logic. It's a mistake to hunker down and resist the opposition now; there will be time for fighting soon enough. Instead, listen to the feedback, even if it's excessive in its negativity. Don't fall into the trap of self-doubt. Figure out what you can do to upgrade your game, and then fearlessly put your plan into motion."
aries,2016-11-24,"Deep tremors of change begin to shake in a manner that may eventually alter your direction in life. A profound reexamination of your beliefs could leave you doubting what you knew to be true in the past. Thankfully, close friends or relatives offer constructive advice, and you can rely on them for helpful guidance now. Although you might feel as if your reality is being jolted, whatever is left standing will be more powerful than ever. Paulo Coelho wrote, ""Knowledge without transformation is not wisdom."""
taurus,2016-11-24,"Amidst the fun and frivolity, you may experience a sense of urgency with respect to your goals. You could even become a bit fanatic and fight for something you strongly believe in, whether or not it's a justifiable conviction. You have powerful work to do now and, fortunately, the fortitude to do it. Resist your tendency to be silent about important issues. Although some people might prefer you to be less persistent in your pursuit of answers now, it's more productive to face your questions head on than to postpone the confrontation for another day."
gemini,2016-11-24,"The intensity of interpersonal dynamics could interfere with your holiday celebrations today. You may be overly ambitious as you strive to resolve a lingering disagreement, or open the door to a deeper level of sharing with others. Old rules still apply, but you're in a new arena that's likely to bring up issues lurking beneath the surface. Do your best to sidestep unwinnable debates that provoke religious or political extremism. Absolute certainty is often a sign of insecurity, so if you feel yourself puffing up with self-righteousness at the dinner table, have a laugh at your own expense. Taking the high road aids everyone's digestion."
cancer,2016-11-24,"Your relationship world is enlivened with new people and experiences today, but too many intense interactions can leave you feeling overwhelmed rather than invigorated. Optimistic Jupiter squares mysterious Pluto in your 7th House of Partners, casting shadows of doubt over your high hopes. Encouragement from someone may be matched by discouragement from others, but this is no reason to give up on your dreams. Let go of your old assumptions that block progress. What was true in the past might not be true in the future."
leo,2016-11-24,"You have your heart set on a very specific flow of events today, and any deviation from your preferences can send you into a tailspin. Everything seems magnified, making it difficult to maintain a healthy perspective on what's important and what is not. Your high expectations motivate you to undertake more than you can manage. Undoubtedly, you will be busier than usual, but you could also receive extra attention for the inspiration you are to others. No matter how the day unfolds, be the kind of leader that you would want to follow."
virgo,2016-11-24,"Powerful opinions can stress a friendship or lead to a personal breakthrough in self-expression. Fasten your seatbelts and get ready for a rocket ship ride as potent Pluto squares exaggerating Jupiter in your 2nd House of Values. Pluto intensifies the pressure to know what you want, and where you want to go. If you're on track, a deep well of material and psychological resources propel you along. But if you're still stuck with an old model, you may have to tear it down and start all over. The good news is that every end is a new beginning."
libra,2016-11-24,"Although you might be celebrating with friends and family today, tumultuous waves of evolutionary change are still washing into your life. You are very resourceful now that powerful Pluto squares beneficial Jupiter in your sign, so be courageous and commit to lofty goals. Although your greatest dreams for success may be magnified, fears of the unknown can make finding your way tricky. Nevertheless, as Olympic champion Gail Devers says, ""Every accomplishment starts with the decision to try."""
scorpio,2016-11-24,"You may discover that you and someone else are not on the same page regarding your outlook on life. It's time to recommit, compromise, or just move on. Your ideas about what it means to be part of a relationship could drastically change now. Allow yourself to disagree without becoming disagreeable. Remember, differing views can spice up a personal interaction as long as emotions and egos don't get out of hand."
sagittarius,2016-11-24,"You are driven to demonstrate your worth today, yet making a critical decision is difficult because there is potential everywhere and you don't know which path to take. You could elevate your spirits and improve your self-esteem by seeking adventure now. But rather than doing anything dramatic, you might just spend your energy dreaming about future possibilities. It doesn't matter if the looming changes are psychological or material; you are being asked to widen your perspective."
capricorn,2016-11-24,"There is no room in your life for small-minded thinking; the sky is truly the limit, and the time for your metamorphosis is now. It's as if you are a fuzzy caterpillar that's transforming into a beautiful butterfly. Nevertheless, your dreams won't materialize without hard work, since you must struggle and fight your way out of the cocoon. There's no need to be discouraged if your progress seems slow or even stuck since Mother Nature operates on her own schedule."
aquarius,2016-11-24,"Opportunities for personal and professional growth are more apparent when you're willing to sell yourself with greater enthusiasm. Reach further instead of playing it safe as powerful planetary forces gather in your 12th House of Spirituality, raising hidden emotions from the depths of your unconscious. Great waves of desire are accompanied by alternating ripples of fear, sweeping reason out of the way. Passion provokes philosophical debates in which there are major differences of opinion. Beliefs are being tested so prepare to have yours challenged and changed."
pisces,2016-11-24,"You are stepping into an exciting new world, and it could feel as if your dreams are coming to life. Go ahead and acknowledge your deep yearnings for success while your goals are within close proximity. Nevertheless, you must apply all of your wisdom and maturity to the present moment to manifest your vision. Although you are inclined to push yourself too hard now, staying in touch with your emotions keeps you on your spiritual path."
aries,2016-11-25,"Take a deep look at the most important relationships in your life to find ways to improve them or discern which, if any, no longer meet your needs. If all is going well, your success might arouse jealousy in others or leave you feeling strangely unfulfilled as sweet Venus joins suspicious Pluto in your 10th House of Status. Nevertheless, stretching your limits leads to desiring someone or something that costs more than it's worth. Hippocrates wrote, ""Everything in excess is opposed by nature."""
taurus,2016-11-25,"Suppressed passions push their way into awareness today, deepening the bonds of a significant partnership. However, you could spread yourself too thin when your key planet Venus squares excessive Jupiter in your 6th House of Routine. But the stakes are higher than you realize, and your actions can stir up unexpectedly powerful emotions now. The outcome is uncertain; even if you think truth is on your side, the rules of the game may be changing all too quickly. Stay light on your feet, and remember that maintaining your objectivity allows you to successfully navigate the twists and turns of life."
gemini,2016-11-25,"You're unlikely to change your mind today once your heart is set on something or someone. Vulnerable Venus joins unfathomable Pluto in your 8th House of Deep Sharing, scaring you with the intensity of your unexpressed feelings. You are driven to push them out into the open, even if your normal response is to bury your emotions. Unfulfilled needs can stand in the way of your happiness now. Although the risks are substantial, your determination is strong. Focusing on the big issues and looking beyond your transient personal desires produce the most positive results."
cancer,2016-11-25,"Expressing your desires sounds like a wise move today until someone unexpectedly tries to silence you. Apparently, the intense passions that you're bringing out into the open can be upsetting at first, yet they could also build intimacy if you're willing to go deep. Although you might not have planned things this way, you need to give relationships top priority when sultry Venus bumps into shadowy Pluto. But the road to emotional equilibrium is not a smooth one. Nevertheless, as Buddhist teacher Thich Nhat Hanh says, ""Awareness is like the Sun. When it shines on things, they are transformed."""
leo,2016-11-25,"Acknowledgment of your efforts may not come readily as evaluating Venus joins insatiable Pluto in your 6th House of Service. Unfortunately, relationships are undermined by mistrust or manipulation today, especially when secrecy is involved. Expressing your discontent doesn't help now unless you recognize what's wrong and attempt to deliver fast answers. Maximize the use of your resources by networking with others. As psychologist Brene Brown writes, ""Imperfections are not inadequacies; they are reminders that we're all in this together."""
virgo,2016-11-25,"Your emotional intensity re-energizes a partnership or strengthens your resolve in a significant negotiation. Nevertheless, in the midst of all your obligations today, find some playtime to kick back and enjoy yourself. Searching for meaning in interpersonal relationships can take you out of the casual realms, and into more intimate spaces. An indulgent Venus-Jupiter square amplifies your cravings, and tempts you to ask for more than you need. Ritu Ghatourey writes, ""Satisfaction is not always the fulfillment of what you want; it is the realization of how blessed you are for what you have."""
libra,2016-11-25,"Harmony at home and the approval of your friends are less important than connecting with your deepest desires today. Nevertheless, you can't just ignore the mundane promises you made to others. But neither can you deny the feelings that are bubbling up from your subconscious as magnetic Venus dances with provocative Pluto in your 4th House of Roots. You must integrate your needs with the practical side of your life. The 14th Dalai Lama said, ""The way to overcome negative thoughts and destructive emotions is to develop opposing positive emotions that are stronger and more powerful."""
scorpio,2016-11-25,"Sometimes your feelings are so powerful that you don't know what to do with them. Normally, a sexy Venus-Pluto hookup creates an emotional tidal wave that's beyond your control. Romance heats up to the boiling point. However, this time around, the conjunction occurs in your 3rd House of Information, allowing you to talk about your desires in a responsible manner rather than simply acting on them. Author James Humes wrote, ""The art of communication is the language of leadership."""
sagittarius,2016-11-25,"You can't help but see the best in others, making you eager to gamble on their potential now. While it's healthy to push the edge of the envelope and broaden your horizons, make sure to maintain your bearings by using your moral compass. Acting with integrity may lack the excitement you crave today, but the tangible results of your ambitious plans are certainly worth the sacrifice. Author Anthony Williams wrote, ""If we seek a positive outcome, we must begin with a positive attitude."""
capricorn,2016-11-25,"You exude an irresistible magnetism that makes your relationship world more exciting today. But your newfound lust for life also leads to control issues or problems stemming from possessiveness. Nevertheless, jealousy and envy are traps created by a lack of self-confidence. Thankfully, your sense of social responsibility could save you from the consequences of intense personal desires. Never overestimate your weakness or underestimate your strength."
aquarius,2016-11-25,"Hidden feelings may pop out unexpectedly today. But your odd sense of liberation might not last long because loving Venus hooks up with mysterious Pluto to reveal deeper layers of meaning. You could unwittingly step onto a relationship roller coaster ride as you discover new sources of pleasure while breaking free of unrewarding alliances and responsibilities. Remember, the hardest prison to escape from is your own mind."
pisces,2016-11-25,"Mistrust may arise among your friends due to someone's secrecy, or a severe difference in values. But even your coworkers can create drama when gracious Venus runs into cynical Pluto in your 11th House of Groups. Although it's uncomfortable to deal with an unpleasant subject, bringing difficult issues to the surface is more productive today than ignoring them. Denial won't make anything go away; it just ensures that the problem doesn't get resolved. Transparency is your friend."
aries,2016-11-26,"You're more likely projecting your fantasies onto others than perceiving them as they are when you peer into the magical metaphysical mirror of life. Everything could happen so fast that you're not prepared for the final outcome as trickster Mercury harmonizes with shocking Uranus. A single stroke of genius reveals the truth, breaks the looking glass, and shatters your illusions. Success arrives when your persistence overcomes the resistance."
taurus,2016-11-26,"Lingering emotional issues appear to be resolved in a momentary flash of awareness today. An electrifying Mercury-Uranus trine breaks the spell with a sudden epiphany that can free you from any negativity. Although there is light at the end of the tunnel, this welcome illumination does not resolve everything. Expect buried emotions to continue to bubble up into consciousness over the days ahead. Remember, the best dreams happen when you're fully awake."
gemini,2016-11-26,"You may be recovering from a situation where your excessive enthusiasm and unrestrained honesty recently got the best of you. Although you're not one to think twice before sharing information, at least make sure it's ready for prime time. Every cloud has a silver lining; today's brilliant Mercury-Uranus trine hands you the keys of innovation that enable you to escape from your self-created situation. Author Jim Rohn writes, ""Your life does not get better by chance; it gets better by change."""
cancer,2016-11-26,"An excessive amount of self-confidence encourages you to overstep your bounds when talking about your feelings today. Chatty Mercury's flowing trine with innovative Uranus activates your 6th House of Health, giving you the right words to state your intentions about improving your lifestyle. But don't take the easy way out by creating a plan based upon shallow thinking. Put the transformational Scorpio Moon to work by taking the first steps toward creating the future of your dreams."

Cerebral Mercury's creative trine to revolutionary Uranus in your 9th House of Faraway Places inspires original concepts that can help you overcome an impasse with someone stuck in the past. But don't push too hard or too fast; be patient with conservative thinkers that may require more time to catch up to your progressive ideas. Demonstrate your leadership skills but don't get so far ahead of the pack that you're on your own."
virgo,2016-11-26,"You are quite the smooth operator today, and may have a magic touch for inspiring incompatible people to work well together. If you take on unreliable partners or stretch your credibility by promising too much, a surprising Mercury-Uranus trine reveals unconventional ways to get you out of a jam. But don't trust your intellect alone; demonstrating your emotional IQ now enables you to smooth over someone's fear by appealing to the heart and not just the head."
libra,2016-11-26,"Silence may be golden, but you probably won't find any quiet time today as your brain lights up with unorthodox ideas. Verbal self-restraint disappears when a fiery trine from uncontainable Uranus to chatty Mercury in your 3rd House of Communication frees you to speak your mind. Some thoughts come and go, but you will know which ones are critical because they won't leave you alone. Elvis Presley wrote, ""Truth is like the Sun. You can shut it out for a time, but it ain't going away."""
scorpio,2016-11-26,"You have plenty of chores to do today and, thankfully, the intellectual resources to accomplish your goals. It may be frustrating to realize that your recent judgment was not your best, but the crafty Mercury-Uranus trine offers you radical alternatives to your current trajectory. Although your reactions might be magnified with the moody Moon in your sign, you possess the brainpower to turn your best ideas into reality."
sagittarius,2016-11-26,"Although it really does ""take a village,"" sometimes there are differences of opinion among the residents that make progress difficult today. Although dissent may create a temporary roadblock, everyone seems to be working for the same cause now that communicator Mercury harmonizes with revolutionary Uranus. Free-flowing conversations break down all barriers and open doors to more productive alliances."
capricorn,2016-11-26,"If you feel lost in unfamiliar physical or psychological territory, the brilliance of a Mercury-Uranus trine will supply the smarts you need to find your way back home. Nevertheless, the emotionally intense Scorpio Moon may challenge your assumptions about your friends. Reassess your social relationships with an objective eye, even if you must reduce someone's role in your life. Kindness is a wonderful quality but it can be costly if a supposed ally takes more than he or she gives."
aquarius,2016-11-26,"Your radical ideas are often far ahead of their time, yet occasionally you experience an epiphany that has immediate relevance. Today's electric Mercury-Uranus trine sparks unique questions, exciting conversations, and surprising answers.

Thankfully, you're working with a full arsenal of intelligence and ingenuity that puts you in the zone where you can be smart and socially skillful at the same time. Trust your gut and speak from your heart."
aries,2016-11-27,"You are not listening to those people who tell you to chill out today because you have already set your agenda and plan on sticking to it. Nevertheless, you still want to get to the bottom of a mystery that comes to light when someone's actions don't match their words. You might be falling down the rabbit hole because nothing is as it seems. You may be shocked at what you learn when you discover the truth. Don't bother trying to hide your surprise. Be like Robert Frost who said, ""I am not a teacher, but an awakener."""
taurus,2016-11-27,"Your uncharacteristic willingness to change your opinion in an instant could save the day. Normally, you Bulls prefer to not alter your course mid-stream. However, you don't even need valid information before you are already speaking your truth today. Ensure that your plan doesn't run into an insurmountable hurdle by evaluating everything you hear with an objective ear. The eyes are useless when the mind is blind."
gemini,2016-11-27,"Everyone else seems to have plenty of time for some personal rest and relaxation, while you're too busy to take a short break. Unfortunately, there aren't enough hours in the day to complete all the projects that are still on your plate. Thankfully, the unyielding Scorpio Moon energizes your 6th House of Logistics, enabling you to manage the growing complexity. You're a champ at juggling several balls at once while making it all look easy. Your only enemy now is yourself because you can be so easily distracted. There's a lot at stake, so concentrate on the things that matter the most."
cancer,2016-11-27,"You can think of countless ways to express what's in your heart, but when it comes down to initiating a discussion today, you wonder if it's actually worth the effort. There are many forces shouting for your attention now, and the loudest ones are also the most uncomfortable. If you think you're just going to yell at someone and magically resolve all your interpersonal differences, you have another thing coming. Margaret Wheatley instructs, ""Be brave enough to start a conversation that matters."""
leo,2016-11-27,"Your loyalty to your relatives runs deep today, leading you to participate in activities with them instead of heading off to be with your friends. Nevertheless, rebellious Uranus shocks the radiant Sun in your 5th House of Spontaneity, tempting you with exciting social possibilities. You possess the strength to turn down a fun invitation, but you may have momentary flashes of regret unless you do something to make your day extraordinary. Find a path that will lead you to adventure without creating questions about your devotion to your family."
virgo,2016-11-27,"Your restlessness is nearly unmanageable today, but staying aware of your feelings prevents serious problems down the road. There are many wonderful ideas moving so fast in your mind now that the inspirations come and go before you even have a chance to pick one and work with it. Nevertheless, trying to stop the mental flow will only drive your frustration higher. Instead, sit back and watch the show as if it were entertainment. Eckhart Tolle writes, ""Observe your thoughts, don't believe them."""
libra,2016-11-27,"For someone who is supposed to be indecisive, there is nothing wishy-washy about your current beliefs.

Author Jack Dixon wrote, ""If you focus on results, you will never change. If you focus on change, you will get results."""
scorpio,2016-11-27,"Processing bottled-up anger is a crucial component of finding happiness today. Something that shouldn't be important might stick in your mind and won't quit bothering you. Keeping your annoyance quiet is tempting but not advisable when the controlling Scorpio Moon squares contentious Mars. Let your feelings flow into the open gradually instead of waiting until they run the show. Rather than allowing resentment to create a mess, talk about minor irritations as they surface so everyone can move on. Live life to express, not impress."
sagittarius,2016-11-27,"Although you might appear to be in a good mood today, there are feelings you're choosing not to share. Thankfully, your upbeat manner can deflect some of the negativity you could otherwise attract. Don't waste energy worrying about what's unsaid; it will come out naturally when the time is right. Your emotions will continue to evolve until you're ready to talk about them in a couple of days. For now, put your best foot forward. Socrates wrote, ""The only true wisdom is knowing that you know nothing."""
capricorn,2016-11-27,"You can't settle your nerves today because you're expecting something bad to happen, even if you don't know what it is. Unfortunately, believing is seeing and you'll likely manifest an event to satisfy your expectations.

A sudden strike of lightning doesn't necessarily start a fire; it might just light up the sky for a brief moment to reveal the truth. Ken Keyes wrote, ""You should always be aware that your head creates your world."""
aquarius,2016-11-27,"Holding onto an unresolved emotional issue could turn your day into an obstacle course. Fortunately, your entire metaphysical world can shift in a single instant as you see others in a new light. Although your friends may come to your rescue with their passion for life, it's up to you to open the door and let them in. You are standing at a fork in the road today, and you must either pick a route into the future, or turn back and hide in the past. When stated in those simple terms, the choice is easier than you think."
pisces,2016-11-27,"It's nearly impossible to see yourself as someone separate from your family or community; you are a fish that is part of a school. However, differences of opinions about issues that matter are now cause for great concern. You're not entirely sure you want to be a member of your group, but you have nowhere else to go. You wonder if you should modify your beliefs or try to sway the opinions of everyone else. There is no immediate answer to this dilemma; resolution can wait as long as you are asking the right questions and seeking a sensible path into the future."
aries,2016-11-28,"Trusting your rational judgments is quite a challenge today, unless they are supported by an intuitive hunch. Although you might doubt your ability to guide anyone into the future, you are sitting on a gold mine of valid information that you can use to make the best decision.

Nevertheless, people's actions alter the trajectory of your day before you realize what is going on. Your uncertainty builds as the transformational Scorpio Moon creates mysterious aspects with three planets, flooding your 7th House of Others with powerful energy. Maintain your composure and take enough time to connect with your heart. Your emotional brilliance will shine through as long as you don't react too quickly. Today's mighty oak is just yesterday's nut that held its ground."
gemini,2016-11-28,"Paradoxically, the methodical routine of your job increases your creativity today. You are more likely to succeed if you're motivated by the desire to do something positive than if you're simply escaping something negative. You have untapped resources and underused talents that can help you improve your current situation, or fuel your search for a new opportunity. But there's no reason to isolate yourself if you're feeling less than confident. People will support you when you share your doubts, but remember, the highest form of self-expression is kindness."

You are preparing to step into new territory, but must decide what to leave behind now so you can pursue the opportunities ahead.

Once you clear your heart of what's no longer needed, you can utilize your precious resources to focus on manifesting your dreams for the future. Frank Sinatra said, ""The best revenge is massive success."""
virgo,2016-11-28,"You must learn more about your subject today and communicate with greater force if you are to be successful. But you might just need a break from the pressures of your regular routine. In fact, you're probably more preoccupied with the inner workings of your mind now than you are about succeeding at work. Nevertheless, the Moon's shift into extroverted Sagittarius reawakens your desire to impress others with your skills. Your newfound enthusiasm gives you the determination to strive for what you want, so be fearless in the pursuit of your dreams."
libra,2016-11-28,"Ideas flow freely but you still want more openness and honesty in all your interactions today. However, the secretive Scorpio Moon puts money matters front and center now. Some subjects are more personal than others and you're not required to tell anyone about your fiscal concerns. Although refining your budget can produce positive changes that will make you proud, it's up to you to draw the line when deciding which details to share. As Gregory Peck said, ""I have tales to tell, but I don't tell them."""
scorpio,2016-11-28,"It might seem as if you are running out of time to make some basic decisions about where to focus your intentions. Thankfully, you're so eager to get over your past that shifting into the next phase of your personal growth will be a piece of cake. Nevertheless, you may uncover some unresolved jealousy and anger that needs to be processed before you move on. Sometimes you don't realize the weight of the world you are carrying until you feel the lightness after its release."

The evolutionary Scorpio Moon continues to shift the energy in your personal life, encouraging you to break your ties to people who no longer support your goals.

aquarius,2016-11-28,"Concerns in your professional life need to be resolved, and the sooner you start, the better. In fact, the dynamics in play are being reshuffled, motivating you to bring a sense of spirituality or community to your work. Unless you can meet your other obligations with greater efficiency today, you may be promising more than you can deliver. Although it might be necessary to make bigger changes, it's wise to take the simplest and most direct action available on all practical matters now."
pisces,2016-11-28,"Your vision for the future and the dedication to your beliefs reach a new level of commitment as subtle waves threaten to carry you off course. The Moon's current visit to your 9th House of Adventure might entice you to overextend on a project, yet the hope you feel may propel you further than you expect. The secret sauce is created by mixing in the right blend of practical thinking and intuitive inspiration.

However, you can't get away with false bravado when the cavalier Sagittarius New Moon occurs in your 8th House of Regeneration, sending you on a journey of self-discovery. Your emotional antennae are scanning the cosmos for more action, which can distract you from your personal work. Nevertheless, psychological and spiritual transformation is your key to happiness. Instead of trying to control the external flow of events, focus on improving your inner game."
gemini,2016-11-29,"Your perspective is changing, requiring you to take a fresh look at relationships when new partnerships and old alliances are put to the test. The Sagittarius New Moon energizes your 7th House of Others now, planting seeds of opportunity for making new connections or taking a current union to the next level. Nevertheless, settling down is unlikely with erratic Uranus in the picture. Don't expect to find a single right answer to so many complicated questions. Keep an open mind and try different approaches according to each situation. One size does not fit all."

Nevertheless, set aside some time to revel in the camaraderie of your family and friends while the high-spirited Sagittarius New Moon empowers your 11th House of Community, reminding you of how much you enjoy this time of year.

But nothing is as it appears now, and just when you're certain that all is well, you realize that you're standing on unfamiliar ground in an entirely different world. Rather than relying on external signals or on the good advice of those you trust, accept the fact that your thoughts are actually altering the world around you.

Naturally, you don't want to miss your chance to make the most of a current situation, especially if new partnerships open doors previously not available. However, your hypercreative mind can perceive things that don't yet exist. Manifesting your dreams through hard work is possible, but don't fall into the trap of assuming there is a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.

However, holding on to unrealistic hopes can be a study in futility that leads to discouragement and doubt. Setting your goals too high might be disillusioning, yet a lack of ambition encourages laziness.

Although there's potential for achieving a new level of understanding with those closest to you today, there's also the possibility of losing steam before you reach any sort of agreement. You are treading on tricky ground; if you push too hard, your gains will disappear in a puff of smoke. However, if you give up too soon, all your previous accomplishments will be for naught. Running away from your problems is a race you'll never win."

However, without any boundaries to slow you down, you could easily overextend your vision, believing that what you see is what you get. Nevertheless, transcendent Neptune's stressful square to the Sun in your freedom-seeking sign weaves a web of fantasy around your world, bringing both enlightenment and confusion. Don't lose a diamond while chasing glitter."

Previous commitments seem to weigh on you when all you want to do is go home to your comfort zone and recuperate. Something may surface from those still-but-deep waters today, which makes you want to concentrate on healing your mind, body and spirit. It's easy to worry about what someone might think if you focus on your needs, but the real issue is that you are your own biggest critic.

With clever Mercury whispering in optimistic Jupiter's ear, you're confident that you're really onto something -- and others are likely to jump on the bandwagon after you fill them in on your plans.

Jovial Jupiter and passionate Mars are giving you the green light, stimulating your desire to go out and kick up your heels. It's great to play like a kid again, but you may feel anchored by responsibilities at home. Don't let nagging doubts keep you tied in knots; instead, acknowledge the facts as they are.

You may feel compelled to dive deep and sniff out what's making you tick right now. Take time to look within and see if any deep-seated issues are calling for closure or healing. You don't have to shout your findings from the rooftops; in fact, the internal dialogue is typically the most important. Mercury the Messenger could deliver an inkling of insight regarding what really matters to you, so listen to that quiet inner voice to learn the key to your heart."
sagittarius,2016-12-01,"No one is a stranger today as friendly vibes permeate the atmosphere. Stimulating discourse follows you as you find yourself engaging in big-picture conversations even in the most mundane of places. The truth is you're excited to share your thoughts and you may book your schedule so tightly that not even one more person can be penciled in.

It's almost like someone has plugged you into the universal electrical outlet, and you're fully charged and seriously ready to make all the progress you can. The Moon in your sign reinforces your naturally goal-oriented rhythm while quietly reminding you that persistence leads to success."
aquarius,2016-12-01,"The call of the wild has you itching to be out the door and on to your next adventure. Your progressive ideals around social matters may be at the forefront of your mind now. You're happiest when marching to the beat of your own drum and today is certainly no exception. However, the Moon in your 12th House of Rest reminds you to take the alone time you need now so you don't crash and burn later. Napoleon Hill wrote, ""Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success."""
pisces,2016-12-01,"Sometimes the most passionate dreams are best kept close to the chest, or at least that's how it seems today. Your inner world may be more colorful than the outer landscape while dynamic Mars harmonizes with noble Jupiter. However, there's a palpable heaviness coming from a subject that's being avoided, and you may be hesitant to reveal your position for fear of being judged or misunderstood. It's okay to keep things from your coworkers, but it helps to confide in a close friend with whom you can speak intimately. Sigmund Freud wrote, ""Out of your vulnerabilities will come your strength."""
aries,2016-12-02,"You know what you want, and you're willing to  work for it. You may be inclined to power through issues as quickly as possible, no matter how many corners are cut in the process. However, the tenacious Capricorn Moon gifts you with the perseverance and sure footing of the Mountain Goat. Keep climbing step by step and you're likely to reach the top. Be sure not to get lost along the way when dreamy Neptune tempts lovely Venus with alluring offers to escape from responsibilities. Keep in mind that sagacious Mercury expects you to walk your talk."
taurus,2016-12-02,"Something within you stirs visions of an ideal future, and your aspirations may seem so real and close that they sparkle. As nice as it is to imagine the life you want the most, what it takes to get there requires a lot more than a dream. Thankfully, your natural practical streak can help get your head out from the clouds and back down to earth. Later in the day, your clarity will return, enabling you to determine exactly which steps you need to take to move closer to your long-term goals. Good intentions are wasted without hard work."
gemini,2016-12-02,"Imagine your perfect job -- the one that inspires you to reach your full potential, and provides more than enough compensation for how quickly money seems to pass through your hands. Grounding this dream in reality may feel like trying to pin a wave to the sand, but with some help from your rational ruling planet, Mercury, you are capable of realistically evaluating what resources you have at your disposal now. Better to face the facts and figures today than let your funds recede like the tide as you fantasize about living on Easy Street. Prosperity is a state of mind, but you still have to pay the bills."
cancer,2016-12-02,"It's not always easy to find the words you're looking for when you need them. You sensitive Crabs are often uncomfortable engaging in conflict; sometimes you would rather run away and imagine that everyone else is behaving just as they should. But no one can run forever, and after the Sun sets you may be ready to return to reality and face the music. After all, the silver Moon guides you through the dark, and her presence in earthy Capricorn will lend you the strength and fortitude to talk things out. Jimi Hendrix said, ""Knowledge speaks, wisdom listens."""
leo,2016-12-02,"You're a smart cookie, but even the smartest folks need help staying on track now and then. Try not to ignore your health today; instead, reexamine your daily routine to see where you could make improvements to bolster your well-being. You might believe that if you just had more time or money, you could pay for a personal trainer or hire a nutritionist to help manifest your lifestyle goals. Slow your roll and let logical Mercury help you make a realistic plan. Get adequate sleep, stick to a clean diet, and -- although everyone knows you're a superhero -- don't push yourself to keep going when you're running on empty."
virgo,2016-12-02,"As you reassess your goals and reshuffle your priorities, you may find yourself longing for like-minded company that can relate to your aspirations. What would it be like to have a special sidekick who fits into your life just like a puzzle piece? It will be easy to see your fantasy companion in crystal clear detail today, but don't let this lack of objectivity distract you from what's happening in the here and now. Winged Mercury flies into your 5th House of Self-Expression tonight, encouraging honest communication about your desires and thoughtfulness in your creative acts."
libra,2016-12-02,"You're a natural-born dreamer and today you might find yourself recalling your childhood and the good old days with fondness. Nebulous Neptune may lure you into the drowse of Memory Lane as you go through the motions, but keep putting one foot in front of the other until you return to the present. By tonight, you'll feel solid ground underneath your feet again as discerning Mercury helps you redefine your goals and establish a winning strategy. As Tom Petty sings, ""You can look back babe, but it's best not to stare."""
scorpio,2016-12-02,"It may seem like business as usual as you move through your prosaic day with no more fanfare than absolutely necessary. But sometimes you secretly wish that someone would come along who could see through your walls and understand that mind of yours in a way which transcends words. Such romances can exist, but you still have to get your priorities straight and make a decision about whom and what you want. Thankfully, meticulous Mercury encourages you to organize your thoughts and speak your mind with clarity and conviction."
sagittarius,2016-12-02,"Details aren't really your thing, but sometimes it's necessary to hunker down and get the facts right. Your budget demands your attention while the responsible Capricorn Moon sets the tone in your 2nd House of Money. Obviously, it would be so much sweeter to stumble upon buried treasure or inherit a large sum of money from a distant relative. Whimsical Neptune may have you daydreaming of a simpler childhood existence when parents paid for everything. Thankfully, this nostalgic fog should lift later in the evening, enabling you to finally crunch the numbers and face the facts. Maturity starts when the drama ends."
capricorn,2016-12-02,"You almost always have a plan for what you wish to accomplish next. However, you may find yourself wanting to escape the constant weight of self-inflicted responsibility today and go for a long walk in the park where your mind can wander and relax for a while. This temporary retreat might not be a bad idea, since methodical Mercury joins the goal-oriented Moon in your sign, prompting you to vocalize your goals and intentions. Use this time in nature to ruminate on the dreams you hope to make come true one day soon."
aquarius,2016-12-02,"You're typically not shy about saying what you think, but today your thoughts turn within as you envision a world where a lack of resources is never an issue. There are a million dreams floating around in your head, and all it takes is money to get the ball rolling. Fanciful Neptune floods your mind with possibilities as you reflect on your current fiscal situation, but don't get lost in the clouds of disillusionment or doubt. Luckily, cerebral Mercury joins your inner counsel and helps guide the proceedings in a more productive direction."
pisces,2016-12-02,"Your vision of yourself has been polished until it's sparkling like a brilliant diamond today. Thankfully, your friends are feeding you confidence-boosting compliments left and right. Although the sweetness of camaraderie can be like an anesthetic for a sore heart, the reality of the current social climate could be weighing heavily on you. You might feel like you're only safe within the small group of friends you trust. Nevertheless, it's essential that you speak your truth and even more so, that your message is heard."
aries,2016-12-03,"Your social interactions are infused with a strong sense of ethics today. A supportive sextile between your ruling planet, Mars, and unyielding Saturn gives you the courage to uphold your code of honor or help a friend in need. After your work is done, you may feel like shifting gears and engaging in stimulating discourse with friends as the Moon meanders into conceptual Aquarius. C.S. Lewis wrote, ""Integrity is doing the right thing, even when no one is watching."""
taurus,2016-12-03,"Any incomplete business left over from the workweek should be fairly easy to conclude in a timely manner this morning. Serious Saturn lends a hand to ambitious Mars in your 10th House of Career, allowing you to execute your tasks efficiently. Fortunately, you're not in this alone as a friend will be there to support you if you need a little help. As the day unfolds, you may find yourself going from action mode to idea mode when the Moon moves into intelligent Aquarius. The finish line is the beginning of a whole new race."
gemini,2016-12-03,"Nothing gets your adrenaline pumping quite like a spirited discussion where each facet of a topic is explored. You have a propensity for getting your message across in a compelling way, and you might find yourself receiving an endorsement from a friend or partner that helps you drive the point home even more. Chances are that later in the day you'll be more interested in bouncing ideas around than building a flawless argument to test against someone else. Maintaining an open mind enables you to learn from others."
cancer,2016-12-03,"More often than not, what it really takes to resolve a conflict or bring something to completion is an act of service or sacrifice. That's exactly how it feels early in the day, when your willingness to do the work no matter the cost allows you to finally wrap up an issue whose time has come. Luckily, you're ready to put it all behind you and look to the future when Luna moves from committed Capricorn to thought-provoking Aquarius. The lighter your baggage, the higher you can soar."
leo,2016-12-03,"If you have any qualms about your relationship with your significant other, perhaps it's a good idea to simply do something fun together. You may be pleasantly surprised by how helpful it is to spend some stress-free time outdoors, or to share in an activity you both enjoy but haven't made the time for lately. Sometimes the best type of intimacy is when you laugh uninhibitedly together and just enjoy each other's company."
virgo,2016-12-03,"It's gratifying to see a list with all the boxes checked, and that's precisely what yours will look like at the end of the day. You're eager to knock out those household chores and in fact, with the strategic Capricorn Moon's presence in your 5th House of Playfulness, the tasks will feel more like a game than work. Once you've crossed everything off your to-do list, it's right on to making the next one. Victory is the result of preparation and determination."
libra,2016-12-03,"It's prudent to manage any domestic affairs that need settling while you have the support of the committed Capricorn Moon. A sense of accomplishment in your creative life leads to satisfaction and puts you in the mood to enjoy the rest of your weekend. If all goes according to plan, you and your friends will be on the same page when it comes to having fun after the Moon shifts into your 5th House of Spontaneity later in the day. Coloring outside of the lines with those you love does your heart good."
scorpio,2016-12-03,"Duty calls as you check your wallet today. Sorting out financial affairs isn't anyone's favorite cup of tea, but luckily, you have the support of pragmatic Saturn in your 2nd House of Finances. Don't procrastinate; organize your accounts and pay your bills before you phase completely into weekend mode. Fortunately, everything falls into place as the day progresses if you mind your business. Seize the day and enjoy the evening."
sagittarius,2016-12-03,"If there's something you want to vocalize, there's a good chance you can step up and deliver your message with the trademark maturity of seasoned Saturn today. You're quite invested in whatever is near and dear to your heart, and it's unlikely that you'll waste any energy beating around the bush. However, the mood changes when Luna moves into your 3rd House of Travel, inspiring you to get out for a brisk walk or bike ride in the fresh air to make the most of the weekend. John Keats wrote, ""The poetry of the earth is never dead."""
capricorn,2016-12-03,"Receiving usually feels better than losing something but, paradoxically, that's not always the case. Sometimes the greatest gift is to let go of an item on your crowded plate. Evaluate how much space you're giving yourself to breathe between all the things you care about, and eliminate anything that's cramping your style. Do what feels good today, even if your reasons aren't clear to others. Less self-judgment allows you to envision your future with a fresher perspective."
aquarius,2016-12-03,"Your friends have your back today as you present your point of view with integrity. This energetic shift comes just in time if the world recently seemed to be marching on without you due to your low energy. Resolute Saturn strengthens action-hero Mars in your sign, accentuating your organizational skills and blessing you with much-needed stamina to complete whatever you start. Fortunately, your personal ambitions won't isolate you from your support network because the Moon's shift into friendly Aquarius widens your social horizons. Work hard; play harder."
pisces,2016-12-03,"Although your friends are already bustling around with their weekend activities, you're not quite ready to join the party. Your mind is set on achieving your career goals or improving your social status as dynamic Mars supports steely Saturn in your 10th House of Public Persona. Whatever stirs you deep inside may provide just the fuel you need to drive you toward successful completion of a project. Where genuine effort goes, recognition is sure to follow."
aries,2016-12-04,"Thankfully, any leftover contention between you and your colleagues is easy to smooth over today. In fact, it's best to simply leave behind whatever happened during the workweek and just enjoy the spiritual vibe. There's lots of bustle and buzz in your social circle, and it's a great day to get involved with a vibrant group of people and lend some of your passion to the process. Be that as it may, it's unlike you to get lost in a crowd, so you might want to bail at the last minute if you feel like your independence is compromised by your participation."
taurus,2016-12-04,"Your long-term goals or plans for the future may have been a recent source of concern, but in this moment you find yourself reflecting on all of your accomplishments. It's rewarding to realize that your efforts are paying off, and your thoughts are likely to turn to how much you owe to your extended family for their unwavering support. Show your appreciation by volunteering your talents for a community event or a group project. Sacrificing your individuality isn't necessary to be part of the whole."
gemini,2016-12-04,"The community spirit is strong now and you may be excited about being a part of the energy. The free-thinking Aquarius Moon shines in your 9th House of Spirituality, inspiring you to volunteer at a local church or shelter. Fortunately, you may find that you're capable of taking a step back from any conflict now and come to an unconventional solution as you let go of worrying about what others think. Only fools let compliments inflate their heads and criticism hurt their hearts."
cancer,2016-12-04,"Attending to your own needs naturally flows into taking care of others today. Thankfully, a stressful relationship dynamic is settling down now that the friendly Aquarius Moon calms the waters, allowing some much-needed bonding and reparation to occur. This graceful energy reminds you of all of the values you share with those around you, so bask in the light of mutual support. A person who feels appreciated will always do more than what is expected."
leo,2016-12-04,"You tend to lead the way more than fall in line, but you do love being surrounded by your pack. The social Aquarius Moon illuminates your 7th House of Relationships, prompting your heart to swell with love for the special people in your life. Inclusive behavior elevates your position in the minds of others, so volunteer your services and invite a buddy to accompany you on your mission. Introduce a new companion to your existing group of friends and make sure he or she feels comfortable. Thankfully, the cosmic weather is perfect for reconnecting with your social network and talking about the issues that are closest to your heart."
virgo,2016-12-04,"Recuperating with your friends before the workweek begins anew makes perfect sense now. The collective spirit of the day, combined with Luna's stroll through your 6th House of Health is a cosmic invitation to take a fitness class at your neighborhood gym or hike your favorite trail with a nature-loving companion. Oftentimes, strenuous exercise relaxes the body and mind better than anything else; work up a sweat and luxuriate in the sweet reward of rest afterwards."
libra,2016-12-04,"You've cut loose the anchors keeping you tied to family obligations, freeing you to head out and enjoy pleasurable pursuits with your favorite people. The humanitarian Aquarius Moon's presence in your 5th House of Play awakens an irrepressible urge to surround yourself with creative folks who inspire you to color outside of the lines. You will start to feel better if you engage in activities that encourage personal expression like singing, dancing or performance art. Thankfully, you have a cosmic permission slip to act silly today as the leisurely vibe in the atmosphere irons out potential wrinkles before they can ruin your day."
scorpio,2016-12-04,"Enjoy the unexpected break from your hectic schedule and kick back today. This easygoing energy is wonderful for spending time with your soul family, while the social Aquarius Moon leaves you feeling involved and included. However, if you sense your autonomy slipping away, perhaps it's best to temporarily withdraw to lose yourself in a novel or favorite movie at home instead. Sometimes the healthiest strategy is to retreat and get reacquainted with yourself."
sagittarius,2016-12-04,"You may be soaring so high above the stresses and strains of the mundane world today that you want to give back to others in appreciation. Communal spirit beckons as you are grateful for your brothers and sisters in arms. Thankfully, you can contribute in many ways, such as organizing a block party or potluck dinner, where everyone can share something they enjoy. Your local community is filled with like-minded people who value every person's individuality, which allows you to be yourself without having to stand alone. Make sure to tell your closest friends just how much they mean to you while you have the chance."
capricorn,2016-12-04,"The mood of the day reminds you of the simple joy of finding a lucky penny heads up on the ground when you least expect it. It's not about monetary gain, it's about feeling like the universe is looking out for you. The philanthropic Aquarius Moon is activating your 2nd House of Self-Worth, so leave a proverbial penny for someone else today by giving back to your community in ways that align with your core values. Put your money where your mouth is and others will admire your integrity."
aquarius,2016-12-04,"Everything seems right with the world as the lethargy and inner disquiet of yesterday fades into the past. Rally your friends around you today while your social sphere vibrates with the spirit of togetherness. Connection and community are the focus of the moment, and you certainly feel right at home with these concepts. But you are known for preferring the road less traveled, so if you think you're merging a little too much for your liking, have an exit plan in mind to suit your free-flying spirit."
pisces,2016-12-04,"There is a gentle resonance of peaceful tranquility as your relaxing weekend winds down. You need your alone time to recharge your batteries today, but the needs of your tribe are just as important to you. Combine both approaches by attending a restorative yoga class with friends or gathering together a small group to share a meal. As you reflect on social issues with those you trust, take time to pause and note what you're most appreciative of in this moment. Counting your blessings cultivates grace and gratitude."
aries,2016-12-05,"On your mark, get set, go; it's time to hit the ground running. Progressive ideas are fueled by your characteristic vigor today, but there's a chance you might come on too strong if you don't choose your words wisely. Fortunately, the intellectual Aquarius Moon works in tandem with your opinionated ruler, Mars, giving you the opportunity to express yourself coolly as well as confidently. Use this cosmic boost to your advantage now, because by the time night falls you'll be more interested in relaxing and recharging than pushing a project forward."
taurus,2016-12-05,"Tensions are running high at work today, as everyone has their own ideas about how to move the group's agenda forward. The brilliant Aquarius Moon connects with ambitious Mars, setting a rather brisk pace for the day. Use this energy to be as productive as possible, and constructively throw in your two cents before you clock out. Rushing isn't your style, but it's prudent to fulfill your obligations before the Moon shifts into dreamy Pisces tonight. Taking pride in a job well done is its own reward."
gemini,2016-12-05,"Contrary to popular belief, you can't talk your way out of everything. Be careful that your words don't turn into weapons today as your conversations may gravitate toward touchy subjects like religion and politics. It can be difficult to let something go if your principles are on the line, but tempers blow over just as quickly as they flare if you don't throw fuel on the fire. Happily, the Moon drifts into whimsical Pisces later tonight, diffusing difficult dialogues and transforming your mundane thoughts into dreams of recognition and validation."
cancer,2016-12-05,"If you're wondering whether now is the right time to bring up the subject of money with a loved one, it probably is. Although it can be awkward to address financial problems, especially those involving debts or loans, it is important to confront the issues if you don't want your generosity to be taken for granted. Fortunately, you can summon the courage you need to sort out any concerns that surface today. You feel strong when you stand up for yourself and your growing confidence earns you the respect you deserve."
leo,2016-12-05,"Friction is likely between you and your beloved right now, but keep in mind that it's not always about you. Instead of reacting defensively, make sure you listen as much as you speak. Conflict isn't required today, but sometimes expressing your emotions allows the energy to move forward to a more productive place. The Moon's shift into peaceful Pisces and your 8th House of Intimacy inspires a reunion of hearts. Taking things too personally delays emotional satisfaction."
virgo,2016-12-05,"Whether you like it or not, the weekend is over and it's back to work. There's a strong chance you'll encounter some dissension over the course of the day, and it's best to acknowledge it as soon as you can. It might be upsetting when someone rocks the boat, especially when you're used to your normal routine. However, this challenge could be just the push that's needed to make an improvement to your daily grind. Dealing with a conflict immediately, while logic is on your side, enables you to think with your head rather than your heart."
libra,2016-12-05,"If you peacemakers of the zodiac had it your way, everyone would do their very best to compromise and collaborate so conflict is kept to a minimum. Unfortunately, this isn't the way the world works, and you must contend with discord now and again. You might be confronted with an issue that could cause some uncomfortable tension today, but if you say what you mean and mean what you say, you may discover that clearing the air opens up your creative channels, too. Difficult roads often lead to beautiful destinations."
scorpio,2016-12-05,"You may feel some internal conflict brewing deep beneath the surface, and it's wise to unpack it now rather than ignore or suppress it. The detached Aquarius Moon wanders through your psychological landscape today, encountering warrior Mars along the way. This combustible cosmic combination causes some rumbling in your emotional foundation, but you can make the most of the turmoil by using your passion to drive your advancement toward achieving your wildest dreams."
sagittarius,2016-12-05,"There's a need for speed as you race through your day, solving problems as you go. Issues might unexpectedly arrive this afternoon when impatient Mars runs into the eccentric Aquarius Moon, but this could serve as just the lightning bolt needed to take a brilliant idea to the next level. Resistance doesn't always slow you down; sometimes conflict resolution acts as a propelling force. Rather than ignoring the reality of the situation, save the day by finding an innovative solution as soon as you can."
capricorn,2016-12-05,"It's not like you to get upset over every little thing, but expending some emotion on a peaceful resolution is more than worth it today. Warrior Mars becomes entangled with the objective Aquarius Moon in your 2nd House of Values, prompting you to wonder why everything means so much to you now. Call it how you see it in this moment, because being honest in your reasoning moves you in the right direction. Take these steps without delay so you don't miss the opportunity to transform your life."
aquarius,2016-12-05,"You're likely to feel energetic and ready to roll at the beginning of the day, so get the show on the road early and ride the momentum. Strategic Mars teams up with the Moon in your innovative sign, propelling you forward at a breakneck pace. There may be challenges ahead, but there are also opportunities to speak up about an unorthodox solution that will get the job done. Enjoy the excitement while it lasts, because Luna's shift into intuitive Pisces will put you in a more introspective mood. Work now, dream later."
pisces,2016-12-05,"It may feel as though time is rushing on like a river today, so dive in and don't fight the currents. It is wise, however, to be wary of rocks in the rapids. You could be in for somewhat of a bumpy ride this afternoon as something surfaces from your subconscious that you didn't realize was bothering you so much. But don't be discouraged; inner turmoil can often lead you to the breakthrough you need to create positive change."
aries,2016-12-06,"The world appears foggy as you look through your subjective lens today, and it's hard to separate what is real and what is not. You may find yourself completely lost in thought, encountering hopes and fears that arise from your blind spot. Do what you can to keep your feet on the ground as the ambiguous Pisces Moon provokes unrealistic concerns, possibly leading you to self-sabotage. Fortunately, your ruling planet Mars connects with ingenious Uranus at the end of the day, providing a flash of insight to zap you back to reality."
taurus,2016-12-06,"Your heart tells you to aim for the stars since anything is possible if you put your mind to it. Faith sustains you on your way to reaching your goals while the shimmering Moon dances with fanciful Neptune in your 11th House of Dreams. However, no vehicle can run on hope alone. Fortunately, an energetic Mars-Uranus connection provides the electricity you need to wake up from your daydream and plug into the source of your passion. Stop wishing and start doing."
gemini,2016-12-06,"Your illustrious reputation precedes you everywhere you go in your imagination today. Fantasies of fame and fortune swirl through your mind as the reflective Moon conspires with Neptune the Dreamer in your 10th House of Status. Try not to get too lost in an illusion, as your feelings could hijack your logic when it's time to make decisions. Stay alert; a fresh and original insight may come out of nowhere, slicing through the haziness that colors the day."
cancer,2016-12-06,"There is a spiritual vibe lingering in the air today. The mystical mood resonates with your sensitive disposition, allowing you to move through the day feeling connected to your intuitive power. You may experience a renewed sense of faith in the universe at large while the Moon joins magical Neptune in your 9th House of Higher Truth. However, you could just as easily drift toward fear and paranoia instead of divine inspiration, so maintain conscious awareness in all your interactions. Rumi wrote, ""You are not a drop in the ocean; you are the entire ocean in a drop."""
leo,2016-12-06,"Your generous heart is in the driver's seat today as you see those you love through rose-colored glasses. It's difficult for the rational mind to steer when ceaseless visions of transcendent intimacy occupy your head space. There's nothing wrong with being enchanted by your fantasies now and again, but make sure you don't confuse them with reality. Try not to expect others to live up to your visionary ideals. Nevertheless, thanks to a lively Mars-Uranus contact, you might you may find yourself amazed by a realization of what was in front of you all along."
virgo,2016-12-06,"You may be preoccupied with wondering what others think of you today; in fact, you might be concerned that they don't even know you exist. It's hard to relax your mind at the best of times, and when the spacey Pisces Moon bumps into illusory Neptune, you could waste precious energy running in circles with worry. Neptune is known to confuse and even deceive, so try not to take these daydreams or nightmares too seriously. Thankfully, an unexpected epiphany could suddenly jostle you out of your reverie and set you back on earth."
libra,2016-12-06,"Shaking off the blahs is tricky today if you are feeling a little under the weather. You could even feel sorry for yourself while delusional Neptune mingles with the emotional Moon, especially if you're working too hard and not being appreciated for your contribution. Try not to fall into an unwarranted victim mindset where everything seems unfair; instead, take balance into your own hands, and remain grounded in your thoughts. What you think about, you bring about."
scorpio,2016-12-06,"You could drift on autopilot today, paying so little attention to your surroundings that hours fly by before you realize it. The haze seeps down from your head to your heart, and you might daydream about a perfect romance. On the outside, you may seem absent-minded, but inside your heart flutters with visions of being swept off your feet (or being the one to do the sweeping). Unfortunately, impractical decisions could land you in a sticky situation, but a flash of inspiration arrives like lightning from revolutionary Uranus, snapping you out of your trance."
sagittarius,2016-12-06,"It's prudent to get in touch with your emotions now, because they're going to flood your psychological basement anyway. You start the day with a plan, but it's soon washed away by Neptune's mystical waves. The introspective Moon beckons you to dive deep today and uncover a spiritual truth rather than let irrational fears psych you out. A brilliant Mars-Uranus sextile lightens the mood, making it healthier to address emotional issues rather than leaving them there to simmer. Joseph Campbell wrote, ""The cave you fear to enter holds the treasure that you seek."""
capricorn,2016-12-06,"It's best to just go with the flow rather than trying to control every little thing today. A nebulous Moon-Neptune conjunction fuzzes your neural pathways and trips up your tongue. Don't beat yourself up for any unintentional little blunders; it happens to everyone, and the cerebral mist will lift soon enough. There's nothing quite as powerful as the moment of clarity when you suddenly see the truth. Compassion starts with yourself."
aquarius,2016-12-06,"Beautiful fantasies dominate your mind today, and all you seem to be able to think about is your dreams of Utopia. Wishing and hoping will only get you so far before you must take concrete steps to make something consequential happen. Radical Uranus shakes things up with the help of energetic Mars, and before you know it your vision could manifest in ways you never imagined."
pisces,2016-12-06,"Your heart and imagination are united today, activating your visionary potential and strengthening your connection with something greater than yourself. However inspirational it feels to have the Moon join forces with Neptune the Mystic in your sign, be aware that this amorphous energy could be deceiving. Your grandiose notions sparkle with originality, but may lack a solid foundation to stand the test of reality. The good news is practical inspirations strike when you least expect it if you continue to push the creative edge."
aries,2016-12-07,"You may be wondering if you're heading in the right direction now, or if you should just scrap it all and try something new. The sensitive waxing Moon wants to make something grow, but the Sun is high and mighty in philosophical Sagittarius and won't concede to just anything. On top of this inner conflict, you're one quip away from provoking an argument with anyone who rubs you the wrong way. Fortunately, elegant Venus moves into intellectual Aquarius today, cooling the atmosphere and encouraging a more objective approach to social interactions. Bark less, listen more."
taurus,2016-12-07,"Your sense of purpose is at odds with your delicate emotions today, and you may find yourself just wishing this inner dilemma could be over. Aggressive Mars crosses paths with mental Mercury, straining your thinking and shortening your fuse. You simply can't deal with people getting on your case now, and you prefer to adopt a more detached perspective as your ruling planet, Venus, moves into rational Aquarius. Embracing congeniality and compromise offers you the chance to cultivate peace."

You've taken a mental stroll down both paths to explore all your options, but you're having trouble coming to a solid conclusion on which direction is best. To make matters worse, hot-headed Mars is busy picking fights and your brainy ruler, Mercury, is all too willing to take the bait. You may find yourself sharp-tongued and edgy today, but chic Venus' switch to aloof Aquarius soothes the emotionally charged tension. Ironically, taking the high road turns out to be the course of least resistance."
cancer,2016-12-07,"You're not sure if a fledgling idea can stand on its own yet, or if it needs more incubation time before it's ready to be released into the world. The last thing you want is to see something you've carefully cultivated be shot down, yet you're not certain of your next move. Better safe than sorry is your motto, but is that always true? You may consider asking a friend for some objective advice on your situation once graceful Venus moves into open-minded Aquarius. Although you might feel out of sorts, staying open to all the possibilities ahead gives you the best chances for success."
leo,2016-12-07,"Wise cracks from a partner might provoke your ire today, yet you may find yourself too exasperated to even retort. Honestly, your mind is elsewhere as the boisterous Sagittarius Sun intimidates the fragile Pisces Moon.

It seems like one wrong move could be a big mistake, so you may agonize over this uncertainty for much of the day. This uncomfortable state of mind tempts you to latch onto the smallest of details, clinging to fruitless arguments. It's a tense situation on all fronts, but there is a bright side just around the corner.

The tender Pisces Moon puts you in touch with your emotions, but your optimistic bubble might be easily burst now.

Focusing on expressing your creative side rather than engaging in meaningless squabbles inspires others to do the same."
scorpio,2016-12-07,"Verbalizing what you want is a significant challenge today. The haughty Sun clashes with the moody Moon, causing uneasiness and a lack of clarity in which direction to take. Irritation sets in as passive-aggressive remarks fly in all directions, and you might just want to give the cold shoulder to anyone who tries to start an argument. Thankfully, caring Venus enters forward-thinking Aquarius, shifting the focus from inconsequential disagreements to more universal topics. Let your light shine so brightly that others can see their way out of the dark."
sagittarius,2016-12-07,"You don't expect your emotions to get in the way of progress today, but sorting out all your options is tricky when you're hoping for a particular outcome. Arguing with yourself and others isn't going to help, but it seems unavoidable as wordsmith Mercury is challenged by contentious Mars. Emerging from the turbulent atmosphere, affable Venus steps into unflappable Aquarius. Use this favorable planetary placement to zoom out, rise above the negativity and set a positive example."
capricorn,2016-12-07,"Decisions must be made, but clarity is lacking as even the steadfast are contending with doubt today. You just want some time alone to think, but you may find yourself defending your position against the most minor oppositions, cluttering your mind with irrelevant ideas. Thankfully, amiable Venus moves into progressive Aquarius, making it easier to take a step back and disengage from avoidable issues. The right perspective makes the impossible possible."

aries,2016-12-09,"You're enjoying the cosmic momentum today, but you might not be so happy when circumstances stop your progress. Rather than just accepting the resistance you encounter, you want to do battle with anyone who stands in your way. Unfortunately, fighting the opposition of an authority figure only exacerbates the stress. It's smarter now to collaborate than to compete. Fortunately, an adversary will likely come around to your perspective, bringing a resurgence of energy and renewed optimism. Patient determination is your most efficient path to success."

Peter Drucker wrote, ""The purpose of information is not knowledge. It's being able to take the right action."""
virgo,2016-12-10,"There may be unresolved issues at home that you can no longer dance around in an attempt at deflection. Taskmaster Saturn calls the integrity of your foundations into question today, forcing you to dig deep and face the reality of the uncertain ground you're standing on.

You and stern Saturn are old friends, so take a deep breath and pour a cup of tea during this cosmic checkup in your 12th House of Endings. Moving on isn't the same as giving up, so don't let your stubborn nature keep you hanging onto something that has served its purpose. Meanwhile, the Taurus Moon beckons you to do something nice for yourself, but only indulge if you truly deserve it."
aquarius,2016-12-10,"Rules aren't your strong suit, but some boundaries are set in place to make the world a safer place. Saturn governs the cosmic laws of reality and today you need to address serious issues regarding your support network. If someone close to you fails to have your back in a time of need, it may be necessary to prune your circle of friends. Do whatever is required to fly freely with the flock you choose intentionally, and not with those who just happen to be nearby.

gemini,2016-12-11,"A quiet day of contemplation is what you think the doctor ordered but reality seems to have a totally different idea. Although the nurturing Moon in your 12th House of Meditation calls for calming your mind and recharging your batteries, it's unlikely you will stay still for long. Boredom sets in before you even begin to unplug. Thankfully, your friends already included you in their plans and you're more than ready to accept an unexpected invitation. Don't trade the thrill of living for the security of existence."
cancer,2016-12-11,"You deserve a tranquil day spent with your closest pals after adapting to some recent adjustments. However, not everyone seems to be on the same wavelength today.

Your attitude determines your direction."

Nevertheless, unresolved family issues could disturb the peace sooner than you like. Thankfully, you're prepared to handle an uncomfortable situation, make whatever changes are necessary and hope for the best. Your unflappability comes in handy when you least expect it."
aquarius,2016-12-11,"You may find yourself becoming more bored and less satisfied as the day unfolds.

Learn from the past; live in the present."

It's difficult to finish one thing before starting another, and the disorganization may be driving you a little crazy. Although the outside world is disorienting now that vulnerable Venus is under duress in your 10th House of Status, an old grudge may be what's troubling you on the inside.

You may notice that your thoughts meander a little more than you prefer while you're busy at work or school today. In fact, maverick Chiron's current activity in your 6th House of Habits draws you back to an old pattern you wish to change. It's hard for you  Virgos to admit that you're imperfect like everyone else. Nevertheless, it's healthier to acknowledge your frailties than to ignore them.

Express your emotions through art or writing while the clever Gemini Moon squares imaginative Neptune in your 5th House of Creativity. Opening your heart allows true healing to begin."
sagittarius,2016-12-12,"Boundless banter swirls around you today, decreasing your productivity while providing welcome entertainment. The witty Gemini Moon's presence in your 7th House of Others attracts conversations that may be cheerful on the outside. However, your internal dialogue is more disconcerting if you find it difficult to avoid getting lost in nostalgia. Remembering a past experience can be a catalyst that temporarily eclipses your normally sunny demeanor. Author Rabindranath Tagore said, ""Faith is the bird that feels the light and sings when the dawn is still dark."""
capricorn,2016-12-12,"You want to do it all -- the morning fitness class, the phone call you promised to a friend, and the workload you accepted to meet a deadline. Unfortunately, one interruption after another makes it difficult to focus on completing your list no matter how hard you try. You just don't have as much energy as you prefer today, while your thoughts vacillate between excitement for the future and regret about the past. Continue to put one foot in front of the other; you'll know you're on the right track when you become uninterested in looking back."
aquarius,2016-12-12,"You wish you could take a play day instead of having to return to work or school. In fact, you'd love to be distracted by any number of fun things today. The excitable Gemini Moon forms an easy trine to creative Venus, filling your mind with ideas for arts and crafts projects that you wish to fit into your schedule. However, it isn't wise to ignore what must be done, both externally and internally. Pay attention to your feelings and do the work necessary to take care of the emotional burdens you typically avoid. Do it from the heart or not at all."
pisces,2016-12-12,"You can't quite find your footing today as your restless mind makes it nearly impossible to concentrate. Ironically, the one thing you want to avoid is the one thing that dominates your consciousness. The whimsical Gemini Moon stresses your 4th House of Family, prompting you to replay an unresolved childhood memory again and again like a broken record. Your thoughts are an amorphous mirage shifting from past to future and back again. Author Steve Maraboli wrote, ""Let your past be your springboard, not your quicksand."""
aries,2016-12-13,"The holiday bustle is in full swing, which of course means your schedule is completely packed. A mercurial Full Moon in your 3rd House of Communications shines a spotlight on what comes out of your mouth. This chatty Gemini lunation is set straight across from serious-minded Saturn, warning you to not only speak responsibly, but to consider the moral principles that motivate you to speak up in the first place. Buddha teaches, ""Better than a thousand hollow words, is one word that brings peace."""
taurus,2016-12-13,"It's no secret that you enjoy the sweet comforts of life, but it's essential to keep a level head when it comes to your spending habits. The Gemini Full Moon illuminates your 2nd House of Money, prompting you to look at where your cash is coming from and where it is going. It's prudent to reassess your finances, but there could be concerns that go deeper than the surface. It's wise to consider how much you're giving away, both monetarily and energetically, as debts that aren't paid back to you can put a strain on your budget and your stamina."
gemini,2016-12-13,"The reflective Full Moon lights up your 1st House of Self, making this the perfect time to splurge on a few upgrades to your image so you can put your best foot forward. But who you associate with is even more important than your hairstyle or clothes. Be honest with yourself about the closest relationships in your life. Scrutinizing Saturn expects you to address your relationship concerns with honesty and respect; there's no reason to stoop to accusatory and deflective narratives. Out with the old, in with the new."
cancer,2016-12-13,"You are overdue for some serious rest and relaxation while the Full Moon casts a soft light on your 12th House of Privacy. During your downtime, reflect on your work obligations and the promises made to those you love. You may want to lighten your load and let a few things fall to the wayside. Remember, it's okay to say no if you can't fit anything else on your plate. Draw your boundaries and stick to your commitments; don't allow stress to drive you to the low road. Honesty is the best route to happiness."
leo,2016-12-13,"The busiest season of the year is here and while you're enjoying the festivities, there are some pressing matters that are pulling you away from the fun. The flirty Gemini Full Moon shines a spotlight on your 11th House of Groups, inspiring you to mix and mingle. However, the fickle Moon is set in high contrast to the righteous Sagittarius Sun, which is reminding you to be yourself and not compromise your authenticity. Connections are valuable for creating a support network, but make sure you're not sacrificing who you are to make them."
virgo,2016-12-13,"The pace at work is picking up speed, and you're diligently focused on your goals. The Gemini Full Moon brightens your 10th House of Career, highlighting your stellar performance on the job -- but there are always two sides to one coin. You cannot reach great heights if there's nothing solid to push off from. Domestic concerns may undermine your aspirations at work, so don't neglect one for the other. A stable foundation supports your personal and professional success."
libra,2016-12-13,"Spirited discourse around moral and ethical principles is a familiar activity around the holidays. The inquisitive Gemini Full Moon enlightens your 9th House of Higher Truth, refocusing your attention to what it is you truly think. You might be challenged by those in your immediate environment, as disagreements are likely to arise when everyone feels strongly about their beliefs. Stand your ground, but do it honorably -- there's room for multiple views. Respect is a two-way street."
scorpio,2016-12-13,"Many people are strapped for cash around the holidays, and your pocketbook may be on your mind today. It's natural to think about money owed and money loaned while the Full Moon illuminates your 8th House of Shared Resources. Scrupulous Saturn looks on from across the zodiac, requiring you to be realistic about how much you can afford, both financially and emotionally. Debts left unpaid can breed resentment, so the sooner you settle accounts, the better for everyone involved."
sagittarius,2016-12-13,"The fun and festive season is ramping up, but there are some stressors present which keep you from fully engaging in the excitement. The Gemini Full Moon occupies your 7th House of Relationships, throwing its bright light on the people closest to you. Observe what issues your relationships are reflecting back at you -- because how you respond is the most important part. Your philosophical nature combined with a strong dose of maturity from solemn Saturn is a recipe for progress, as long as you stick to your principles."
capricorn,2016-12-13,"Some days it can be difficult to persevere when you wonder if what you're doing even makes a difference. The Full Moon's presence in your 6th House of Habits accentuates your duties and obligations, allowing you to evaluate if giving your all is worth it or a waste of your time and talent. Reexamine your motives and realign your priorities if necessary. Your greatest strength can also be your greatest weakness; carefully aim your ambition in the right direction and success will be yours."
aquarius,2016-12-13,"You may be in the thick of the workweek, but you find your thoughts turning to fun and fantasy today. A flirtatious Gemini Full Moon heats up your 5th House of Romance, but responsible Saturn warns you to not take things too far or too fast. There are personal and professional ramifications to consider, and you want to do the right thing by everyone. Have fun, but err on the side of caution when it comes to matters of the heart."
pisces,2016-12-13,"Your nerves are jumpy as restlessness plagues you today, but potent realizations offer an unexpected wake-up call. The Gemini Full Moon in your 4th House of Roots exposes the extra baggage you bring home with you at the end of the day. It's perfectly acceptable to ambitiously strive for your goals, but when your work starts negatively affecting your personal life, it might be time for a realignment of your priorities. Do right by your career, but do right by your heart, too. You can't help one and leave the other behind."
aries,2016-12-14,"Someone in your group of friends or social network may catch your eye in a way you never noticed before. Enjoy the flirtatious vibe, but understand the difference between playful banter and real affection. Feeling those butterflies in your stomach is always exciting, but a lasting relationship is built on so much more than chemical attraction. Reconnect with your family -- biological or chosen -- today, and bask in the unconditional love and support that only they can provide."
taurus,2016-12-14,"In light of the past few days of excitement, you might want to take a moment to slow down and collect yourself. Speak kindly and tread softly; do something sweet like mailing a funny card to someone who could use a smile or calling a friend who needs a supportive ear. Although the mood is mellow today, you may encounter a fascinating individual who peaks your interest but is best seen as a fleeting flame. Focus on what matters most, like caring for those you love, including yourself."
gemini,2016-12-14,"The whirlwind slows, and it's time to take personal inventory. You may want to linger to  admire and appreciate the possessions that make you feel happy today. Keep in mind that things are just material, but human connections transcend the physical. Although nurturing emotional bonds is the underlying theme now, nothing stays still for long around you. A creative connection between sexy Venus and cosmic-firecracker Uranus inspires unconventional types of fun and unpredictable events. Memories are timeless treasures of the heart."
cancer,2016-12-14,"Strong emotions are more fleeting than you think today. The soothing Moon comes home to rest in your sign now, putting you in touch with your deepest feelings. You may feel extra affectionate and a little bit needy, but try not to let yourself slip into a possessive attitude or exhibit jealous behavior. However, you could lose the magic if you hold on too tightly. Dance with a light heart and invite others to join in."
leo,2016-12-14,"Your charisma lights up a room today and you can't help but gather more than your fair share of admirers. However, it's important to set aside some time to be alone to recharge your batteries and reassess your direction. You Leos are natural performers, but even the best entertainers need a break from putting on a good show. It's nice to be noticed, but what you really crave now is an uncomplicated and nurturing connection. Start by being the kind of lover or friend you seek."
virgo,2016-12-14,"Spending quality time with your friends acts as a tonic for your heart. Sometimes it's easy to forget when you're caught up in the daily grind just how much they mean to you, but now you're feeling an extra burst of gratitude and appreciation. Someone may even mistake your affection for flirting since it's tough to tell the difference between shallow desires and true connections today. Keep things platonic and don't commit to anything serious or you might regret changing the easy dynamic into something more complicated."
libra,2016-12-14,"It's a sunshiny day when everyone seems to give you a friendly smile. You're no stranger to being popular, but you could end up engaging in some romantic intrigue today. This harmless flirtation is all well and good, but it's best to keep your heart from playing games. Trying to fill an emotional void with fleeting interactions will only make you feel emotionally drained at the end of the day. A big hug from a close friend or a few reassuring words from a family member is all you really need."
scorpio,2016-12-14,"There's a sentimental feeling lingering in the air today, but you may feel like true affection is nowhere to be found. Do your best to acknowledge your emotions without wallowing in regret, and consider what you can do to rekindle your faith in relationships. There is always a risk of heartbreak, but the sweet rewards are worth the effort, regardless. Remain open to a love that is pure and innocent. A head full of fears has no space for dreams."
sagittarius,2016-12-14,"An everyday conversation may turn into a mind-opening and soul-energizing dialogue, and the resulting chemistry could have you wondering if this is the start of an exciting new relationship. Don't confuse infatuation with the real thing today. Listen to your intuition, and it will guide you to a love that is nourishing for your heart. Empower yourself before you give someone else your power."
capricorn,2016-12-14,"If it seems like people are extra clingy today, they probably are feeling the planetary pull of the affectionate Cancer Moon. Your loved ones need you and you need them a little more than you might want to admit. Make a point to spend time with your closest allies and tell them how much you appreciate their supportive presence during the good and the bad times. Although your words of gratitude can positively influence those around you, the boomerang effect brings the love back to you and reenergizes your soul."
aquarius,2016-12-14,"You may receive an extra creative boost from the cosmos today, and it's wise to allow your imagination to guide your lifestyle choices. You're typically not one to blend into the crowd, but now your quirkiness comes out in spades. You might enjoy rattling everyone's cages with your radical behavior, but make sure you leave enough time to tend to your physical needs. Blazing your own trail takes its toll, and it's important to slow down by pampering yourself now and again."
pisces,2016-12-14,"It's not always clear to you Fish what is real and what is fantasy, and today you may find yourself questioning if something was just a figment of your imagination. Be wary of a temporary loneliness driving you to look for connection everywhere, which can lead to delusions of returned affections or unhealthy choices. The safe bet is to get together with a close friend or family member who knows you inside and out. This uncomplicated kind of love is just the same as it was when you were a child, and it will warm your heart just as much."
aries,2016-12-15,"Your thoughts and your feelings are in decidedly opposite camps today. Reconciling your mind and heart can be tough, especially on the relationship front. Regardless of the independence you personally want in a relationship, the clingy Cancer Moon has you longing for someone to need you as much as you need them. This temporary dissension is uncomfortable, but don't let it drive you to act out and treat others unkindly. Author Jack Kornfield teaches, ""If your compassion does not include yourself, it is incomplete."""
taurus,2016-12-15,"A casual conversation may turn chilly today, prompting you to question the strength of a significant relationship. You have a sneaking suspicion that there might be a fundamental difference in principles that you never noticed before, and your dismay is palpable. Switch your focus and distract yourself until the paranoia blows over or you discover facts to validate your concerns. You can prevent a grudge from beginning to calcify by letting empathy take the driver's seat."
gemini,2016-12-15,"Your focus is on your core values today, and you may wonder whether you and your partner have enough in common to sustain a long-term relationship. You might be worried that the whole thing could be a sham if you don't want the same things out of life. Try not to jump to extreme conclusions as your mind fills in the perceived blanks with fear-based notions or preconceived assumptions. Take a few steps back and be certain you are not overreacting. Keep calm and listen with open ears."
cancer,2016-12-15,"Relationships are at the forefront of your mind today, and it may be hard to think of anything else. You might even worry that your significant other is keeping secrets from you. You're protective at the best of times, but be careful that your concern doesn't turn into possessiveness. Sometimes it can be hard to relinquish your fears, even if you know they're holding you back. Believe that your heart will lead you to the truth. Trust is vital if a bond is to last."
leo,2016-12-15,"What starts as any other day may get thrown off-kilter as unexpected events turn the tables on your regular routine. Your thoughts drift to unspoken fears about relationships and the fragility of your heart. You might want to crawl in a hole and hide, but the truth probably isn't as scary as you think. Be careful not to sabotage a good thing by internalizing your feelings. Sharing your concerns sooner than later saves you from unnecessary heartache."
virgo,2016-12-15,"Something about today makes you a little uneasy. A thought may suddenly appear out of nowhere which causes you to doubt the strength of your relationships. You're replaying conversations in your mind, wondering if you understood them correctly the first time or if there was an underlying double meaning. It might seem impossible to stop this cycle of worry, but a little trust goes a long way to bring you back from the edge. Forgiving and forgetting does your heart good."
libra,2016-12-15,"Your warm and fuzzy feelings may cool off today when fears resurface from deep within your subconscious. You may obsess about whether or not you can actually trust the ones you love, or if they care more about themselves. The fretful Cancer Moon makes you feel like you can't move on from this epiphany, but take a deep breath and try to look at things objectively. Are these fears realistic or are they creations of an overactive imagination? Cultivate compassion and let it help you lay the past to rest."
scorpio,2016-12-15,"You wish your faith was burning brighter today, but you can't help but struggle to keep your head above water. Insecurities around relationships dominate your thoughts, and you might question whether your significant other has enough time for you and your needs. Unfortunately, you're especially prone to jealousy now, so be careful to temper your unsubstantiated suspicions and overblown doubts. Accept what is beyond your control, but don't feed the fears or they will destroy what you love most."
sagittarius,2016-12-15,"It may be difficult to see past anxieties that arise today regarding your closest relationships. You might feel as if someone doesn't really love you for who you truly are. Despite your natural optimistic disposition, you often can be quite a harsh judge, so take a breather and really think things through before you say something you will regret. Sticking to the moral high ground now is the only course of action that makes sense if you want a connection to last."
capricorn,2016-12-15,"You might as well face any relationship turbulence head on today because avoidance will only cause more emotional damage in the long run. The caring Cancer Moon highlights your 7th House of Relationships, nudging you to share your feelings honestly, even if you're concerned that you will receive a negative response. Approach any tough conversations with warmth and sincerity so you can sort out whether it is worth it for both of you to continue together or go it alone."
aquarius,2016-12-15,"Pinpointing the missing puzzle pieces of your relationship world is not an easy task. On one hand, you might long for a healthy partnership that will grow stronger, both in good times and bad. But on the other hand, you may worry that you will sabotage your chances for finding true love any time it gets scary. Perhaps it's time to finally let go of any remnants of fear of commitment or pain from previous relationships. Forgive your past; embrace your future."
pisces,2016-12-15,"You want to express your feelings today, but you might be afraid your disclosure will somehow strain your relationships. The moody Cancer Moon encourages you to be true to your heart, even if you're nervous about not being accepted. Unfortunately, worrying about the outcome could spiral you downward into an emotional vortex if you don't fight the inclination. Thankfully, the solution is easier than you think; some things are better left unsaid."
aries,2016-12-16,"After confronting some rather major emotional challenges, you step out of your door, ready to crank up the volume on life today. The Moon proudly marches into lively Leo, setting a boisterous tone for the day. However, there might be a cosmic noise complaint coming from strict Saturn's direction, reminding you to not go overboard when it comes to indulging in pleasurable pursuits or outrageous behavior. Orson Wells said, ""The enemy of art is the absence of limitations."""
taurus,2016-12-16,"Happily, the insecurity of yesterday fades away as the Sun rises to create a bright new day. The bold Leo Moon grounds you in the quiet certainty that you are doing everything it takes to achieve your dreams. Be wary of your pride in your work turning into haughtiness while sobering Saturn is on guard to check your ego at the slightest provocation. Humility is the balloon, confidence is the hot air -- your balloon must be intact for the hot air to send you skyward."
gemini,2016-12-16,"You're excited to jump back on the proverbial track again after an unexpected emotional detour yesterday. In fact, you can't wait to tell people about your fascinating new idea, and everyone is eager to gather around and listen. However, speak responsibly and without hyperbole today, because your enthusiasm is under the watchful eye of stern Saturn. Methodically pace yourself and modify your trajectory so you don't derail your plans before they even get off the drawing board."
cancer,2016-12-16,"The mood has lightened immensely today, allowing you to breathe a sigh of relief and let down your guard. The passionate Leo Moon inspires you to feel generous in all directions, but make sure you don't completely ignore the clock or your wallet. Although you have more energy to put into the things that really matter to you now, your obligations still loom in the shadows and it's unwise to go to extremes to prove your invincibility. Stick to your schedule so you can end your day without regret."
leo,2016-12-16,"The King of the Jungle is proud to make his presence known, and you Leos are no different when you are ready to roar. The Moon returns to your expressive sign today, pumping up your passionate exuberance. This cosmic ego boost could blast you with such a shot of confidence that you might sound cocky if you exaggerate your abilities. You may need to make a few hasty adjustments after running into a sobering speed bump or two placed in your path by karmic Saturn. Proactive measures prevent problems from spinning your day out of control."
virgo,2016-12-16,"You might have hit a rough patch yesterday, but today you're feeling more like your calm and collected self. Your sense of humor is back in action, and any problems you encounter now don't seem quite as dire as they would have just a few days ago. Although you may believe you're capable of accomplishing all you set out to do, make sure not to overextend yourself or bossy Saturn will punish your mistakes. Small steps are the secret to your success."
libra,2016-12-16,"You may have been questioning the motives of your heart yesterday, but now it's time to lighten up and have some fun. The generous Leo Moon inspires you to feel sanguine and social; creating special memories with your friends hits the spot. However, you could experience some friction from pragmatic Saturn, requiring you to enjoy responsibly because your to-do list still has plenty of items which need to be crossed off. Moderation is your friend if you want to earn the respect of others."
scorpio,2016-12-16,"Thankfully, your doubts and fears dissolve into the past as you approach the day with renewed fervor. You feel a reinvigorated sense of purpose and are anxious to pursue your goals as the audacious Leo Moon strides into your 10th House of Career. Luna fuels your bold ambitious and colorful dreams, but utilitarian Saturn tempers any excessive zealousness with a quick burst of karma. Stay humble as you conquer the world."
sagittarius,2016-12-16,"You've spent more time than you wanted coming to grips with some emotional revelations recently, but today you're ready to put your heart into something productive again. The vibrant Leo Moon energizes your 9th House of Higher Truths, harmonizing with your natural big-picture mindset and encouraging you to reach for your dreams. However, stable Saturn solidifies the energy and demands that you speak with integrity. A perfect balance between passion and practicality wins the prize."
capricorn,2016-12-16,"It's a welcome relief to get back to business after a brief stop to attend to some worrisome matters of the heart. The self-directed Leo Moon adds subjectivity to issues pertaining to shared resources, which may have you feeling possessive about certain assets, or insecure about the longevity of the partnership. A tense aspect from imposing Saturn can prompt you to overreact, but it's prudent to simply make the needed alterations to alleviate tension as soon as time permits."
aquarius,2016-12-16,"The unwavering power of love outshines the emotional rollercoaster ride of yesterday. The ardent Leo Moon heats up your 7th House of Relationships, infusing your personal interactions with an enticing magnetism. As wrapped up as you might be in adoring your partner and being adored right back, don't get carried away by romantic illusions. Somber Saturn steps in to warn you to keep a larger perspective, even when it's hard to tear your gaze from what's right in front of you."
pisces,2016-12-16,"Yesterday's emotional turbulence fades in the dawn of a new day and the icy waters of doubt recede to be replaced with hope and warmth. There's an optimistic filter over everything now, and you approach your duties and obligations with extra enthusiasm. Stoic Saturn still lurks in the shadows to remind you that while dedication is important, attaching your ego to your work can turn passion into fanaticism.  Less is more is a motto worth striving for in today's climate of excess."
aries,2016-12-17,"Your current disposition consists of one part sheer determination, one part wild abandon, and one part good cheer. The fiery vibe of the dramatic Leo Moon suits you perfectly today, and your game is on point. A harmonious Grand Trine between the playful Moon, rebellious Uranus, and responsible Saturn strikes just the right balance, enabling you to walk the line between bucking the system and following the rules -- and have plenty of fun doing it."
taurus,2016-12-17,"Your unflappable willpower to fulfill your obligations fuels your strong confidence in your abilities today. Although sudden changes might occur at the last minute, you're well-equipped to handle whatever is tossed your way now.

gemini,2016-12-17,"You are blessed with a fountain of ideas today as colorful visions endlessly spill over in your mind's eye. The theatrical Leo Moon creates creative connections with rule-making Saturn and rule-breaking Uranus, giving you the rare opportunity to say exactly what you think to a receptive audience. This cosmic advantage offers you the chance to push the limits without crossing a line. Thankfully, there's no need to waste time in hours of analysis; for once, it's okay to act first and think later."
cancer,2016-12-17,"Take a moment while rushing to finish your errands to consider the values you're assigning to the material world around you. Of course, it's easy to get attached to the wrong things during the gifting season, but letting money or objects dominate your thinking isn't good for your soul. Luckily, the luxurious Leo Moon receives helpful trines from both pragmatic Saturn and progressive Uranus, bringing you a healthy perspective on what to hang onto and what to let go. Honor your heart by cherishing the ones you love the most."
leo,2016-12-17,"Your light is shining brighter than the brightest star today. The generous Leo Moon occupies your 1st House of Personality, amplifying your charming qualities and making you nearly impossible to ignore. Fortunately, a set of favorable contacts with the polar opposites of lightning-like Uranus and rock-steady Saturn enable you to expertly balance loud with proud. Magically, you can dazzle those around you by being enterprising and responsible at the very same time. Work for a cause, not for the applause, and a lasting sense of satisfaction is your reward."
virgo,2016-12-17,"It might appear like a normal even-keeled day on the outside, but you are experiencing a variety of feelings on the inside. The lively Leo Moon activates your 12th House of Spirituality, creating epiphanies and uncovering revelations no one knows about except you. Thankfully, you can stay emotionally grounded when exploring these brilliant ideas; trusting your instincts allows you to bring them into the light of reality when the time is right."
libra,2016-12-17,"Immersing yourself in a group of people who share your beliefs is imperative for your personal growth now. The spirit of camaraderie makes you feel like you're all of one collective mind today, and that your little tribe can alter the course of the world. Although the passionate energy of the Leo Moon motivates you to aim high, brilliant connections from traditional Saturn and unconventional Uranus help you create waves of change without capsizing the boat."
scorpio,2016-12-17,"Your heightened desire to achieve the impossible has you champing at the bit today, ready to pave the way to progress. A thrilling Grand Fire Trine between the Moon, Saturn and Uranus highlights your ambitious goals, and offers you plenty of inspirational ideas on how you can achieve them.

Thankfully, your passion is contagious while the dramatic Leo Moon unites with revolutionary Uranus and steadfast Saturn. Don't grow complacent and waste this powerful yet balanced cosmic configuration. Revitalize your most wonderful fantasies about the future, while you can also remain practical enough to see them through. Anything is possible when you find that sweet spot between the ideal and the real."
capricorn,2016-12-17,"You know the rules are there for a reason, and you're generally inclined to follow them; in fact, you even like to draw the guidelines whenever possible. However, dynamic Uranus sparks an electric connection to the lively Leo Moon today, inspiring your inner fire to burn a little hotter. The planets are giving you a free pass to take a risk, offering you cosmic assurance that you will succeed as long as you have the sense to not stretch the envelope too far. Fortune favors the bold, but only if you know when to not push your luck."
aquarius,2016-12-17,"The warmhearted energy from yesterday is carried forward today, but a round of planetary fireworks is tossed into the mix to shock you out of your comfort zone. The animated Leo Moon interacts with unpredictable Uranus, saturating the range of feelings you're experiencing now. There's no doubt that you are on a wild and crazy ride. However, it is your choice to stand up and throw your hands in the air or to follow the rules and buckle up. Courage without wisdom can lead to dangerous results."
pisces,2016-12-17,"You take quiet pride in your work today because it's deeply gratifying to know how much you're needed. However, try not to get too attached to your routine since your schedule will inevitably shift more than once during this hectic season. Nevertheless, a conductive Grand Trine between the creative Leo Moon, industrious Saturn and brilliant Uranus energizes your workflow and removes obstacles in your path before you even need to struggle. Don't be shy; this is your chance to accomplish great feats in an original and innovative way."
aries,2016-12-18,"The focus shifts from outside to inside as you wind down from a fast-paced weekend. The Moon steps into industrious Virgo today, and you are busy meeting obligations rather than putting on a show. Although you understand that everyone is preoccupied with their own concerns, it's annoying when your accomplishments aren't recognized. Don't let a lack of praise darken your day. However, an evening connection between dreamy Neptune and the inspirational Sagittarius Sun gives you a cosmic permission slip to escape to fantasyland after your work is done."
taurus,2016-12-18,"The saturation setting on life seems to have been turned down so everything appears in muted tones. Although it's not quite as cheery as you might prefer for the holiday season, it's a welcome change of pace when the Moon moves into fellow earth sign, virtuous Virgo. Tackling practical chores like meal prep, list making, and gift wrapping before the week starts makes the tasks more enjoyable. Do your busy work earlier in the day, because tonight you're going to want to lose yourself in a captivating book or movie and cozy in with the ones you love."
gemini,2016-12-18,"The switch from outbound energy to inbound energy sets the scene today. Bring your ideas home and opt for a quiet mix of rest and work. You may be slightly irritated if no one immediately compliments your sparkly decorations or delicious cookies, but at the end of the day all your effort won't go unnoticed. Thankfully, a whimsical Sun-Neptune connection stimulates your creativity and offers a spiritual respite right when you need it most."

As the holiday season unfurls, there are plenty of details to keep you hopping, so let the meticulous Virgo Moon facilitate some planning in your downtime. Don't take it personally if someone is clueless to the amount of work you're putting in -- do it for your own joyful satisfaction, instead. Others are probably trying to tackle just as much, if not more than you. Attacking your goals in bite-size pieces allows you to savor the true message of the season."
leo,2016-12-18,"There's somewhat of an energetic letdown from the weekend high as you pivot your focus to your finances and immediate goals. Sorting out your holiday budget is much easier with the help of the discerning Virgo Moon's presence in your 2nd House of Money. Attending to fiscal matters may not be your typical fun activity for a Sunday afternoon, but don't let the numbers drag you down. Finish your financial due diligence early and there will still be time for a peaceful interlude tonight before another busy week begins."
virgo,2016-12-18,"It's almost like the cosmic music has changed to something that better suits your natural rhythm. As the evocative Moon moves into your conscientious sign, you're able to hit the proverbial reset button and put all your personal affairs in order before the weekend is over. Nevertheless, it's prudent to accomplish as much as possible before nightfall. The surreal Neptune-Sun connection lends itself more to whimsy and less to practicality, making it a perfect night for dreaming your way to sleep."
libra,2016-12-18,"The pace slows today as rest and self-reflection become top priority. The perceptive Virgo Moon slips into your 12th House of Secrets, helping you to clean out the cobwebs that have gathered in your subconscious mind over the past month. Take stock of where your dreams lose touch with reality and visualize a path joining the two worlds. Make the most of the enchanting magic of an otherworldly Sun-Neptune connection by letting your imagination color in the details of your future."
scorpio,2016-12-18,"You're walking on the path of purpose since your energy is aligned with your goals and ambitions; but today you are being asked to utilize a more focused and practical approach. You have your checklist in hand and a clear idea of where you want to be in the future, but what direction will you take to get there? The methodical Virgo Moon can help you build a staircase to your destiny by breaking down spiritual goals into actionable steps. Dreams don't work unless you do."
sagittarius,2016-12-18,"Whether you like it or not, details exist for a reason and it's important to examine them on a regular basis. The precise Virgo Moon calls your attention to the smaller pieces of the puzzle today, helping you sort through them to find the information you need without cluttering your mind unnecessarily. Your specialty may be envisioning the bigger picture, but you can't ignore the logistics of creating it. The more you learn, the more you grow."
capricorn,2016-12-18,"Your focus shifts to a plethora of practical considerations now that the fun of the weekend is wrapping up. The Moon's entry into fellow earth sign Virgo highlights your 9th House of Travel, making this the perfect time to finalize holiday plans. However, not all travel is physical, and you may find yourself embarking on an excursion through your vivid imagination when an enchanting Neptune-Sun contact blurs the line between fiction and fact. Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote, ""A single dream is more powerful than a thousand realities."""
aquarius,2016-12-18,"The high-energy weekend is winding down and your thoughts move from personal affairs of the heart to material concerns. The pragmatic Virgo Moon brings up the topic of ""yours, mine and ours,"" so try to keep your facts straight as you sort out the details. This relationship work can be tedious and doesn't necessarily evoke fanfare, but it's worth it to iron out the little things now so they don't tangle you up later. Talk more, stress less."
pisces,2016-12-18,"There is a distinct change in the air as you begin to reconsider how you can best support those closest to you. The dutiful Virgo Moon's natural inclination is to help and serve; Luna's shining presence in your 7th House of Relationships encourages you to be more conscientious of the needs of others. However, it is best to give freely without expectation if you truly want to receive anything of value in return."
aries,2016-12-19,"The hectic hustle of the holidays may seem extra complicated these days. Trickster Mercury turns retrograde to spend extra time in your 10th House of Reputation. Be aware of what you say in a casual conversation now because it could be taken out of context by your coworkers. Your courageous ruler Mars dives into watery Pisces today, sapping your drive and cooling your fire. Proceed slowly and try your best to communicate with clarity to avoid unnecessary misunderstandings on the job or hurt feelings at home. Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""Honesty is the first chapter in the book of wisdom."""
taurus,2016-12-19,"There's no time to slow down while the holiday energy envelops your world, but you may have little choice in the matter. Mercury the Messenger retrogrades in your 9th House of Travel, adding delays and mishaps to your already overbooked schedule. You might be so exhausted by the current noisy social dialogue that you don't possess the emotional energy to stand up for what you believe in. Be kind to yourself and others; choosing quality over quantity increases everyone's happiness."
gemini,2016-12-19,"Whether you're working, traveling, or staying in for the holidays, you are probably busier than a bee in a field of flowers. Clever Mercury goes retrograde today to begin its three-week review of your 8th House of Intimacy, urging you to reevaluate shared assets and the logistics of partnerships as a whole. Nevertheless, you are slow in your progress and often divide your attention over too many tasks. Scale back your goals, open communication lines and double-check the facts to minimize confusion and maximize productivity."
cancer,2016-12-19,"It's easy to slip into overwhelm as the busyness of the season starts to take its toll on your mind and body. It's critical to choose your words consciously now as cerebral Mercury's retrograde backtracks through your 7th House of Relationships. Late night heart-to-hearts with your partner could prove to be emotionally healing as you review your relationship goals and the beliefs you share. Assertive Mars' move into spacey Pisces may weaken your resolve to fight for what you want, but try not to lose faith in the bigger picture. A deeper transformation is quietly occurring that galvanizes your spiritual growth."
leo,2016-12-19,"You can carry a lot on your shoulders when required, but the weight of your obligations seems to be growing heavier by the day. Your packed schedule may begin to catch up with you after Mercury goes retrograde in your 6th House of Health. Examine your unsustainable habits, whether they're vices or cases of overcommitment, because it's time to reshuffle your priorities. Grab this opportunity to uncover the deep truths at the core of your desire to excel. But take the words of Anton Chekhov to heart: ""Knowledge is of no value unless you put it into practice."""
virgo,2016-12-19,"It may seem as if you're at the mercy of the hectic season, and right now you might feel like bowing out and hiding until it blows over. Cerebral Mercury begins its retrograde period in your 5th House of Play, causing you to rethink how you spend your recreational time. But others don't necessarily approve of your decisions if your plans don't include them. You're likely to back down today rather than arguing with someone just to prove a point. Fortunately, taking the path of compromise turns out to be the gold standard of your current options."
libra,2016-12-19,"You may be running around completing last-minute errands, but there are complicated domestic issues to address which can no longer be ignored. Mercury the Messenger turns retrograde in your 4th House of Family, potentially delivering some messages to the wrong address. Double-check your holiday plans to circumvent confusion and unmet expectations. If you feel like you're running out of steam, take preventative measures to avoid exhaustion ruining your holidays. Be wise and do the right thing before it's no longer a choice."
scorpio,2016-12-19,"You may grow weary just thinking about the lively discourse that inevitably happens when you visit relatives around the holidays. Your muddled mind could have you tripping over your tongue before you even say anything now that interactive Mercury is turning retrograde in your 3rd House of Communication. However, you're currently inclined to speak less and express yourself in other ways. Although you don't typically back down from an argument, it's prudent to just take the high road and wait it out. Channel your angst into your art."
sagittarius,2016-12-19,"Your thoughts turn to your budget today as you finish up holiday shopping and fine-tune travel plans. Mercantile Mercury begins its three-week retrograde period by assessing your 2nd House of Finances, so read the fine print before you make any significant purchases. Meanwhile, heroic Mars slides into gentle Pisces, discouraging you from provoking arguments -- especially those that tend to happen with family gathered around the dinner table. Maintaining the peace will be a lot easier if you steer conversations toward light and enjoyable topics as much as you can."
capricorn,2016-12-19,"Your busy schedule requires that you keep marching on, but you really just want to stop and take a nap. Messenger Mercury slows to a standstill in your sign today, turning around to retrace his steps as you check your list twice. It may take longer to get around during the next three weeks so allow for extra transit time to give yourself the advantage. Furthermore, fiery Mars dissolves into watery Pisces, fizzling some of the ambition that usually drives you forward. Even if it feels hard to keep your head above water, stick to your agenda and take it one task at a time. No one expects you to be a superhero, except yourself."
aquarius,2016-12-19,"A journey through your subconscious could reveal things you don't want to think about at first, but avoidance only leads to more headaches. Disruptive Mercury's retrograde starts in your 12th House of Secrets today, so be careful of anything you might be hiding because it may end up dragged out into the public domain somehow. Unfortunately, it could be difficult to act decisively after go-getter Mars slips into fuzzy Pisces. Being honest about your uncertainty is a more viable strategy than pretending you know what's best. Vulnerability is the key out of this self-made mess."
pisces,2016-12-19,"You may be secretly longing for the hectic holiday season to slow down, but the excitement is just beginning to ramp up to full tilt. Mischievous Mercury is back-stepping through your 11th House of Networking, placing an awkward emphasis on what you communicate and how you do it. It's important to think before you speak over the next three weeks as careless words might be lost in translation or taken out of context. Pursuing the longer and more methodical route when delivering your message is wise, even if it takes more effort to make your point."
aries,2016-12-20,"It's crunch time as you try to fit as many last-minute activities into your schedule as humanly possible. Your personal obligations may clash with your long-term goals today, and it's a struggle to keep a clear perspective while still wrapping up tasks that need to be done. Thankfully, this tension fades on its own when the Moon moves into charming Libra, adding a sense of beauty to everything you touch. Don't lose the real meaning of the holidays in your pursuit of perfection."
taurus,2016-12-20,"The day feels rushed as you try to finish projects at the last minute; perhaps you're only just now decorating for the holidays or starting your shopping late. It's easy to feel spread rather thin as you try to juggle all the fun things you want to do for yourself and the commitments you've already made to others. Fortunately, the Moon's shift into pleasant Libra offers respite, enabling you to easily balance your personal needs and the wishes of your friends and family."
gemini,2016-12-20,"As you try to wrap up loose ends and get all the housecleaning done today, people are persuading you to see the bigger picture. These conflicting perspectives aren't very helpful right now, so it's best to focus on the particulars that matter the most while the Moon is still in organized Virgo. However, Luna's entry into agreeable Libra tonight makes it much easier to acquiesce to another person's point of view. Collaboration cultivates peace and harmony if you are willing to play by someone else's rules."
cancer,2016-12-20,"Extra responsibilities begin to add up, and before you know it you're making more phone calls and running more errands than you expected. As you attempt to get these last-minute affairs in order, you may feel slightly frustrated that you don't have time for your normal routine today. It's uncomfortable when you must step out of your comfort zone to make something special happen, but there's no cause for panic now. The Moon's glide into genial Libra relieves some of the pressure just in time to turn your stress into the satisfaction of a job well done."
leo,2016-12-20,"There's a disturbing gulf between what you want to be doing today and your pile of unfinished obligations. It's no fun to spend time paying the bills or running errands when you prefer to be chasing pleasurable pursuits. However, settling down and completing your business early in the day allows you to fully relax with a clear conscience later on. Hurry up and finish your chores as a well-deserved celebration is waiting for you around the next corner."
virgo,2016-12-20,"There's so much to do and so little time, but you naturally thrive when there's detail-oriented tasks to be done. However, minor discord between your busy external self and what's buried internally could leave you feeling out of sorts this afternoon. Happily, this emotional discomfort doesn't last long as the Moon's ingress into light-hearted Libra temporarily allays the unresolved tension. When in doubt, throw yourself into your work."
libra,2016-12-20,"Your mind is a labyrinth today as you search through old stories you've kept locked up inside. It could be challenging to determine what it is you truly believe as conflicting thoughts wage battle in the background while you continue to go about your day. Fortunately, the Moon moves from your 12th House of Invisibility into the brightness of your 1st House of Self, renewing your confidence and recharging your energy. Owning your power is the first step to taking back what is rightfully yours."
scorpio,2016-12-20,"It's hard to see past whatever is immediately right in front of you now because you're inundated with social events and holiday plans involving your family and friends. However, an irritating mental itch paints colorful visions of alternative activities today, just at the periphery of your awareness. Luckily, your aggravation won't last long as the Moon's entrance into artful Libra gives your mind a well-deserved chance to rest. Let your imagination run the show."
sagittarius,2016-12-20,"There are so many details to manage this time of year that it's tempting to just surrender control and let someone else deal with all the facts and figures. The last thing you want to do is crunch numbers now, but you feel the tense pull between what you know must be done, and where your heart is calling you to go. Fortunately, the Moon's shift from analytical Virgo to affable Libra makes it easier to see things from a more peaceful perspective. Honest hearts produce honest actions."
capricorn,2016-12-20,"There are many small tasks that require your attention today and you want to get every one of them right on the very first try. However, distractions may arise from unseen places or even from unrest that's buried deep inside of your subconscious. Although this unsettling vibe can persist throughout the day, your unwavering perseverance pays off when it comes to tackling your chores. Handling the tiniest details in advance ensures the biggest things happen without a glitch."
aquarius,2016-12-20,"There's a frenetic feeling as you flip back and forth between zooming in on one specific issue and zooming out for a more global perspective. While you usually prefer to just pick one trajectory and doggedly stick with it until its logical conclusion, you may benefit from the best of both worlds if you continue to vacillate between the narrow and wide views today. Paradoxically, the ongoing juxtaposition of multiple perspectives opens your mind and makes you more effective in the long run."
pisces,2016-12-20,"You seem to waffle between focusing on the broad strokes, or getting wrapped up in every tiny detail you encounter today. Your thinking may be strained as you try to cram too many things into your day while there already is so much piled up on your plate. However, you can put the cosmic energy to better use if you singularly focus on the task at hand now. Finishing one thing at a time leaves you in a better position at the end of the day than if you attempt to do it all and miss your mark."
aries,2016-12-21,"The solemn energy of the Winter Solstice chills the air as the Sun spends more time under the earth today than any other time of year. The Sun's shift into dependable Capricorn illuminates your 10th House of Career, revealing the distance between who you are and who you want to be. Although you might be eager to begin reaching toward this ambitious new version of you, there's some inner work to do first. Go within and plunge into the depths of your subconscious so you can finally heal and become emotionally whole prior to resuming your forward march to the future."
taurus,2016-12-21,"This night is the longest of the year, but your solid and steadfast nature can weather the dark better than most. The Winter Solstice demarcates the Sun's entrance into calculating Capricorn, shining the light of awareness into your 9th House of Beliefs. However, it's essential to take some time to reestablish your place in the world now rather than adopt to a new way of thinking. The cosmos nudges you to reflect on your past mistakes so you know what to do differently in the future. If you don't stand for something, you'll fall for anything."
gemini,2016-12-21,"The year's steady progression changes direction at the Winter Solstice. The Sun's move into persevering Capricorn introduces light into the depth of your 8th House of Regeneration. Although this shadow work falls at one of the busiest times of the year, your soul calls you to ponder what parts of you need to be pruned so you can begin to grow anew. Self-analysis takes courage, but the rewards are potentially great if you're willing to embark on this inner quest. Ask the heavy questions and quietly wait for the answers to emerge."
cancer,2016-12-21,"Beyond the frenzied noise of the holiday season, there is a small stillness that invites you to listen. The Sun's shift into cautious Capricorn shines a spotlight on your 7th House of Relationships, enabling you to see a delicate issue from another person's perspective. Answer the call and take time to mull over what kind of energy you're attracting through other people. It's best not to make any hasty changes or impulsive decisions, but rather trust that insight will arrive when you need it most."
leo,2016-12-21,"You are inexplicably intrigued today by the very same issues you've been doing your best to avoid. The Sun's entrance into responsible Capricorn brightens your 6th House of Health, so ask yourself what you must do to support your body as the container for your spirit. Although the answers you receive may extend beyond your mundane routine, give yourself plenty of time to reach tangible conclusions and make a sustainable plan. The critical part of the equation is to compose the right questions and remain open to the lessons you learn from your exploration."
virgo,2016-12-21,"It might seem as if there isn't even time to take a breath, but it's crucial now to create moments of peace in order to contemplate the meaningful questions of life. The Sun slips into ambitious Capricorn, lighting a candle in your 5th House of Self-Expression and stirring your creative juices. Although you may grow obsessed with being fully authentic in all avenues of your life, it's not necessary to change every behavior today. Nevertheless, reassessing your priorities catalyzes a transformational process that will continue to unfold over the weeks to come."
libra,2016-12-21,"All your life experiences thus far combine to make up an essential part of your inner world. The Sun's entry into solid Capricorn today sheds light on your 4th House of Foundations, asking you to reevaluate the stability of the ground you stand on. Unfortunately, you might encounter fear as you realize that your emotional infrastructure isn't as supportive as you wish. But it's pointless to worry about what you would do if your house of cards collapses. Instead of stressing over a worst-case scenario, visualize the best possible outcome. Changing your mind changes your future."
scorpio,2016-12-21,"The time has come when the longest night of the year compels you to go inside and stare into the deep reflecting pool that is your mind. The Sun's move into strategic Capricorn lights up your 3rd House of Communication, asking you to explore how you process thoughts and ideas with a critical eye. What you learn during this mental examination may surprise you, so be gentle with your self-judgment now. There is deep healing in the works, so take it slow and don't expect to find an easy fix overnight."
sagittarius,2016-12-21,"Amidst all the holiday hoopla, you might be more pensive today -- questioning what truly matters. Instead of searching for an answer, you are curious as to how you assign value to physical things and metaphysical concepts. The Sun marches into conservative Capricorn and your 2nd House of Possessions, setting a more somber tone to your thoughts. Fortunately, you're likely to uncover some profound truths hidden in the corners of your awareness, so hold off on initiating anything until you get a chance to sink deeper into your discovery process."
capricorn,2016-12-21,"The busiest time of the year also happens to be the most internally active for you Mountain Goats. The Sun's shift into your sign is like the beginning of your personal new year. While this is traditionally a period of celebration for many, you sense that a deeper transformation is accompanying the outer noise now. You might have to pull some strings to change your plans to accommodate your introspective frame of mind. Nevertheless, the cosmos calls for quiet reflection before launching in a new direction."
aquarius,2016-12-21,"Although the light of winter is dim in the northern latitudes, it still has the power to slowly melt through the walls of fear. The Sun enters solemn Capricorn today, illuminating the darkness of your 12th House of Secrets. It's time to get serious about taking inventory of the myriad of thoughts within the privacy of your mind. If you are keeping old objects that you no longer value in your mental vault, now would be an appropriate time to make peace with them and let them go. Freedom comes from releasing your attachment to things you no longer need."
pisces,2016-12-21,"The recent shift in energy encourages you to run a full self-evaluation review, both inside and out. The mighty Sun's rays shine in your 11th House of Hope, highlighting your aspirations and dreams for the weeks ahead. Who you are and where you're going are intricately entangled, so take time before you start your journey to separate the threads that are weaving your current visions. Reflecting on the tapestry of your life reaps a rich and rewarding future."
aries,2016-12-22,"The social dynamics could rapidly fluctuate today, leaving you wondering exactly where you stand. Fortunately, you are capable of maintaining your composure if you just hold your tongue and count to ten when you encounter any unexpected drama. You can always tactfully remove yourself from the situation if a squabble suddenly erupts. Thanks to a creative Mars-Saturn connection, respectfully asserting yourself with candor and consideration turns enemies into allies."
taurus,2016-12-22,"There's plenty of work to get done today, and the state of affairs could continue to change from moment to moment. An airy Libra Moon allows you to work smarter instead of harder by making the most of favorable aspects from generous Jupiter and strategic Saturn. Although things may not go according to plan, you will find help where you need it -- and maybe when you least expect it. Lead with a positive attitude and see who follows."
gemini,2016-12-22,"You are everyone's favorite friend to be around now because it's impossible to listen to your charming banter without smiling. You may be as stressed as the next person, but it lifts your spirits when you make people laugh. Although it's not all smooth sailing today, you can dexterously navigate the waves with some cosmic assistance from a stabilizing Mars-Saturn connection. A Yiddish proverb states, ""What soap is to the body, laughter is to the soul."""
cancer,2016-12-22,"It's a good idea to stick to a strict schedule now to keep the flurry of activities from overtaking your agenda. Although things may seem hectic or unstable today, the limber Libra Moon will help you bend in the wind rather than snap. Assistance is likely to appear in the form of a friend with a fresh solution for a sticky situation. Show your appreciation by offering to lend a hand when they need it next. A shared burden is lighter to carry and easier to unload."
leo,2016-12-22,"A little bit of diplomacy makes all the difference today. Keep the lines of communication open as others are likely to get caught up in the whirlwind of pre-holiday jitters. You can't really blame anyone for trying to pull it together any way they can. It may be somewhat of a bumpy ride at times, but fortunately, an imaginative connection between energetic Mars and studious Saturn blesses you with a creative edge to help others throughout the day. Assuming authority at the appropriate moment provides a path to peace and harmony."
virgo,2016-12-22,"Life may seem like a moving sidewalk today as you sweep along at a brisk pace but feel like you're only just maintaining your balance. The graceful Libra Moon creates precarious aspects to several planets, but her objective vantage point enables you to keep a clear head even amidst the holiday noise and chaotic cheer. Attitude is the difference between an ordeal and an adventure."
libra,2016-12-22,"You may not believe that you possess surfing skills, but the way you're riding the waves today would convince anyone of your expertise. The evocative Moon is visiting your diplomatic sign and although she makes a variety of connections, both disruptive and constructive, the positive ones tip the balance in your court. As you navigate the ever-changing landscape, remember that choosing kindness will always work to your advantage."
scorpio,2016-12-22,"Keep it light and friendly today -- try not to inflate one little upset into a major crisis. Intensity is the name of your game and you're never afraid to go there, but do yourself a favor and skate over the conflicts now. Chances are they will blow over as quickly as they blew in. A creative connection between Mars and Saturn offers you a unique point of view that inspires you to express yourself in a dramatic manner that entertains rather than offends."
sagittarius,2016-12-22,"People might be high-strung today as the demands of the busy season begin to take their toll. However, there is also a sense of merriment in the air and the sound of laughter rings out -- which is exactly how you like it. Although there is a possibility for some turbulence on this flight, the lithe Libra Moon will help you maintain a level head amid the commotion and fly through the day like a seasoned pilot. Spreading cheer is one of the things you Archers do best."
capricorn,2016-12-22,"Your ability to stay calm even in the direst situations is an asset today as friends and family flock to you for sound advice and sensible input. The social Libra Moon joins expansive Jupiter in your 10th House of Public Speaking, drawing people to your grounding guidance. Although it may seem like things are going south at several points, you can maintain your clarity and resolve tough circumstances, thanks to stable Saturn's magical connection with assertive Mars. A river cuts through a rock not by its strength, but by its persistence."
aquarius,2016-12-22,"Unexpected feedback flies in from several different directions today, creating a chaotic environment where it's difficult to relax. Fortunately, the tactful Libra Moon is here to help you process this new information easily and keep interactions congenial and conversational. Call up a friend and share a few stories about the day's crazy antics and funny adventures. In times of stress, laughter truly is the best medicine."
pisces,2016-12-22,"The holidays are fast approaching and with so many tasks left to finish, it's easy to forget that the real purpose of a holiday is to spend time with the ones you love. The best thing to do now is gracefully glide around any unforeseen mishaps as they arise. Luckily, the elegant Libra Moon keeps you just far enough away from the drama tornadoes to prevent you from being sucked in. Feeling the strong winds just at the edge of your consciousness empowers you to create positive change."
aries,2016-12-23,"With one foot in a world of righteous rules and one foot leading you to a radical new concept of self, there is a delicate balance between what you used to think and who you are becoming. The nearly inaudible rumble of change in the atmosphere may drive you to reflect on issues of power and control lurking beneath the surface. There's no need to isolate yourself; today's events are lively and enjoyable when spent with the people closest to you. However, it's helpful to remember the words of Maya Angelou who wrote, ""If you're always trying to be normal, you will never know how amazing you can be."""
taurus,2016-12-23,"Often change is good for stirring up the energy, but it still can be uncomfortable while it is occurring. The deep cosmic shift you sense drives you to seek emotional intimacy while the Moon travels through your 7th House of Partners, activating intense interactions and heart-tugging connections. Despite the deep undercurrent today, the holiday cheer is like a bright light in the dimness of winter. Holding a space for your old ways of thinking while accepting brilliant new realizations paves the way for relationship growth in the days ahead."
gemini,2016-12-23,"Happily, the tension between a new group of friends and your long-established social network is temporarily alleviated. Your optimism seems to twinkle through the rush of the day at just the right times. However, the Moon moves into melancholy Scorpio and your 6th House of Daily Routine, so don't ignore any sniffles or headaches today. Put your body first even though there are many more exciting attractions calling out for your attention. Gandhi said, ""It is health that is real wealth and not pieces of gold and silver."""
cancer,2016-12-23,"Emotions run high as you do your best to adapt to changing demands in a blink of an eye. The Moon slips into fellow water sign Scorpio today, heightening the intensity with which you express your feelings. Fortunately, the tenuous balance between your previous priorities and your current goals triggers unlikely inspiration and the determination to take your ideas to the next level. Old ways won't open new doors. Overcome your resistance to change if you want real transformation to take root."
leo,2016-12-23,"You possess the surprising ability to incorporate tried-and-true methods of expressing yourself with a blast of unconventional thinking today. Your tendency to talk big may work in your favor as you frame your message with a creative twist. However, the Moon swims into secretive Scorpio and your 4th House of Home and Hearth, drawing your energies back to the safety of your own space. Once you call it quits for the day, you're likely to want nothing more than to sit in silence and travel to your happy place. Recharging your batteries is essential, and quieting your mind is one of the best paths to rejuvenation."
virgo,2016-12-23,"There are times to tear down your old psychological foundations and times to build something new, but today there is space for both. You are passionate about an innovative approach to saving or earning money while a fortunate Sun-Jupiter connection inspires you to grow your wealth. However, you may be single-minded now, so make sure you don't come across as overly fanatical in your communications with others. As Dorothy Sarnoff advises, ""Make sure you finish speaking before your audience finishes listening."""
libra,2016-12-23,"Ironically, your possessions may begin to possess you today when the obsessive Scorpio Moon casts her light into your 2nd House of Material Things. It could be easier to get what you want now, but you still must choose your words and actions with integrity. The cosmos gives the gift of balance between your typical ways of communicating and a fresh new slant on how you interact with others. Use this moment of grace as a catalyst for personal growth while you temporarily can juggle both the old and the new."
scorpio,2016-12-23,"A creative insight may come seemingly out of nowhere today, prompting you to see yourself in a whole new fashion. As you stop to reconsider where you stand, you're able to acknowledge your old value systems while seeking an innovative new method of working for what you want. In the meantime, the Moon enters your introspective sign, inspiring you to keep your burgeoning insights close to the chest as they grow and mature. Author Aldous Huxley wrote, ""There is only one corner of the universe you can be certain of improving, and that's your own self."""
sagittarius,2016-12-23,"Although you move through the day with your characteristic exuberance, on the inside you may be longing to retreat into the sanctuary of your own mind. The Moon's shift into brooding Scorpio activates your 12th House of Secrets, which could provoke dark thoughts and feelings. Thankfully, you can count on your friends to lift you up and out of your own shadows with the cosmic assistance of a cheery Sun-Jupiter connection. The most memorable people in life are those who love you when you have trouble loving yourself."
capricorn,2016-12-23,"You may feel possessive of your friends today, and even a little jealous if they are busy with plans that don't include you. However, people are just trying to uphold their social obligations now and it's unwise to take their preoccupation personally. When you stop to think about it, you recognize the transitory nature of the world at large and are prepared to overhaul your psyche to match the external changes. Nevertheless, there's no need to sink too far into your depths when you could be enjoying the precious time you have with the ones you love."
aquarius,2016-12-23,"There is a subtle but persistent hum in the background that's a harbinger of imminent social change. However, more immediate circumstances draw your attention to managing personal issues in the here and now. The Moon enters ruthless Scorpio and your 10th House of Status, magnifying your desire to be on top. Although your ambitions drive you to reach great heights, there are still jovial moments which break through the intensity. Take the opportunities to lighten the mood as they come but don't let down your guard. Author Paulo Coelho writes, ""Love everybody, but never sell your sword."""
pisces,2016-12-23,"Although you are busy attending social events and spreading holiday cheer, there's a sneaking suspicion in the back of your mind that something isn't quite right. The Moon's shift into leery Scorpio might raise fears of deception or betrayal. In fact, paranoia could hijack your fun festivities if you give it your permission. Luckily, a trusted friend holds the key to helping you view things in a totally different manner. Author Dan Brown writes, ""Sometimes a change of perspective is all it takes to see the light."""
aries,2016-12-24,"You secretly worry that a crowd of loud relatives or friends might be too much noise for you today, but you won't let that stop the festivities from going on around you. You may need to hide your preferences during the holiday season, but thankfully, you can stick to your principles without compromising your individuality. In fact, you seem to have a strange stroke of luck when an offhand comment is recognized as a brilliant idea. Stand up and accept the applause; the acknowledgement from your peers warms your heart and inspires you to greater heights."
taurus,2016-12-24,"You want to hold tight the people who are dearest to you and enjoy the comfort of their presence today. The emotional atmosphere may be complex, but happily, family and friends are able to put aside differences and successfully avoid contentious conversations. Congenial discussions grow even more exciting throughout the day, creating opportunities for a meeting of the minds, even when there is a wide diversity of opinions. Magically, the holiday spirit enables you to see things from a bigger perspective. Building a bridge is the only way to reach the other side."
gemini,2016-12-24,"You may feel slightly resentful about committing to someone else's schedule when you wish you could do things your way. Despite a moody undercurrent today, your trademark wit is in high gear and you can turn a sticky situation into a thought-provoking conversation before it escalates into an argument. A little bit of diplomacy goes a long way toward making everyone feel welcome, no matter their beliefs or customs. Practicing the spiritual message of inclusivity is the key to making happy memories."
cancer,2016-12-24,"You are in touch with your need to express just how deeply you care for all your loved ones and friends today. Nevertheless, complicated emotional eddies push and pull you through strange waters. Fortunately, no harm is done as a cosmic moratorium is in place between traditional Saturn and revolutionary Uranus. Enjoy connecting with the special people in your life while focusing on the most positive aspects of each interaction. As Louise Hay writes, ""Every thought we think is creating our future."""
leo,2016-12-24,"Your colorful personality is toned down considerably today as feelings that might usually be fleeting stick to you like glue. It may seem like this cosmic restraint will never end; luckily, the provocative Scorpio Moon makes a multitude of favorable contacts, preventing your emotions from stagnating for too long. You may be lifted from your introspection at some point when a spirited conversation piques your interest. Thankfully, you can passionately express your opinion while still demonstrating enough respect so you don't rock the boat or offend anyone."
virgo,2016-12-24,"It's easier than ever to get hung up on small details and overreact to slips of the tongue or other minor communication mishaps. Do whatever you can to release your attachment to the words said today, as they probably aren't as loaded as they sound. You may be quietly shocked if discourse with relatives is friendly, and free from skepticism or righteousness. You could even surprise yourself with a fresh new take on a topic that seems almost divinely inspired. Counting your blessings includes being thankful that the people you love can openly share their thoughts and respectfully listen to yours."
libra,2016-12-24,"The notion of family values is a common theme around this time of year as you reassess those things you cherish the most. You may notice that you are a tad overcontrolling when it comes to your resources and your relationship with finances might be slightly convoluted today. Try to let go of your fear and enjoy the holiday spirit without attaching monetary worth to the experience. Happily, the usual battle for attention at the dinner table is suspended by a temporary armistice between karmic Saturn and eclectic Uranus, allowing you to embrace a different approach to the holidays while still honoring important traditions."
scorpio,2016-12-24,"You are more enigmatic than ever today as the moody Moon stalks through your mysterious sign. However, you are not the only mystery unfolding now that sexy Mars forms a fated connection with cerebral Mercury. This interplay may turn dinner conversation into something that's completely out of the ordinary, but in a welcome manner rather than a disruptive one. Paradoxically, you can revel in the revolutionary nature of the moment without forcing your radical ideas on anyone else."
sagittarius,2016-12-24,"You might want to momentarily pull the covers back up over your head today because you're missing your regular dose of sunshine and optimism. Luckily, the pace quickly picks up once you are on the move and you find yourself increasingly excited to participate in the festivities. There seems to be a temporary ceasefire between your desire to shake things up and your wish to stabilize interpersonal interactions. Your current pragmatism helps you engage in a stimulating conversation without becoming adversarial or unkind. Poet Rumi wrote, ""Life is a balance of holding on and letting go."""
capricorn,2016-12-24,"There's a strange vibe that follows you around today, prompting you to remain slightly withdrawn and introspective. You don't want to say anything because everyone else seems to be a little more reactionary and emotionally invested in the day's events than you are for some reason. Luckily, the intuitive Scorpio Moon's favorable aspects assist you in maneuvering through the turbulent landscape. In spite of the moody atmosphere, communication eases tensions while harmonious energy flows between conventional Saturn and radical Uranus. Expecting the unexpected soothes nerves now rather than putting anyone on edge."
aquarius,2016-12-24,"You made up your mind and you plan on sticking to it now, with no thought of backing down. Although a headstrong approach often works when you're trying to accomplish career goals, a special event with family or friends presents a different kind of challenge. Fortunately, any lingering holiday tension is mitigated by a cosmic calm and discussions are unlikely to stray far into tempestuous territory. In fact, you may find that the topics being bounced around over dinner are far more eccentric and interesting than in years past."
pisces,2016-12-24,"Regardless of religious beliefs, the very act of gathering with loved ones with purpose and intention can be a spiritual endeavor. You may feel things very deeply today, and the regenerative Scorpio Moon's presence in your 9th House of Higher Truth inspires you to explore the larger meaning of the season.

You will thank yourself tomorrow if you exercise a modicum of self-restraint now."
taurus,2016-12-25,"If ever there was a time to eat, drink and be merry, it's today. Charming Venus is your lovely cosmic assistant, helping you roll out the red carpet for family and friends. Your warm hospitality allows others to completely relax and enjoy themselves. You are likely to execute your plans without a hitch, and there's a distinct possibility that people will talk about your wonderful party for a long time to come.

You seem to quickly check one thing after another off your to-do list, while still engaging in plenty of merriment along the way. Everyone appears to be getting along famously, keeping conversations cheerful and light. Childhood stories are recounted with special fondness.

You might have over-stressed about the little things, but your excessive planning results in an effortless launch today, and everyone pitches in to facilitate maximum merriment. Your confidence surges as you realize everything is going according to plan. Although you may deceive yourself into believing you can add a few extra items to your agenda, stick to what you have on your already full plate. Quit while you're ahead and leave them wanting more."

Auspicious Jupiter creates a beautiful trine to romantic Venus in your 5th House of Pleasure, setting the tone for making marvelous memories. There's nothing to stop you from having the time of your life as you make all the right connections and somehow squeeze in every bit of frivolity humanly possible.

You may have prepared to defend yourself against the awkward conversations that often occur at holiday gatherings, but it seems that everyone is pretty much on the same page now. The priority for the moment is creating an inclusive atmosphere where everyone is comfortable and content. All is right in your world when the cosmos is smiling at you, and you are surrounded by those you love."
sagittarius,2016-12-25,"Kind remarks are flowing every which way, setting the stage for a day that's suitable for merrymaking and mending fences. It sounds impossible, but things are only going to get better as vivacious Venus forms favorable contacts with several other planets. Meanwhile, the Moon parties her way into your sign, and you're likely to catch a second wind after the festivities begin to wind down. Round up some friends and head to a local dive bar or convene at someone's home; just don't get so carried away that you can't find your way back home."
capricorn,2016-12-25,"You may be pleasantly surprised when you realize how amazing your day is turning out. Everything just falls into place; it's as if you have been blessed with a guardian angel who is looking out for your happiness. You are prepared for nearly any contingency today, but it appears as if everything is going swimmingly.

aries,2016-12-26,"Although you're already fired-up about your next amazing adventure, positive thinking can only take you so far today. For better or for worse, you are often known for charging ahead prematurely. Unfortunately, temporary satisfaction isn't worth future regret. Rather than making impulsive decisions that will require correcting your course as you go, contemplate your alternatives now without initiating direct action. There's no need to rush fate; let your destiny unfold organically for the most gratifying results."
taurus,2016-12-26,"You might have overindulged yesterday, which is understandable considering how much fun you had. Although you wish you could extend the high spirits of the holidays, all good things must come to an end. There's nothing wrong with continuing to enjoy the positive vibes as long as you take time to recharge your energy and regroup your thoughts. Instead of running on empty, stop to refuel and catch your breath. New horizons are beckoning, but you need to remember that life's a marathon and not a sprint."
gemini,2016-12-26,"Levity still lingers in the air and although you're probably exhausted, you don't want the good times to end.

An ingenious new slant on your goals renews your faith in the universe. However, your solid assumptions may be more illusory now than you realize. Although you want to get started on your plans right away, it's best to take time to rest before you try to incorporate a fresh set of ideals. Practicing patience gives the big pieces of reality time to fall into place."
leo,2016-12-26,"You are still basking in the afterglow of yesterday's festivities as you look to the future with renewed enthusiasm. You're excited to share your ambitious ideas with everyone, but be careful not to talk so dramatically that it's impossible to live up to your own expectations. The good news is you feel ready to go; the bad news is your eagerness can get the best of you. Another round of creative exploration is wise before taking action. Timing is everything."
virgo,2016-12-26,"Recent interactions with friends or family reactivate old dreams which are now taking new flight. Shocking revelations inspire you to swing into action. However, others may not be ready to  give your unorthodox plans the green light. People are quick to put their faith in your abilities, but they need tangible evidence before they will be comfortable supporting your venture. Do your research prior to starting a new quest. Most Virgos would agree with Author Alan Lakein when he said, ""Failing to plan is planning to fail."""
libra,2016-12-26,"You're likely to wake up smiling just thinking about recent events. Inspiring conversations replay in your mind, galvanizing you to put your ideas into motion. However, don't take on too much work right away. Although you think you can move forward immediately, you may encounter stop signs at every corner. Don't waste energy attempting to outsmart the cosmos. Spend more time talking about your creative vision with a trusted friend before you launch into the future."
scorpio,2016-12-26,"Although you might be recovering from a little too much holiday merriment today, you could discover that the recesses of your mind contain unexamined treasures. You feel like you're on the brink of something huge and the adventurous Sagittarius Moon impels you to fully invest yourself into this new enterprise. Nevertheless, it's best to keep your ideas incubating for a while longer before pushing them out of the nest. William Blake wrote, ""No bird soars too high if he soars with his own wings."""
sagittarius,2016-12-26,"Your imagination is flowing with creative ideas that you are longing to express. The Moon in your inspirational sign encourages you to reach for the stars, but it's wise to make sure you are standing on solid ground first.

Nevertheless, you may find that it's more challenging than you thought to wrap your head around what needs to happen next. Prior to making a definitive move, take extra time to explore your dreams and see where they lead. As Author Beth Mende Conny writes, ""If the future seems overwhelming, remember that it comes one moment at a time."""
aquarius,2016-12-26,"Visions of distant lands inspire you to set off on a new expedition as soon as you can pull on your coat. Although the travel bug may bite you, make sure you don't overextend your resources. You might not be as ready for a new adventure as you think; recent celebrations extracted a toll on your body, whether you realize it yet or not. Consider taking a mental journey to satisfy your craving instead, especially if a tight budget prevents you from putting your money where your mouth is. As the Moody Blues sang, ""Speeding through the universe, thinking is the best way to travel."""

gemini,2016-12-27,"Your ideas seem better and better the more you think about them, and you're anxious to prove their brilliance in the real world. Unfortunately, even the greatest inspiration alone does not make an idea hold water. Be prepared to encounter several speed bumps as you cruise through your day. But don't slam on the brakes at the last minute to avoid the inevitable. Instead, use the rough spots in reality to clarify your thought process that is currently a bit muddled by Mercury's disorienting retrograde. Author Michael Gelb wrote, ""Confusion is the welcome mat at the door of creativity."""
cancer,2016-12-27,"You may feel so energetic today that you consider starting your new year resolutions early. The grandiose Sagittarius Moon is likely to widen your mind's eye until it's bigger than your stomach. Unfortunately, you can't assimilate everything you see because of your human limitations. Sobering Saturn steps into the picture to deal you a cold dose of reality and remind you that planning is half the battle. As Ani DiFranco sings, ""Some of life's best lessons are learned at the worst times."" Nevertheless, advanced preparation prevents avoidable problems."
leo,2016-12-27,"You're having fun with your daydreams as they become more and more elaborate in your mind. Although your self-confidence grows along with your inflated plans, a strict evaluation from serious Saturn can reveal trouble in the details.

The road to success is paved with humility."
virgo,2016-12-27,"You're all set to get busy with an exciting new project, but you quickly discover that your intricate plans are impractical. Your ruling planet Mercury often shows up to help you discern which ideas are critical to your success. However, the Trickster's current retrograde journey could lead you to waste time on insignificant minutiae. Rather than launching new ventures, use this time to reassess and rethink your options. Don't trust everything you see today; even salt looks like sugar."
libra,2016-12-27,"You believe in yourself more than ever and you can't wait to share your excitement with your friends. But just as the words leave your mouth you realize how unbelievable your plan might sound. Although austere Saturn steps in like a cosmic astringent to tone down your enthusiasm, you may be glad the detour happened once you get further down the road. Facing a temporary setback seems like a bummer but it's more fortuitous now to be stopped in your tracks than to leap before you look."
scorpio,2016-12-27,"You are unwilling to negotiate once you set your mind to something. Your passion is fired up today and you're inspired to do the hard work necessary to turn your brilliant idea into reality. Unfortunately, you may run into financial issues that halt your progress. But this is less of a showstopper than a cosmic prompt for further preparation. Success isn't about sticking to an ideal plan; it's about making the best use of available resources. President Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""Delay is preferable to error."""
sagittarius,2016-12-27,"You are completely convinced that greener pastures are around the next bend. However, the electrically charged atmosphere takes an earthbound shift when the ostentatious Sagittarius Moon is restrained by weighty Saturn.

Fine-tuning your plan now improves the vehicle which will carry you to your dreams."
capricorn,2016-12-27,"There's a fine line between initiating action and taking a foolish risk, but you're willing to gamble today. Unexpressed ambitions are ready to come out for the world to see. However, you may realize there are holes in your logic before you can even share your ideas with an audience. Mercury's current backtracking through your sign impedes your progress, but the extra time allows you to rethink your plans before you make mistakes you can't undo."
aquarius,2016-12-27,"The lightning bolt of inspiration strikes today, charging you with the energy to make a dream come true. However, your gleaming aspirations must pass stern Saturn's rigorous test to make it in the real world.

cancer,2016-12-28,"Your thoughts grow heavy as you replay the past year in your mind. Relationships are bound to be on the brain while there are so many planets occupying your 7th House of Others.

Whether you plan to change residence, do some remodeling or just improve family dynamics, you're anxious to get the show on the road.

You're ready to get a firmer grip on your schedule so you don't lose more time due to idle distractions or poor planning. Ironically, Mercury's retrograde could be scrambling your thoughts and messing with the very strategy you created in order to prevent delays. Take it easy today and stay in the tactical phase. Impatience won't do you any good, but reassessing your goals and polishing your skills will."

Luckily, this isn't the case since unconventional Uranus begins its march forward once again, giving you access to a treasure trove of inspiration.

The dutiful Capricorn New Moon calls attention to your 6th House of Well-Being, urging you to implement healthier and more responsible habits.

virgo,2016-12-29,"Sometimes nothing is more gratifying than putting in hard work and seeing the fruits of your labor. Not everyone understands how you can enjoy combing through the details and setting everything just right, but you truly have a gift for making chores seem like a game. The pragmatic Capricorn New Moon stabilizes your 5th House of Play, prescribing a fun new project that you can be involved with for the long haul.

scorpio,2016-12-29,"Language is more powerful than any tool, whether you're building a structure or tearing one down. The stern Capricorn New Moon stabilizes your 3rd House of Communication, drawing attention to your words and how you use them.

On one hand, you're ready to dedicate as much as possible to an organization or movement but on the other hand, you're wondering if you possess the stamina to maintain the efforts for any sustained period.

You could slip into a bit of a funk, wondering if joining in the party mood tonight will do more harm than good to your emotional state of mind.

No one can blame you for following your heart."

But even if there is money burning a hole in your pocket, you're still not sure if you want to make such a big deal out of the evening just to be trapped in a wild crowd of rowdy people.
