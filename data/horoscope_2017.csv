aries,2017-01-01,"You are about to embark on a great spiritual quest that will carry you through the year ahead. But your energy is mushy as self-directed Mars wobbles into ethereal Neptune in your 12th House of Destiny. Rather than assuming a know-it-all attitude, you can derive great benefit by revealing your vulnerability. Forcefully plowing ahead isn't your best strategy now; instead, give yourself permission to wander in your imagination or waste time in the pursuit of an unattainable dream. Nourishing your soul restores your spirit. Arthur C. Clarke wrote, ""The limits of the possible can only be defined by going beyond them into the impossible."""
taurus,2017-01-01,"It's only natural to dream about the future on this first day of the New Year. Happily, the progressive Aquarius Moon invites you to look ahead rather than ponder the past. Your desire for deep and meaningful friendships intensifies while ardent Mars energizes idealistic Neptune in your 11th House of Social Networks. However, you may become less certain about your destination but more insistent about getting there. Remember, you might be missing an important piece of the puzzle; your imagination can inspire you to great heights or it can lead you down the proverbial rabbit hole."
gemini,2017-01-01,"You're driven to achieve success in the outer world as you look forward to an as-of-yet unformed year. But it's challenging to distinguish between fact and fancy when insistent Mars joins imaginative Neptune in your 10th House of Career. Unfortunately, your enthusiasm waxes and wanes as diffusive Neptune dissipates your excitement as quickly as it comes. Hold steady and let the discouragement pass without taking any setbacks as personal defeats. Don't let today's disappointments cast a shadow on tomorrow's dreams."
cancer,2017-01-01,"You're happy to set aside this first day of the New Year for a fantastical escape of imagination and adventure. A dreamy Mars-Neptune hookup in your 9th House of Big Ideas is a cosmic reminder that the magic is within you. Nevertheless, an inspired relative or a free-spirited friend shows you that there's no need to struggle to make your dreams come true. Exploring your fantasies can be a powerful vehicle to free you from your fears, revealing ways to bypass any obstacles. Sometimes play is serious business if you use it to fuel your confidence."
leo,2017-01-01,"Your tenderness is both a blessing and a curse. Your interactions with others could be quite inspiring when can-do Mars joins compassionate Neptune in your 8th House of Deep Sharing. Although you may be duly impressed with someone's emotional or financial riches, what you're seeing and hearing might not reflect reality. Misplaced faith or outright fraud can take more from you than you wish to give, so don't make any serious long-term commitments today. Fantasy Island is a lovely spot for a quick getaway, but you can't live there forever."
virgo,2017-01-01,"Someone's sweet but misleading behavior may lure you down a garden path today. However, you can easily misjudge the intentions of others by assuming you understand them because you share an emotional connection. Nevertheless, a shape-shifting Mars-Neptune conjunction falls in your 7th House of Relationships, making it so difficult to tell what's real that you could exhaust yourself trying. Don't let your idealism become a trap that entices you to believe the impossible. Ask for help from a trusty ally if a burden is too great rather than stumbling ahead without the support you need."
libra,2017-01-01,"Surprisingly, having fun today may be quite challenging if you see chores that need to be done around the house. However, being productive is a bit like nailing jelly to a tree when macho Mars pushes elusive Neptune into starting a project. Unfortunately, positive feedback might not be forthcoming and evaluating your progress objectively could be a daunting task. The silver lining in this dark cloud is that once you know the truth, you can do something to change the situation. Adopting a more enlightened approach to a current setback allows you to overcome it in the days ahead."
scorpio,2017-01-01,"Your imagination enables you to see all kinds of potential where none exists today. However, there's no need to struggle for control while enterprising Mars connects with nebulous Neptune. Thankfully, taking time off to connect with your friends or family is a perfect use of this magical planetary alignment that makes adversarial relationships nearly impossible to sustain. Relax your expectations; the spirit in which you act is more important than the results you achieve."
sagittarius,2017-01-01,"Although you like the idea of participating in a holiday celebration, you might feel as if you're just spinning your wheels today without doing anything of significance. Nevertheless, you want others to see you striving for something more in life, but pursuing unrealistic goals or playing out the role of a martyr can be exhausting. Luckily, the wizardly Mars-Neptune conjunction casts an enchanting spell, empowering you to make a little magic at home by showing tenderness to those you love."
capricorn,2017-01-01,"Ironically, you're good to go today as long as you don't attempt to accomplish something practical. Your stamina is running low and you might feel discouraged as courageous Mars bumps into confusing Neptune in your 3rd House of Communication. Although this planetary dance bodes well for artistic endeavors or flights of fancy, it's frustrating if you can't transform your high intentions into the physical plane. When in doubt, manifest positivity energy until your strength returns."
aquarius,2017-01-01,"Relying on blind faith can lead you astray unless your core beliefs are so strong that they become the primary motivational force in your life. Avoid forcing a situation or committing to a group activity that's likely to deplete your energy today. Acts of creativity and charity can produce lasting inspirational value. Invest in doing whatever touches your heart and you'll find continued momentum to carry your ideas across the threshold. Robert G. Ingersoll said, ""We rise by lifting others."""
pisces,2017-01-01,"Taking charge of your life by being more physically active makes good sense now. Although you're eager to act, your intentions are muddled, so don't push yourself too hard or too fast. Luckily, your imagination and compassion can melt obstacles in your path when the supernatural Mars-Neptune conjunction sizzles in your 1st House of Self. Although reality may slip through the cracks, your compelling stories convince others to buy into your dreams. Avoid wasting everyone's time and energy by making sure your visions are rooted in something solid and serious right from the start."
aries,2017-01-02,"No matter how many responsibilities are piling up on your plate today, you're not finished with your vacation yet. You can think of a hundred ways to avoid work or school while a cluster of planets in your 12th House of Escapism captivates your imagination and tempts you to run away from the real world. Nevertheless, the pressure is relentless and you can't hide from your obligations forever. Luckily, nothing prevents you from continuing to dream as long as you keep up appearances. Jonathon Swift wrote, ""Vision is the art of seeing what is invisible to others."""
taurus,2017-01-02,"You're normally a champion when it comes to finishing what you start because your methodical progress is a proven winner. However, staying on track is more challenging now because your imagination can easily send you on a wild goose chase. It's no easy task to remain focused on your job while you're busy worrying about the distant future. Nevertheless, you can increase your efficiency by gently bringing your thoughts back to the present moment each time you catch your mind wandering. Concentrating on your work today helps you forget everything else."
gemini,2017-01-02,"Your high hopes for professional recognition could lead to major discouragement if your goals are not grounded in a strong foundation. A gathering of dreamy Pisces planets in your 10th House of Public Status prompts you to reevaluate your role at work. Unfortunately, there might be  so many scenarios playing out in your mind that you grow unsure of your intentions. You don't have time to waste floundering about now, so make a decision and stick to it. Remember the proverb, ""If you chase two rabbits, you will not catch either one."""
cancer,2017-01-02,"You're like Don Quixote who is lost in fantasy, imagining that he's on a knightly adventure. Mundane events take on mythic proportions, making it nearly impossible to separate your dreams from reality. Fortunately, you can grow into your visions over time, but only if you are unwavering in your search for the facts. Don't deviate from what you know to be true. And if you doubt your objectivity, rely on the perceptions of those you trust until your clarity returns. Computer scientist Linus Torvalds said, ""That which works, works."""
leo,2017-01-02,"You're sometimes overly concerned with appearances, yet you also understand there is a magical relationship between a book and its cover. Several planets are now conspiring in your 8th House of Deep Sharing, enticing you to examine the hidden core of your assumptions. You're not interested in putting on a show for the sake of applause today. You crave to establish a solid connection with your strongest passions and might wonder if your partner feels the same intensity. Henri Nouwen wrote, ""If fear is the great enemy of intimacy, then love is its true friend."""
virgo,2017-01-02,"You are wandering in the Cosmic Hall of Mirrors today and everything you see on the outside is but another reflection of you. Unfortunately, every mirror has a slightly different warp and therefore distorts you in a unique manner. Don't fall into the trap of believing what you perceive. Once you understand that everything in your environment is strangely already inside your head, you can boldly create a new relationship with the world around you. The ancient Emerald Tablet reveals, ""As above, so below. As within, so without."""
libra,2017-01-02,"You're ready to take care of business today but you might not be able to get back into your old groove so easily. It's nearly impossible to set a schedule and stick to it while several planets float around surreal Neptune in your 6th House of Logistics. You need plenty of wiggle room now, and the wider your current perspective, the better it will be in the long run. Avoid closing down your analytical process prematurely because there's not as much of an urgency as you may think. Slow down and deal with the details before you miss something important in your haste."
scorpio,2017-01-02,"Although you long to be seen and appreciated today, you want to control which aspects of your life are expressed and which are kept secret. You understand Shakespeare's famous line, ""All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players."" Nevertheless, there are many possible ways to act your part and you don't know which one makes the most sense. You can easily be swallowed up by any character you choose now, so consider your options before picking one. Maturity starts when drama ends."
sagittarius,2017-01-02,"Your life is not always as much fun as everyone expects it to be from the outside view. Oddly enough, instead of trying to extend the holiday festivities, you're actually eager to pull back into your shell for a while to reconnect with your roots. Although it would be less complicated to just capitulate to someone else's demands, it may be necessary to politely blow off a social event if you need some quiet time. Paulo Coelho wrote, ""When you say yes to others, make sure you are not saying no to yourself."""
capricorn,2017-01-02,"Returning to the daily grind usually means adhering to a tight schedule for you goal-orientated Goats. Nevertheless, you might not be able to wrap your head around everything that must be done today. It seems as if you can't even make a simple phone call without jeopardizing the plans for the rest of your day. Paradoxically, the most radical approach is the most stable one. As Queen sang, ""Tear it up, Stir it up, Make it up -- as you go along."""
aquarius,2017-01-02,"You may be worried that the window of opportunity is closing too soon, but your sense of immediacy is probably based on a false assumption. Don't waste valuable time lost in regret. Instead, concentrate on the present to make sure your current actions are consistent with your beliefs. Self-esteem is a key ingredient to your success, so steer clear of any behavior that feeds your doubts now. Even if your future is clouded in a fog of uncertainty, keep your eyes locked on the horizon ahead. When clarity returns, you'll be ready to quickly shift back into high gear."
pisces,2017-01-02,"You are what you think. It's as if your body and mind are so hypersensitive that they magically conform to your strongest thoughts. Although this metaphysical practice is the basis for many traditions, your intuition is so powerful today that there's no discernible difference between your dreams and your future. This surrealism makes for sketchy reasoning but fosters uninhibited insight. As poet William Blake wrote, ""What is now proved was once only imagined."""
aries,2017-01-03,"A growing sense of compassion helps you let go of recent conflicts and enjoy the pleasurable experiences to be found within your imagination today. Your mental toughness dissipates once affectionate Venus glides into velvety Pisces and your 12th House of Dreams, redirecting your focus to the awe of spiritual mysteries. Tune into your tender spots instead of pushing your emotions aside for the sake of convenience. Believe it or not, vulnerability reveals your strength. Rumi wrote, ""As you live deeper in the heart, the mirror gets cleaner and cleaner."""
taurus,2017-01-03,"Your ideals can blur with the object of your fantasy today, clearing a path to a new romance or rekindling an old one. Thankfully, you pick up solid support and meaningful inspiration from friends and associates when your ruling planet, Venus, enters sympathetic Pisces and your 11th House of Teamwork. But this cosmic generosity is a two-way street; giving selflessly to your peers is a win-win proposition. Ryunosuke Satoro advises, ""Let your dreams outgrow the shoes of your expectations."""
gemini,2017-01-03,"Although you might hand over some of your power to those around you, their acknowledgement of your contributions means the world to you now. Fortunately, you may find the recognition you seek once resourceful Venus moves into your 10th House of Status. However, you still must remain singularly focused on your objectives or you'll quickly fall from grace. Don't turn down your ambition just because someone is uncomfortable with the volume. Legendary coach Vince Lombardi taught, ""Winners never quit and quitters never win."""
cancer,2017-01-03,"Nurturing relationships and keeping everyone happy can be exhausting, prompting you to plan your great escape. It's all too tempting to think about running away when alluring Venus slips into your 9th House of Faraway Places. Imagine foreign lands where you are free from the responsibilities and complications of your current life. Take these impressions as inspirations for future travel but don't lose touch with the realities of the present moment. You can dream all you want but you must live in the here and now if you want to maintain your integrity."
leo,2017-01-03,"You can advance your hopes with the help of a supportive partner today, but you must be willing to blend cool logic with impassioned desire. Sweet Venus shifts into dreamy Pisces and your 8th House of Deep Sharing, highlighting a romantic component to partnerships, which can be more about feelings than facts. A cosmic message of compassion smooths the hard edges of your judgment, raises trust and increases your chances for developing more meaningful relationships. Having a soft heart in a cruel world takes real courage."
virgo,2017-01-03,"Allow yourself the pleasure of sharing time with someone who has no ambition other than to enjoy your company. Instead of building a relationship on hopeful expectations, simply be open to learning from the dance of give and take. Fortunately, kind Venus reveals the power of love and respect as she glides into your 7th House of Partnerships today, attracting compassionate individuals who don't require you to be perfect. As Leonard Cohen sang, ""There is a crack in everything, that's how the light gets in."""
libra,2017-01-03,"Balancing your dreams with reality seems to be within reach today but you must work extra hard  to achieve the results you desire. Venus enters psychic Pisces and your 6th House of Self-Improvement, helping you figure out what you must do to reach your goals. However, you may be reminded of a hurtful situation from your past, increasing your vulnerability now. Stay strong and resist the urge to run; the potential rewards are well worth the emotional process. Author Robert Collier wrote, ""Success is the sum of small efforts, repeated day in and day out."""
scorpio,2017-01-03,"The magic of attraction happens when you are less focused on a goal and simply open yourself up to enjoy whatever or whomever comes your way. The sweet pleasures of love and play are spellbinding once desirable Venus drifts into dreamy Pisces and your 5th House of Romance. Pursuing creative experiences that incorporate music, art or dance  enrich your life in countless ways now. Thoreau wrote, ""The world is but a canvas to the imagination."""
sagittarius,2017-01-03,"You can work yourself into a state of unhappiness if you continue to look elsewhere for emotional satisfaction. You're not interested in worldly pursuits today; you just want a luxurious taste of peace and quiet. Thankfully, gentle Venus swims into the imaginative waters of Pisces and your 4th House of Security, providing you with a safe and dreamy environment at home. Ram Dass says, ""The quieter you become, the more you can hear."""
capricorn,2017-01-03,"You may be lost in a lovely fantasy now, which encourages blind faith and a hyper-positive attitude. Kindness and compassion take priority over duty and deadlines when it comes to matters of the heart. Although you might feel a bit disoriented as sensual Venus begins her dance in spiritual Pisces and your 3rd House of Information today, reconnecting with your dreams replenishes your creativity. Carl Jung wrote, ""Your vision will become clear only when you can look into your own heart."""
aquarius,2017-01-03,"Personal finances are on your mind when Venus, the planet of money, joins four other planets already in your 2nd House of Income. But economic issues are deeply entangled with your core values; cash flows more readily when your work aligns with your beliefs. A generous salary isn't sufficient to keep you happy and healthy if you're stuck in an unfulfilling job. Finding your calling is well worth the effort. Psychologist Dr. David Viscott wrote, ""The purpose of life is to discover your gift. The meaning of life is to give your gift away."""
pisces,2017-01-03,"The stark contrast between romantic ideals and interpersonal realities can initiate a fierce debate between your head and your heart today. Several planets in pragmatic Capricorn convince you to let reason take center stage. However, graceful Venus twirls into your poetic sign, creating waves of emotion and inspiring romantic fantasies. Fortunately, you appear irresistibly desirable now, inviting plenty of attention from others. Prioritizing your personal interests balances your tendency to make too many sacrifices for the sake of a harmonious relationship. Don't surrender your power for love."
aries,2017-01-04,"Although you're no stranger to impatience, your willingness to slow down for others just might be at an all-time low. You are redefining the meaning of urgency now that the Moon is back in your impulsive sign. But the cosmic signals are decidedly mixed because retrograde Mercury isn't ready to let you move ahead yet, even if it is in contact with fiery Mars. You may have no choice but to wait this one out, since the control tower is unable to give you clearance until next week. In the meantime, let your dreams nourish your ambitions until you're able to take flight."
taurus,2017-01-04,"You're unsure how to handle your high-strung nerves today. Although you might long for a more laid-back day, everything runs smoother if you temporarily drop your need for control. However, keeping your restlessness to yourself presents its own layer of challenges. Sharing your desire for more peace and quiet could actually help you put it to rest, especially if your conversation turns more spirited than you expect. Russian author Boris Pasternak wrote, ""Surprise is the greatest gift which life can grant us."""
gemini,2017-01-04,"You're in your element and may be pleasantly surprised that people appear to be as upbeat and talkative as you today. Sometimes you need to exercise self-restraint because your endless antics can exhaust your friends. Thankfully, bouncing all over the place like Tigger the Tiger doesn't seem out of place because so many others are experiencing the same degree of unrestrained enthusiasm. Consider this a cosmic permission slip to plant seeds of love and inspiration wherever you roam. Happiness is contagious, pass it on."
cancer,2017-01-04,"Your mind is brimming with good ideas about nearly everything and you are capable of inventing a better plan than anyone else today. The problem is that people won't accept your solution at face value; in fact, they may even oppose your efforts. You're often willing to set your position aside or, at least, negotiate a workable compromise. However, you're quite prepared to head off on your own now if no one jumps in with the support you want. Those who fly solo have the strongest wings."
leo,2017-01-04,"It's nearly impossible to tell if you're more exciting or excited today. Either way, there's enthusiasm coming and going, and it really doesn't matter whether you're sending or receiving. The responsive Moon and retrograde Mercury shift into fire signs, fueling your desire to make something big happen. Unfortunately, you're so easily inspired to initiate action that you provoke trouble, even if it's the opposite of your intentions. Nevertheless, several planets are hanging out in psychic Pisces, giving you a chance to explore non-verbal forms of communication. Your sixth sense is your best sense."
virgo,2017-01-04,"You might wish you didn't have to rely on your feelings to navigate through the emotional currents today. Normally, your savvy mental analysis reveals a path that is good for all. However, trickster Mercury retrogrades into your 4th House of Home and Family, fomenting creative disagreements and numerous misunderstandings. Motivational speaker, Tony Gaskins says, ""Arguing isn't communication; it's noise."" True resolution is possible when you stop focusing on who is wrong, and concentrate on what is right."
libra,2017-01-04,"Relationships may be the primary source of your angst today; you see multiple possibilities that are based upon different assumptions, yet can only move down one path at a time. Paradoxically, the very same partnership that is emotionally unstable also stabilizes your wandering heart. Although you want to act on your thoughts, it might be healthier to sit with them for a while longer. Augustine of Hippo wrote, ""Patience is the companion of wisdom."""
scorpio,2017-01-04,"You are struck with a brilliant idea about how to do a regular chore in a different manner. Your breakthrough might not work out in the long run, but there's only one way to see if you're on track or off the mark -- and that is to actually give it a trial run. Don't cling to a thought with innocence; test it, tweak it and test it again. Or, if your new approach doesn't work very well at all, just eliminate it and move on to the next proposition. Fear regret more than failure."
sagittarius,2017-01-04,"You may be standing in a strange place in your life. Although you're willing to boldly step into uncharted territory and express yourself in a more avant-garde manner, you're simultaneously longing for the past when making choices wasn't such a complicated process. It's impossible to sustain your excitement for the future while also experiencing the fear of the unknown. However, you seem to thrive on this paradox. Keep psychologist M. Esther Harding's words in mind: ""Conflict is the beginning of consciousness."""
capricorn,2017-01-04,"You are looking for a whole new way of framing your relationships with family and friends today because the old assumptions may no longer be working. The pioneering Aries Moon gives you the impetus to take the ball and run with it, even if you don't know where you're going or what you will do when you get there. Author Frank Herbert wrote, ""The future remains uncertain and so it should, for it is the canvas upon which we paint our desires."""
aquarius,2017-01-04,"You are living proof that leaping before you look can be a perfectly viable strategy. Unfortunately, this act-now-think-later tactic doesn't work all the time, but the impulsive Aries Moon shifts into your 3rd House of Environment today, rewarding unpremeditated action. Fill your day with lots of activities, but don't plan ahead too much. The more flexible your calendar, the greater your chance of creating magic in the moment without a whole lot of forethought. Germaine Greer said, ""The essence of pleasure is spontaneity."""
pisces,2017-01-04,"Your professional aspirations are so vivid in your mind that they're close enough to grab. However, success still appears to be relegated to the future and not the present. Nevertheless, you're ready to put your thoughts into action, even if it requires you to take a big risk. You exude confidence and your now-or-never attitude won't give up at the first sign of resistance. Just remember that satisfaction isn't always the fulfillment of what you want; it's the realization that you are blessed for what you already possess."
aries,2017-01-05,"Appearing as if you have everything under control is a defensive tactic that could preemptively dissuade others from questioning your strategy in greater detail. You don't want people delving into your affairs now because you want to review your plans one more time prior to going public. Nevertheless, the reactive Aries Moon keeps your nervous system on high alert. The adrenaline you are feeling is real and it propels you forward on your mission. Henry Van Dyke wrote, ""Genius is talent set on fire by courage."""
taurus,2017-01-05,You enjoy socializing with your peers today but may walk away from a heated discussion at the water cooler so you can return to work. Others might question your motives but only you know the real reason why you can't waste time over petty arguments. Don't bother explaining your actions; you have too much on your plate now and it's wise to conserve your energy for when you need it. Just remember that being busy and being productive are two very different things.
gemini,2017-01-05,"Relationships might be the source of unexpressed stress today. Nevertheless, it's your success that could be on the line if you don't keep your priorities straight. Reaching your professional goals will be an empty achievement unless your heart is happy, too. Walt Disney warned, ""A man should never neglect his family for business."" But talking about your personal commitments isn't enough; you must be willing to put in the work. Ultimately, your beliefs don't make you a better person; your behavior does."
cancer,2017-01-05,"You don't want to give anyone the power to control your life today. However, you appreciate the feeling of comfort that arises when you know that someone is watching your back. Luckily, you have the best of both worlds now; you are free enough to make your own choices and contained enough to sustain your efforts. Lose any last tendrils of doubt and get to work on manifesting your dreams. Although it is reassuring to have a safety net in place, never let your fear decide your fate."
leo,2017-01-05,"You are smoothly working both ends of the spectrum today. On one hand, your desire for spontaneity pushes you to express yourself with wild abandon. On the other hand, acknowledging your limits ensures that you won't take an idea too far over the edge. The energetic balance between optimistic thinking and realistic action offers a stable ground from which you can continue your work undisturbed. Author Anne Wilson Schaef wrote, ""Differences challenge assumptions."""
virgo,2017-01-05,"On the surface, your relationships seem to be fulfilling your needs. However, there is something happening on the inner dimensions that eludes the light of awareness. You may be bothered by the gulf between reality and your imagination, but the two worlds do not need to intersect now. There's no reason to jump through hoops to make ancient teachings relevant to the modern world. Just step outside of your old logical approach and trust the intuitive wisdom that you're receiving from the cosmos. Sometimes a dance with irrationality is required to reestablish harmony."
libra,2017-01-05,"People may be so intent on sharing today that you go quiet with your feelings. You want to treat everyone nicely, but you are courting resentment if you don't express yourself sooner than later. You might try to blame others for your discomfort while the assertive Aries Moon in your 7th House of Relationships rubs you the wrong way. Don't  worry about shifting a conversation gracefully; just cut through the social niceties and say what's on your mind. Stand up for yourself; a change in behavior begins with a change in the heart."
scorpio,2017-01-05,"You're no stranger to emotional intensity, even if you choose to keep it under wraps. However, today's inner explorations can uncover some information you wish you didn't know. Nevertheless, you can't forget what you learn; you can only assimilate it into your perspective the best you can. Slipping into denial won't work because your unexpressed feelings prolong your dance with negativity. Unleash your inner turmoil into a constructive channel. Simone de Beauvoir wrote, ""Art is an attempt to integrate evil."""
sagittarius,2017-01-05,"Solid growth in relationships is the potential reward for bringing your feelings out into the open today. Although you might have insecurities about sharing some aspect of your inner life, exposing your vulnerability is a catalyst that strengthens friendships. The best interactions are the ones that push through the darkness and come out the other side. Real intimacy begins when people see the less-than-perfect human qualities in each other. Live in acceptance rather than expectation."
capricorn,2017-01-05,"You may feel it's imperative to make a decision today, especially if circumstances seem to be holding you back. In fact, you could lose your cool if you are overly eager to obtain results, and you don't want to wait another day. However, the impulsive Aries Moon squares the Sun and Pluto in your calculating sign, preventing you from initiating action before you consider every possible scenario. The good news is your sense of urgency will likely pass before you need to make a significant change."
aquarius,2017-01-05,"All communication channels are wide open today and you may be interacting with others through a variety of social media. Thankfully, texting, online chatting, and even talking on the phone enable you to stay connected to your friends while also honoring your desire for independence and your need for exploration. Dorothy Parker quipped, ""The cure for boredom is curiosity. There is no cure for curiosity."""
pisces,2017-01-05,"Your life is complicated and you might not know how to untangle all the threads that comprise the tapestry of your world. You're committed to tuning into your unconscious to find answers, but you're not interested in lingering in the shadows today. Keep returning to the sunny side of the street so you can enjoy the lighthearted pleasures of the day as well. Novelist Olen Steinhauer wrote, ""Without balance a life is no longer worth the effort."""
aries,2017-01-06,"Taking your time to notice all the details isn't the easiest thing to do, but today you have a rare chance to actually enjoy the process. Although you're still enthusiastic about your activities, you begin to see the wisdom in moving at a more reasonable pace. But it's not about achieving less; it's about fully experiencing every moment as it occurs. Practicing contemplation helps you understand subtleties you might otherwise miss. Fellow Aries Leonardo da Vinci wrote, ""The noblest pleasure is the joy of understanding."""
taurus,2017-01-06,"Although there may be lots of chores to tackle today, you won't have any trouble crossing one item after another off your list. Your ability to concentrate now is as keen as an arrow heading toward its target. Your brain is firing on all cylinders when the Moon returns to your steady sign. You instinctively know that a methodical approach to success results in more progress than racing ahead at full speed. Persistence and consistence are your best friends."
gemini,2017-01-06,"You're known to be a natural-born juggler, adept at keeping many projects and thoughts in the air all at once. But you flexible Geminis still need occasional downtime to recharge your batteries. Thankfully, you can effectively pare back your activities if you have a final goal in mind. Your energy becomes less scattered as your intentions grow more specific. Augusta Kantra teaches, ""Discipline is just choosing between what you want now and what you want most."""
cancer,2017-01-06,"You relish the notion of spending quiet time with friends or family, but you might not get your chance until later in the day. Thankfully, you possess a deep well of patience and can go about your current activities with a smile on your face. Although an emotional storm may be brewing, you're motivated to take on anything and anyone who stands in your way. After all, you're only willing to delay gratification so long. Wake up with determination. Go to bed with satisfaction."
leo,2017-01-06,"Your optimism may wane as the day unfolds, but there are preventive actions you can take to extend your enthusiasm. Unrealistic expectations could be your downfall today if you are cavalier about your previous commitments. It's all too easy to assume everything will magically come together now, but good intentions are not enough to positively influence the flow of events. Actions speak louder than words."
virgo,2017-01-06,"Concentrating on what's possible rather than trying to change what's inevitable vastly improves your odds at finding happiness today. You're heading into an emotional storm, but you could minimize the intensity by reevaluating your priorities and carefully choosing your battles. The bigger the fight you pursue, the more powerful the energies you will unleash. But don't talk yourself into inaction; just make sure you only bite off what you can chew."
libra,2017-01-06,"A strong dose of pragmatism might be just the remedy you need today. Your key planet Venus is busy making magic with no-nonsense Saturn, coloring your dreams with shades of reality. Rather than resisting this call back to Earth, you're eager to reap the rewards of your active imagination, even if you must practice self-restraint in the process. Poet Robert Bringhurst wrote, ""Wings are a constraint that makes it possible to fly."""
scorpio,2017-01-06,"You can see a problem a mile away and are ready to do whatever is necessary to either avoid it or confront it. Although you might take action today that leads to successfully sidestepping an intense emotional encounter, this kind of denial only begs greater trouble later on. Fortunately, there's plenty of planetary support for you now if you approach the potential predicament with an open mind and a loving heart. There's no need to push for immediate resolution. As Gandhi said, ""In a gentle way, you can shake the world."""
sagittarius,2017-01-06,"You may think that everyone around you is encouraging you toward greater heights. Although they probably want the best for you, reaching too far outside your comfort zone now can destabilize your life and set you up for failure. Restrictive Saturn is not asking you to give up today, only demanding you take a more sensible approach to your ambitions. Express your truth, be meticulous with the logistics and focus on attainable long-term goals. Promise less, deliver more."
capricorn,2017-01-06,"You Goats rarely choose the easiest path, which sometimes might leave you tired just thinking about the road ahead. You may wake up today raring to go, but a high level of enthusiasm early in the day can only be sustained for so long. Instead of rushing into your work, start off slowly and attack one small task at a time. Once you handle a few items on your agenda, you will begin to gain momentum. A slow start ensures a solid finish. Yard by hard, it's hard; inch by inch, it's a cinch."
aquarius,2017-01-06,"Dark clouds are gathering on the horizon, but you see silver linings everywhere you look. Rather than succumbing to the negativity of the general consensus, you're eager to do whatever you can in order to create a protective bubble around you and those you love. By accepting the fact that you cannot fix the ails of society at large, you're free to work on the problems that are nearer to home and closer to your heart. Think globally; act locally."
pisces,2017-01-06,"You are being tested today and will likely pass with flying colors if you're willing to buckle down and do the work. Although you may be dealing with financial issues, focus on your attitude and not your material possessions. Setting the wrong goals can lead to disappointment when you successfully complete your mission. Personal transformation is more crucial now than dwelling on the symptoms of a deeper malaise. You have a chance to rise above the mundane without experiencing negative consequences. Rumi wrote, ""You were born with wings; Learn to use them and fly."""
aries,2017-01-07,"Your intense drive for accomplishment today is also setting a deeper tone for the weeks ahead. However, you must renegotiate old commitments before taking on new responsibilities while the evolutionary Sun-Pluto conjunction emphasizes your 10th House of Career. Thankfully, you can push through current limitations and achieve higher levels of success if you're willing to transform your public image and relinquish activities that distract you from your goals. Energy flows where attention goes."
taurus,2017-01-07,"It takes quite a bit to stop you from progressing toward your self-appointed destination once you make up your mind. Your obstinacy is even more tenacious now as the willful Sun joins relentless Pluto, shedding new light on your obsessive behavior when it comes to reaching your goals. Ride your power for all it's worth, but be attentive to the needs of others so you don't unintentionally trample over them on your way to success. Sensitivity is not a weakness of mind, but an act of a compassionate heart."
gemini,2017-01-07,"Unexpressed feelings of resentment can chip away at your confidence without you even realizing it. The emotionally intense Sun-Pluto conjunction occurs in your 8th House of Transformation, revealing the depth of your current metamorphosis. Nevertheless, others may not understand the strength of your convictions or the inevitability of your changes. You could undermine the support you need from your social network by channeling your frustration into petty arguments. Taking full responsibility for your decision to embark on a new path earns you credibility and respect."
cancer,2017-01-07,"Although it's nearly impossible to know where your current trajectory is heading, it's obvious your world is irrevocably changing. There might not be anything you can do to slow this evolutionary process, but you could ease the pressures along the way. Turning your fear into hard work might be productive, but it won't help you get to the underlying issue. There's really no need to struggle; the simple act of letting go of your attachment to the caterpillar paves a smooth road to becoming a butterfly."
leo,2017-01-07,"Trying to connect with your inner child could be frustrating today, especially while all your attention is aimed toward the work ahead. Unavoidable responsibilities mount, making it clear that you must streamline your life for the sake of efficiency. The penetrating Sun-Pluto conjunction in your 6th House of Logistics requires you to prioritize your tasks so you have time to reconsider which parts of your job no longer serve you well. Eliminating fears and habits that hold you back clears the way for a more fulfilling expression of your talents. Worry less, roar more."
virgo,2017-01-07,"You may know exactly what you want now and are in possession of a plan to get it. However, your ambitious drive could hurt someone you love unless you remember to consider their needs as well as your own. The radiant Sun's annual hookup with resolute Pluto can either box you into a corner or empower you to shine your light into the darkness. There is no valid reason to continue to nurse negative feelings tied to events in the past. The sooner you acknowledge your fears, the better it will be for everyone involved."
libra,2017-01-07,"Sometimes you need to sink to the bottom before you can seek higher ground. Unfortunately, the mysterious Sun-Pluto conjunction falls in your 4th House of Roots, taking your emotions to a deeper level than you knew was possible. Feelings of disappointment or betrayal may surface now, but there's no reason to flinch when you see what's lurking in the shadows of your subconscious. Untangling your needs and desires can clear up a murky situation and initiate a profound process of recovery and transformation."
scorpio,2017-01-07,"You're at a fork in the road now and you won't be able to cycle back to this intersection after you make your decision. You may be required to surrender a belief you once considered important, since the unforgiving Sun-Pluto conjunction in your 3rd House of Communication shines light on anything that's no longer needed. Don't cling to an insecurity or hold onto a grudge that has outlasted its purpose. Keep in mind that your actions at this point of no return might have much greater impact than you realize. Difficult roads often lead to beautiful destinations."
sagittarius,2017-01-07,"A power struggle might be precipitated by a disagreement about money with a partner or family member today. Although a solution may seem non-existent at first, the conversation will likely shift from short-term concerns to deeper matters that raise issues of conflicting values. Nevertheless, your job isn't to convince someone that your conclusions are valid; it's to listen so you can establish common ground. Communication must be a two-way street if you want peace in your world."
capricorn,2017-01-07,Your reactions to people who appear to be interfering with your life are extreme and it's challenging to moderate your response today. You could easily precipitate an unwinnable battle with a fearful or controlling person who expresses needs you cannot meet. The intense Sun-Pluto conjunction in your sign can bring a long-simmering point of contention to an emotional climax. The real issue is whether you value the relationship enough to face your own shortcomings and do what's necessary to make it work.
aquarius,2017-01-07,"Practicing self-restraint is an important key to your happiness now. You're unlikely to make a scene while an uncompromising Sun-Pluto communion in your 12th House of Invisibility turns you in a more spiritual direction. Your current introspection won't necessarily resolve relationship conflicts; nevertheless, you can balance any stress with patience and planning. Finding some quiet time by yourself gives you a chance to tap into an unused source of passion and power. Philosopher Martin Buber wrote, ""Solitude is the place of purification."""
pisces,2017-01-07,"If you're not on top of a situation now you may wind up buried by it later on. Relationship issues weigh heavily on your mind while the compulsive Sun-Pluto alignment activates your 11th House of Social Networks. Take control of the process as much as possible rather than just trying to make everyone happy. Thankfully, you can achieve great things if you focus on carrying out your intentions and allowing your ambitions to fuel the fire in your belly. Believe it to achieve it."
aries,2017-01-08,"You Rams are known for your directness, yet today you could easily outdo yourself. Messenger Mercury's direct turn in your 9th House of Big Ideas would normally be enough on its own to have you spontaneously spouting your thoughts, whether they are valid or not. However, several cosmic factors are also encouraging you to express your feelings even if you know you are likely to push someone's buttons. In fact, you might even exaggerate your message to increase the shock value. Author Caroline Schoeder wrote, ""Some people change their ways when they see the light, others when they feel the heat."""
taurus,2017-01-08,"Your friends may confront you with an issue that was recently swept under the rug. However, it's like someone opens Pandora's Box when communicator Mercury shifts into forward gear today, accentuating your 8th House of Deep Sharing. Although you might feel uncomfortable with the topic of discussion at first, accepting the inevitable can actually feel liberating. Change often doesn't come easily, but this time you will be glad you switched to the new program as fast as you did. Your willingness to compromise opens doors that were previously shut."
gemini,2017-01-08,"If it seems like you have reached the end of your rope, take a few deep breaths and prepare yourself for a pleasant surprise. Everything is about to change once your key planet Mercury completes its retrograde period in your 7th House of Partnerships. However, you may need to take responsibility for your feelings before you see the tension in a relationship begin to dissipate. Standing up to someone who is holding you back shifts the dynamics and puts you in control of your destiny."
cancer,2017-01-08,"Interpersonal dynamics have been quite complicated lately, making you wonder whether or not the stress is truly worth it. Thankfully, the cosmos gives you the green light today, informing you that things are about to improve if you're willing to do the work. Cerebral Mercury resumes its forward movement in your 6th House of Habits, reminding you that the planning period is over and it's time to make your move. Remember, you don't need to reach the finish line right away; many small steps will successfully lead you to your destination."
leo,2017-01-08,"Although it may take a while to get going today, there's no stopping you once you do. Mercury's direct turn in your 5th House of Self-Expression triggers a barrage of creative communication that sets the tone for the days ahead. Don't wait for a better time to put a project into motion, especially if it's one that you've been thinking about for a long time. As Zig Ziglar said, ""You don't have to be great to start, but you have to start to be great."""
virgo,2017-01-08,"You might be looking forward to a day of relaxation but the pace of events picks up suddenly, requiring you to leave your idyllic daydreams behind. Your key planet Mercury resumes its forward motion in your 4th House of Family, redirecting your attention to your closest relationships. However, your relatives don't seem to be playing the parts in your script that you previously assigned to them. Instead, you must manage your own feelings because you're not in control of everyone else's. What happens to you is not as important as how you react."
libra,2017-01-08,"Your inner rebel awakens today, encouraging you to behave contrary to what others expect. Of course, this urge to stir the pot conflicts with your natural desire for everyone to live in harmony. Nevertheless, your key planet Venus forms a stressful alignment with revolutionary Uranus, temporarily altering your values. Currently, it's more critical for you to be different than it is to conform, and interactive Mercury's direct turn in your 3rd House of Communication pushes you to speak your mind in the present moment. You must be willing to be uncomfortable if you want to change your world."
scorpio,2017-01-08,"Your psychic antennas are overly sensitive these days, dissolving boundaries between your internal and external worlds. Although your heightened awareness deepens your compassion, it also can be emotionally overwhelming. You want others to become more conscious of everyone else's feelings and to contribute to the well-being of humanity. Meanwhile, talkative Mercury spins forward in your 2nd House of Values, urging you to share your perspective with your friends, whether or not they want to hear it. Author Neale Donald Walsch wrote, ""Speak your truth but soothe your words with peace."""
sagittarius,2017-01-08,"You've been not so patiently waiting for the moment when the clouds part and the endless blue sky becomes visible again. Logical Mercury's shift into forward motion occurs in your philosophical sign, allowing you to express your thoughts without restraint. However, it's crucial to know your limits, especially when the horizon appears so far away. Although you have little reason to moderate your opinions, you'll lose your audience unless you know when to stop. Leave them begging for more, not less."
capricorn,2017-01-08,"There is a sense of urgency in the air and it's challenging to maintain a rational mindset when you get swept up by unexpected circumstances. Although these are intense times and the issues you face are real, your need for immediate resolution is not necessarily based upon the current situation. Trickster Mercury turns direct in your 12th House of Destiny, convincing you that an impulsive reaction must be the correct one. Acknowledge your feelings and let them flow through you without taking action. Remember, you don't have to say or do everything you think."
aquarius,2017-01-08,"One of your special gifts is the ability to get away with weird behavior that somehow seems acceptable to your fans. Today's stressful Venus-Uranus alignment inspires you to take these eclectic actions to new places. Clever Mercury's shift of direction in your 11th House of Friends signals a change of dynamics in your social landscape. Although others may just give you a funny look, they might be struggling with the real issues behind your non-conformity. Remain authentic at all costs. What makes you different makes you beautiful."
pisces,2017-01-08,"There are many ways to distract yourself from what's really important today. Although this may be an intended day of rest, you might choose to fill it by pursuing unusual experiences that could bring you pleasure. Whether you go skydiving, visit an art gallery or make new friends, you don't want your activities to consist of the same old things. Nevertheless, once the amusement is over, your thoughts return to your career trajectory over the weeks ahead while your 10th House of Profession is activated by intelligent Mercury. Fortune sides with those who dare."
aries,2017-01-09,"Thankfully, you are surrounded by positive energy today, but you still secretly wonder if you can keep up with your ambitious agenda. Everyone seems to have an abundance of confidence in you while several planets send their energy to propitious Jupiter in your 7th House of Others. But working non-stop isn't necessarily the way to get more done. Making time for healthy activities produces a more positive impact in the long run. An old Chinese proverb says, ""Tension is who you think you should be. Relaxation is who you are."""
taurus,2017-01-09,"You are grateful that your support network comes through when you need it today, but your associates still remain a mixed blessing. Although others arrive with encouraging words or offers to work on your behalf, they can also be extremely distracting. Everyone seems to have a story to tell and you appear to be the designated listener, regardless of whether or not you have the time. All social interactions extract a price now. There are no free lunches; if you want assistance from your peers, you must show up for them in return."
gemini,2017-01-09,"Your mind is running on several parallel tracks today and your thoughts might be moving so rapidly that you momentarily forget who you are and where you're going. Although your recovery time may be so fast that others don't even notice your lapse of attention, this lack of concentration can throw your rhythm off. Instead of waiting for the next cerebral blip, channel your energy into one specific task at a time. Narrowing your focus expands your productivity."
cancer,2017-01-09,"Although it may be back to work or school today, you wish you had an extra day to indulge in your favorite fantasies. In fact, concentrating on your assignments seems nearly impossible now. Instead of attempting to relentlessly power through your day, set a timer so you can focus on a task for a specific length of time, followed by a designated few minutes of daydreaming. Rather than driving yourself crazy trying to contain your attention within narrow slices of reality, find a rhythm of expansion and contraction that works best for you."
leo,2017-01-09,"You possess a natural instinct for sensing what's around the next corner today, making this an opportune time to solidify your plans. But logical analysis isn't as helpful now as you might hope because even verifiable facts can still lead you in the wrong direction. The Moon's visit to your 11th House of Hopes and Wishes encourages you to close your eyes and let your imagination take you where it will. Let your dreams be bigger than your fears; your intuition knows no bounds."
virgo,2017-01-09,"Business and personal relationships contain a layer of complexity today, requiring additional effort on your part to untangle all the emotional threads. You are being shown many opportunities now, but aren't ready to limit the field to just one yet. Nevertheless, your confidence is growing and you're quite certain that the right pieces will come together in the nick of time. Avoid making decisions prematurely; the longer you can keep your options open, the better the outcome."
libra,2017-01-09,"Reestablishing your balance is tricky business when everything looks so good on the surface. But there are weak links to every chain and it's in your best interest to know where they are now and how much weight they can bear. Nevertheless, your positive attitude influences the results you want to achieve. But your good intentions are not enough to assure success, even while auspicious Jupiter aligns with Venus and Mars in your 6th House of Daily Routine. Richard G. Scott write, ""You become what you want to be by consistently being what you want to become each day."""
scorpio,2017-01-09,"People may be surprised by the steady stream of creative solutions you have to offer today. However, they can't see how much your current productivity stems from your spiritual perspective on life. The curious Gemini Moon is dancing in your 8th House of Regeneration, inviting you on a Magical Mystery Tour to explore the hidden shadows of your imagination. A wellspring of inspiration waits to be untapped by your intuition. Eleanor Roosevelt said, ""It is better to light a candle than curse the darkness."""
sagittarius,2017-01-09,"Everyone seems a bit flaky now, making it difficult to know who you can trust. People might change their minds without warning today, even if they pledged their allegiance to your altruistic cause yesterday. It seems logical to tighten your control to make sure others hold up their part of the bargain. Nevertheless, adopting an authoritative stance will not work. Jump in and get your hands dirty without waiting for anyone else. Leading by example sends a clear message of integrity."
capricorn,2017-01-09,"Oddly enough, you can get a bit nervous when everything is coming up roses. After a while, you can't help but begin to wonder where the thorns are hiding. Although positivity is an admirable trait, it's more important today to be realistic than optimistic. Only when you have a sensible perspective based upon seeing things in their true light will you be able to find satisfaction in your success."
aquarius,2017-01-09,"You are at the top of your game today and believe that you can solve any problem that shows up at your door. Although your analytical skills are certainly on point, there will be no mind-blowing epiphany from the facts alone. A conceptual breakthrough is possible only if you're willing to step over the edge and into the irrational realms of intuition and feelings. As Albert Einstein said, ""Logic will get you from A to B. Imagination will take you everywhere."""
pisces,2017-01-09,"You're willing to jump off an emotional cliff and delve into the deepest abyss today if it leads you to finding the truth. However, there is a battle being played out within your mind to determine whether it's wiser to trust your gut instinct or to stick with the facts now. The answer is a paradox not unlike the particle-wave duality of quantum physics. You can't assume that one frame of reference is better than the other; they each add a layer of richness to the whole."
aries,2017-01-10,"The best advice you could follow is to let go of your attachment to the plans you made for today. You can still accomplish your objectives, but things at work won't likely unfold as you expect. The Sun's dynamic square with anything-goes Uranus hotwires communications, suddenly blasting a conversation into uncharted territory. Thankfully, your persistence will pay off if you hang onto your sense of adventure. Be stubborn about your goals now, but flexible about your methods."
taurus,2017-01-10,"A confrontation with a coworker isn't easy to resolve if it brings up differences about basic values. Nevertheless, unexpected events could rattle a professional relationship when the willful Sun squares irrepressible Uranus. Sometimes, an honest dialogue is necessary to clear the air. However, stepping around disapproving individuals is wiser than escalating a minor disagreement into a major battle now. A simple smile can relieve the tension until you're ready to face the issue head on. Some people create their own storms, then get upset when it rains."
gemini,2017-01-10,"You are leaning over the edge of an exciting conceptual shift now. You may be experiencing an equal share of anticipation and fear. But even if you're ready to jump, remember that today's wild-and-crazy Sun-Uranus square can tempt you with immediate distractions when you should stay focused on your long-term goals. Keep in mind that your success is directly proportional to the effort you apply. Honoring your priorities above all else brings you a greater sense of gratification."
cancer,2017-01-10,"Although you can be a lot more flexible than anyone realizes, you may choose to dig in your heels today and stubbornly resist change. But the shocking Sun-Uranus square casts things in an entirely different light. Thankfully, you surprise everyone by how quickly you adapt to the new scene once you see how your actions affect the ones you love. However, it's not an easy transition, because you vacillate between wanting the sensual benefits of an intimate relationship and your need to maintain emotionally secure boundaries. Compromise is an act of strength that demonstrates the depth of your commitment."
leo,2017-01-10,"Your long-term vision conflicts with your current responsibilities at work and you don't see a simple way to solve this dilemma. The pressure for resolution has been building for a while and it could reach a crescendo today. Naturally, it's healthy to confront the problem, but it may not be time to make your move yet. Frustration morphs into the most effective action if you don't get impatient over an issue you cannot change in the present moment. As Tom Petty sings, ""The waiting is the hardest part."""
virgo,2017-01-10,"Restless feelings are stirred today, distracting you from the details of your daily duties. A crackling Sun-Uranus square tempts you to overreact and rebel against your current responsibilities. You're ready to set your work aside and engage in some good old-fashioned play. Spontaneity may come easily now but impulsive actions provoke shocking responses. Your experiments can produce amazing breakthroughs or blow up in your face, so be careful about where and how you take chances."
libra,2017-01-10,"Don't bother playing it safe today, since the unexpected can happen even when you're taking the most cautious route. Thankfully, you can reach your goals if you're willing to step outside of whatever box contains you. It's as if you sense the lightning bolt that awakens your consciousness when the Sun forms an electric square with brilliant Uranus, giving you a glimpse of the bright future ahead. Keep your eyes on the horizon and your foot on the gas pedal."
scorpio,2017-01-10,"Traditions that you once held in high esteem are now being challenged by current events. The Sun's tense square with unruly Uranus electrifies the atmosphere with a call for rebellion that encourages you to undermine authority. Nevertheless, it's wiser to break with the past than to allow a breakdown in civility at work or in your household. Knowing how to adapt to change in a mature manner helps you navigate through this tricky passage without wreaking havoc. There are always consequences to your behavior; make sure you're prepared for them before you act."
sagittarius,2017-01-10,"Misunderstandings and mix-ups may lead to explosive words today, so listen carefully and speak slowly to avoid needless arguments. You might be uncharacteristically hesitant to go out on a limb now because you're afraid of the possible negative responses to your wild and crazy behavior. Nevertheless, your urge for innovation and independence is fueled by a radical Sun-Uranus square, leaving you to wonder if this is your moment to strike out on your own. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said, ""The only strategy that is guaranteed to fail is not taking risks."""
capricorn,2017-01-10,"Reality brings you a surprise gift today but you must wait to open it. However, adherence to the rules is tossed out the window when the Sun squares unorthodox Uranus, turning a simple event into a life-altering one. It helps to have your ducks in a row now, since someone else's erratic behavior can mess up your plans. Thankfully, you're not as bound up by protocol as you thought. Break patterns and claim ownership of the moment without waiting any longer. Going outside of the norm enables you to discover exciting new worlds within."
aquarius,2017-01-10,"Your opinions are strong today and you might be itching for an intense debate. The expressive power of the Sun in your 12th House of Destiny is amplified by its dynamic square to uncontainable Uranus. Although it may be nearly impossible to settle down thanks to all the excitement you feel, pushing back against an authority figure isn't smart, either. Tread carefully; a small dispute could quickly grow out of hand. Instead, vent your overabundant energy and unbridled passion in creative and constructive ways."
pisces,2017-01-10,"Unmet responsibilities or an argument with your boss may open your mind to more inventive ways of taking care of business today. In fact, a minor crisis might unexpectedly turn into an apparent opportunity when the Sun creates a dynamic square with revolutionary Uranus. Stay cool if you're hit by a shockwave; you can recover swiftly if you remain adaptable enough to consider alternative approaches. President Franklin Roosevelt said, ""There are many ways of going forward, but only one way of standing still."""
aries,2017-01-11,"You are finally done running through an obstacle course and the results of your hard work should begin to be evident. Nevertheless, you're drawn into a whirlwind of activity today and you might find yourself spinning your wheels just to keep up. Meanwhile, the real juice comes to you in the form of deep conversations about the meaning of life. Dig beneath the noise of the day to transform lighthearted discussions into a rewarding metaphysical journey. Go to the places that spark a fire in your soul."
taurus,2017-01-11,"Looking outside the box in search of more meaningful work sounds like a good idea while the Sun creates a slick square to adventurous Jupiter. Your expectations may be high but they are within your grasp if you're willing to put in the effort. Make an honest assessment of your talent; even if you come up short somewhere, trusting your instincts enables you to find the additional resources you need. Arianna Huffington wrote, ""Life is a dance between making it happen and letting it happen."""
gemini,2017-01-11,"Too much of a good thing can become a major headache today. The Sun's square to exaggerating Jupiter infuses your life with unrestrained ambition and inspires you to pursue every opportunity in sight. Nevertheless, your blind optimism turns into informed realism when you take time to do the research. Be wise and exercise self-control or you may exhaust yourself before you reach your goal. Marathon champion Juma Ikangaa says, ""The will to win means nothing without the will to prepare."""
cancer,2017-01-11,"Stretching yourself to reach for a higher prize is a sound tactic as long as you carefully calculate the cost of fulfilling your dreams. However, you're challenged to maintain a sensible perspective now because an inflationary Sun-Jupiter square dares you to overstep your limits. Your emotions are powerful today and it may require extra effort to keep them in line. Revealing your innermost thoughts can make others uncomfortable, prompting them to withdraw. Keep your fears to yourself; everyone, including you, is entitled to take a step back in order to create breathing room."
leo,2017-01-11,"You might be harboring unresolved concerns today about the boundaries between enough and too much. But your desire for balance is not just an intellectual exercise because the Sun's square to giant Jupiter inspires you to make commitments you cannot keep. A combination of blind optimism and escapist tendencies empowers you to smoothly skirt around important issues. Nevertheless, separating your grandiose visions from your present reality can be challenging now. Thankfully, your saving grace is found in  remembering that moderation and clarity go hand-in-hand."
virgo,2017-01-11,"Waves of change are more than personal now and can pull you into social or political realms. You may be extending beyond your regular boundaries and moving in the direction of excess as the Sun's stressful square to bountiful Jupiter magnifies your desire to play a prominent role on a larger stage. Voluntarily cutting back before you deplete your resources is a true sign of maturity. Journalist Shannon Fife wrote, ""Self-restraint is feeling your wild oats without sowing them."""
libra,2017-01-11,"You may feel intense pressure to define your long-term needs and protect your interests. But getting down to business today involves tough-minded negotiations that won't necessarily show your generous nature. Fortunately, changing circumstances allow you to take a stand without shutting the door on a possible win-win solution. Keep your drive to succeed in check; unrestrained ambition can undermine your recent gains. Roman poet Horace wrote, ""He who is greedy is always in want."""
scorpio,2017-01-11,"Current opportunities look too good today to be true. Thankfully, your positive outlook fuels your actions, helping you accomplish more than you thought possible. Your newfound exuberance can be helpful as long as you temper any tendency to exaggerate a story or over-commit to a social cause. Being aware of your limitations is a smart practice that helps you to keep excessive behavior in check. Zen master Lao Tzu wrote, ""By moderation one can be generous."""
sagittarius,2017-01-11,"You are so anxious to express your feelings that you don't even think about the potential fallout. You simply want others to understand your position, but unfortunately, you could easily go to extreme measures and overstate your case. Nothing is gained by offending anyone with your strong opinions. However, if you want to be taken seriously now, temper your arrogance before unconsciously swinging into action. Fools rush in where angels fear to tread; wise souls know when to wait."
capricorn,2017-01-11,"You might experience a eureka moment today that leads to the solution of a long-standing mystery. In fact, you're likely to accomplish nearly anything you set your mind to now. Nevertheless, the Sun's square to exorbitant Jupiter can trick you into jumping to conclusions before you think the logistics all the way through. Strong convictions and grand ambitions are allies for growth, but demanding Saturn currently reveals the flaws in your plan and reminds you to stick close to the facts. With great power comes great responsibility."
aquarius,2017-01-11,"You might not know what to do with all your extra enthusiasm today. Naturally, you prefer cool logic to the intensity that currently accompanies your thoughts. You are energized by waves of change that are greater than personal interests now; nevertheless, it's not easy to harness this power. Go along for the ride, knowing that these emotional currents can carry you well beyond your original destination. The more you take responsibility for your past and present, the more you're able to create the future you seek."
pisces,2017-01-11,"Pushing gently against the edges of your assumptions forces you to learn new things about yourself and your world. Stretching the boundaries of your beliefs is a powerful growth process as long as you stop before the breaking point. However, the Sun's current square to boisterous Jupiter tempts you to promise more than you can deliver or buy into someone else's sales pitch. Your impulsive decision to move into new territory might be exhilarating, but staying within your bounds keeps you safe."
aries,2017-01-12,"You may have worked yourself into a corner, believing there is no easy way to meet your obligations while still being true to yourself. The moody Cancer Full Moon settles into your 4th House of Emotional Security, yet your reactions to a complicated situation can tilt events in your favor. Instead of shooting from the hip -- which often works well for you -- engage in practical negotiations. A quantum leap is only possible if you focus on finding common ground instead of attacking what appears to be the source of the problem."
taurus,2017-01-12,"The excitement of an unorthodox vision might shake your foundation since moving from concept to reality involves a destabilizing shift. Giving up beliefs and behaviors that anchor you isn't necessarily easy. You may have the sensation that your life is floating off somewhere beyond your control. However, the self-protective Cancer Full Moon lights up your 3rd House of Information, tempting you to withdraw to a more comfortable space. A cozy gathering with your friends and family sounds like the best possible scenario. Nevertheless, establishing your own emotional security is your responsibility alone."
gemini,2017-01-12,"Although you may wish to incorporate the ambitions of others into your plans, the tenacious Cancer Full Moon illuminates your 2nd House of Personal Resources, shifting the focus back to your individual needs. You might be harboring beliefs that your fantasies are real but chatty Mercury moves into calculating Capricorn, requiring you to access your innate practicality. Common sense is a flower that doesn't grow in everyone's garden, so harvest it while you have the chance."
cancer,2017-01-12,"There is no room for lazy thinking or careless communication today, so express yourself with authority or keep your thoughts to yourself. Although a lack of planning and commitment may put control in someone else's hands, the nurturing Cancer Full Moon in your sign reminds you to consider your own needs before trying to meet the expectations of others. Making the satisfaction of a lover, friend or coworker your top priority will only leave you in second place. You can't pour from an empty cup; take care of yourself first."
leo,2017-01-12,"You are free to choose what to share when you are ready because no one can require you to bare your heart unless you are willing. The contemplative Cancer Full Moon falls in your 12th House of Secrets, temporarily alleviating pressure as you realize that your feelings belong to you and you alone. Remember, your relationships are not separate from your identity, your fears and your hopes. Regardless of how much you disclose, recognize others as mirrors of your soul."
virgo,2017-01-12,"Rather than giving into your impulses today, do what you Virgos do best: analyze new projects and activities to weed out those that will require more effort than you originally anticipated. Fortunately, your friends and colleagues will show up with the emotional support you need while the Cancer Full Moon brightens your 11th House of Community. Instead of forging ahead on your own or just struggling to quietly maintain your current vision, turn to dependable allies who can help to make your work more manageable. Roman poet Ovid wrote, ""The burden becomes light that is shared by love."""
libra,2017-01-12,"You may believe that your reputation is at stake when the emotionally protective Cancer Full Moon shines in your 10th House of Status. However, a power struggle could upset the harmony at work or at home, unless you possess the wisdom to face the issue without stirring further conflict. Your clever-yet-restrained response can alleviate unexpressed tensions, allowing everyone involved to find much-needed balance. The Dalai Lama teaches, ""An open heart is an open mind."""
scorpio,2017-01-12,"Don't discount the value of the lessons you learn from your life experiences, even if you're feeling insecure about a lack of academic credentials. Verbose Mercury speaks with conviction when it enters earthy Capricorn but the importance of education is underscored by the Cancer Full Moon's presence in your 9th House of Higher Truth. Be diligent in your pursuit of knowledge and purposeful in your behavior. If it doesn't challenge you, it won't change you."
sagittarius,2017-01-12,"You enjoy talking about your fantasies as if they're already real, yet you grow more serious today when mental Mercury marches into methodical Capricorn. Nevertheless, an emotional crisis tests your common sense when the Cancer Full Moon washes over your 8th House of Deep Sharing. This lunation is a not-so-gentle reminder to consider the cost of your relationships and the potential return for your investment. Focusing on your long-term goals helps you turn a current situation into a lasting treasure."
capricorn,2017-01-12,"Relationship issues come to the forefront as the Cancer Full Moon nurtures your 7th House of Partnerships. Although you try to remain cool and unemotional, it's difficult to suppress your desires. You may overstate your needs while the Sun and Moon are squaring excessive Jupiter. In fact, you can convince yourself of nearly anything to justify what you want. Don't fall prey to your own enthusiasm or you'll wear everyone out. Increase your chances of finding satisfaction by mutually agreeing to a sustainable plan and sticking to it."
aquarius,2017-01-12,"You may not be in the spotlight today but you surely will be recognized for your efforts behind the scenes. The cautious Cancer Full Moon activates your 6th House of Work, reminding you of the emotional security you gain from  maintaining regularity in your daily routine and performing your job well. However, this lunation foments restlessness and maybe even chaos in your world. Thankfully, stable Saturn supplies a modicum of reason to prevent things from going completely off the rails. President Theodore Roosevelt said, ""With self-discipline most anything is possible."""
pisces,2017-01-12,"Conversations with friends and colleagues are teeming with useful ideas today. Luckily, your ability to express and understand complex concepts benefits from an integration of fact and philosophy. Nevertheless, feelings flow freely when the sentimental Cancer Full Moon floods your 5th House of Love and Creativity, bringing hopes of romance to fruition. Your need for affection produces waves of emotion that can erode the walls of logic you built to protect your vulnerability. Give people a slice of your heart rather than a piece of your mind."
aries,2017-01-13,"You are operating with conflicting agendas today and might be unable to resolve the differences. On one hand, you want to retreat from the outer world and spend the day in quiet contemplation. It's not that you're lazy; you just need some time to reflect on your life so you can decide what you want to do next. On the other hand, there are places to go and people to see. You can't imagine wasting the day with nothing to show for it by nightfall. Finding the right mix between productivity and relaxation is the trick."
taurus,2017-01-13,"You're unclear about your role with your friends and associates today. At work, you might not know where you best fit into the group process, or it may seem awkward to participate in social events. There's no reason to fake enthusiasm if you're not feeling a connection now. It's easier to establish your rhythm when you're not trying to dance to someone else's drum beat. Sometimes you just need to disconnect and enjoy your own company. Time alone can be time well-spent."
gemini,2017-01-13,"You might have your day mapped out in great detail, only to discover that you must change your schedule when something happens that's beyond your control. But perhaps you need to reconsider your overall goals before you simply shuffle a few appointments around. Rather than getting caught up in the tiny details, take a few steps back to review your current position, where you're coming from and where you wish to go. Actor Scott Caan says, ""Good things happen when you set your priorities straight."""
cancer,2017-01-13,"It's no fun when your coworkers make demands on your time, especially when you think they are being unreasonable. You know what needs to be done now and prefer to just get on with it. Unfortunately, things aren't flowing easily because people seem to be slightly misguided today. Nevertheless, it's not your job to straighten out anyone else when there's still plenty of unfinished business on your plate. Successful people never worry about what others are doing because they are too busy being successful."
leo,2017-01-13,"You may be mildly annoyed with others today, especially if your creative muse is nowhere to be found. It's tempting to blame someone for your shortcomings, but your unhappiness is likely more about you than anyone else. You could be irritated because concentration is challenging when your emotions get in the way of logic. However, you won't solve this dilemma overnight; acknowledge your changing moods and accept responsibility for your actions. Going through the motions allows you to fake it until you make it."
virgo,2017-01-13,"Misinterpreting someone's signals today could land you in a heap of trouble. Coworkers and friends can contribute to your confusion if they are not clear about their own goals. Remember, it's all too easy to jump to a conclusion based upon a faulty assumption when you don't have all the facts at your disposal. Thankfully, preventing a misunderstanding before it happens takes very little effort on your part if you simply ask the right questions along the way."
libra,2017-01-13,"You know you can be more productive if you work alone today, but you're willing to sacrifice some overall efficiency for the sake of your team. But just pretending to be a part of the group won't achieve the results you seek; you must be willing to fully participate, even if it means getting your hands dirty. A half-hearted promise isn't the same as a real commitment. There are only two options: you're either in or you're out."
scorpio,2017-01-13,"You're in a no-nonsense mood when it comes to business today -- or so you say. You may attempt to do all the right things in order to demonstrate how serious you are now. Nevertheless, you might be unable to deny your inner child of its need to come out and play. Unfortunately, the more you restrict the fun and games, the less productive you are. Thankfully, responsibility and joy are not mutually exclusive. If you play your cards right, you can have your cake and eat it too."
sagittarius,2017-01-13,"Sometimes, you just can't help but show the world your true colors, even if it doesn't further your cause. Your mind is not on work today; instead, you're dreaming of flying to Mars or conquering a Tibetan mountain. Unfortunately, your visions of the future are not grounded in reality, yet you talk about them as if they are already in the works. No doubt, everyone loves your I-can-do-it attitude, but only if you can discern the difference between fact and fancy. Benjamin Franklin wrote, ""Well done is better than well said."""
capricorn,2017-01-13,"Although your definition of success may change month by month, achieving your dreams is on your agenda now. Nevertheless, it might seem as if the window of opportunity is closing so fast that you could lose your chance before you can make something happen. Ironically, true satisfaction isn't always found by attaining measurable results. Instead of basing your happiness on material wealth, go deep within to find an abundance of joy. Albert Einstein wrote, ""Not everything that counts can be counted."""
aquarius,2017-01-13,"Love is in the air, but it seems as if you must meet someone else's expectations in a very specific manner if you want the approval you seek. However, being acknowledged by others won't fill the longings of an empty heart. Thankfully, your self-esteem soars when you reexamine your core values and choose a path based upon expressing them in the real world. Nevertheless, you can still enjoy the company of someone special as long as you untangle your sense of dependency from your wellbeing. Don't let anyone's actions steal your happiness."
pisces,2017-01-13,"Paradoxically, you can be optimistic about your future even if you can't keep your feelings straight today. Instead of running the risk of high stress and irrepressible frustration, temporarily shift your focus away from your emotions and toward your daily routine. Concentrate on those activities that you perform day in and day out, without worrying about anything else. Limiting your actions narrows your thinking and frees you from a vicious cycle. Your attitude determines your direction."
aries,2017-01-14,"Although there are chores waiting for you today, you're ready to blow off your responsibilities and pursue a bit of overdue pleasure. Thankfully, the disparate pieces should fall into place pretty easily once you make your decision. There is no reason to hide your plans from anyone else, even if they don't agree with your choices. Follow your heart and not your head now, but stop long enough to see the intrinsic value in both your feelings and your thoughts."
taurus,2017-01-14,"You're eager to swing into action in order to reestablish your emotional equilibrium today. You may feel like a candle in the wind if you lose your connection with the more practical side of the equation. Nevertheless, your life is more stable than you realize and your light has nearly no chance of being blown out by changing circumstances. Author Rikki Rogers wrote, ""Strength doesn't come from what you can do. It comes from overcoming the things you once thought you couldn't."""
gemini,2017-01-14,"You want to shout your plans from the rooftop today because you're anxious to make a point about how you want to live your life. You may think it's important to express your individuality and stand up to the authority of anyone who tries to limit your options. However, you could get carried away with your mission and overstate your cause. Unfortunately, people might not be so appreciative of your agenda unless you demonstrate your concern for their needs as well. Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""Without a rich heart, wealth is an ugly beggar."""
cancer,2017-01-14,"The same ideas that you weren't sure about a few days ago now appear to be the shiniest of stars beaming at you. Your confidence inspires others to respond enthusiastically when you share your plans, which in turn, validates your ambitious intentions. However, your current originality can overshadow your common sense. Don't trade in a practical plan for an ingenious one that won't work. Your success depends upon setting goals that are flexible and attainable."
leo,2017-01-14,"It feels good to boldly state your needs without much of a filter today. Your plans may be outrageous but your flair for the dramatic makes even the craziest idea sound totally plausible to your audience. Happily, everyone seems to be applauding your efforts and you're not completely sure why. But don't waste energy trying to rationalize the behavior of others; you have too much to prove and the sooner you start the show, the sooner you'll be able to reap the rewards of your stellar performance."
virgo,2017-01-14,"You might be riding a quiet wave of self-assurance now, but people won't likely see your positivity at first. You could go out of your way to hide a blooming relationship or minimize an infatuation with a person, place or idea because you don't want anyone spoiling it with their negativity. But your somber demeanor is confusing to others who can't understand what you're keeping to yourself. Greek philosopher Phaedrus wrote, ""Things are not always as they seem; the first appearance deceives many."""
libra,2017-01-14,"Maintaining your place in the social pecking order is easier today than keeping the peace in a family relationship. Although your friends and associates offer enticing invitations now, your time is better spent patching up hurt feelings with someone close to you than filling your calendar with many diversions. But don't expect too much too fast; you might miss the most important part if you continue to rush through the day. Virginia Woolf wrote, ""No need to hurry. No need to sparkle. No need to be anybody but oneself."""
scorpio,2017-01-14,"You're tired of putting your professional reputation on the line. You wish there was a way to engineer a retreat where you didn't have to face any responsibilities for a few days. Plan your great escape, whether it's a long vacation to an exotic location or a quick afternoon getaway to a local spa. But whatever you choose, it's essential to break your pattern and unplug for a while. Goethe wrote, ""We must always change, renew, rejuvenate ourselves; otherwise we harden."""
sagittarius,2017-01-14,"Walking on the sunny side of the street requires no extra effort today because the shade seems to magically disappear as you approach it. In fact, it feels like everything is coming up roses even in the middle of winter. Nevertheless, as Grateful Dead lyricist Robert Hunter wrote, ""When life looks like easy street, there is danger at your door."" Even the most perfect situation can unravel quickly if no one is attending to the details. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure."
capricorn,2017-01-14,"Although you don't necessarily like it when anything or anyone gets in the way of your productivity, it's nearly impossible to compartmentalize your feelings today. Thankfully, you won't likely be overwhelmed now as waves of compassion open your heart to the plight of those less fortunate. Nevertheless, your current hypersensitivity requires some time management, especially if your to-do list continues to grow. Elbert Hubbard wrote, ""Do not take life too seriously. You will never get out of it alive."""
aquarius,2017-01-14,"You might need to put some personal space between you and another individual today if it feels like you're losing control of your boundaries. You aren't confident that you're reading the current situation correctly, but you're not ready to handle someone else's state of perpetual greed. There's no point in trying to reason with those who won't listen. It's healthier to disengage from a toxic interaction and walk alone than to follow a crowd going in the wrong direction."
pisces,2017-01-14,"You can't let down your guard today until you meet your obligations. Fortunately, you're blessed with an abundance of energy so don't procrastinate while the cosmos is working on your behalf. However, your fantasy life might be running on overdrive now, distracting you from your responsibilities. You could derive great inspiration from your imagination if you stay conscious enough to know the difference between dreams and reality. Believe it or not, cultivating your creativity and demonstrating your integrity can be done at the same time."
aries,2017-01-15,"Responsibilities seem to keep piling up and they won't go away until you decide to face them once and for all. Nevertheless, you're distracted by your fantasies and might try to cleverly delay your obligations a little while longer. Unfortunately, this tactic of procrastination will likely backfire today; it makes more sense to bite the bullet and resign yourself to a day of karmic catch-up. For now, heed the words of author Peter Drucker: ""Never mind your happiness; do your duty."""
taurus,2017-01-15,"You are looking at the world through a very practical lens today, motivating you to find satisfaction by achieving substantial results. People may marvel at your positive attitude because they know they would complain if they had your row to hoe. But you're willing, even eager, to do whatever it takes if your work influences your peers to shine their lights in the darkness. Applying your creativity for the good of all makes your heart smile and inspires others to follow in your footsteps."
gemini,2017-01-15,"Sometimes spending the day at home is a way to escape from the real world. But there are plenty of projects to finish and you're happy to have the breathing room to tie up loose ends. Mundane household chores are at the top of your to-do list. Oddly enough, focusing on physical activities frees your mind to meander in your daydreams. If you concentrate on one thing at a time, you will be amazed by how much you can accomplish with a short burst of willpower. Channel your energy constructively and your productivity will increase dramatically."
cancer,2017-01-15,"You like the idea of free-floating through the day without anything on your schedule. Nevertheless, creating an agenda enables you to make the most of your time. It may seem counter-intuitive to allocate space on your calendar for rest and recreation, but it's wise to relinquish your resistance to organizing everything in advance. Even if you deviate from your initial arrangement, planning in advance gives you the widest range of choices. Prepare for the road ahead, even if it's just leading to the playground or the couch."
leo,2017-01-15,"You have a hundred different money-making ideas running around in your head, but turning any one item into tangible income is an entirely different story. Unfortunately, the gulf between your fertile imagination and boring reality seems too wide to cross today. Nevertheless, building bridges between the present moment and your future aspirations starts with a thought. As Gloria Steinem correctly noted, ""Dreaming, after all, is a form of planning."""
virgo,2017-01-15,"You long for consistency but it is elusive today, nonetheless. Your efforts to stabilize your emotions only adds energy to their uncertainty. Nearly everything in your world seems to be in flux while the evocative Moon is camping out in your sign. It can be tiring to keep up with your never-ending mood swings now, but even more exhausting if you try to control them. Tides change, feelings change, perspectives change. It's part of the natural process; take a deep breath and just go with the flow."
libra,2017-01-15,"You are a closet list-maker today, and will jump through hoops to prevent others from discovering your secret. Of course, there's nothing wrong with enumerating what you want, but your heart is set on showing everyone how much you're willing to compromise. You don't want to come across as controlling, so you might pretend you aren't attached to a particular outcome now. Paradoxically, your suppression of your real intentions is transparently obvious. The more you mask your need to have it your way, the more others will resist your ideas. Ben Franklin wrote, ""Honesty is the best policy."""
scorpio,2017-01-15,"You can see where your current path leads into the future and you're driven to modify it so it will take you exactly where you want to go. However, you might not possess as much accuracy as you wish and today's actions could profoundly impact your trajectory unless you consider all of your options first. Think twice and then think again; your impulsive changes have as-of-yet unseen consequences. Orator William Jennings Bryan said, ""Destiny is not a matter of chance. It is a matter of choice."""
sagittarius,2017-01-15,"You might get so hung up on the logistics of your plans today that you end up missing your opportunity to put them into motion. You are engaging in a familiar dance between using a telescope to aim at the distant horizon and a microscope to focus on the minutiae. Your current inclination is to handle all the details first, but you may grow frustrated when you keep slipping into daydreams and lose touch with your goals. President Barack Obama advises, ""If you're walking down the right path and you're willing to keep walking, eventually you'll make progress."""
capricorn,2017-01-15,"Your current idealism is like an itch that won't go away. Try as you might, making a practical plan is a real struggle today because your thoughts keep drifting toward chivalrous goals like protecting the environment or feeding the poor. However, your real problem isn't your altruism; it's about scale. Instead of trying to save the entire planet, start in your local community. Margaret Mead wrote, ""Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has."""
aquarius,2017-01-15,"Logic enables you to only get so far as you try to navigate your way through complex relationship dynamics today. Your emotions are warping your perspective and you realize that objectivity is nowhere to be found now. However, you don't know how to start a conversation about a subject that's a mystery to you. Fortunately, the moment is rife with opportunities to grow and learn more about your feelings. However, it takes courage to admit if you're floundering. Author James Thurber wrote, ""It is better to ask some of the questions than to know all of the answers."""
pisces,2017-01-15,"You may find yourself in an awkward position if people think you have more information in your possession than you do now. They could demand  specific details all they want today, but your feelings don't easily fit into words. It might seem as if others are leaning on you to manage their own discomfort with uncertainty. However, you can't squeeze water out of a stone and you just don't have a simple solution to give anyone. Shakespeare wrote, ""Expectation is the root of all heartache."""
aries,2017-01-16,"You can think of several reasons based upon personal experience why your present path won't lead you to success. You've been here before and you're in no mood to repeat the past. Nevertheless, a rare lunar opposition to pioneering Mars and painful Chiron could stop you in your tracks as you consider a current situation in light of a previous failure. Thankfully, you're willing to make a superhuman effort to reach your goals now. If you refuse to take no for an answer, your confidence returns quickly. The pieces are falling into place; however, it's up to you to race to the finish."
taurus,2017-01-16,"You might not realize that you're behaving badly now, yet your aggressive actions can elicit resistance from those around you. Your uncharacteristic impatience only exacerbates the situation when reactive Mars joins distressed Chiron in your 11th House of Groups. Your friends and coworkers may seem overly critical when they confront your stubborn insistence. Instead of walking away from interactions that don't match your expectations, remain open to what you could learn from others. Anthony de Mello wrote, ""Pleasant experiences make life delightful. Painful experiences lead to growth."""
gemini,2017-01-16,"You want to believe that your wishes can come true today, but instead you might turn into your own worst critic. Although you are less interested in the facts than in the possibilities of your dreams, the analytical Virgo Moon puts your fantasies through a wringer now. You may be frustrated if you throw in the towel too soon, so take as much time as you need to accomplish your goals. Florence Nightingale wrote, ""I attribute my success to this: I never gave or took any excuse."""
cancer,2017-01-16,"You may not be very happy today if circumstances rain on your plans. However, sometimes hearing no is a blessing in disguise, since practicing self-restraint can be helpful in the long run. Nevertheless, obstacles will fade if you apply what you learn in a methodical manner. Thankfully, you are strong on determination and endurance now, assuring that your actions will have the impact that you desire. Robert Collier wrote, ""Success is the sum of small efforts, repeated day in and day out."""
leo,2017-01-16,"Vulnerability runs rampant and could create negative dynamics today. Try not to take what you hear too personally or you may end up doubting your ability to succeed. There are many opportunities to soften your rhetoric or put your spirituality into action. On the other hand, you might waste precious energy chasing illusions. Don't be too sure of what you know; paradoxically, your strongest intentions are best expressed with flexibility and love."
virgo,2017-01-16,"A close friend or partner may misinterpret your behavior today, even if you meant to be of service. Impetuous Mars in your 7th House of Companions meets up with disorientated Chiron, muddling your actions and frustrating your intentions. Recalling an old emotional wound allows you to transform a light and easy relationship into one of much deeper significance. Psychologist Rollo May reminds you, ""Intimacy requires courage because risk is inescapable."""
libra,2017-01-16,"Don't even think about shutting down and running away if you run into disapproval from a coworker today. You must show up and face the music so you can overcome your own resistance that lingers from events in the past. Instead of letting yourself be thrown off track by a reluctant colleague, take stock of your needs and commit to doing what's necessary to succeed. You may not see quick results, but you will eventually be rewarded for your patience, persistence and clear sense of purpose."
scorpio,2017-01-16,"Expressing your feelings is easier now that superhero Mars is hanging out in your 5th House of Love and Creativity. You're particularly eager to be in the spotlight today, but you could exhaust yourself if you don't heed sensible limits. Nevertheless, you're not likely to admit that you could be running low on energy or lacking sleep. You may put someone off if you overcompensate and act in a pushy manner. Author Joseph Chilton Pearce wrote, ""To live a creative life, we must lose our fear of being wrong."""
sagittarius,2017-01-16,"You need to get a tight grip on your passion today, so you can apply it effectively to obtain what you want. Thankfully, you're able to objectively look at your most fundamental assumptions as a healing Mars-Chiron conjunction focuses powerful energy in your 4th House of Foundations. Channel negativity into positive action for the best results. J.P. Guilford wrote, ""The ultimate solutions to problems are rational; the process of finding them is not."""
capricorn,2017-01-16,"You are hypersensitive today but, thankfully, your intuition is right on target. However, the cosmos demands your patience before you're allowed to translate your new awareness into language that others can understand. Thankfully, there are so many opportunities for sensual delights, you don't need to jump at the first one that catches your eye. Although you are excited about your new perspective, it might take some getting used to before you fully trust reality again."
aquarius,2017-01-16,"You could feel disheartened by memories of a hurtful situation that comes around to haunt you from your past. However, this cosmic bottleneck may actually be a blessing if it forces you to explore the deep oceans of your imagination. Take a chance and ride the expressive tide instead of standing on the shore clinging to your unsubstantiated fears. If you are struggling to embark on this adventure alone, ask a trustworthy friend to join you. No road is too long or too circuitous when you have a good traveling companion by your side."
pisces,2017-01-16,"Your insecurities are swimming very close to the surface today, increasing your desire to be around people you can trust. A conflict in a relationship reveals how to work through issues of authority and control in an effective manner. Although talking in vague generalities won't move you any closer to resolution, neither will arguing over isolated points of contention. Fortunately, making careful choices now, rather than attempting to take giant steps, enables you to shape the future you want."
aries,2017-01-17,"A minor argument at work can develop into a messy situation that ultimately has very little to do with a real difference of opinion. You might overreact to something that's said because your feelings are hurt. In fact, your subjectivity could prompt you to respond with an overly emotional defense that throws gasoline onto the smoldering coals of disagreement. Nevertheless, self-awareness is the best preventative medicine for inflammatory remarks. Author Jarod Kintz wrote, ""Opportunity seldom rises with blood pressure."""
taurus,2017-01-17,"You are highly attuned to your coworkers today and try to do everything in your power to meet their expectations. Thankfully, you are motivated by your need to be of service to others, so your focus is pretty straightforward. Although you could fall into the trap of thinking too small, it's prudent to develop more visionary strategies now. Don't be afraid to take a risk. Making someone angry with your position may be necessary to initiate an honest dialogue. Magic only occurs when you're willing to shake things up."
gemini,2017-01-17,"You are out to demonstrate your strength of purpose, which runs counter to everyone's expectations today. Unfortunately, you might feel disappointed if you can't find someone to match your depth. Instead of waiting for the right person to show up and wave a magic wand, jump in and start cultivating an existing relationship by building bridges instead of walls. Theologian James Freeman Clarke wrote, ""Strong convictions precede great actions."""
cancer,2017-01-17,"You're not very interested in going out to change the world today. In fact, if you had your druthers, you would have the world come to you. However, you might end up feeling isolated if you sink deeper into your emotional safety zone. But don't waste this opportunity to reflect on your personal life or even look back over larger reaches of family history. What you discover while exploring these inner worlds is magically projected onto the outer realms. Lao Tzu wrote, ""Knowing others is wisdom; knowing yourself is enlightenment."""
leo,2017-01-17,"Communication is not based upon factual information now; instead, stories are invented by each of the involved parties. Fortunately, you bring a perfect balance of intrigue, character and drama to the show. Although you might receive a healthy dose of cosmic support, others still seem to remain unconvinced today. It's nearly impossible to lead with your emotions while presenting an objective perspective. Psychologist Alfred Adler wrote, ""Follow your heart but take your brain with you."""
virgo,2017-01-17,"It appears as if you're on a mission today, so it's crucial to make sure you know exactly where you are heading. For all intents and purposes, you cannot begin your journey until you have a specific destination in mind. Although you may be driven by spiritual pursuit, your goals might be less lofty. In fact, attending to mundane matters like shoring up your finances is a good place to start. Avoid making decisions of any kind based solely on your emotions. If you want to manifest your dreams, the first thing you have to do is wake up."
libra,2017-01-17,"You may open your heart wide today, yet you're also emotionally demanding of others. One thing is clear: your subjectivity can get in the way of making the most sensible choices. Unfortunately, discerning a common goal is complicated if neither party wants to compromise. It's one thing to have strength in your convictions, but quite another to be arbitrarily stubborn. Motivational speaker Jim Rohn said, ""Adopt the attitude that everything is negotiable. A world of opportunity will greet you."""
scorpio,2017-01-17,"You don't need a second invitation when the cosmos tells you it's time to go on a mini-retreat to reinvigorate your creativity. At first, you might receive nothing but negativity when you share your plans with people who should be your best supporters. But don't pause long enough to feel hurt; keeping the energy in motion helps it find the most direct route to satisfaction. Sugar Ray Robinson said, ""To be a champ, you have to believe in yourself when nobody else will."""
sagittarius,2017-01-17,"You could easily live up to your reputation as a social animal today. People may be distracted by your outgoing personality and your willingness to say yes to nearly any fun idea that pops up now. Nevertheless, your internal stress tells a different tale. You might be arguing with yourself as you try to reach the most sensible conclusion. Fortunately, your popularity will not suffer if you have the courage to say no, explain your position and stand firm in your beliefs."
capricorn,2017-01-17,"It's as if you're living in a glass house and everyone in the neighborhood is watching your every move. But you don't really have time to talk to every passerby about the secret parts of your life. Unfortunately, people seem to focus on what you do, rather than who you are. Break through the old ways of relating to one another by starting a conversation where each person reveals something about his or her own heart. Intimacy is not limited to the physical; it's the act of connecting with someone so deeply that you can see into their soul."
aquarius,2017-01-17,"Although a new friend might walk into your life today, you must remain open to how the relationship develops. If you're not careful, your preconceived notions may be enough to ward off a potential interaction before it even occurs. But you are exploring new territory now, and could lack the confidence you possess when you're standing on more familiar ground. Sometimes, life is a gamble; you will only achieve your dreams if you're willing to take a calculated risk."
pisces,2017-01-17,"You're torn between scheduling activities with your friends and isolating yourself so you can get back to work to meet your obligations. But you're not happy with either of these choices today and may strive for something right down the middle. Unfortunately, following a more moderate path conveys to others that you can't make up your mind. However, this isn't about being wishy-washy. Avoiding both extremes might be a difficult decision, yet it's the only one that's worth pursuing now."
aries,2017-01-18,"You may be convinced that pretty much anything is possible today. However, it could be tough to balance your outrageous dreams with a more pragmatic approach to life. Frustration can get in the way of your happiness when assertive Mars tangles with excessive Jupiter, forcing you to increase your efficiency and narrow your vision. Nevertheless, it's not a good idea to settle for less; even if there are practical issues to address, they could be critical steps propelling you to the stars. Work steadily and consistently if you want the rewards to follow."
taurus,2017-01-18,"Keep your eyes on the ball since precision control of your actions is crucial now that energetic Mars bounces off giant Jupiter. Missteps in matters of the heart, complications with children and glitches in creative projects are possible. Still, you can avoid the unexpected by consciously channeling the urgency you feel into your work. Minimize your distractions and concentrate on the task at hand. Managing your emotions allows you to make a powerful impression in a low-key manner."
gemini,2017-01-18,"Themes of expansion and contraction make it hard to find the right mix between too much and not enough. You may be required to temper your excitement about the future because of the demands of a more immediate situation involving your home or family. The most extreme plan can work now if you take it one solid step at a time. Nevertheless, standing on the edge of something big is both thrilling and nerve-racking. Integrate the small changes day by day so you don't get overwhelmed and walk away. Fear looks, faith jumps."
cancer,2017-01-18,"You may rush ahead and take unnecessary risks today, but impulsive actions only remind you that you do better when you consider your words and actions first. Warrior Mars rams into a clunky alignment with bombastic Jupiter, possibly inciting an argument or leading you in the wrong direction. It might not be easy to manage your intensity now, yet limiting the scope of your endeavors and tempering your language allow you to apply your passions more productively. George Lucas teaches, ""Always remember, your focus determines your reality."""
leo,2017-01-18,"Everything you fix today seems to create new problems, like the mythical many-headed Hydra. Your I-can-do-it attitude may backfire now, even if you have the best of intentions when superhero Mars misaligns with overblown Jupiter. Don't get sidetracked by the immediate effects of your behavior; just keep making the necessary adjustments until you're back on your feet and on solid ground. Nelson Mandela said, ""After climbing a great hill, one only finds that there are many more hills to climb."""
virgo,2017-01-18,"Relationships may be a source of irritation today because you can't find enough clarity on the problem in order to resolve it. Something doesn't feel quite right, yet the closer it is to you, the more elusive it becomes. Although you're willing to do almost anything, the solution continues to slip through your hands. Ironically, answers come when you stop asking questions. The simple act of shifting your attention elicits the resolution you seek. As psychiatrist Viktor Frankel wrote, ""When we are no longer able to change a situation, we are challenged to change ourselves."""
libra,2017-01-18,"You might feel as if you're dancing in the dark today, uncertain of your next step. You may think you need more time to evaluate your options while reactive Mars creates a nagging aspect with auspicious Jupiter. It seems as if any choice you make now isn't the right one. Fortunately, Mercury in strategic Capricorn comes through with a sound plan that gives you the benefit of the doubt. Trust your dreams, even if the possibilities before you appear limited. Your horizons will continue to broaden as long as you keep hope alive."
scorpio,2017-01-18,"You can breathe a welcome sigh of relief if love and creativity are flowing more freely today. But imagination is not an escape from reality; it's a window to a more wondrous world that is within your reach. An exciting Mars-Jupiter connection produces colorful fireworks, distracting you from your regular duties. However, a petty disagreement could suddenly burst into flames of fury now, so do your best to avoid direct confrontation. Anything can happen in the heat of the moment. Staying neutral gives you time to take what you need and let go of the rest."
sagittarius,2017-01-18,"Managing your energy wisely seems like an impossible task today, especially if you are swept up by a wave of enthusiasm. Nevertheless, armed with a grand idea, you're ready to take on the world as you battle for survival. Unfortunately, self-righteousness could instigate a war of words that prevents you from reaching your goals. Stick to the facts and sidestep unnecessary conflict based upon mere differences of opinion. Joyce Meyer wrote, ""Patience is not the ability to wait, but how you act while you're waiting."""
capricorn,2017-01-18,"Orderly thought and decisive action make perfect sense to a calculating Mountain Goat. However, action-planet Mars crosses paths with indulgent Jupiter, leading you on a wild goose chase or sparking misplaced anger. You may believe that you need to react immediately or things will quickly grow out of control today. Nevertheless, a moment of self-restraint in the midst of an emotional exchange could save you many moments of regret later on."
aquarius,2017-01-18,"You may benefit from redirecting your energy today if you hope to find resolution to a lingering conflict. Normally, you're more than willing to attack a complex problem head-on. However, maintaining your focus is difficult when contentious Mars goads boisterous Jupiter, sending you off on a wild ride. Delicately dancing around an argument now reduces tension, saving wear and tear on both you and your relationships. You can always reengage in negotiation after the drama subsides, but don't wait too long. Virginia Woolf wrote, ""You cannot find peace by avoiding life."""
pisces,2017-01-18,"You're itching for action as your wanderlust continues to grow, but somehow your goals become less specific over time. It's hard to tell today whether you're making concrete plans or just idly watching the clouds roll by. Thankfully, there's no need to struggle now; your best bet is to postpone big decisions until you are clear about your direction. In the meantime, try a bit of escapist fare as purposeful Mars skids into an awkward misalignment with joyful Jupiter. Edgar Allan Poe wrote, ""They who dream by day are cognizant of many things which escape those who dream only by night."""
aries,2017-01-19,"Although you may be anticipating the future with great enthusiasm, you are also acutely aware of the hard work that needs to be done. But meeting your obligations isn't enough; you are holding yourself to higher standards now and must surpass everyone's expectations. Purpose and discipline are essential as hard-driving Mars is blocked by authoritative Saturn. Thankfully, following the rules could produce immediate positive feedback. Patiently adhering to a well-defined plan establishes a strong foundation that provides enduring support for your long-term goals."
taurus,2017-01-19,"You are eager to turn your big ideas into reality, but logistics require you to wait before putting your plan into motion. But rather than  giving up, make necessary modifications without abandoning the best parts of your overall strategy. Your frustration could reach critical mass today when impulsive Mars crosses paths with nay-saying Saturn. Nevertheless, continue to make small changes without losing control of your temper. Your drive for fame and fortune can get out of hand unless you practice restraint. Remember, short-term victories won't necessarily assure long-term success."
gemini,2017-01-19,"You are working with a very small margin of error now, so be vigilant in your actions and noble in your intentions to get it right. Pushing harder won't be of much help when macho Mars runs into Saturn's wall of resistance, but being smarter will. Narrowing your focus and acting with discipline enables you to move ahead with the projects that count the most. Proper preparation empowers you to break new ground where others can't."
cancer,2017-01-19,"You will know if you recently overstepped your bounds by the severity of challenges you face today. An industrious Mars-Saturn square demands your immediate attention as it stresses your 6th House of Logistics. If difficult driving conditions require you to apply the brakes, do so willingly before anyone asks twice. Your resentment will show if you respond reluctantly and others will be even less supportive of your efforts. Sharing your ideas of success might arouse resistance but all that truly matters is your level of commitment."
leo,2017-01-19,"Plenty of concentration and effort are necessary now to make any measurable progress. Although you would love to take some time off, a karmic Mars-Saturn square reminds you that hard work leads to precious rewards. However, it seems as if stern Saturn's presence allows no room for bad judgment calls, so carefully choose how and where you push the limits. Nevertheless, as legendary coach Vince Lombardi said, ""Perfection is not attainable, but if we chase perfection we can catch excellence."""
virgo,2017-01-19,"You might be at odds with your partner or a family member while harsh Saturn squares contentious Mars in your 7th House of Relationships. However, you can't afford to waste time in a childish quarrel now. To the contrary, you need to take the most responsible course of action to set an example for everyone else. Paradoxically, trying too hard to fix things will only make matters worse. Instead, apply your consistent positive attitude toward improving your game. Switching your focus to a non-adversarial mode can make all the difference in the world."
libra,2017-01-19,"Dealing with complex emotional issues isn't necessarily a walk in the park today. Unfortunately, you might not have a choice as reality requires you to face a hard fact that was previously hidden from view. Nevertheless, awareness means little without action, and a stressful Mars square to karmic Saturn reveals where to concentrate your efforts now. If you can avoid the rush to instant gratification, you'll be rewarded with greater satisfaction down the road."
scorpio,2017-01-19,"There is a reason if your progress is blocked by circumstances that seem to be out of your control today. It's likely the universe is telling you to reassess your current resources before moving ahead. Unfortunately, your annoyance may escalate while combative Mars squares bossy Saturn in your 2nd House of Self-Worth. Although you might believe that you are in the right, you're still better off cooling your heels rather than fighting your way forward. Calmly handle each situation as it arises and you will be proceeding toward your goals once again before you know it."
sagittarius,2017-01-19,"Reality reins you in now and you probably won't like having your wings clipped if you recently took an issue too far. Although you can't fly freely today, retreating won't help the situation either. The stress from assertive Mars' dynamic square to repressive Saturn in your sign can be irritating, especially if you're itching for a little adventure. But it's not useful to blindly ignore the signs; instead, postpone any new activities until you address the current blockages. If you are persistent without forcing the issue, the resistance will play out on its own."
capricorn,2017-01-19,"A reckless friend might encourage you to cut corners today or to make a questionable claim. Unfortunately, there's a good chance of getting caught even if someone else gets away with murder. Militant Mars in your 3rd House of Immediate Environment squares strict Saturn, demanding that you follow the letter of the law. Integrity is essential since your willingness to do things the right way -- even if it's the hard way -- will not only keep you out of trouble, but actually saves you time and effort in the long run. Helen Keller wrote, ""There are no shortcuts to any place worth going."""
aquarius,2017-01-19,"You bring a hefty helping of cheerful optimism to the table, but your high expectations might not survive another round of setbacks. Even the best-laid plans require revision when reckless Mars slams into a roadblock created by unforgiving Saturn. The warrior planet fuels your impatience and cajoles you to blast your way through any obstacles. Stopping to modify your methods may be infuriating, but it greatly multiplies your chances for success."
pisces,2017-01-19,"It's no fun when you experience a frustrating day at work. Unfortunately, you must wait a little longer before initiating action while enterprising Mars in your sign squares off with show-stopper Saturn. Thankfully, Saturn blesses your 10th House of Career with an extra dose of persistence that improves your odds for victory. Although you might need to apply the emergency brake, your speedy response prevents you from creating a disaster. Ignoring the signs is a good way to end up at the wrong destination. Following your intuition almost always steers you right."
aries,2017-01-20,"Listen carefully to your inner voice, especially when it encourages you to follow your dreams. Fortunately, you're ready to do whatever it takes to reach your professional goals while resourceful Venus in your 12th House of Destiny supports ruthless Pluto in your 10th House of Career. Don't doubt any decisions you make at this time for your logic is sounder than you think. Your chances for success improve greatly now, as long as you are motivated by the stirrings of your heart."
taurus,2017-01-20,"You are quite insistent when it comes to getting your message across and you won't let anything stand in the way of achieving your goals. Pleasure-seeking Venus sextiles obsessive Pluto, intensifying your desires today and making you more likely to express your needs. The strength of your feelings prompts you to search for emotional satisfaction. However, choosing security over transient romance now does not mean giving up your chance to experience deeper passion. Jessica Walsh writes, ""Do the work that feeds your soul and not your ego."""
gemini,2017-01-20,"There are positive vibrations in the air today, elevating you to the top of your game. However, the music of the spheres has a deep bass note that pulls your energy downward and inward. Although you are often attracted to lighter tones, magnetic Venus forms a supportive sextile to regenerative Pluto in your 8th House of Transformation, setting the stage for a profound metamorphosis. Whatever you do, don't quit before the miracle happens."
cancer,2017-01-20,"Your newfound self-sufficiency allows you to withdraw deeper into your shell today. Fortunately, you are tapping into powerful emotional issues that can teach you something valuable about yourself. People may think you are retreating as an act of rebellion, but it's just your way of forcing them to show their cards. There's no need to explain your motives now; execute your strategy and your determination will be rewarded. Work hard in silence; let your success be your noise."
leo,2017-01-20,"Relationship dynamics grab your attention today, requiring that you put everything else on the back burner. You clearly see the value of one-on-one discussions as passionate Pluto aligns with loving Venus in your 8th House of Regeneration. Thankfully, you can turn an adversary into an ally or revive a faltering relationship while you are channeling this cosmic support. Go out on a limb and trust the process; change starts in your heart."
virgo,2017-01-20,"You possess the skills to handle delicate matters gracefully today, especially if a revealing conversation touches sensitive issues. An insightful Venus-Pluto sextile intensifies passions and increases your capacity to heal damaged alliances. However, you can't be effective while you're safely ensconced behind a protective wall. You must be willing to jump in and get your hands dirty in the process. Luckily, you may be given an opportunity to reap the rewards of your persistence if your intentions are in the right place."
libra,2017-01-20,"Your judgment is excellent today, especially when it comes to discovering hidden value that others overlook. Your sixth sense is attuned to the best deals you can find as a cooperative Venus-Pluto sextile heightens your perception and deepens your wisdom. Nevertheless, you must be persistent in your analysis if you want to uncover the truth. Expressing your emotions honestly can save a relationship that seems to have lost its way. John Lennon said, ""It matters not who you love, where you love, why you love, when you love, or how you love. It matters only that you love."""
scorpio,2017-01-20,"Take every opportunity to make deeper emotional connections today, for a heart-to-heart conversation possesses enough substance to withstand the tests of time. You can experience love that truly matters while romantic Venus is supported by passionate Pluto. Whether it's personal or business affairs you must manage, you are extremely effective as long as you're willing to accept the outer responsibilities while doing the inner work. Rumi wrote, ""With life as short as a half-taken breath, don't plant anything but love."""
sagittarius,2017-01-20,"Powerful passions motivate you to express your beliefs and to pursue them with calculated concentration. A sensual Venus-Pluto sextile adds a delicious dose of pleasure and savvy social skills to the mix today. You're driven to achieve your aims, but you are also tempted to take the easy way out and amuse yourself by entertaining friends and colleagues. Instead of seeking greener pastures, stay right where you are now and explore the emotional richness of your immediate environment. Building on what you already have might be the adventure you've been searching for all along."
capricorn,2017-01-20,"You may need to dig deep to find true meaning today. Loving Venus forms a supportive sextile with relentless Pluto, enabling you to cut to the chase in a relationship. Fortunately, you can also reduce waste in your financial dealings if you are willing to reexamine the bottom line. Small but solid steps will take you as far as you want to go, but giant leaps forward will only leave you hanging out on a limb. Progress has much less to do with speed than it does with direction."
aquarius,2017-01-20,"Carefully examine the professional opportunities around you now since you might just have the proverbial pick of the litter. A favorable Venus-Pluto aspect clarifies your needs, empowers you to eliminate wasteful distractions and urges you to focus on activities that bring you the greatest rewards. Fortunately, you're capable of looking beyond short-term issues and seeing the long-range potential that's still waiting in the distance. Patience pays off, all but guaranteeing the enduring significance of whatever you choose to undertake at this time."
pisces,2017-01-20,"You are busy cleverly exploring new ways to find the resources you need to make your dreams come true. You are blessed with a magical diplomatic touch now that the planet of love is moving through your sign. Additionally, you are empowered to seize the day when gracious Venus receives assistance from fierce Pluto. Take advantage of your current ability to maximize an opportunity and stick with your commitment until you reach your goals. Tenacity is your friend."
aries,2017-01-21,"You are at ease with your emotions today and willing to stretch into new territory by sharing your inner process with someone you trust. But you're not just interested in reporting your feelings; you're hopeful that you'll learn something valuable in the exchange. However, you might want to bail when the conversation takes an unexpected turn. Nevertheless, your perseverance will be rewarded. Robert Frost wrote, ""The best way out is always through."""
taurus,2017-01-21,"You might think you're missing something important today because people's actions don't seem to align with their words. It's disconcerting when you can't trust your own senses, but the disparity may be in your logic rather than in someone else's behavior. Instead of spending time trying to find the missing puzzle pieces, just accept the paradox as part of the picture. Some mysteries don't need analytical solutions. Poet Mary Oliver writes, ""Keep some room in your heart for the unimaginable."""
gemini,2017-01-21,"Although you're ready to swing into action as if you have all the answers, you're not surprised when you realize you need to refine your strategy. Fortunately, you're eager to accept new information, even if it means your initial plans must be scrapped. People like to be around you today because they are entertained by your mental agility; you gracefully change horses in midstream without getting wet. Every day holds new magic if you're willing to adapt to the evolving circumstances."
cancer,2017-01-21,"Sometimes you are so wrapped up in your emotions that you don't even see how they are coloring your perceptions. Be wary of clinging to hurt feelings from the past because they can prevent you from experiencing the beauty of the present moment. It has been said that holding onto anger is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die. A negative mind will never give you a positive life. Mother Theresa taught, ""If we really want to love, we must learn how to forgive."""
leo,2017-01-21,"You may act as if everything is copacetic today, but you're likely suppressing feelings you don't want to acknowledge. Unfortunately, your friends and family can see right through your veneer. They might not know the specifics of your emotional disconnection, but they'll fill in the missing information with their best guesses. The bad news is people won't get it right unless you tell them the truth. You aren't required to fake a smile if you don't feel it. Thankfully, once you come clean, that elusive happy face could return on its own."
virgo,2017-01-21,"You want to count on the support of others today, but you can't get a clear reading on their intentions. Asking for help seems to be out of the question when you're afraid of being rejected. Nevertheless, there's no way to test the water without jumping in to see what happens. Although revealing your vulnerability isn't easy, the answer is automatically no until you lay your cards out on the table. Playing it safe is risky business."
libra,2017-01-21,"You won't likely share your action plan with anyone else today. Your quiet self-confidence could quickly vanish as soon as you open your mouth to talk about your ideas. It's best to just get on with your work; you don't owe anyone a detailed explanation of your methods. Accomplishing your goals is a simpler task when you're not on center stage in everyone's line of vision. Abraham Lincoln said, ""Don't worry when you are not recognized, but strive to be worthy of recognition."""
scorpio,2017-01-21,"Your secretive nature is at home in this emotionally charged planetary landscape. You correctly believe that it's better for everyone involved if you cool your passions now and process your feelings on your own. Impulsively expressing your thoughts will likely produce a high shock value, but won't go far toward settling the energy. Fortunately, you're no stranger to transforming your extreme perspectives into ones that are more acceptable to others. Gandhi said, ""Be the change you wish to see in the world."""
sagittarius,2017-01-21,"You might like to hide out at an undisclosed location today. You need some space away from the maddening distractions of life and a spiritual retreat will do the trick. It's not about how much alone time you get as long as you can separate yourself from your regular routine. But don't let your rejuvenating escape turn into a long-term absence. Flow with the emotional currents and let them carry you where they will, while waiting for the opportunity to make magic."
capricorn,2017-01-21,"You're on a straightforward mission today, but your psychic radar keeps receiving alien instructions that help you to navigate through parallel universes. Unfortunately, these higher dimensions don't manifest here on Earth, leaving you confused as to which way to turn next in the real world. Fortunately, human intervention is more useful now than high-tech tools. Your friends will surprise you with exactly the information you need; all you must do is listen."
aquarius,2017-01-21,"You may extend your authority today and take control of a situation that's beginning to flounder. Although you can be quite domineering now, others won't seem to mind; in fact, they welcome your guidance since you actually appear to know what's going on. Your charisma might be so disarming that people step forward to offer their assistance. Your intuition is accurate now and nearly everyone has the wisdom to trust your judgments. Step forward and be the leader you would like to follow."
pisces,2017-01-21,"You are in your watery element today as you swim through the dark uncharted depths of your subconscious. Although you cannot see what's ahead of you, your psychic sense is functioning on full-strength and fills in the details as you go along. Nevertheless, you still might be happily surprised when you end up somewhere very different than you expected. Poet W.B. Yeats wrote, ""The world is full of magic things, patiently waiting for our senses to grow sharper."""
aries,2017-01-22,"You want everyone to come along for the ride today because it's more fun when you share your excitement with others. Although your enthusiasm is contagious, your energy could be too much for some people to handle. In fact, they may grow weary of your hyperboles, hesitant to trust your exaggerated interpretations of the current potential. Fortunately, toning down your optimism makes your dreams seem possible and inspires others to do their best. American revolutionary Thomas Paine wrote, ""Moderation in temper is always a virtue; but moderation in principles is always a vice."""
taurus,2017-01-22,"Your desire to deepen the level of communication with a close friend or intimate partner today motivates you to say things you might normally keep secret. You might startle others with your direct approach, but they will likely be receptive to your message if you give them enough time to adjust to your straightforwardness. Executing your agenda could make you less aware of someone else's boundaries, but the simple act of demonstrating respect builds stronger trust in the relationship. Dare to express what's in your heart."
gemini,2017-01-22,"Oftentimes, people can't keep up with your pace because it seems like you're all over the map. However, you're apt to slow down and focus on one task at a time today since the idea of working with someone else sounds extremely appealing. The Moon's visit to your 7th House of Relationships shifts your focus from your personal desires to the needs of others. Unfortunately, you still may have problems if you say yes to everyone about everything they want to do. Your happiness is not dependent upon following every whim."
cancer,2017-01-22,"It's self-empowering to believe that you can accomplish anything you set your mind to today. However, you might grow frustrated when everything takes longer than you planned. Thankfully, preventing problems in your schedule is much easier than it is to fix them after the fact. Allow extra time for each task now; managing your calendar wisely saves you from unnecessary headaches later in the day. Proactive measures produce the best results."
leo,2017-01-22,"The more commitments you make today, the less happy you are about them. The extravagant Sagittarius Moon activates your 5th House of Spontaneity, motivating you to seek play over work, even if there are unfinished chores on your to-do list.  Thankfully, fulfilling your obligations won't necessarily kill your fun. If you decide to shift your priorities in favor of a little recreation, at least inform those affected of your plans. Most importantly, remember to return later and deliver on your promises if you want to maintain your integrity."
virgo,2017-01-22,"If life's busyness is finally catching up with you, it's time to set some boundaries and claim your slice of the fun. However, you're not likely interested in going out to play while the Moon is traveling through your 4th House of Security. Be honest when telling others what you want today, even if your preference is to hide out away from the noise of the world. If you're feeling at loose ends, start a project around the house or invite a friend over for some meaningful conversation. There's no place like home."
libra,2017-01-22,"Your restlessness could get the best of you now unless you figure out how to channel it productively. There are many things that need your attention, yet you find it quite daunting to actually make a plan. The Moon's current visit to your 3rd House of Short Trips can entice you to make a quick run to the store or head out for a short walk just to shake up the energy. Cut yourself some slack if you're not making measurable progress. If you can't concentrate today, it's probably smarter to call it quits and pick up where you left off tomorrow."
scorpio,2017-01-22,"You're tempted to purchase a luxury item today that's been on your radar for a while. Fortunately, a new wave of confidence has you riding high enough to think about spending money on something special. The buoyant Sagittarius Moon energizes your 2nd House of Self-Worth, adding to your optimism about your income potential. Before doing something you might soon regret, it's wiser to see how you feel about this expenditure in a few days. Anything worth having is worth waiting for."
sagittarius,2017-01-22,"You're likely to take an emotional risk today by sharing your feelings before thinking about the consequences. You are in touch with your vulnerability while the receptive Moon hangs out in your sign all day. But revealing your heart -- your needs and fears -- is only one half of the relationship equation. True intimacy requires mutual respect, so invite the other person to speak his or her truth also. Listen in such a way that people love to confide in you."
capricorn,2017-01-22,"Keeping your optimism to yourself may seem like a waste of good energy, but it probably is the wisest course of action today. Your cheerful certainty about what you plan to accomplish in the upcoming weeks could offend others who don't share in your confidence. Fortunately, your diplomatic skills serve you well now, as long as you remember that there are many paths to the same destination. Allowing everyone the room to come to their own conclusions at their own pace avoids unnecessary conflict."
aquarius,2017-01-22,"You don't want to be alone today and may spend extra energy surrounding yourself with friends who will be there when you need them. The adventurous Sagittarius Moon is traveling through your 11th House of Community, making you eager to share your dreams with those you admire. Luckily, you can set the mood and create the social event you crave. Although a party sounds perfect for cultivating camaraderie, an intimate gathering might make more sense. Vulnerability is the most reliable bridge to building strong connections."
pisces,2017-01-22,"You are quite opinionated today and are easily lured into an intense conversation about social issues. Although defending your beliefs with unwavering passion might feel exhilarating in the moment, an argument won't necessarily have a positive outcome. Your unique point of view may inspire others, but it can also anger them if you become self-righteous. Share your visions without restraint, but do it in a way so that others feel comfortable also sharing theirs. Respect is a two-way street."
aries,2017-01-23,"Separating realistic objectives from impossible dreams is such a challenge now that you might just give up before you start. The good news is that your mental wanderings revitalize your spirit, motivating you to attempt something extraordinary today. However, the bad news sets in when you feel discouraged because you fall short of your lofty expectations. Nevertheless, reaching higher leads to greater achievements. Thankfully, you can set multiple goals -- a minimum that you must accomplish and a maximum that encourages you further. Strive for progress, not perfection."
taurus,2017-01-23,"You might believe that your social and professional relationships are in fine shape, only to realize that you jumped to an incorrect conclusion about someone's feelings. Don't get defensive if new information contradicts your previous assumptions. You are being offered an opportunity to expand your emotional spectrum today, and it would be a shame if you missed it because of a bruised ego. Sometimes you wish others would widen their limited perspectives. Now you have the chance to do the same. Opening your mind lets wisdom enter."
gemini,2017-01-23,"You could get into an argument with someone about your divergent goals today. But things are not as they sound in the heat of the moment. If you both try to prove the other person wrong, the conflict will escalate because there won't be a clear winner. However, if you each take a few deep breaths and actually listen to what is being said, you might realize the differences are not as great as they seemed. In fact, it's the lack of clarity that creates the gulf now, not the specifics. Find common ground and work from there without trying to sway the final outcome."
cancer,2017-01-23,"Your analysis of a current strategy may lead you through some tricky territory today. Your grasp of the big picture is quite sound, but you could run into trouble when you try to turn your conceptual framework into a concrete plan. Although the Sagittarius Moon enables you to see the world through a wide-angle lens, her visit to your 6th House of Details demands specifics. Rather than choosing one approach over the other now, keep going back and forth between the basic facts and your colorful imagination.  Walking with one foot in each world allows you to produce creative and sustainable ideas."
leo,2017-01-23,"You may be inspired or overwhelmed by irrepressible waves of compassion today. Honestly, it seems nearly impossible to create impenetrable boundaries to separate your feelings from those of other people. Your first reaction is to throw on your superhero costume and head out to save everyone. However, you could be left feeling an inconsolable disappointment when you remember that you're only mortal just like everyone else. Take heart; tiny steps lead to big changes."
virgo,2017-01-23,"You know exactly what needs to be done today and your good intentions get you off to an excellent start. However, you are so captivated by your own thoughts that you offer little resistance when they carry you off into fantastical dreamscapes. Unfortunately, your productivity might suffer due to your lack of concentration, but this mental detour may be worth the loss of work. Thankfully, there's no need to justify your imaginative wanderings now; after all, even Lao Tsu was on your side when he wrote, ""Meandering leads to perfection."""
libra,2017-01-23,"Your unusual approach to work today may baffle those around you. You're not trying to leave anyone in the lurch, but you might be so busy with your plans that you don't consider the consequences of your actions. The adventurous Sagittarius Moon seduces you into believing your personal escapades are more important than your routine responsibilities. You can pretend that everyone will accept your flighty behavior as a minor annoyance, but as photographer Robert Mapplethorpe cautioned, ""You're never going to get anywhere in life if you don't live up to your obligations."""
scorpio,2017-01-23,"You may convince yourself that your current goals are achievable but you could be living in an illusion of your own creation. Rather than waiting until your dream-bubble pops, it is prudent to preemptively make your way back to the basic facts today. After you reestablish your balance on terra firma, you can construct a new plan that's based on reality, not fantasy. Reassess your priorities and consider your choices carefully. Comedian Amy Poehler said, ""You attract the right things when you have a sense of who you are."""
sagittarius,2017-01-23,"You are unusually realistic when it comes to your dreams today. Perhaps you can already anticipate the looming conjunction of the buoyant Sagittarius Moon with weighty Saturn. Although the fear of failure may haunt you, it won't prevent you from mentally traveling to the far reaches of your imagination. Feel free to explore all the possibilities before initiating action in the three-dimensional world. Balance your highest aspirations with what's actually plausible and your decisions will produce lasting results."
capricorn,2017-01-23,"You are known to be a highly effective organizer and people rely on your natural proclivity for preparation. Ironically, you can accomplish more than you expect as long as you don't try to adhere to a tight schedule. It may seem counter-intuitive to think that a lack of planning could somehow make you more efficient now, but that's exactly what happens. It's not that your goals are unworthy of your best effort; it's just your most creative cooking today occurs when you are working without a recipe. As Internet pioneer Marc Andreessen claims, ""Adaptability is key."""
aquarius,2017-01-23,"You want to do things your way today, but could run into a wall of resistance if you stray too far from the norm. The good news is fear of judgment from your peers doesn't bother you at all now. You are sure that right is might and your plan will prevail. Unfortunately, you can sell yourself a bill of phony goods while trickster Mercury is conspiring with delusional Neptune. Check your facts and double-check your assumptions. Blogger William Chapman wrote, ""You can only fool reality until the truth comes knocking on your door."""
pisces,2017-01-23,"You harbor high hopes about what you wish to accomplish at work today, but you might have bitten off more than you can chew. The philosophical Sagittarius Moon blesses your 10th House of Career with big ideas while your inner idealist grows more attached to the outcome hour by hour. Fortunately, a practical friend may unexpectedly offer you unsolicited advice that gives you a new perspective about the role you are playing within your social sphere. Your actions have much greater consequences than you realize. Don't lose a diamond while chasing glitter."
aries,2017-01-24,"You don't like being told no, especially when you're riding a wave of enthusiasm. Nevertheless, there may be enough cosmic restraint to take the wind out of your sails today. Your response is more important than ever; you can pack up your ideas and call it quits. Or you could rise to the occasion and figure out why your progress is being tested. Winners are not people who never fail but people who never quit."
taurus,2017-01-24,"Your dogged persistence is your saving grace today as circumstances test your resolve. You quickly accept the fact that accomplishing your work won't be as simple now as you imagined. In fact, less determined people might just change courses or even throw in the towel. But not you; instead, you consider modifying your strategy in order to assimilate the changes around you. Don't let self-doubt creep into your reality; there's too much to do and you need every ounce of positivity you can muster. You are what you think."
gemini,2017-01-24,"Someone who has been a real ally of yours may turn on you today for no apparent reason. Your first inclination is to ignore the betrayal and just continue on in the same manner. Or, you might react defensively, fearful that their lack of support could be detrimental to your cause. However, a third response is actually your best bet. Uncover what caused the shift in the other person's thinking and then see what you can learn from your new perspective. Incorporating more points of view into your plan helps to ensure its success."
cancer,2017-01-24,"You might grow annoyed if you encounter a glitch in your day, especially if there's someone or something you can blame. But even if the cause of your trouble is obvious, you're likely to hold your anger close to your chest today. You may reason that nothing positive will come from an open conflict. Nevertheless, you're not interested in just letting the matter pass. Instead of getting mad, you decide to get even. As Frank Sinatra said, ""The best revenge is massive success."""
leo,2017-01-24,"You take it personally when something doesn't go your way now. It may feel as if someone is purposefully trying to rattle your cage to test your reactions. Regardless of anyone else's actions, the real lesson here is about your behavior and not theirs. Forget about trying to analyze why other people do what they do; concentrate on the path ahead of you. After you acknowledge a recent mistake, let it go. Author Maria Robinson wrote, ""Nobody can go back and start a new beginning, but anyone can start today and make a new ending."""
virgo,2017-01-24,"You can amaze your friends and fellow workers today by your ability to separate your feelings from the facts. While others might take a minor setback to heart, you're ready to review the problem, reassess your options and do better next time. Although you may do an internal dance with self-doubt, you won't let it negatively influence your performance. Motivational coach Ralph Marston wrote, ""Excellence is not a skill. It is an attitude."""
libra,2017-01-24,"You might not understand why, but it seems as if people are harshly criticizing you for no reason at all. Granted, they may be more critical than necessary and their delivery could be less than diplomatic. But the fact of the matter is the cosmos is sending you a signal and your critics are just messengers. Don't reject the feedback you receive now just because it makes you feel uncomfortable. This is a delicate moment and if you can listen with an open mind, you can change your game for the better."
scorpio,2017-01-24,"You have little patience for people who question your values. You wish they would take the time to discuss their assumptions rather than jumping to erroneous conclusions about your behavior. However, current interpersonal dynamics can be further confused if you defensively dismiss someone's point of view just because it differs from yours. Spanish novelist Miguel de Unamuno wrote, ""Isolation is the worst possible counselor."" As always, communication is the backbone of all relationships."
sagittarius,2017-01-24,"Your skin is thin today and you might feel things that you wouldn't normally notice. The receptive Moon's visit to your sign increases your emotional sensitivity and her conjunction with stern Saturn is like getting your hand slapped as you reach for the cookie jar. Rather than just withdrawing, you could overreact in order to hide your current vulnerability, especially with contentious Mars in the equation. You may not be able to change what happens to you, but you can improve the outcome by modifying your response. Stay positive and let your actions spring from love."
capricorn,2017-01-24,"A reality check requires you to narrow your perspective, reassess your priorities and focus on the most important tasks. Thankfully, you don't need to abandon your optimism; you only need to tighten the reins a little bit to navigate your way through this eye of the needle. Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""Shallow men believe in luck. Strong men believe in cause and effect."" Be strong and do the work; success is not for the faint-hearted."
aquarius,2017-01-24,"Your friends and associates might not be there to support you today as much as you wish. However, their unavailability is a blessing in disguise that catalyzes you into action. When you realize that you're personally accountable for your success or failure, you shift into overdrive to prove your competence. Hal Elrod wrote, ""The moment you take responsibility for everything in your life is the moment you can change anything in your life."""
pisces,2017-01-24,"You might feel like a fish swimming upstream today if your coworkers are impeding your progress rather than helping it. Although this is no time to just go with the flow, you could exhaust yourself fighting the prevailing currents. You're not required to claim victory over every obstacle in your path; you don't have to attend every argument you're invited to now. Choosing your battles carefully has the magical effect of decreasing the resistance you face. William James wrote, ""The art of being wise is knowing what to overlook."""
aries,2017-01-25,"Your coworkers may be standoffish today because you're giving off the impression that you don't want to be disturbed. It's true: you're not in the mood for horsing around because you're trying to get serious about your work. However, your no-nonsense attitude is really an avoidance strategy as wounded Chiron and vulnerable Venus sing a lament in your 12th House of Escapism. It isn't wise to succumb to their sad siren song by suppressing your feelings; instead, allocate a time and space to address them compassionately. You can't change what you refuse to confront."
taurus,2017-01-25,"You're trying to collect as many constants as you can so the variables aren't as tricky to handle. Surrounding yourself with the facts helps you feel more comfortable in your own skin. You can usually count on your friends for support, but you prefer to depend on yourself today. Unfortunately, being in the midst of a group reminds you of past friendships that may have ended badly or communities you left behind. In reality, rounding up your squad for an intimate get together to share your experiences may be just the bonding experience you need to help you release old paradigms."
gemini,2017-01-25,"Others may wonder what's wrong today as you're not quite acting like your usual chipper self. The truth is you're uninterested in small talk because you're preoccupied with processing complicated emotions while the solemn Capricorn Moon transits your 8th House of Transformation. Additionally, the poignant Chiron-Venus pairing calls to mind a time when your reputation was damaged, and it feels just as real now as it did when it happened. The good news is that talking about your feelings will expedite the healing process. Thomas Jefferson said, ""Honesty is the first chapter in the book of wisdom."""
cancer,2017-01-25,"Your melancholy is hidden under the surface of the tough exterior shell you created to keep it inside. However, the people who know you best are likely to notice that something is bothering you anyway. You may be stuck remembering a time when your biggest dream fell flat, and it's difficult to stop your heart from replaying the painful feelings of disappointment. However, with a little bit of conscious effort you can see this bygone experience in a new light. It is but one thread in a tapestry whose beauty is amplified by the contrast of light and dark."
leo,2017-01-25,"Getting enough rest should be top priority now, whether or not external circumstances are physically demanding, since your immune system needs support. Healer Chiron and vulnerable Venus conspire in your 8th House of Intimacy and your heart pangs in remembrance of an emotional debt that was never repaid. However, being too tired to worry is actually a blessing today as lower physical energy can motivate you to mellow out and let things go. Every time you subtract negative from your life, you make room for more positive."
virgo,2017-01-25,"Your manner is calculated and controlled today as rigidity feels safer than allowing the chips to fall where they may. You're afraid your heart might do the talking, and it has plenty to say about an old flame that's haunting your thoughts now. Instead of dwelling on the past, try to realize that it's not your job to fix lost souls. Although forgiving the person who has hurt you is an important piece of the puzzle, it's even more crucial to forgive yourself."
libra,2017-01-25,"Your people skills are one of your best assets and it's gratifying to put them to good use. Although creating harmony and mediating compromise can seem like a full-time job, it's easy to see the beauty in conflict resolution. However, sometimes diplomacy doesn't always do the trick, and you may remember a time when you tried your best to serve the greater good and it was all for naught. Instead of feeling remorseful about the past failure, view it as a learning experience that can positively influence your future endeavors."
scorpio,2017-01-25,"Keeping busy with menial tasks is surprisingly satisfying today. It's as if you're able to detect the artfulness of the mundane in every curve and angle. Although you're often seen as the brooding type, you actually possess a knack for transmuting negative feelings into imaginative art. In fact, things in your immediate environment might trigger recollections of a time when you shared something you were proud of and it wasn't favorably accepted. This creative wound could cause you to retreat in defense of your heart. Luckily, tapping into the energy of the memory inspires you to create something new if you're willing to examine your pain in a different light."
sagittarius,2017-01-25,"What you thought was ancient history is brought back to full-blown awareness today. Loving Venus encounters sensitive Chiron in your 4th House of Family, dredging up childhood memories that may not be so happy. The past might be hard to face, but favorable aspects from the patient Capricorn Moon can help you see the value in these difficult experiences. Henna Sohail wrote, ""The moment you learn the lesson, the test will be over."""
capricorn,2017-01-25,"No matter how many times you turn over a problem in your mind, you can't seem to find an answer that satisfies everyone. The reason is that sometimes there is no solution; accepting a situation exactly as it is can be the best way to make peace with it. The cosmos is offering you an opportunity to practice this process as a sentimental Venus-Chiron connection recalls an image of the past frozen in time. There's not much to do but observe how this makes you feel now, and move forward with the knowledge that this experience is expanding your perspective. When you seek it, you can't find it; when you stop looking, it finds you."
aquarius,2017-01-25,"The silent spaces in between activities seem to stretch out, allowing you to reflect on a time when you had less than you do now. Perhaps you went for a stretch with few material comforts or spent time on your own with little emotional support. These recollections may be uncomfortable because you remember them so vividly, but they also serve as landmarks that indicate how far you've come on your journey. Past and present placed side by side fosters a sense of gratitude like nothing else can."
pisces,2017-01-25,"It feels as if you've been transported back in time because everything reminds you of an earlier version of yourself. Although you may have shed your skin many times in this life, some new phases began out of necessity when chapters had to come to an end rather painfully. Keep in mind that there's a fine line between meditating on the past and throwing a pity party. Choosing a proactive way of processing memories like creating a scrapbook or writing a song empowers you to relive the past while also being able to close the book on it."
aries,2017-01-26,"Although there are professional responsibilities to attend to now, you're dreaming of having a day off to follow the whims of your heart. It's difficult to predict your rapid mood changes; one moment you're impatient with others and the next you're on the hunt for a sidekick to join you in a spontaneous adventure. If you let yourself go wherever the wind blows you today, you're likely to end up at a dead end with nothing to show for it. Tap into the industrious energy of the persistent Capricorn Moon to steady yourself among the temptations. Keep calm and remember your roots."
taurus,2017-01-26,"You're feeling the love and you want nothing more than to gather with your pals at your favorite restaurant. The problem is that you're known to overindulge in such sensory stimulus when the circumstances are right, and today it's difficult to stop once you start. Although you know you should think about the effect your revelry has on your health, it's a slippery slope. Fellowship is nourishing for the soul, but bring along a Plan B if your Plan A for self-control goes out the window."
gemini,2017-01-26,"You're happy to throw yourself into your work today because the recognition you receive makes you feel better about your current situation. In fact, you may be craving accolades because there's something bothering you that you prefer not to think about. While your attempts to seek approval are understandable, be aware that whatever you're avoiding inside will be there when the applause dies down. The Dalai Lama cautions, ""We can never obtain peace in the outer world until we make peace with ourselves."""
cancer,2017-01-26,"Your desire to feel secure may be projected onto a close relationship, driving you to be a bit too protective now. Circumstances seem unpredictable and you wish you could find solid ground. At the same time, you secretly want to escape and seek refuge at home base. Whether the dangers you perceive are real or not, they're likely to trip you up today. Don't get too carried away with preventative measures. Sometimes by holding on too tightly, you end up losing what you were trying to save."
leo,2017-01-26,A casual conversation with your partner or a close friend may go a lot deeper than either of you initially expected. You suddenly want to know if you're truly loved and your neediness might drive you to seek the words of affirmation you long to hear. It's perfectly natural to want some validation but it's probably doing more harm than good when your concern over being accepted monopolizes your thoughts. Love yourself first and the world will follow.
virgo,2017-01-26,"The problem isn't staying on task, it's that you have so many tasks you want to stay on. There is a plethora of alluring ideas that you believe would make great projects, but you know you should stick to the ones that are the most practical. The earthy Capricorn Moon advises a pragmatic approach, but wild Uranus and extravagant Jupiter urge you to go big or go home. This cosmic conflict creates an annoying buzz, but methodically filing away ideas for another day gives you the chance to focus on what's most important today."
libra,2017-01-26,"You may have made one too many promises, and you plan to follow through with all of them today. But you also long for some down time to do what you want as well. You constantly must adjust to make room for your obligations and your personal desires. Balance is hard to come by now, but the steadying influence of the consistent Capricorn Moon favors keeping your feet on the ground and putting one foot in front of the other. Focus on the present and the future will take care of itself."
scorpio,2017-01-26,"You might enjoy a recreational project so much that you lose track of time completely. You're going all in today, even though there are a lot of errands to run before day's end. Optimistic Jupiter and passionate Venus align, promising that you will produce something incredible if you pour yourself into your creative endeavors. However, this planetary duo is known for exaggeration, so be aware that you may not get as far as you think if you succumb to denial or procrastination. Concentration is the secret to your success."
sagittarius,2017-01-26,"You're so eager to let loose that you're already planning for the weekend. Creating a mental list of friends to invite and places to go is distracting you from your work, making it nearly impossible to focus on the here and now. However, a familiar voice in the back of your mind warns that you shouldn't let your festivities get out of hand because of the strain it puts on your pocketbook. The calculating Capricorn Moon plods through your 2nd House of Finances, cautioning you to stay cognizant of your budget. Setting manageable limits enables you to still have fun without breaking the bank."
capricorn,2017-01-26,"One thing after another is being added to your plate, and you're under the mistaken impression that you're capable of doing it all. However, the reliable Capricorn Moon's presence in your 1st House of Self hampers your objectivity. You find yourself rushing to help out coworkers when asked today, and unexpected things pop up at home that must be handled as well. You may have to say no to someone even if you think you can manage more. Establishing boundaries isn't admitting defeat; it's preparing for victory."
aquarius,2017-01-26,"Your mind is halfway across the world, roving from place to place like a traveling merchant. Your thoughts flit here and there but never return to your present location, making it a struggle to complete even the simplest chore without drifting off into another dream. Your physical energy is mellow today thanks to the sobering Capricorn Moon taking refuge in your 12th House of Rest. J.R.R. Tolkien wrote, ""Not all those who wander are lost."""
pisces,2017-01-26,"The urge to merge is so strong that it's a challenge to think about anything else. Whether it's a friend who really understands you or a lover who shares your dreams, it's as if you only have one setting when you open up today: full blast. The tenuous connection between magnetic Venus and expansive Jupiter creates an abundance of emotional energy that's difficult to regulate, pulling people in like a vortex. It may seem like perfect love is just a heartbeat away, but reality waits under the delusions of grandeur. A diamond with a flaw is worth more than a pebble without imperfections."
aries,2017-01-27,"Taking a step back to observe your social life from a new angle produces some mixed feelings. You're questioning whether your community fosters a sense of belonging or a feeling of being lost in the crowd. The global Aquarius New Moon falls in your 11th House of Groups, highlighting not only where you fit into the whole but your need to stand out. The code you live by requires rigorous testing of friendships to make sure they're worth your effort, even if you privately long for an effortless sense of kinship. This emotional proving ground sets the scene for stronger bonds in the future."
taurus,2017-01-27,"There appear to be more options in your vocational sphere when you look around today. You're realizing just how far you've come and how far you have yet to go at the same time, prompting an evaluation of your professional direction while the Aquarius New Moon emphasizes your 10th House of Career. But you might feel like you need to put blinders on and ignore your social life to take full advantage of this cosmic momentum. This may or may not be true, but it certainly seems so as ambitious Saturn bears down on affectionate Venus. Climb high, climb far; your aim the sky, your goal the star."
gemini,2017-01-27,"You're thirsty for knowledge and you're willing to journey far and wide to find it. Fortunately,  libraries of information are available online to sate your cravings without having to invest in overseas excursions. This priority shift is thanks to the intellectual Aquarius New Moon taking center stage in your 9th House of Higher Education. You may find yourself willing to allocate precious time to focus on learning, even though you're slightly worried that others might deem it foolish. The only person who can really hold you back is yourself, so cut the anchors and elevate your mind."
cancer,2017-01-27,"A dissonant chord is struck between your head and your heart today, and you're not sure how to make your next move. It often seems like the closer you hold something the safer it is, or the better you can make sense of it. However, the dispassionate Aquarius New Moon occurring in your 8th House of Transformation invites you to step back from what you cling to so tightly to gain a more unbiased perspective. While this detachment could seem harsh at first, it's really just providing you with space to breathe. Objectivity is your friend."
leo,2017-01-27,"You're reluctant to show your hand just yet, preferring to watch the situation from behind an inscrutable smile. A chilly breeze blows through your 7th House of Relationships where the aloof Aquarius New Moon draws attention to your interpersonal interactions. You may secretly wish to completely surrender to transcendent love, but karmic Saturn sends a stern reminder to romantic Venus that you won't truly be happy if you give up who you are for another person. You owe yourself the love you so freely give to others."
virgo,2017-01-27,"Affections may fizzle as other matters seem more important today than warm and fuzzy sentiments. There is work to be done and you're anxious to hit the drawing board when the astute Aquarius New Moon shows up in your 6th House of Routine. As you refine your plans for greater efficiency, you start to wonder how much time you're willing to give to other people. If you obsessively focus on the particulars, it's easy to view love and friendship as frivolous. To live life fully entails a balancing act, but with consistent effort and conscious intention you can experience the best of both worlds."
libra,2017-01-27,"A new chapter is beginning in which you're called to intellectualize your amorous ideals. The unconventional Aquarius New Moon revitalizes your 5th House of Romance, turning your heart towards autonomy. You want to make the rules yourself so you can fly free and stand out from the crowd, creatively shaping your aesthetic to reflect the newfound self-reliance growing inside you. Let your light shine so brightly that others can see their way out of the dark."
scorpio,2017-01-27,"You may act tough like a lone wolf, but you're uncertain if you prefer to be part of a pack or a rebellious roamer. The cerebral Aquarius New Moon pulls you back into your 4th House of Home, unpacking psychological boxes that could reveal profound insights. However, sweet Venus and strict Saturn square off now, making you feel like even if you want to have a constant companion by your side it would be out of your reach. This chill in the air will warm with time, so don't let a temporary tinge of loneliness get you down. Love is a long and winding road."
sagittarius,2017-01-27,"Upbeat mental melodies are replaced by abstract soundscapes as your mind rises into the thin air of the upper atmosphere. Conversations are served on ice not because you're upset or withdrawn today, but because your high-minded hypotheses are more theoretical than tangible. The progressive Aquarius New Moon highlights your 3rd House of Information, heightening your ability to think far outside of the box. This kind of intellectual stimulation lends itself to going it alone, where no one can criticize every idea or keep you from creating your own unique masterpiece."
capricorn,2017-01-27,"You're likely to make the most practical decision possible on any day, but today you're keenly focusing on your fiscal flow. Monetary matters are at the forefront of your mind, and you're interested in making the most of your income even if it means going without some of your favorite things. Detaching from acquiring more worldly possessions is a healthy step towards moderation, but even saving can escalate into the same kind of obsession you're trying to prevent. Find a way to balance your new initiative toward money with appreciation for the treasures already in your life."
aquarius,2017-01-27,"Something is different today -- you feel more like yourself than you have in a while. The beginning of your personal new year is demarcated by the individualistic New Moon's presence in your sign. It appears like you're wearing a tailor-made outfit, adorned in all your favorite colors and textures. You are both the drummer and the one marching to the beat; nothing can stand in your way of being totally authentic. Your place in the world seems clear and you're happy to sit at a table for one if it means freedom is yours."
pisces,2017-01-27,"Although you remain cordial on the surface, you can't wait to have some time alone today. A spiritual seed has been planted and quiet contemplation is the water that will help it to grow. The futuristic Aquarius New Moon calls you to the stillness of your 12th House of Meditation, where the noise of the day doesn't disturb your thoughts. Sometimes isolation feels lonely but you have an intuitive hunch that this time apart is for the best. You're never truly alone when you're by yourself, as solitude creates space for connecting to the divine. Surfing other dimensions delights your soul."
aries,2017-01-28,"Lethargy and doubt are left in the dust as the fire within you blazes. Brazen Mars bursts into your sign, beginning a conquest in your 1st House of Self. You are able to call on the courage and grit of the red planet to initiate an exciting new phase in your life, characterized by being completely yourself without compromise. The unorthodox Aquarius Sun and Moon fan the flames of your passion, supporting even your loftiest aspirations. Strike while the iron is hot."
taurus,2017-01-28,"Electricity crackles through your environment as possibilities for career advancement seem more real than ever. Ideas for innovative collaborations with colleagues flood your mind today, but enterprising Mars takes up residence in your 12th House of Privacy, indicating that your boldest plans may come to you when you are alone. Although you might feel pressure to participate in a social event, assert your need for privacy while you can. Hold on tight and prepare to soar."

Militant Mars marches into your 11th House of Social Movements today, inciting action and fueling motivation to get out there and make a difference. A special connection between revolutionary Uranus and the regal Sun adds creative flavor to the mix, promising that whatever you set out to accomplish will be worth writing home about. Out with the old, in with the bold."

Your close friends are likely to support your endeavors and you're looking forward to proving yourself capable in your new enterprise. You can achieve impressive results when you harness your pride as fuel for noble undertakings."
virgo,2017-01-28,"A switch has flipped and you're eager to start a new cycle. Warrior Mars takes the title of Cosmic Catalyst upon entering your 8th House of Transformation, initiating deep alchemical changes in your psyche. Although this process may not look like much fun from the outside, the results are game-changing. Adding this measure of valor to your inherent critical nature leads to dynamic development. John Wayne said, ""Courage is being scared to death and saddling up anyway."""
libra,2017-01-28,"You are turning a new page and are no longer afraid to speak up about what you want. Sexy Mars strides into your 7th House of Relationships, attracting all types of partnerships from romance to business. This cosmic dose of assertion mixes with your natural diplomacy to create a compelling potion that's sure to ignite passion wherever it's poured. Abraham Maslow wrote, ""In any given moment we have two options: to step forward into growth or to step back into safety."""
scorpio,2017-01-28,"The heat is rising and you're ready to get up and move. If you've grown bored with your routine, it's the perfect time to take things to another level now that action-planet Mars is fueling your 6th House of Fitness. Whether your sights are set on a weightlifting regimen or simply taking a daily walk, the Universe is giving you the green light to mobilize your plan. Let consistency and willpower unite for a common cause, and you will be a healthier version of you before you know it."
sagittarius,2017-01-28,"The stage is set for your dramatic entrance and you're more than ready to star as the life of the party. Everyone wants to hear your stories as the individualistic Aquarius Sun and Moon bless you with originality and charisma; in fact, passions may flare when you spark more than just casual interest in a conversation. Fiery Mars steps into red-hot Aries, cranking up the heat in your 5th House of Romance, creating an exciting cosmic conglomerate to reignite your playful spirit. Poet James Russell Lowell wrote, ""Fate loves the fearless."""
capricorn,2017-01-28,"The time for planning has come to an end; decisive action is top priority now. Macho Mars is in aggressive Aries, ready to carve a new path in your 4th House of Roots. You're ready to conquer home improvement projects that you previously doubted your ability to pull off. Moreover, you possess the courage to address old patterns from the past which are holding you back in the present. Sometimes updating antiquated structures requires bulldozing so you can build something better from the ground up."
aquarius,2017-01-28,"You're not one to be at a loss for words, but your eccentric notions are even more dazzling today. Both the Sun and Moon are in your innovative sign, and you feel right at home offering up thinking-points and promoting stimulating conversation. Furthermore, rambunctious Mars charges into your 3rd House of Communication, driving you to see just how far you can push the limits of discourse. Author Danielle LaPorte wrote, ""Your life unfolds in proportion to your courage."""
pisces,2017-01-28,"Although plenty is going on behind the closed doors of your mind, your outside world is changing rapidly at the same time. The conceptual Aquarius Sun and Moon occupy your 12th House of Meditation, where personal growth is a private affair. Meanwhile, insistent Mars shifts into daredevil Aries and your 2nd House of Self-Esteem, urging you to take immediate action. This unique cosmic combination empowers you to pick up the pace without losing control. John A. Shedd wrote, ""A ship in port is safe, but that's not what ships are built for."""
aries,2017-01-29,"You're rarely afraid to go after your heart's desires, but your true motivation for wanting to be on top rises to awareness today. Cerebral Mercury joins powerful Pluto in your 10th House of Ambitions, retrieving insights about your drive to succeed. There's no use doubting the reality of these revelations or using escapist behaviors to repress them. Introspection is facilitated by the Moon's retreat into your 12th House of Endings, where you can devote your attention to the integration process. James Russell Lowell wrote, ""A wise man travels to discover himself."""
taurus,2017-01-29,"Everyone runs to you when they need someone dependable, but now you're pondering who you call upon when you need help. Your 9th House of Big Ideas serves as the conference room for messenger Mercury and incisive Pluto, prompting you to take a good look at what you believe and why. While you should avoid resisting any insights that arise now, there's also no need to alter your worldview overnight if you sense that changes must be made. Quiet rumination enables you to unpack the celestial information you receive today. Lao Tzu wrote, ""To the mind that is still, the whole universe surrenders."""
gemini,2017-01-29,"Looking at the world through curious eyes is a gift unto itself, but looking within is an intimidating prospect. Perhaps that's why you typically avoid delving too deeply, preferring to skim over many ideas rather than follow one through to the end. However, the cosmos draws you into your personal underworld to finally face the issues you usually ignore. Hidden fears and problems that have been swept under the rug are now brought into your conscious mind for you to address. Change begins with a single thought."
cancer,2017-01-29,"The curtain is pulled back today, uncovering a cold harsh truth about a close relationship. Everyone has secrets they feel they must hide from even their most intimate companions. Nevertheless, if you've been keeping too much sealed away for fear of rejection, it will likely be reflected by someone near and dear to you now. Reality can be hard to face and you may wish that you could pretend that you imagined the whole thing. However, it's time to engage in heavy conversations even if you feel like running away. Fear only has the power you give it."
leo,2017-01-29,"You have a natural tendency to run yourself into the ground, believing your supply of stamina is endless. However, your habits are catching up with you and you're not getting off the hook this time. Mental Mercury is carrying an urgent message from your 6th House of Health, where your constant striving to be the best may cause your physical wellbeing to suffer. Acknowledging you need rest isn't admitting weakness, so be compassionate with yourself and take time to identify where you can make constructive adjustments in your routine. The Dali Lama says, ""Sleep is the best meditation."""
virgo,2017-01-29,"Everyone knows that working hard and taking care of your health are cornerstones of good living, but having a creative outlet is just as important for your soul. Mischievous Mercury aligns with insightful Pluto in your 5th House of Spontaneity, calling your inner child out to play. Neglecting recreation may not help you progress professionally as much as you think. While you don't have to quit your job to become a renowned artist, making time to allow your mind to rest while your heart takes over improves every aspect of your life. Albert Einstein said, ""Creativity is just intelligence having fun."""
libra,2017-01-29,"Old memories bubble up to the surface accompanied by a bittersweet sense of nostalgia. Methodical Mercury is sending a message in a bottle from your 4th House of Family, inviting you to revisit a childhood insecurity or painful trauma. You may try to suppress these recollections today, but there's no denying their impact on who you are as a person. Be gentle with yourself during this period of soul-searching -- you'll be stronger for it afterwards. Your past never defines your future."
scorpio,2017-01-29,"A dawning realization about the way in which you convey your messages begins to slowly dominate your thoughts. Sometimes you don't notice how your comments sound until they're already out in the open; conversely, often you wish you had spoken up only after it's too late. The transformational Mercury-Pluto conjunction in your 3rd House of Immediate Environment brings your communication issues to the forefront for self-evaluation. Be so busy improving yourself that you have no time to criticize others."
sagittarius,2017-01-29,"Your money is on your mind and your mind is on your money, but there's something lurking beneath your financial preoccupation that deserves your immediate attention. Your value systems are under examination by the keen eye of Mercury and the penetrating gaze of Pluto. An epiphany reveals what holds worth in your life, and the truth may be hard to swallow now. Fortunately, the Moon's shift into compassionate Pisces favors a peaceful afternoon for digesting discoveries. Baltasar Gracian wrote, ""Self-knowledge is the beginning of self-improvement."""
capricorn,2017-01-29,"You're finally able to relax and enjoy the weekend, which is precisely why you also have the mental space to contemplate some heavy issues. The person you're becoming is called into question as analytical Mercury joins evolutionary Pluto in your 1st House of Personality. A surprisingly thorough self-assessment comes seemingly out of nowhere, allowing you to see yourself with new eyes -- the good, the bad and the ugly. Plutarch wrote, ""What we achieve inwardly will change outer reality."""
aquarius,2017-01-29,"What starts as a normal day takes a philosophical turn, even though you may be the only one who realizes it. Secrets are unearthed as cerebral Mercury aligns with probing Pluto in your 12th House of Invisibility. Once brought to light this confidential information isn't likely to disperse without being acknowledged. Privacy and secrecy aren't the same thing, and you always have the choice to keep your most intimate thoughts to yourself. As long as you don't run from the truth  or try to twist it into something else, growth will occur naturally."
pisces,2017-01-29,"You start the day only to be stopped by a cosmic knock on the door. Swift Mercury and shrewd Pluto arrive with a message from your 11th House of Hopes and Dreams. You often feel like you can't decide where you want to put down roots, wishing instead that you could float along unhindered to explore whatever stirs your soul. However, a prominent landmark arises on the proverbial horizon, and you're suddenly clear on your desired destination. Somehow things are making more sense, whether this new insight is shocking or familiar. Trust the journey even if you don't understand it."
aries,2017-01-30,"The week has just started but it could feel like you're already running out of batteries. You prefer to recharge while the Moon wades through transient Pisces and connects with dreamy Neptune in your 12th House of Privacy. You don't need to conquer the world today, but choosing to give up and hibernate isn't a wise choice either. Take care of your most important responsibilities first and then you can rest with a clear conscience later, knowing you made some progress. Wake up with determination, go to bed with satisfaction."
taurus,2017-01-30,"It almost seems like if you keep your eyes closed, the exotic resort you're imagining will materialize. Experience proves that this isn't the case, but that doesn't stop you from wishing with all your might for an escape from the mundane. The nebulous Pisces Moon tries to talk brainy Mercury into planning your dream getaway, but perhaps the realistic choice is to simply change the screensaver on your phone to your ideal vacation spot instead. Starve your distractions, feed your focus."
gemini,2017-01-30,"It's as if a sonic frequency is vibrating all the pieces in your personal puzzle, moving things when you're not looking until suddenly everything has shifted. The watery Pisces Moon aligns with penetrating Pluto and wordy Mercury, creating a funnel through which your deep musings spill into the outside world. A close watch is required to prevent saying too much, since comments made in the workplace often lack the appropriate context and can lead to awkward misunderstandings. Erring on the side of caution enables you to sidestep trouble and maintain peace of mind."
cancer,2017-01-30,"You're walking through life in a trance today, as if your personal bubble has expanded to encompass imaginary worlds that only graze reality. It seems so real that you feel you must tell someone about your splendid visions, and even take them along for a tour if they're willing. However, there's a chance that opening up to others will only pull you deeper into your magical playground, so choose your words wisely if you wish to remain productive in any capacity. Joseph Joubert wrote, ""He who has imagination without learning has wings but no feet."""
leo,2017-01-30,"You're doing your best to stay engrossed in your daily routine, clinging to your schedule to keep your head above water. Your productive streak is nowhere to be found today, while the tools of self-analysis and soul-searching lie at the ready. These psychological tactics are unnecessary on a normal work day, but a surreal Moon-Neptune pairing in psychic Pisces cares not for the mundane world. Ground yourself by writing a simple list of manageable tasks and tackling them one by one. To do two things at once, is to do neither."
virgo,2017-01-30,"The world is softened around the edges and reality seems more pliable than it should. It's questionable whether the facts even matter from behind your rose-colored glasses. You're lost in a daze today, imagining the perfect partner as the reflective Moon glides into romantic Pisces, highlighting your 7th House of Relationships. Idealized standards can lead to major disappointment, so do your best to avoid getting swept up in a feeling that may not last. The Wizard of Oz said, ""Hearts will never be practical until they are made unbreakable."""
libra,2017-01-30,"You usually favor a fair and balanced approach, but your capacity for selfless service is expanding today. You prefer to donate your time to help someone else accomplish their tasks rather than focus on your own now, which could be problematic at the end of the day if you take your altruism too far. The line between generosity and sacrifice is blurred at this time, so only give what you're certain you can spare. Put your own oxygen mask on before assisting others."
scorpio,2017-01-30,"Meetings and agendas aren't likely to hold your attention today as you fill every margin with doodles and sketches. Your creative juices are flowing thanks to the evocative Moon's entrance into your 5th House of Self-Expression, where whimsical Neptune is waiting at the door. Coherent conversation may be a challenge as images flood your mind instead of words. Don't be surprised if others are confused by your intentions; there is no need to justify your behavior now. Emily Dickinson wrote, ""Saying nothing sometimes says the most."""
sagittarius,2017-01-30,"A sleepy start to your day leads into some rather intense research as you become fixated on finances. Lunar contacts to mercantile Mercury and obsessive Pluto in your 2nd House of Money send you into investigation mode as you search for ways to grow your nest egg. Investing in a comfortable future is admirable, but you may undermine your own efforts if you abandon your normal duties today trying to plan for a wealthy tomorrow. Eckhart Tolle wrote, ""Realize deeply that the present moment is all you really have."""
capricorn,2017-01-30,"Your lack of progress makes you want to push harder and harder, but it feels like you're just spinning your wheels today. The path from point A to point B is more circuitous than it should be as many minuscule mix-ups confuse the whole operation. Paradoxically, letting creativity take over when you might otherwise use logic to control the situation is the best way to make the most of the imaginative energy of the day. Your heart knows things your mind can't explain."
aquarius,2017-01-30,"Reality shifts and shimmers and even ordinary objects seem to be touched by magic. It's as if you're getting a glimpse beyond the veil as the mystical Pisces Moon sends telepathic messages to watchful Pluto in your 12th House of Secrets. You are easily lured off the productive path to chase any white rabbits that come along. Attending to daily matters is boring compared to living in the magical world inside your head, but the contrast can make both dimensions more enjoyable."
pisces,2017-01-30,"It appears to be the perfect day to spend in peaceful reflection, but people are depending on you to show up and you don't have the heart to let them down. Trying to stay on track feels like a division of your energy, as a magical merging of the Moon and Neptune in your intuitive sign draws your soul toward meditative bliss while your mind and body have other things to do. Finish the most pressing of your chores so you are not overwhelmed with work tomorrow. However,  sharing your inspired impressions is a wonderful way to strengthen the bonds of friendship and move towards uniting the immaterial with the material."
aries,2017-01-31,"You're aware from a rational standpoint that you should probably stick to the tried-and-true when it comes to your finances, but you keep convincing yourself that this next brilliant scheme might be the one to outdo them all. Unfortunately, taking chances isn't likely to evoke the instantaneous magic you expect. However, making real headway is possible once the Moon moves from delusional Pisces to your action-orientated sign. Funnel this energetic boost into nailing down what you know must be done rather than letting it fuel your impulsiveness. Know your limitations and then defy them."
taurus,2017-01-31,"You may find yourself further from practicality than you bargained for in your effort to think outside the box. Grounding your ideas is a challenge as mental Mercury is coerced by unruly Uranus and go-getter Mars. You might try to lean on your friends for objectivity, but even they seem to have their heads in the clouds today. Happily, you get a break later when the ephemeral Moon moves into your 12th House of Rest. Muhammad Ali said, ""The man who has no imagination has no wings."""
gemini,2017-01-31,"It's hard to tell what's real and what's fiction today as wild rumors circulate around the water cooler. You might be completely convinced that your friends and coworkers are talking about you behind your back, but it's important to consider that you could just be worried for no reason. You may finally feel brave enough to step up and face the hearsay directly after the Moon marches into confident Aries and your 11th House of Social Circles. As George Bernard Shaw wrote, ""The single biggest problem in communication is the illusion that it has taken place."""
cancer,2017-01-31,"You're wondering if you heard someone right as words seem to dissolve and change immediately after they're spoken. The spiritual Pisces Moon encourages you to have faith, but you're concerned that none of your work tasks will get done if you expect the Universe to do them for you. Fortunately, the Moon shifts into enterprising Aries, imbuing you with the guts to take care of business yourself. However, don't be overzealous right out of the gate or overcompensation might land you in a bigger mess than before. Speak softly and carry a big stick."
leo,2017-01-31,"Irrational thoughts run wild over your mental landscape, leaving you a bit breathless with all the possibilities. Separating the wheat from the chaff isn't as simple as it seems when the fuzzy Pisces Moon is involved, filling your mind with idealistic notions and the promise of escape from the mundane. Later it becomes clear that you'll have to take the bull by the horns to make the changes you're dreaming of, but surprises are still in store once you make your move. Embrace the unknown."
virgo,2017-01-31,"You're tempted to say exactly what's on your mind today, even though you know it might sound far-fetched to your audience. Blurred boundaries in the heart seep through to the mind, and you may be moved to profess love and affection when you would typically hold your tongue. Meanwhile, brazen Mars and unpredictable Uranus influence your key planet Mercury, revving your courage up and emboldening you to put a risky plan into action. Fortune favors the bold."
libra,2017-01-31,"You're fascinated by someone's ambitious goals, but you can't seem to summon the energy to fully commit to getting on board. The sensitive Pisces Moon fumbles through your 6th House of Wellbeing, attracting peculiar symptoms and perhaps even a slight case of hypochondria today. Fortunately, confusing ailments disperse into thin air after Luna switches into hot-to-trot Aries, motivating you to get back on the horse. Determination determines your destination."
scorpio,2017-01-31,"Fear of being misunderstood creates inner conflict between blurting out your feelings and letting things stew inside. You may decide to use art or music to express your volatile emotions rather than vocalizing them, especially since your moods are changing rapidly. However, when the reflective Moon moves from disorienting Pisces to assertive Aries, you might choose to shift gears and let your actions do the talking. John Burroughs wrote, ""The smallest deed is better than the greatest intention"""
sagittarius,2017-01-31,"You're questioning the things you normally take for granted today and wondering how much they really matter. You're a heartbeat away from purging your closet of any items you think are tying you down. However, the sentimental Pisces Moon begs you to remember that some things have special value because of their place in your heart. At some point, you might decide that the internal tug-of-war is too complicated, and set out on a completely different path altogether. Sometimes a healthy dose of recreation can clear the mind like nothing else."
capricorn,2017-01-31,"Employing even your highest quality fog lights won't increase visibility as much as you wish, forcing you to bide your time until the haze lifts. Once the mental mists blow past, your challenge is to keep your plan realistic when reactionary Uranus and warrior Mars rally in your 4th House of Foundations, urging you to forge a new set of rules from the ground up. General George S.Patton said, ""Better to fight for something than to live for nothing."""
aquarius,2017-01-31,"Your thoughts are going off like a line of firecrackers today causing you to switch direction each time a new piece of information enters the picture. You're convinced that secrets hiding in plain sight could be the key to unlocking incredible discoveries, but reckless Uranus is pranking trickster Mercury in your 12th House of Mystery, blowing everyday occurrences out of proportion. Keeping a cool head is the difference between creating an innovative solution and a conspiracy theory."
pisces,2017-01-31,"The rallying cry for an idealistic social cause could be so stirring that you're willing to write a check or volunteer your time to whoever asks as long as it moves the operation forward. Be sure that it makes sense before pledging your resources, because you're susceptible to swindling prior to the Moon's shift into independent Aries. It's prudent to hold off on making any major decisions until you're certain you know what you're signing up for. Better safe than sorry."
aries,2017-02-01,"You embody the courageous streak your sign is known for today as challenges which usually block your path seem to vanish in thin air. It feels like the universe is granting you clearance to sidestep the rules; you're anxious to get people on board with your plans because they're so unorthodox they just might work. Clear communication will stoke the fire propelling you toward your ambitions. Actions speak louder than words, but the right words at the right time can move mountains."
taurus,2017-02-01,"You may worry that you can't hide your true feelings, but your coworkers see you as enterprising and focused today. In fact, you're willing to restrain from any heated retorts in order to maneuver into the right position. Your drive to succeed comes from a hidden place, but putting your dreams into words for a few close friends clarifies your vision. You can still keep your inspiration protected while cultivating a fertile mental garden in which it will grow."
gemini,2017-02-01,"Your dreams seem closer than ever now, and you're willing to stretch beyond normal capacity to reach them. The unabashed Aries Moon strides through your 11th House of Networking, prompting you to shake all the right hands and make the connections that will lead to advancement. While you enjoy the high energy, make sure you also take time to monitor your thought process. Honor the desire to transform your life, but remember that everything begins in the mind. True happiness is created, not found."
cancer,2017-02-01,"Your arrow is aimed at the ideal vision of yourself and your natural tenacity pulls the bow string taut. You're ready to push past any vulnerabilities that might usually give you pause, and even step out of your comfort zone if it means moving closer to your goals. You possess the strength today, but make sure you aren't pushing yourself just for the sake of it. Although it's satisfying to be recognized for a job well done, kind words from a loved one mean so much more than a gold star at work or school. There's no shame in your game for seeking support when you need it."
leo,2017-02-01,"Your gaze is directed outward now, and you can see a runway to launch you into the wild blue yonder. The fuel that's been thrown on your fire is thanks to the courageous Aries Moon in your 9th House of Big Ideas. A trusty sidekick may put a different spin on things, heightening your imagination and urging you to get on the road to the next adventure without delay. However, sometimes the best part of a spontaneous journey is the conversation that happens along the way. Inspiration is often found in the most unexpected places."
virgo,2017-02-01,"You're ready to make a change and dexterously handle any obstacles with confidence. Stepping outside the box allows you to quickly discover an innovative approach to your workload, increasing your productivity. However, the blessing of an authentically expressed self can be more gratifying than any number of accomplishments. Analytical Mercury's collaboration with healer Chiron encourages you to creatively re-frame your ideas and offers the key to personal fulfillment. It is far more powerful to live your truth than to preach it."
libra,2017-02-01,"You sway with the energetic atmosphere today, enjoying the exciting interactions that seem to be around every corner. Sparks fly as the eccentric Aquarius Sun dances with the feisty Aries Moon, and you may be pleasantly surprised with how much fun you're having now. Letting loose and coloring outside the lines brings more joy into your life, but true healing occurs from the ground up. Speak from your heart, not just to rattle someone's cage. Genuine words of kindness contain more healing power than any exciting enterprise you can imagine."
scorpio,2017-02-01,"You feel the fire flow through your veins today as you knock out one task after another. Your drive to push past personal limitations flares as the restless Aries Moon powers through your 6th House of Health and Fitness, inspiring you to find an outlet for your high energy. However, your mind needs stimulation just as much as your body. Putting your thoughts on paper can be just as challenging and rewarding as physical exercise, and it's just as important for a balanced and healthy you."
sagittarius,2017-02-01,"Life is a game and you were born ready to play. You don't see anything stopping you from making the most of the day while the brazen Aries Moon transits your 5th House of Spontaneity. Your inner child is unleashed and running off the beaten path today, encouraging you to ignore conventions so you can stay true to yourself. Listen to the whispers of your heart regarding your self-worth. Follow your bliss and you may find something beautiful waiting to be discovered."
capricorn,2017-02-01,"The outer world mirrors the inner; the itch to power through a pile of clutter often indicates that an emotional purging needs to take place. You're ready to clean house in every sense while the tenacious Aries Moon heats up your 4th House of Foundations. Keeping busy with chores allows your mind to sort itself out in the background, running through what you can eliminate and what to cherish. Reshuffling your priorities unlocks a sense of peace and calm."
aquarius,2017-02-01,"You're fired up and ready to go, leaping over hurdles and leaving everyone in the dust. Your thoughts race faster than you can follow and you believe you are capable of setting anything you want into motion today. Your original approach to problem-solving empowers you to resolve dilemmas as soon as you run into them. While riding the mind-over-matter wave may feel good now, remember to communicate with honesty not just force. Taking time to listen allows wisdom to find its way in."
pisces,2017-02-01,"The nagging doubts that often slow you down are nowhere to be found today. In fact, you roll along at a brisk pace and your belief in your talent is reignited. It's nice to feel capable of getting what you want, and the momentum that comes from confidence in your abilities may lead you to rewarding yourself with some impulse purchases. Self-indulgence is fun, but lasting gratification takes time. Rather than hastily acquiring new things to make you happy, cherish the healing connections of your closest companions. Vincent Van Gogh wrote, ""What is done with love is done well."""
aries,2017-02-02,"Persistence in the face of doubt proves the impossible to be possible today. Encouragement from a supportive buddy inspires you to break down your ambitious goals into manageable pieces like an immovable boulder being chipped into movable rocks. High-and-mighty Saturn holds you to your principles as you persevere through challenges and come out on top. Thankfully, reprieve quickly follows when the Moon cools off in laid-back Taurus, giving you a chance to celebrate your progress."
taurus,2017-02-02,"You're doing your best to confront issues as they pop up, even if you're afraid you may not be able to stretch as far as challenges demand. A heartening square between discerning Mercury and promising Jupiter inspires you to hold the big picture in mind and keep moving even when it seems smarter to dig in your heels and wait. Keeping your chin up now makes it easier to unwind later when the Moon relaxes into your sensual sign. A positive attitude is your best offense."
gemini,2017-02-02,"Excitement can turn to frenzy if you lack focus and it's easy to spin your wheels rather than move forward when you doubt your abilities. Luckily, stabilizing Saturn in your 7th House of Others reminds you to seek the advice of a trusted friend to help you stay consistent now. Finding a way to make progress on a tumultuous journey enables you to keep your momentum without letting nerves swerve you off the road. A well-deserved break is just around the bend, so keep calm and carry on."
cancer,2017-02-02,"You can just as easily declare your certainty and question your competence in the same breath today, but courage wins out when you remain firm in your convictions. Saturn the Tester honors its half of the bargain when you stick to your to-do list and overcome overwhelm by staying organized. Your unrelenting focus on your goals softens later after the Moon slips into mellow Taurus, offering you a chance to relax and get cozy. Indulging in creature comforts is a delightful way to reward your hard work."
leo,2017-02-02,"As the natural performer of the zodiac, you put on a great show even when you're unsure you can pull off your grand plan. Happily, a dynamic connection between inspirational Jupiter and methodical Mercury points out where adjustments might be made to help you run a tighter ship without having to depend solely on showmanship to get by. Recognition for your efforts is likely after the Moon moves into your 10th House of Reputation. Work for the cause, not the applause."
virgo,2017-02-02,"You prefer to know the chances of success or failure ahead of time, but you can't always plan every detail in advance. A splash of boldness added to your naturally brainy methods is just the combination that allows you to maintain your rhythm in the face of apprehension. Affirmative Jupiter passes a note to cerebral Mercury today, reminding you of your worth and reinvigorating your self-confidence. Positive thinking leads to positive outcomes."
libra,2017-02-02,"Your ability to stay centered without picking a side comes in handy today as contentions may intensify your interactions with others. An invigorating square between altruistic Jupiter and clever Mercury reminds you that fairness and justice are worth fighting for now; keeping your cool when engaging in tricky conversations helps level the scales for everyone involved. The mood softens down the road after the graceful Moon slows her pace in sensible Taurus. Rumi wrote, ""Love is the bridge between you and everything."""
scorpio,2017-02-02,"You're determined not to take the easy way out, even though it looks appealing in the heat of the moment. You innately understand that when the going gets tough, the tough get going. Fortunately, persistent Saturn is on your side now, encouraging you to believe in your skills and talents. Your nose gets a break from the grindstone later when the Moon chills in soothing Taurus, relieving you of obligations, both real and perceived. Your unwavering perseverance is an undeniable force of nature."
sagittarius,2017-02-02,"Sugar-coating the truth isn't your style, especially when you passionately believe in your position. While it's prudent to choose your words wisely and avoid inflammatory remarks, you can't help but feel that it's your duty to speak your opinion now without reservation. Boisterous Jupiter connects with tricky Mercury, inciting animated conversations about social values. A welcome lull in the excitement comes later once the emotional Moon relocates to placid Taurus. Anais Nin wrote, ""Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one's courage."""
capricorn,2017-02-02,"It may feel like all you do is work, but that's because you instinctively take on heavy loads knowing that you can somehow bear them. Twinges of hesitation appear in the shadows today but will quickly fade when auspicious Jupiter in your 10th House of Ambitions reminds you why your goals are so important. It is nearly impossible to give up when you are motivated by pure intentions. Happily, you can take a break from your persistent striving when the Moon moves into pleasure-seeking Taurus. Pablo Picasso wrote, ""The meaning of life is to find your gift. The purpose of life is to give it away."""
aquarius,2017-02-02,"It's tempting to just speak louder if you feel like you're not being heard. You may be afraid that if you don't make your point now, you won't get another chance. However, it's wise to temper your words with maturity as stern Saturn looks on from your 11th House of Networking. What you say and how you say it can create goodwill among your peers or cause hurt feelings. Think before you speak today rather than taking a reactionary approach. Thankfully, the tension will dissipate  if you leave well enough alone. Desmond Tutu teaches, ""Don't raise your voice. Improve your argument."""
pisces,2017-02-02,"Material assets are at the forefront of your mind today, and there's nothing stopping you from pursuing what you want. Sometimes acquiring coveted possessions makes you feel like you're climbing the ladder of success, but money can't buy happiness. True worth is found in loving who you are and striving to fulfill your potential by being the kind of person you admire. Take a page from the book of a person you respect to see the value in genuine connection and dedication to a cause. Actor Scott Caan said, ""Good things happen when you set your priorities straight."""
aries,2017-02-03,"Life is breathed into your daydreams today as they cross the veil which separates fantasy from reality. Desirous Venus debuts in your 1st House of Personality, imbuing you with charm, courage and a splash of impatience. You're unwilling to lay down your sword and surrender now; you're ready to go after what you want without compromise. Although your dreams are playing out before you in full color and clarity, a nod from potent Pluto reminds you that this is a marathon, not a sprint. Combining passion with perseverance is the only way to win."
taurus,2017-02-03,"Something marvelous is beginning to brew, and you're craving peaceful solitude where you can listen to the quiet music that is playing deep within your heart. Alone time is essential for incubating your ideas, but unfortunately, the world doesn't wait around for anyone. The down-to-earth Taurus Moon makes a challenging aspect to the forward-thinking Aquarius Sun, encouraging you to test your resolve and make the adjustments needed for professional progress. Thankfully, your dreams will still be there when you get back from work."
gemini,2017-02-03,"You're an expert on the field of verbal athletics, able to play both sides of a conversation with finesse. However, you may begin to grandstand and swing for the fence now that acquisitive Venus suits up in independent Aries. This impassioned approach to your aspirations is exhilarating, but the grounded Taurus Moon reminds you to take a timeout when needed so burnout doesn't sabotage your game. Stepping back from the plate provides a wider perspective."
cancer,2017-02-03,"Your vocational goals take center stage and it's time to see if your preparation has paid off. Vivacious Venus strides into your 10th House of Career today, eager to refashion your public image and take you to new heights. It may not be your nature to speak up and demand satisfaction, but you're beginning a new phase in which you find your voice rising above the rest. However, simply being the loudest in the group won't bring you long-term satisfaction. It's not about being better than anyone else; it's about being better than you were yesterday."
leo,2017-02-03,"Expanding your repertoire can be exhilarating now, and you're eager to strive for the next  level by mastering something new and exciting. However, your immersion into the world of learning may prove to be more like diving into an ocean than a swimming pool. Insatiable Venus surges into impatient Aries, but a nudge from unrelenting Pluto warns that the journey might be longer than you think. Nevertheless, your dreams are within reach -- just remember to rehearse before rushing to launch your new show."
virgo,2017-02-03,"The path to the top isn't always a straight line, and you're acutely aware of the rigorous testing that must happen to prepare yourself for advancement. Nevertheless, the heat is intensifying, requiring you to face the deep changes that rumble within. Magnetic Venus enters your 8th House of Metamorphosis, turning your gaze away from the outer world. Self-transformation is a bold and admirable task, and you're up for the challenge now. Henry Ford said, ""If you think you can or you think you can't, you're right."""
libra,2017-02-03,"Cupid's arrow has been dipped in a passion potion and directly hits its target today. Sassy Venus saunters into sexy Aries, highlighting your 7th House of Partnerships and setting your heart on fire. You approach your relationships with new certainty, unafraid to boldly state exactly what you want. Limber Libras often adapt to the needs of others, and this move toward decisive action may render you more impatient than usual. Your desires seem simple to you, but they paint a more complicated picture to everyone else. Hang onto your trademark tact as you chase what you crave most."
scorpio,2017-02-03,"Your closest companions want your time and attention today, but a complex inner atmosphere ties an easy decision into a rather complicated knot. While you prefer to relax with the ones you love, passionate Venus blazes into your 6th House of Wellbeing, encouraging you to get off the couch and spice up your routine. Creating new habits is a positive step in the right direction, but obsessing over every detail can detract from your health instead of improving it. Stop pursuing happiness, create it."
sagittarius,2017-02-03,"You're eager to paint the town red when vibrant Venus dances into impulsive Aries, lighting up your 5th House of Play like a city skyline. Instant gratification is the name of your game as you see no reason to hold anything back. However, a tense square between the objective Aquarius Sun and the practical Taurus Moon reminds you to rearrange your priorities before throwing your schedule out the window. Guilt can ruin the best of times; letting loose is more fun when you complete your work first."
capricorn,2017-02-03,"Everyone knows you're ambitious by nature and it's not uncommon for you to bring your work home. However, your attention is shifting to what you can do to make your place more beautiful as stylish Venus charges into energetic Aries, emphasizing your 4th House of Foundations. An aggressive attitude toward home-improvement lends itself to quick execution of your undertakings, but balancing your budget requires more mindful planning and temperament. Little changes act as stepping stones toward a larger transformation."
aquarius,2017-02-03,"After juggling a hectic schedule, it's time to  downshift and enjoy some peace and quiet. However, your thoughts begin to race as resourceful Venus strides into your 3rd House of Mind, and soon you're itching to tell your new ideas to anyone who will listen. Intense Pluto joins the conversation, warning that your fervency could be an overcompensation stemming from a complex inner dynamic. Peter Marshall said, ""Small deeds done are better than great deeds planned."""
pisces,2017-02-03,"The frenetic pace is settling down and you're proud of yourself for taking the busy week in stride. Your confidence is bolstered by beautiful Venus as she enters assertive Aries today, accentuating your 2nd House of Self-Worth. Doubts fade into the past as it becomes easier to pursue the things you want. However self-assured you feel now, be sure to make the best choice, not just the bold choice. Forgotten details could compromise your plans if you don't take the time to thoroughly think things through before forging ahead. Don't let haste make waste when the stars are on your side."
aries,2017-02-04,"You're revving your engine and raring to go, confident you can make magic happen as you speed to your destination. However, the practical Taurus Moon would rather rein in your enthusiasm and remind you that a steady pace is safer, albeit less exciting. It's natural to leap before you look, but the unknown sometimes holds unfathomable secrets which are impossible to predict. Instead of risking it all, open your eyes and buckle your seat belt. Keep your arms and legs inside the vehicle as a safety measure. A Filipino proverb warns, ""Caution minimizes loss."""
taurus,2017-02-04,"An internal nudge stirs secret desires, but you're not yet ready to kick into high gear and initiate action. You prefer to stay in your comfort zone and keep your plans private, enjoying things the way they are instead of pushing change too early. Trusting your gut when it recommends caution is wise today, especially when it's impossible to know what's around the next corner. Waiting for the right opportunity is a test of your common sense. A person who masters patience masters everything else."
gemini,2017-02-04,"Although you love dancing to the upbeat rhythm of those around you, you secretly long to be alone today. You are a bit fearful that you might miss the time of your life as your social scene is lit up with exciting possibilities. However, Luna's presence in your 12th House of Privacy indicates you can benefit from a quiet retreat to recharge your batteries. The good news is there will be plenty of opportunities for frivolity over the weekend. Paulo Coelho wrote, ""A warrior balances solitude and dependence."""
cancer,2017-02-04,"Your appetite for success and recognition continues to grow, but you still don't want to rock the boat. The cosmic dance of Venus and Mars in your 10th House of Publicity draws you toward the spotlight, but you worry that your friends might think differently of you if you act too large and in charge. You wonder if whispers are floating around you, and it seems more secure to play small until you know how to execute your next move. Author Joyce Meyer wrote, ""Patience is not the ability to wait, but the ability to keep a good attitude while waiting."""
leo,2017-02-04,"Your mind swirls with fantastic visions and you wish you could cultivate these colorful saplings into towering giants overnight. You're acutely aware that coming across as overly enthusiastic and promoting your enterprise too soon could lead to a disappointing flop. You may need to choose between keeping your lips sealed today or risking embarrassment by raising the curtain prematurely. Bouncing ideas around with close friends is a good way to soft-launch your grand plan. Luckily, the ever-curious Gemini Moon will be happy to facilitate your research over the weekend."
virgo,2017-02-04,"You're motivated to take courageous steps of self-improvement, but you want to gather more facts and fill in the details to your plan first. The steadfast Taurus Moon grazes in your 9th House of Higher Education, encouraging you to keep chewing the food for thought before jumping to any conclusions. Unraveling inner stories is mysterious and time-consuming work that will provide you with the answers you need. Proper preparation prevents poor performance."
libra,2017-02-04,"You are surprised by how unapologetic you are in your personal interactions today. Your craving for passionate engagement with others drives nearly everything else out of your mind. However, the sensual Taurus Moon advises you to do more than just skip from thrill to thrill; nurture the more stable connections that sustain you, instead. You can keep wearing the rose-colored glasses, but gaze off into the distance once in a while rather than becoming fixated on what's right in front of you. Wayne Dyer wrote, ""If you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change."""
scorpio,2017-02-04,"You wake up ready to take on the world and you believe you possess the strength to pull it off. However, you may have to rethink adding more to your plate to avoid letting others down when they need you today. Although it might feel as if you must postpone work on a creative project to be there for a friend, abandoning cultivation of your closest relationships will only detract from your fulfillment in the long run. Temper your passion with compassion."
sagittarius,2017-02-04,"You can't wait to make the most of the upcoming weekend, whether you're spicing up your romantic life or singing karaoke with your best buds. Your heart is set on celebrating life's pleasures, but be aware that things you say in the heat of passion might weave webs which could trip you later. Pacing yourself is a smart strategy if you want the good times to last. The key to keeping your equilibrium is knowing when you've lost it. Counterbalance playtime with self-care to maintain optimum health."
capricorn,2017-02-04,"Hard work is more fun when you get to see immediate results from your efforts. You're eager to roll up your sleeves and tackle domestic projects with gusto, but be careful that you don't go overboard and bite off more than you can chew. Although you're longing to move mountains, the serene Taurus Moon encourages you to partake in simple pleasures like watching a movie, baking cookies or looking at childhood pictures. Cutting yourself slack when you have the time will make you more efficient later when you don't."
aquarius,2017-02-04,"Ingenious ideas are never far behind you unconventional Aquarians, but your mind is racing faster than ever as each new thought seems more vibrant than the last. The same passion brightens your conversations today and your friends are likely to be entertained by your exuberance. There's no harm in being enthusiastic, but words taken out of context can land you in bizarre situations that even the sharpest minds can't foresee. Photographer Francoise Gautier wrote, ""More important than the quest of certainty is the quest for clarity."""
pisces,2017-02-04,"What seemed like hopeful thinking in the recent past seems more tangible now, and you're excited to put your money where your mouth is. The dependable Taurus Moon plods through your 3rd House of Communication, prompting you to put your goals into words before giving chase. You're right to believe that you can attract what you want, so be mindful of what you wish for today. Impulsive acts may be thrilling after a long wait, but the winds of fate could buffet you into wild places if you're not careful. Race car driver Bobby Unser said, ""Success is where preparation and opportunity meet."""
aries,2017-02-05,"Your thoughts are like a whack-a-mole game today as you can barely sort one out before another appears. Although the talkative Gemini Moon lightens the mood, the sheer number of conversations happening at once might drive you to agitation and provoke sharp words. Taking a moment to notice how you treat others during chaotic times like these illuminates larger themes in your relationships. True growth occurs when you stay vulnerable in the present moment."
taurus,2017-02-05,"There seems to be less time for everything today as overdue fiscal tasks must be addressed. The restless Gemini Moon makes it difficult to focus on one thing at a time, but tapping into your reserves of persistence aids you in navigating through the pile of receipts and bills. Although menial matters are top priority now, there is much to learn from the way you approach these unavoidable duties. Evaluating your work ethic uncovers meaningful truths about your character."
gemini,2017-02-05,"Constantly changing circumstances keep you entertained today, but may also detract from your productivity. You prefer busyness over boredom if given a choice, and your mental agility allows you to roll with the punches without your world being turned upside down. In fact, your ability to put a creative spin on situations that might aggravate another person is a special gift of yours. However, make sure you are using this talent responsibly rather than crafting creative cop-outs. Modeling a positive outlook on life's challenges lifts everyone's spirits up."
cancer,2017-02-05,"Some much needed alone time is on the agenda but the air seems to crackle with erratic energy, making it hard to quiet your thoughts. Instead of tuning out other people and retreating further into your shell, practicing active listening may reveal insights you might otherwise have missed. Everyone needs to unplug now and then, but observing how and why you withdraw into your personal bubble teaches you valuable lessons and promotes growth. A mind once opened never loses."
leo,2017-02-05,"It's a good thing your plans were penciled in, because you might end up erasing and replacing them all day long. Ironing out the whats and whens is no simple matter as the fickle Gemini Moon darts through your 11th House of Social Circles. No one seems to want to make a decision, but remaining flexible can turn an irritating episode into a spontaneous adventure. The more you practice consciously choosing how to think about situations, the wider your horizons become."
virgo,2017-02-05,"Although you're trying to take care of business today, your responsibilities seem more slippery than a wet bar of soap. Unexpected events make staying on track a challenge and you may worry that others are unfairly judging your professionalism when most of the derailments are actually out of your control. Fear of unwarranted condemnation might stem from a bigger self-esteem issue that needs to be addressed. You're right at home with the tiniest of details; zooming out for a check on the big picture brings information to light that can only be seen from a bird's eye view."
libra,2017-02-05,"Trying to wrap your head around the truths of the universe may just make you dizzy today. The curious Gemini Moon flies through your 9th House of Big Ideas, delivering one stimulating notion after another without really moving you forward. All the circular dialogues spin you around and you're not sure which way is up or where you stand. Instead of looking for answers in other people's opinions, trust your own logic when seeking solid ground. True comprehension comes from within."
scorpio,2017-02-05,"Everyone seems extra chatty today and it's cramping your style. You prefer to focus on your work and accomplish your goals, but you can't help getting sidetracked when conversations end up going down rabbit holes too enigmatic to resist. The good news is you don't have to keep your guard up now; in fact, taking these detours could lead you on more meaningful journeys than you can imagine. Vincent van Gogh wrote, ""Normality is a paved road; it's comfortable to walk,  but no flowers grow on it."""
sagittarius,2017-02-05,"Miscommunications and mixed messages abound today, but you're willing to cheerfully laugh them off. You can't blame others for their confusing typos and sudden changes of plans because it seems like everyone is experiencing a bit of cosmic turbulence. It's natural for you to see the world from a global perspective, making it easy to not sweat the small stuff. While your reputation counts on you honoring your commitments, your love of spontaneity makes you a fun and positive influence on all those you encounter."
capricorn,2017-02-05,"You hope to cross every item off your to-do list today, but even the most routine parts of your day seem to run into snags. You wish people would take things as seriously as you do, but a lighter mood is actually beneficial when unpredictable blunders might otherwise drag everyone down. Try not to get hung up on the details; as long as you're moving toward your goals consistently, minor obstacles won't compromise your ultimate aspirations. Terrence McKenna said, ""Levity is the opposite of gravity."""
aquarius,2017-02-05,"You're excited to start a long-anticipated creative project, but even recreational plans are hard to nail down today. The playful Gemini Moon lightens spirits, but you may end up talking about all the fun you could have rather than actually having it. Unfulfilled expectations add up and threaten to trigger testy interactions. Creatively re-framing the situation is the best way to make the most of the day; seeing setbacks as an experiment in non-attachment is a healthy coping strategy. A negative mind will never give you a positive life."
pisces,2017-02-05,"What you thought was a great day to wrap up chores around the house turns out to be more hectic than you expect. It seems that for every can of worms you contain, another one opens and things run amok. Instead of allowing the inconsistency to drive you crazy, see it as an exercise in mental dexterity. While a clean and tidy living environment is worth striving for today, sometimes it's not worth straining for. Know when to stop and breathe, and when to call it quits."
aries,2017-02-06,"Choosing your words wisely is of paramount importance today. You're confident that you can fulfill every verbal contract you make, but one too many could cause you to drop all your spinning plates in an instant. Instead of pushing your limits, quit while you're ahead. Under-promising and over-delivering is always preferable to spreading yourself too thin. Benjamin Franklin advised, ""Well done is better than well said."""
taurus,2017-02-06,"You're scrambling to finish tasks that remain incomplete and in your haste to make up for lost time you could find yourself overwhelmed again. Disorganization in your surroundings disrupts your peaceful environment today, and you might be worried that the clutter reflects badly on you as a person. Rather than allowing anxiety to divide your energy among too many distractions, only agree to those things you have time to complete. It's kinder to say no now rather than let someone down later."
gemini,2017-02-06,"You're happy to juggle multiple things at once, bouncing from project to project on a whim. The chatty Gemini Moon merges mind and mouth -- and thoughts are spoken nearly as quickly as they form. As a result you may not even realize how much you're taking on until you hear yourself agreeing to something out loud. There comes a point when words mean very little and others demand that you follow through with your promises. Buckminster Fuller said, ""Integrity is the essence of everything successful."""
cancer,2017-02-06,"You prefer to keep things to yourself today as you just don't have the energy to explain what's on your mind. It's a challenge to stay focused when your thoughts keep distracting you from the task at hand. Walking away from your work may seem counter-intuitive, but taking short breaks to enjoy some silence can help you gracefully move through the day. If you ignore your need for rest, you may end up so mentally exhausted that you call it quits before you achieve your goals. Reconnecting with your center supplies you with enough stamina to go the distance."
leo,2017-02-06,"You want to be there for your friends but it seems like everyone wants to do something at the same time today. If you don't think before you speak, you might consent to a social engagement that's contrary to your personal desires. There's no point in going if you resent being there in the first place. Instead of trying to please everyone now, reexamine your priorities before accepting any  invitations. The more validation you need, the less discernment you have."
virgo,2017-02-06,"You're eager to prove yourself to your coworkers today by managing all your professional affairs efficiently. However, heavy workloads are only impressive when you can carry them without a struggle. There's no use in packing your agenda so tightly that you need to work overtime to get it all done. Besides, neglecting your home life creates its own set of consequences as falling behind on the job. Author Colin Wright wrote, ""Extremes are easy. Strive for balance."""
libra,2017-02-06,"Wandering off on one tangent can lead you to many others when you realize how much you still have to learn. A number of fascinating topics for study enter your consciousness as the inquisitive Gemini Moon meanders through your 9th House of Higher Education. A thirst for knowledge is healthy, but you could end up overwhelmed by an onslaught of data if you don't respect your mental limits. Instead of over-saturating your mind with information, stick to just one new pursuit at a time. Focus is a matter of discipline and choice."
scorpio,2017-02-06,"The mundane world doesn't interest you at the moment as you are drawn down the deep tunnels of your own mind. The curious Gemini Moon stalks through your 8th House of Self-Analysis today, distracting you from your responsibilities in favor of getting lost in your head. Luna opposes sensible Saturn later on, reminding you to return to reality long enough to pay the bills. The miracle is not to fly in the air, but to walk on the Earth."
sagittarius,2017-02-06,"It's impossible to be bored today because it seems like everyone has an amusing story to tell you. The loquacious Gemini Moon lights up your 7th House of Companions, inspiring delightful discourse with almost anyone you encounter. However, it may slowly dawn on you just how much time you're losing in idle chatter, prompting you to put your foot down rather abruptly. Irma Kurtz wrote, ""Givers have to set limits, because takers rarely do."""
capricorn,2017-02-06,"It appears as if everyone needs something from you today, and you're all too willing to help out. Unfortunately, tasks that you think will only take five minutes end up taking longer; you may run out of time before you know it. Overextending your mental and physical limits won't do you any good. Sacrificing your own well-being for the sake of others is a slippery slope. How you treat yourself is how you invite people to treat you."
aquarius,2017-02-06,"You're having such a great time that it's hard to know when to stop and take a break today. The carefree Gemini Moon zips through your 5th House of Fun and Games, prompting you to turn any activity into a celebration. Everyone appreciates your lighthearted demeanor, but being the life of the party has its drawbacks now. Serious Saturn scolds Luna later on, reminding you to play hard but make sure you work hard too. Osho taught, ""Life is a balance between rest and movement."""
pisces,2017-02-06,"Your body might be out and about in the world but your head wishes it could stay home. You may think you can operate with a divided mind today, but your preoccupation regarding family matters could detract from the daily grind more than you expect. Sobering Saturn restrains the fidgety Gemini Moon later on, warning you to remain on track rather than letting underlying anxiety hijack your day. Crossing bridges before you reach them is an exercise in futility."
aries,2017-02-07,"There's a different vibe floating in the atmosphere today that makes it difficult to reconcile your feelings from your thoughts. The moody Cancer Moon draws you into your comfort zone, but Mercury's entrance into humanitarian Aquarius stimulates your 11th House of Social Groups. You may be considering how you can give back to your community or contribute to something larger than yourself. Peaceful time at home can free up your mind to reassess your place in the world. Ryunosuke Satoro wrote, ""Let your dreams outgrow the shoes of your expectations."""
taurus,2017-02-07,"It feels like the calm after the storm. The sentimental Cancer Moon slips into your 3rd House of Communication, softening dialogues and soothing the mind. While you welcome the lull in the action, your attention shifts toward your next professional move. Mental Mercury's flight into astute Aquarius turns thoughts conceptual, prompting you to explore new options and visualize your goals with more clarity. Working from both your head and your heart is your key to success."
gemini,2017-02-07,"Thinking ahead is an unusual strategy for you, but sometimes you just can't help yourself. Although your thoughts are like magnets that pull you into the future, the tenacious Cancer Moon in your 2nd House of Values reflects your need to cling to old beliefs. Signing up for a workshop or a class is one way to shake loose whatever is holding you back. Using your brain doesn't replace your feelings, but rather augments them. J.P. Morgan said, ""The first step toward getting somewhere is to decide that you are not going to stay where you are."""
cancer,2017-02-07,"You don't feel like hiding in your personal cave quite so much now. In fact, you could wear your heart on your sleeve while the emotional Moon is visiting your 1st House of Self. You express your feelings eloquently once brainy Mercury shifts into thought-provoking Aquarius, highlighting your 8th House of Intimacy. It's ironic that you can talk about such passionate issues while maintaining such a cool demeanor. Nevertheless, life is ultimately subjective; what one person loves another person loathes."
leo,2017-02-07,"You're extremely selective about where you put your energy today because it seems like there's less to go around. You're more emotional and reactionary now, motivating you to keep your preferences private rather than broadcasting them to the world. However, cerebral Mercury moves into your 7th House of Others, inviting you to conceptualize your closest relationships differently. Remember, it's never a good idea to base a permanent decision on a temporary feeling."
virgo,2017-02-07,"You wake up to a totally different world where responsibilities don't seem as pressing and you're able to breathe a little easier. Tensions dissipate and connections are friendlier. Meanwhile, logical Mercury enters your 6th House of Habits, inspiring you to reprogram your self-care regimen to optimal settings. It's not helpful to settle back into old routines that no longer serve your purpose. C.S. Lewis wrote, ""You are never too old to set another goal and to dream a new dream."""

Lady Gaga said, ""You have to be unique and different to shine in your own way."""
scorpio,2017-02-07,"There is magic that goes on beneath the surface and your thoughts turn to the roots from which your words grow. The sensitive Cancer Moon plunges you into emotional realms while your psychological foundations receive a thorough exam by discerning Mercury. There is an unlikely synergy between how you feel and what you think, preventing you from being overwhelmed by one or the other. Create your own path based on the best of both worlds."
sagittarius,2017-02-07,"A new energy stimulates your brain today, but this isn't the same buzz as the recent shallow conversational vibe. You're turning over unorthodox concepts in your mind, hungry to seek new perspectives and hash them out. Brilliant realizations arrive but you're unlikely to stand by quietly if someone disagrees with your revelations. Your point of view may be more subjective than you think, so work hard to identify what makes good sense versus your emotional attachments. David Icke teaches, ""The greatest prison people live in is the fear of what other people think."""
capricorn,2017-02-07,"You're motivated to get a handle on your bottom line, even if it means implementing a completely new budget. Analytical Mercury sets up camp in rational Aquarius, placing your 2nd House of Finances under the microscope. It's satisfying to work out the logistics of a new plan, but sometimes solutions come from seeking with the heart, not just the head. Don't neglect your closest relationships in favor of your fiscal goals; your support network is stronger than you think."
aquarius,2017-02-07,"Expressing your thoughts comes naturally and you may automatically push emotions to the side. Agile Mercury steps into your sign, imbuing your personality with a cool objectivity and allowing you to communicate your ideas with clarity. However, even a kettle on the back burner can heat up enough to draw your attention. Instincts don't just disappear, so pay attention to how you feel underneath the chatty exterior. All the logic in the world can't save your heart."
pisces,2017-02-07,"Your thoughts turn inward today and you want to keep your ideas secret. Mercury's foray into unorthodox Aquarius sparkles in your 12th House of Privacy, giving you just enough light to sort through your confidential files. At the same time, the coy Cancer Moon glides through your 5th House of Romance, urging you to connect with others. Create the space you need to embark on your metaphysical journey. Joy is portable; take it with you."
aries,2017-02-08,"It's almost like the ground beneath you has liquefied and maintaining your composure is a challenging task today. The reactive Cancer Moon's connection with inventive Uranus inspires a risky plan of action and you wish others would just trust you even if your ideas sound crazy. Luckily, emotions are known for their transient nature and every storm dies down eventually. Riding the current as it carries you is wiser than trying to tame the entire sea."
taurus,2017-02-08,"Your emotions are extremely distracting today as turbulence rocks the boat when you least expect it. Conversations meant to defuse the situation might end up striking an unintentional chord, causing contention to escalate to another level. Luckily, an argument in the heat of the moment is likely to be as fleeting as the emotions that spark them. As long as you remain kind while defending your position, there's no point in worrying about things you can't control."
gemini,2017-02-08,"You're content to take it easy and enjoy some familiar comforts now rather than branching out. However, surprise invitations from friends and colleagues may have you feeling conflicted. You hate to miss out on the fun and games, but you prefer not to take a gamble today. You might be concerned about what others will think if you politely decline, but it's important to do what's best for you. Being honest with everyone right from the start reduces the chances of receiving any backlash. Thankfully, there's no need to justify your choices to anyone else."
cancer,2017-02-08,"Your receiver is turned up too high and you're surprised by the amount of feedback you are getting now. The impressionable Moon in your sign reflects shocking Uranus and preposterous Jupiter, putting you on the spot. Although you may feel like you must go to extremes to regain power, overreactions will only make the situation worse. Try not to take things too personally; staying conscious as you respond to the changing tides of the day will enable you to choose your battles wisely."
leo,2017-02-08,"You crave a break from the action and you're willing to go as far as to invent a tale of questionable magnitude to ensure you won't be disturbed. It's perfectly acceptable to keep your feelings private as the vulnerable Cancer Moon slinks through your 12th House of Rest, even if you feel like others are questioning why you're not taking the lead. Telling the truth is more efficient than wasting time hiding your real intentions. You may be a great actor, but you don't always have to turn your explanation into a performance."
virgo,2017-02-08,"Your attention meanders from the beaten path as you imagine your ideal future while the security-conscious Cancer Moon wanders through your 11th House of Long-Term Goals. It seems extremely important to reach for your aspirations now, but you might want to hold off on beginning an ambitious fundraising project until the gullible Moon is out from under the influence of radical Uranus. Ideas which seem wildly innovative now may seem ridiculously silly tomorrow."
libra,2017-02-08,"You're in need of reassurance but it's hard to find stable ground in the current emotional atmosphere. Your closest relationships are charged with electricity, crackling with the risk of offending someone with one wrong word. Although your nerves may be on edge today, you still hope to gloss over disagreements and create harmonious connections. Trusting in your natural peace-making abilities to handle conflict leads to your success."
scorpio,2017-02-08,"You are longing to escape and unwind on your own personal tropical island. Unfortunately, you can daydream all you want but the doubts and worries that drive you into fantasy-land will remain whether you face them or not. Luckily, the Moon's dynamic connection to brilliant Uranus provides a sudden inspiration to shake you out of your reverie, inspiring you to inject variety into your normal routine to cure a case of the blahs. A healthy dose of spontaneity allows your creativity to sparkle."
sagittarius,2017-02-08,"It seems like you can't get what you want today as your need for meaningful connection is at cross-purposes with your desire to be completely free of commitments. The sensitive Cancer Moon clashes with rebellious Uranus, pitting your emotions against your wild side. Fortunately, the situation may stabilize naturally when a trusted friend is willing to hear you out. Maintaining an open mind is the fastest way to personal growth."
capricorn,2017-02-08,"You're walking on eggshells trying to cater to the feelings of others today. You want to be supportive of your closest companions as the protective Cancer Moon swims through your 7th House of Relationships, but it can be hard to know what to say when logic seems lost in the emotional fog. Your mind may wander to your work during the middle of a heart-to-heart conversation with a friend in need, but don't let impatience ruin the moment. Being present is a gift; paying it forward tends to come back around when you need it most."
aquarius,2017-02-08,"You may find yourself operating on autopilot today, falling back on old habits as a way to distract yourself from the emotional turbulence that seems to lurk around every corner. If you lean too much on the daily grind and don't address the swirling feelings, you might lash out verbally when the needy Cancer Moon gets rattled by rebellious Uranus in your 3rd House of Speech. Adding calming elements like a candle or soothing music to your work environment alleviates stress, making it easier to handle the inclement emotional weather. A moment of meditation offers you a glimpse of the silver lining in the dark cloud."
pisces,2017-02-08,"Your friends and loved ones flock to you for consolation because your presence acts as a calming influence on them. You may be feeling just as emotional as they are today, but the nurturing Cancer Moon's presence in your 5th House of Self-Expression makes all your words feel like a warm blanket to those who need them. Sometimes offering someone an inspirational message can be just as uplifting for you, so take your own advice when you tell others that everything will be alright."
aries,2017-02-09,"There's a spring in your step and a song on your lips as the emotional rain ceases and you head for higher ground. You're looking to get into a little mischief now that the Moon is in fellow Fire sign Leo, but it's all in the name of a good time. Toning it down doesn't seem like an option as your enthusiasm overflows into all of your interactions, drawing some friendly moths to a flame but provoking claims of self-indulgence from others. Don't let someone dim your light, just because it's shining in their eyes."
taurus,2017-02-09,"It only takes one try to get your engine started today as your motivation fuels you to catch up on things that have fallen through the cracks. Something compels you to pick up the pace when you might otherwise take more time to work through your tasks. Fortunately, you don't need to understand where this extra boost of energy is coming from to utilize it. Raising the bar of excellence now will make the reward of relaxation even sweeter at the end of the day."
gemini,2017-02-09,"Your visions may be larger than life, but your message is infused with a performer's flare today. Convincing your pals to listen to your notions comes without much effort thanks to the dramatic Leo Moon's dance through your 3rd House of Communication. Keep in mind that you're sure to rouse passions for better or worse with this impressive oratory power at your fingertips. Your words spread like wildfire now -- it's up to you whether they scathe or inspire."
cancer,2017-02-09,"A new sense of certainty allows you to stride toward your ambitions with renewed fervor. It's easier to walk with your head held higher when the Moon struts into confident Leo, accentuating your 2nd House of Self-Worth. You're eager to take your future goals into your own hands today, knowing you can rely on your unwavering self-determination. Be mindful of overextending your resources; overestimating your capacity will land you in a state of exhaustion if you don't pace yourself with care. Transformation rarely happens overnight."
leo,2017-02-09,"It seems like everything you touch turns to gold today. However, you may discover something which will elevate your game from good to great if you can tear your eyes away from your personal magic show. Conditions are right for collaboration when an electric Sun-Uranus connection lights up your 7th House of Others, attracting original ideas from a partner or friend. While it's gratifying to take all the credit for doing something on your own, sometimes a synergistic relationship is more satisfying for the heart."
virgo,2017-02-09,"You're content enough going about your daily tasks as usual but your internal conversations are cutting to the core of your heart today. As you autopilot through your workload, intimate conversations play out in your imagination, allowing you to reconsider the secrets you choose to keep from the outside world. Although you're not likely to discuss your discoveries with everyone, opening your heart to the right person can fulfill your desire to connect on a deeper level without the discomfort of putting your feelings on public display. Vulnerability is an act of courage."
libra,2017-02-09,"You're glowing with an alluring brilliance today, and no one can escape your charm. If your goal is to win people over, the cosmos is offering you a friendly assist as the animated Leo Moon shines in your 11th House of Networking. Your ability to grab and hold the attention of your audience gives you direct control of your social volume knob, whether you're looking to make professional connections or develop a closer bond with someone you admire. Although your popularity appears to be on the rise, make sure you express appreciation to those who are already your biggest fans. Quality over quantity is worth remembering, especially when it comes to friends."
scorpio,2017-02-09,"Your quiet confidence can be intimidating sometimes, but today holds an opportunity to temper your ambitious intensity with a dose of congeniality and charm. The regal Leo Moon turns your 10th House of Status into her throne room, demanding recognition for your efforts. Fortunately, Luna also connects with resourceful Venus and go-getter Mars, backing up your claims to fame with authentic elbow grease. However, unless you take care to harness your passionate work ethic and boundless energy, this dynamic combination could simply inflate your sense of self-importance instead of winning you credibility. Humility is your secret weapon for success."
sagittarius,2017-02-09,"Time flies by and you're flying with it, soaring above the doubts of the mundane world. Keeping pace with your latest projects is hardly an issue when they seem so aligned with your larger scale dreams. You're catching every updraft and nothing can ground you for long; your exhilaration is contagious and inspiring to many. However, as you push the envelope that contains your ideas, there's a risk you might be pushing someone's buttons at the same time. Although there's no reason to hold back your zeal, don't be surprised if you encounter a few raised eyebrows along the way. William Shakespeare advised, ""To thine own self be true."""
capricorn,2017-02-09,"You may prefer to keep yourself safely locked in a stone castle lined with your tactical plans for success, but sometimes you need to open the doors to let some fresh air in. The deeper rooms of your fortress are lit by the glow of the fiery Leo Moon flirting with a passionate Mars-Venus pairing, urging you to acknowledge the needs you typically classify as less pressing than material concerns. The truth is that confiding in a trustworthy ally about these inner yearnings allows you to feel more comfortable in your own skin. Closing your eyes to your feelings doesn't make them go away."
aquarius,2017-02-09,"You are certain you have an answer to every question as you delight in any chance for engaging in spirited discourse today. You may not know how to solve the world's problems, but you're certainly in your element as irreverent Uranus shoots innovative ideas to the radiant Sun in your 1st House of Personality. It's not always about simple solutions in your brand of cerebral conversation; you're interested in discussing a topic even when it doesn't lead to a solid conclusion. Luckily, these theatrics are likely to be enlightening for all when you prioritize inclusion rather than getting on a soapbox. Listen as much as you talk."
pisces,2017-02-09,"While others appear to constantly strive toward receiving personal accolades, you often feel quite differently about the definition of success. Paying it forward can often be more gratifying for a compassionate Pisces than any number of compliments. With the Moon's movement into loyal Leo and your 6th House of Service, you find that investing your time and effort to a worthy cause or person in need fulfills your purpose in a deeply satisfying way. Nevertheless, be sure your gestures of generosity reflect a sincere desire to help rather than giving in the spirit of sacrifice. Act with authenticity or don't act at all."
aries,2017-02-10,"If you've allowed pressure to build up inside, the release valve is pulled today. You may engage in a childish foot-stomping display of emotion as the theatrical Leo Full Moon is eclipsed in your 5th House of Self-Expression. Prevent an embarrassing spectacle by tapping into the objectivity of Mercury in Aquarius, whose friendly connection with amicable Venus inspires you to stay calm, cool and collected when expressing your desires. Benjamin Franklin said, ""If passion drives you, let reason hold the reins."""
taurus,2017-02-10,"Finding balance between your professional life and your personal life is tenuous at best today, and you may just want to throw your hands up in the air and walk off the job early. It's impossible to ignore issues at home while the dramatic Leo Lunar Eclipse shakes your 4th House of Foundations. It could be time to call a family meeting and address everyone's concerns, but perhaps you need to call an assembly with your inner council more than anything. You may have to dig deep to unearth your true priorities, but you might strike gold if you stay the course."
gemini,2017-02-10,"Your big ideas don't fit into the space of a daily conversation, yet you're grappling with how to share them with others. Although you're speaking straight from the heart, your unrealistic ideals become painfully clear as the expressive Leo Full Moon is eclipsed in your 3rd House of Speech. Fortunately, a friendly link between artful Venus and brainy Mercury facilitates organized articulation of your ideas as long as you slow down long enough to think before you talk."
cancer,2017-02-10,"Where you spend your resources is always your choice, and those choices are now clearly laid out in front of you. Sometimes it's easier to invest in others rather than yourself, but the Leo Lunar Eclipse is centered in your 2nd House of Self-Worth and there's no hiding from the realizations it illuminates. You cannot truly give to those you love without being emotionally whole yourself. Being completely honest about your values is the most direct route to happiness."
leo,2017-02-10,"You're ready to roar and you don't care who hears you today. The loud and proud Leo Lunar Eclipse magnifies your 1st House of Personality, centering all your thoughts on your personal ambitions and your rightful place in the world. You're correct in believing that you shouldn't let anyone dim your candle just because they're uncomfortable with your brightness, but self-confidence can quickly turn to arrogance if you disregard the feelings of those closest to you. Take the high road and treat others with the same respect you expect for yourself."
virgo,2017-02-10,"You may want to slip into your own private fantasy world where you are admired and respected for all your hard work. However, dreams only come true when you possess the courage to bring them to reality. The warm Leo Lunar Eclipse rattles your 12th House of Secrecy, pointing out where the real you is hiding. Meanwhile, mental Mercury sketches out a plan to infuse more authenticity to your daily life. Small changes in habits add up to big transformations. Take the necessary steps toward a more genuine you."
libra,2017-02-10,"You could be so invested in being a part of something that you haven't noticed your personality adapting to fit in. Everything changes when the animated Leo Lunar Eclipse casts the spotlight on group dynamics in your 11th House of Friends. If people aren't encouraging you to shine brighter, it could be time to ask yourself if you're being genuine or just putting on a show to please everyone. Affable Venus and talkative Mercury team up to help you find a creative way to say what you mean without stirring up unnecessary drama."
scorpio,2017-02-10,"Moderation hasn't crossed your mind today because your brain is running on overdrive with a full plate of hearty ambition. The boastful Leo Full Moon emphasizes your 10th House of Status, demanding the recognition you feel you deserve. You're willing to ruthlessly claw your way to your goals if that's what it takes. If you truly want to be respected for your achievements, speak your intentions softly, honor your commitments and make a daily concerted effort toward progress."
sagittarius,2017-02-10,"You're ready to throw yourself into your quest as the passionate Leo Lunar Eclipse burns in your 9th House of Vision. You can see yourself soaring above everyone else when you close your eyes, but a bird's eye view is only one way to look at the world. Spare some of your enthusiasm for the smaller details that will support your grand goals. Your faith is unstoppable; now you need to pack all the necessary provisions before rushing out the door to meet your dreams."
capricorn,2017-02-10,"You're all business on the outside, but the desire for deep connection is ignited within you. The loyal Leo Full Moon is a Lunar Eclipse in your 8th House of Intimacy and you feel almost obsessive about strengthening the bonds of your closest relationships. If your search for affection is driven by a fear of not being loved, it's best to address these questions of self-worth honestly rather than ignoring the problem. Reconciliation within your heart leads to greater intimacy with the most significant people in your life."
aquarius,2017-02-10,"It seems like there's not enough space for one more ego in the room today as the bombastic Leo Lunar Eclipse grandstands in your 7th House of Others. People may be putting on a show, expecting you to be the adoring audience, but you have your own opinions that you wish to make heard. Fortunately, a favorable aspect between charming Venus and chatty Mercury sweetens your words, allowing you to offer feedback without hurting anyone's feelings. Mary Poppins advised, ""A spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down."""
pisces,2017-02-10,"You want to do what's best for the greater good, but you're feeling left out today, as if no one sees how devoted you are to doing what's right. The melodramatic Leo Full Moon rocks your 6th House of Service, emphasizing all the little things you do for those around you. You may feel a tinge of resentment if you aren't receiving praise for your contributions, but remember that loyalty doesn't require sacrifice. Don't overextend yourself in search of a pat on the back. There's no need to trade in your authenticity for approval."
aries,2017-02-11,"Although you're well suited to charging ahead with no one telling you what to do, collaboration is favored today. Group discussion can act as a feedback loop that magnifies collective aspirations, creating the perfect environment for brainstorming. However, you're so eager to get your hands dirty that you may grow restless, ready for less talk and more action. As long as you're honest and give others room for the same frankness, you will find your place to do what you do best."

Your ambitions seem crystal clear now, making it simple to tailor your daily routine to support them.

Thankfully, you can bring your philosophizing down to earth and incorporate it into your personal expression. It seems like there's room in every conversation to slip in a nugget of wisdom, and you're happy to share what moves you. However, you may end up talking circles around people when you throw in too many technical details. Stick to broad concepts and your passion will send an inspirational message to the world."
cancer,2017-02-11,"You feel like opening all the windows of your heart to let the breeze in. Your inner sky has cleared to blue today, and you can finally take a long deep breath. This space to breathe is perfect for journaling your thoughts as the detail-oriented Virgo Moon graces your 3rd House of Writing. Exploring your feelings is less disorienting now, and might lead to a greater sense of peace without the turmoil that sometimes accompanies soul-searching. Rune Lazuli wrote, ""Inside the chaos, build a temple of love."""
leo,2017-02-11,"Contentions melt away to be replaced with gracious conversations today. It's easier to see everyone's point of view now as you objectively find value in what others have to say. You're likely to learn more about your companions when you're willing to listen and share equally. At the same time, the analytical Virgo Moon expects perfection and you're unwilling to let anything slip through the cracks. Your critical eye could turn to a critical mouth, so do your best to temper your observations with an open-minded perspective."
virgo,2017-02-11,"In your mind, growing your wealth is a reflection of a strong work ethic and personal integrity. You take special pride in your accomplishments now that the astute Aquarius Sun aligns with auspicious Jupiter in your 2nd House of Money. Making the pragmatic choice is easy when you see the relationship between your daily spending habits and your inflow of funds, allowing you to iron out wrinkles in your budget with your trademark attention to detail. However, if you get too caught up in perfecting your plan, you could create unnecessary stress. From little things, big things grow."
libra,2017-02-11,"You seem to be in touch with your inner artist, bolstering your confidence in aesthetic endeavors. Cultivate your creative side today, whether that means settling in with a sketchbook, playing your guitar, or just styling yourself in a way that reflects your mood. However, the critical Virgo Moon's presence in your 12th House of Privacy may make it tricky to decide what you want to show to others and what you want to hold back for further polishing. Bob Fosse said, ""Don't dance for the audience; dance for yourself."""
scorpio,2017-02-11,"You're not sure if you're up to making plans today and you may find yourself vacillating a few times before deciding. There's a lot weighing on your mind these days and it seems like you're able to recall memories from the past with greater objectivity. Keeping a cool head while sifting through mental images from childhood allows you to enjoy them more, as well as glean information to integrate into your present day world. Rumi wrote, ""Life is a balance of holding on and letting go."""
sagittarius,2017-02-11,"You want to tell the world about your big ideas and you're in a perfect position to know your subject inside and out. Your high-minded ideals are funneled into your social space today, and it seems like everyone is all ears. The radiant Sun and boisterous Jupiter team up to magnify your oratory skills, sending you surfing on a wave of confidence. However, you might come across as overbearing or condescending if you are too self-righteous in your presentation. Preaching to the choir is a waste of time when you could ask them to sing with you instead."
capricorn,2017-02-11,"Your professional future looks bright as your aspirations and values are in harmony. The puzzle pieces seem to be fitting together and you're hopeful that things will keep going in this direction.

Theodore Roosevelt said, ""Keep your eyes on the stars and your feet on the ground."""
aquarius,2017-02-11,"A cosmic link is established between your future plans and your present self. You see where you want to go in stunning clarity, and you can almost feel the wind at your back, blowing you to your destination.

Irrational fears only impede your progress, so address any waffling now so you can quickly get back to manifesting your dreams. Act now or forever hold your peace."
pisces,2017-02-11,"It feels like you're interviewing yourself today. Get ready to take notes, because you can learn a lot if you remain open. The resistance you usually encounter when dredging up psychological issues is nowhere to be found, and you approach this shadow work with faith rather than dread. You may be eager to share your discoveries, but hesitation creeps up behind you when you start to wonder if others will understand your realizations the same way you do. It's okay if they don't; sometimes the greatest blessings are the ones that you cherish in your heart."
aries,2017-02-12,"There's simply no time to beat around the bush today because you couldn't fit another task in edgewise if you tried. You're finally sorting out kinks in your day-to-day life that sometimes get neglected due to other priorities, and the sensible Virgo Moon's trine to powerful Pluto injects passionate drive into your plans. You're convinced that you can finish everything if you just keep plodding ahead. Author Jim Rohn wrote, ""Discipline is the bridge between goals and accomplishment."""
taurus,2017-02-12,"You're trying to keep track of all the little things you agreed to do today, and your head is spinning before you know it. Once you think about the plethora of projects you want to manage, you realize how much there is to do and how little time there is available. It's overwhelming to look at a million puzzle pieces strewn about; identify which pieces go together easily and you can make more progress. However, it's acceptable to choose to put some tasks off until tomorrow if you feel like you're taking on too much. Honesty will get you further than over-commitment in the long run."
gemini,2017-02-12,"You notice there are plenty of loose ends to tie up around the house today. The drudgery of chores may not be very exciting, but cleaning your physical space can be imagined as a parallel to cleaning your mental space. The dutiful Virgo Moon urges you to roll up your sleeves and knock out domestic tasks while a favorable connection to powerhouse Pluto deepens your investment in creating a healthy environment. Tidy house, tidy mind."
cancer,2017-02-12,"There's no time to slow down as your list grows longer by the minute. It feels as if you don't have a choice but to add another errand to your agenda. However, there are only so many hours in a day and so much gas in your tank. The obedient Virgo Moon nudges you toward compliance, but an awkward connection between mental Mercury and wounded Chiron reminds you that sometimes words aren't enough. Putting your heart into just one or two things is better than scattering your energy between several commitments. You can do anything, but you can't do everything."
leo,2017-02-12,"There is more than enough to keep you busy as you embark on an organizational binge. The satisfaction of completing one project after another can become addicting, motivating you to stick your finger in even more pies. You may be led to believe that your self-worth is dependent on your accomplishments as the virtuous Virgo Moon travels through your 2nd House of Assets. However, trusting your intuition rather than just the numbers can bring you more gratification. Albert Einstein wrote, ""Not everything that counts can be counted."""
virgo,2017-02-12,"You may be obsessive about setting things right, and others might just stay out of your way for fear of being alphabetized right along with your files. Your desire to catalogue and coordinate every detail is admirable, but life cannot always be color-coded with all its shades of gray. Your key planet Mercury exchanges an unpleasant glance with healer Chiron in your 7th House of Relationships, reminding you that not everything can be calculated. Sometimes you must be willing to share your feelings without depending on data to back you up."
libra,2017-02-12,"An elusive mental itch grows stronger, and although it's difficult to pinpoint, this anxiety is pervasive in its ability to keep you on edge. Finding the right words to express what you mean doesn't come easily, but a solution may be closer than you think. Spending some time alone will help clear your mind today, even if it's just a few minutes of fresh air. Ironically, tapping into your feelings clarifies your thoughts, allowing you to speak honestly from the heart even if it's uncomfortable. Brene Brown wrote, ""What makes you vulnerable makes you beautiful."""
scorpio,2017-02-12,"You may be wondering why you thought you could squeeze so many activities into your schedule today. Social engagements begin to feel like obligations when you stack too many on top of each other. Something will have to give for you to be able to truly enjoy the time you allotted to spending with your friends. There's no reason to make yourself miserable by spreading yourself too thin. Consult your intuition to determine how much interaction you can handle now. Basketball coach Jerry Dunn said, ""Don't limit your challenges, challenge your limits."""
sagittarius,2017-02-12,"You're not interested in settling for anything less than perfection today, and you're not afraid to tell everyone. You wouldn't want anyone to think you couldn't accomplish something, so you keep pretending you can handle it in an attempt to save your reputation. However, others probably aren't dissecting your every move, and it's pointless to try to prove yourself to people who aren't paying as much attention as you think. Instead of being a jack of all trades and a master of none, demonstrate your ability to finish what you start."
capricorn,2017-02-12,"You always like to be prepared, which is why it's comforting to take the time to do your due diligence. However, what begins as covering your bases may turn into an unnerving number of prerequisites you believe you must accomplish before your next big move. However, you're so invested in your future that you may not know when to call it quits. Pay attention to how you feel in the midst of your research rather than depending exclusively on facts and figures. Your emotions have more to teach you than you think."
aquarius,2017-02-12,"You prefer facts over abstractions today, but deep emotions complicate your quest to set things straight. Sometimes feelings aren't linear or logical, especially when it comes to relationships. The meticulous Virgo Moon stirs up your 8th House of Intimacy, urging you to get into the nitty-gritty logistics of your emotional commitments. The further you delve, the less your rational mind is in charge. Some bonds go deeper than words if you're willing to let vulnerability lead the way."
pisces,2017-02-12,"You want to wait on a special someone hand and foot, but eventually there comes a point when it's impractical. Nevertheless, you somehow still think you can fulfill all their needs and yours in the space of a day. At some point, you must accept your limits and realize that it doesn't reflect badly on you as a person if you can't juggle everything at once. If you slow down long enough to get out of your head, you may notice that all it really takes to make someone's day is a few kind words of love and appreciation."
aries,2017-02-13,"Planning out your day enables you to make the most of your time. It seems like nothing could go wrong when you have every detail in place, but you soon find that your narrow focus  allows broader considerations to be left out of the picture. Aligning the small with the large is the only way to proceed successfully now, even if it seems like you could get more done by ignoring the future in favor of the present. The Moon's shift into affable Libra lightens your mood and alleviates mental strain. Henri Matisse wrote, ""What I dream of is an art of balance."""
taurus,2017-02-13,"Your mind is set on riding your hobby horse to your heart's content. You don't want to give up any of your spare time to other obligations today, but your fixation on your projects may be placing stress on the people closest to you. The industrious Virgo Moon is challenged by responsible Saturn in your 8th House of Shared Resources, revealing how much you're taking away from others to feed your own pursuits. Whether it's time or money, you must create a healthy balance of giving and receiving for everyone to be satisfied."
gemini,2017-02-13,"Once you hit your stride organizing your ideas, you don't want to slow down until you have everything just right. However, promises to people hang over your head, and you feel like you must choose between tending your own garden and watering someone else's. Until you find a way to accommodate your plans and the needs of others, you probably won't get much done. Luckily, a special connection between your key planet Mercury and innovative Uranus delivers a creative solution just in the nick of time."
cancer,2017-02-13,"One task leads to another today, and before you know it you're tweaking little things that you typically don't even notice. It feels constructive to tend to the tiniest details while the efficient Virgo Moon sorts through your 3rd House of Immediate Environment. However, you can't help but realize that your nit-picking detracts from your normal routine when stern Saturn steps in. The challenge is to satisfy your need for perfection without falling behind on daily chores. Discernment and discipline are your key ingredients for success."
leo,2017-02-13,"Anything you invest time or money in must be worth your while. You don't see a reason to compromise your high standards today, and all purchases need to pass your strict evaluation. You're willing to go above and beyond to find the perfect fit as the shrewd Virgo Moon emphasizes your 2nd House of Material Possessions. However, Luna's encounter with mature Saturn warns you that trying to score the best deal isn't always in your best interest. Happily, establishing middle ground is easier when the Moon relaxes into gracious Libra, reminding you that the best things in life are not things."
virgo,2017-02-13,"Putting extra effort into your personal presentation is at the forefront of your mind now. You hope to give the right impression and may spend more time in front of the mirror today, making sure every hair is in place. It's not that you want to steal the show, but you believe improving your image might cast you in a more favorable light. Focusing so much on your appearance distracts you from more important matters. Fortunately, a brilliant Mercury-Uranus connection delivers a sudden insight that frees your mind from its self-imposed cage. Be beautiful from the inside out."
libra,2017-02-13,"A mental block may keep you from verbally expressing your feelings today. Your brain is tied in a knot, and the harder you pull the tighter it gets. The good news is that you won't have to struggle with this tangled mess for long. Once Luna moves out of her contentious alignment with suppressive Saturn and into your charming sign, your communication troubles will be a thing of the past. In fact, radical new ideas begin to arrive out of nowhere, renewing your confidence in your creative powers. Breakthroughs require equal amounts of faith and risk."
scorpio,2017-02-13,"A special insight is hiding in the noise of the day, so subtle and quiet that you might miss it if you're not paying attention. This gift from a creative Mercury-Uranus connection sends you into long-term planning mode, and you're ready to sign the dotted line and board the train to your dreams. However, you may have to rearrange your budget to accommodate new expenses to make these hopes a reality. This isn't a deal-breaker, but if you ignore this piece of the equation you will need to start over from scratch down the line. Establish a solid financial framework first before launching your plan into space."
sagittarius,2017-02-13,"Your professional goals are top priority as you appear to have a sharper vision for all things work-related today. Your quest for excellence appears to falter, and in your search for the reason why you may not think to look in the mirror. If your heart isn't in resonance with your ambitions, you could be the one holding yourself back. Happily, fluidity returns as the Moon moves from worrisome Virgo to light-hearted Libra, and problems won't seem so insurmountable. Zig Ziglar wrote, ""It's your attitude, not your aptitude, that determines your altitude."""
capricorn,2017-02-13,"Your bags are all packed for your next big adventure, but something keeps you from walking out your door. Sometimes taking a step back from all the facts allows them to fall into place. The rational Virgo Moon urges you to control every moving piece, but a square from austere Saturn in your 12th House of Privacy warns that you must spend some time alone to allow your thoughts to coalesce. Fortunately, Luna's shift to cooperative Libra introduces a greater sense of mobility. Everything you say or do in life is a choice."
aquarius,2017-02-13,"Your pals are the first to notice that something is off today, and getting through a conversation is a challenge on both sides. It might seem like you're stuck in a stalemate until you find a way to share what's going on inside emotionally. Fortunately, an inventive connection between communicative Mercury and your key planet Uranus gives you the right words to express just what you mean. Expect the unexpected to come out of your mouth. Spontaneity is your friend."
pisces,2017-02-13,"It seems like no matter how hard you try to lay out all the details, no one really understands what you mean. In fact, the more you explain, the deeper you dig yourself into a hole. The fastidious Virgo Moon promises that additional facts will prove your point, but a stressful square from serious Saturn warns you to pare down your over-justification. Fortunately, integration becomes possible when the Moon moves from compulsive Virgo to conciliatory Libra and your 8th House of Intimacy. Making your case is more about timing than anything else."
aries,2017-02-14,"You may not be sure what others expect of you today. It's tough to choose your next move while the indecisive Libra Moon graces your 7th House of Relationships, but this good-natured influence encourages you to do what's best for everyone. Fortunately, a link between karmic Saturn and the illuminating Sun reminds you of your principles, giving you something solid on which to base your decisions. Honoring your commitments with integrity makes you a hero in someone else's eyes."
taurus,2017-02-14,"The long process of self-analysis is going on underneath the surface; although this inner work is a special kind of challenge, you possess the resilience to see it through. The best way to show appreciation to others today isn't by going overboard with outlandish gifts. The compassionate Libra Moon highlights your 6th House of Service, encouraging simple donations of your time and effort to help someone in need. Maya Angelou extolled, ""Try to be a rainbow in someone's cloud."""
gemini,2017-02-14,"Your main goal is to make people smile today, and your innate knack for lightening the mood works in your favor. However, lasting bonds of trust are made from different stuff than the fleeting ones of flirtation. Fortunately, structured Saturn and the honorable Sun are in your corner now, giving you the strength to sort things out with others when it would be easier to crack a joke and pretend nothing is wrong. You can have the best of both worlds if you allow communication to flow as a two-way street."
cancer,2017-02-14,"Keeping up with your daily schedule is demanding when it seems like there's always another level to which you must rise. However, your natural tenacity is reinforced by a grounding Sun-Saturn connection, empowering you to do the legwork without cracking under pressure. One of the best parts about putting in a full day of work is coming home to a peaceful environment, and the sweet Libra Moon in your 4th House of Family invites a sense of serenity to your abode. No matter the nature of your living situation, the spirit of compromise inspires you to do your part to bring harmony to your world."
leo,2017-02-14,"You possess the gift of gab today as you shape your words with tact and kindness. Flattery isn't the focus as a mature Sun-Saturn configuration fortifies your sense of authenticity. This sensible combination allows you to be yourself while calming the waters rather than rocking the boat. Honesty is the best policy; this cosmic power boost helps you make room for both your self-interest and the feelings of others. Ralph Marston wrote, ""You were born to be real, not to be perfect."""
virgo,2017-02-14,"Cultivating a healthy balance between your professional obligations and your personal life requires a special type of discipline. It's worth it to persevere through a tough day at work when you can use the fruits of your labor to show your appreciation to others. The romantic Libra Moon strolls through your 2nd House of Material Things, inspiring you to find the perfect way to brighten someone's day. H. Jackson Brown Jr. wrote, ""Love is when the other person's happiness is more important than your own."""
libra,2017-02-14,"You do your best to make people happy, hoping for amicable relationships with everyone you meet. Your signature finesse is on point today as the Moon promenades through your diplomatic sign, emphasizing your desire to play peacemaker. Paradoxically, the key to keeping others satisfied is by sticking to a single message rather than vacillating back and forth trying to accommodate everyone. A favorable Sun-Saturn aspect lends gravity to your words and consistency to your statements, enabling you to keep communication lines open for the sake of establishing common ground."
scorpio,2017-02-14,"You may feel like bowing out on the social scene to avoid any hassles today. You want to create a loving environment in which to exist so when others join you it's easy to be peaceful together. Fortunately, the Sun and Saturn are your allies now, coaching you to make wise choices when it comes to how you spend your energy. Whatever you do now, keep your heart open to the element of surprise. John Vanbrugh wrote, ""Love, like a virtue, is its own reward."""
sagittarius,2017-02-14,"There's an effervescence about the day which is perfect for hanging out with friends and letting loose. No matter how you choose to spend your time, societal expectations don't seem to hold as much weight as the uplifting feeling you get from being around your tribe. Should any difficulties arise today, an affirmative Sun-Saturn sextile helps you stick to your beliefs rather than being swayed by outside opinions. Speaking with integrity demonstrates your strength of character."
capricorn,2017-02-14,"The lust in your world is for your professional ambitions today. The stylish Libra Moon glides through your 10th House of Public Image, prompting you to preen your feathers and put your best foot forward as you move toward your goals. At the same time, the value of privacy is becoming crystal clear as you realize how much better you feel when you recharge on a regular basis. The more you commit to self-care, the higher you can aim."
aquarius,2017-02-14,"You're confident that showing everyone the bigger picture is the fastest way to ease troubled minds. You're right; it's useful to have a bird's eye view to get the lay of the land. However, it's all too easy to be overly subjective in thinking your ideas are the ones that will change everything. Philosophizing is a great start; but if you really want to make a difference now, collaborate with like-minded people to blaze a new path to unity. Margaret Mead said, ""Never believe that a few caring people can't change the world. For, indeed, that's all who ever have."""
pisces,2017-02-14,"Dreams of perfect love may drift through your imagination today, but reality is the same as ever. Truthfully, the most beautiful moments come in times of simple togetherness with all its imperfections. Not every relationship sparkles as you wish, but even amid the hard times you're willing to make an effort to get on the same page with the people you love. The gracious Libra Moon in your 8th House of Deep Sharing facilitates  bonding and holding space for your emotions as well as theirs."
aries,2017-02-15,"Underlying tension may have you tiptoeing around the feelings of others, unsure how to proceed. Delicate conversations are not necessarily your forte, but trying to avoid obvious strain between you and another person will only aggravate the issue. Instead of sidestepping accountability, own your words and deeds. Everyone will appreciate it if you're honest from the beginning rather than letting pressure build until an explosion is the only release. Accepting responsibility for your actions is a sign of a strong leader."
taurus,2017-02-15,"Sometimes you get more done when you start with the easiest tasks and leave the most challenging ones until later. However, this clever technique only works if you're not using it as an excuse to put off hard work indefinitely. It could feel as if circumstances are impeding your progress today, regardless of your determination. Fortunately, your efforts will eventually produce results if you maintain a positive outlook. Don't procrastinate now when success is just around the corner."
gemini,2017-02-15,"The ride is a little bumpy today as you try to adapt to the shifting moods around you. You can take both sides of any discussion, but it's difficult for even you adaptable Geminis to keep up as the push and pull requires you to continuously alter your message. The sociable Libra Moon highlights your 5th House of Self-Expression, prompting you to put on a happy face even in the midst of stress. While honeyed words may soften the blow, embellishing your speech won't help anyone. Approaching conflict with integrity is always your best bet."
cancer,2017-02-15,"Coming home is like hitting the reset button for you most days, allowing you to gather your feelings and return to your comfort zone. However, a complicated domestic life could change the energy overnight. You might even be inclined to go out in order to avoid the uncomfortable atmosphere. However, the sooner you clear the air, the sooner you can relax in an environment that soothes your soul. Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""For every minute you remain angry, you give up sixty seconds of peace of mind."""
leo,2017-02-15,"You're trying to steer conversations in a positive direction, but new information keeps being added to the equation and you're not sure how to respond. At one moment, it seems like one person is telling you to stop goofing off, and then the next instant someone else is persuading you to play hooky. You may end up over-promising when the polite Libra Moon in your 3rd House of Communication conspires with exaggerating Jupiter. Seek the advice of a trusted friend who is far removed from the sticky situation. Objectivity brings clarity."
virgo,2017-02-15,"The moment you think your mind is made up, something else comes along to change it. Deciding what you really want isn't very straightforward today, but you feel you must make a choice. You don't want to hurt anyone's feelings, but it seems like you end up stepping on someone else's toes no matter how hard you try to be nice. Putting your logical mind to work reminds you to stay true to your agenda, even if making everyone happy seems to be the quickest route to satisfaction. Do what is right, not what is easy."
libra,2017-02-15,"It's thoughtful to try to consider everyone's feelings, but keeping up with them is more of a stretch than usual today. You may be overdoing it when the people-pleasing Libra Moon joins forces with excessive Jupiter in your sign, fooling you into believing you can accommodate every emotion that shadows your heart. Happily, objectivity comes to the rescue later when Luna harmonizes with the cerebral Aquarius Sun, allowing you to choose your words wisely. Focus your message on what you can control and let go of the rest."
scorpio,2017-02-15,"It seems like information is going in one ear and out the other. In reality, whatever you hear is internalized and you play it over again in your head, even if it doesn't show on your face. Although shoving conflict to the back of your mind is easier than having to deal with it, you're more capable of handling stress as it arises than you think. The cool Aquarius Sun and gracious Libra Moon inspire you to keep your reactions rational without blocking your feelings. A big part of emotional intelligence is being able to experience an emotion without having to act on it."
sagittarius,2017-02-15,"Last-minute changes to plans keep happening one after the other, and the annoyance factor is on the rise. Typically you're willing to go with the flow, but it's challenging to remain patient when no one can make a simple decision. Letting things sort themselves out isn't in anyone's best interests today. Fortunately, you can successfully navigate through a complex obstacle course if you're willing to adjust your attitude. Lead by example and blaze a path others will follow."
capricorn,2017-02-15,"You just want to get your work done, but it seems like you must keep switching between tasks before you're finished with the first one. Putting blinders on is effective sometimes, but they may block out other people's feelings today as well as the distractions you were hoping to avoid. If there's contention among your peers, it's best to handle it with patience and maturity rather than playing the avoidance game. A direct approach is the best approach."
aquarius,2017-02-15,"Although it may be clear to others that your undertakings are far-fetched, you're desperate to cling to your optimism for their success. You find that people are quick to doubt your enthusiasm today, and you might even begin to harbor your own secret misgivings. However, the cosmos is offering you a rare opportunity to prove everyone wrong now. Incorporating this planetary boost allows you use your objective eye to find the cracks in your plan that need fixing. Rising up to meet challenges is worth it when it comes to your dreams."
pisces,2017-02-15,"You wish you could turn a blind eye to what's really on your mind, but your current obsessions won't leave you alone. Signs of your own inner discord pop up in the world around you, urging you to manage the relationship issues that are begging for your attention. You have more power than you think, so acknowledge your fears as soon as they make themselves known rather than trying to bury them out of sight. Discomfort is a part of life, but it's not all bad if it acts as an agent for change."
aries,2017-02-16,"Events seem too coincidental today, and it's almost like images from your mind manifest into reality seconds after you think them. In fact, the universe is just confirming what you already know. Speaking up when it comes to what you really think seems like the only option when your key planet Mars collaborates with vocal Mercury in your 11th House of Groups. Fortunately, your friends are willing to listen and offer the kind of wisdom that comes from an outside opinion. Carl Jung wrote, ""Synchronicity is an ever-present reality for those who have eyes to see it."""
taurus,2017-02-16,"You're face to face with your real desires and it's no use trying to keep them hidden anymore. Once you're one on one with a close friend or partner today, you find yourself spilling your secrets in catharsis mode. It's hard to believe you were burying all those feelings inside, but it's easier to see them from a rational perspective once they are out in the open. Sigmund Freud wrote, ""Out of your vulnerabilities will come your strength."""
gemini,2017-02-16,"Pay attention to the small things happening around you today as you may see something you would otherwise miss. You know it's time to make changes to your habits if you want to go places, and you can no longer hide the time you've tucked away to devote to vices. Luckily, a fortunate Mars-Mercury connection allows you to gain altitude and view the situation more clearly. Reaching out to a mentor or advisor facilitates new opportunities for improvement if you don't let pride stand in your way."
cancer,2017-02-16,"You know bottling your emotions doesn't help in the long run, but sometimes it doesn't feel safe to express them either. However, the magnetic Scorpio Moon intensifies your resentment and makes it harder to let go of a situation you feel was unfair or hurtful. Oddly enough, this inability to play nice works in your favor when courageous Mars and chatty Mercury conspire to give your feelings a verbal outlet. Taking the first step is always the hardest part of any process. But once you say your piece you'll feel stronger than you did before. Bob Marley sang, ""Get up; stand up for your rights."""
leo,2017-02-16,"If there are skeletons hiding in your family closet, be ready for them to walk out and meet you today. The suspicious Scorpio Moon digs through your 4th House of Home and Family, dredging up dust-covered memories that look different in the light of the present day. Input from a close companion is helpful when you're too subjective to make sense of what you see; insightful advice inspires you to choose the moral high ground when incorporating your realizations. Letting go of the past makes room for the future."
virgo,2017-02-16,"You're on the hunt for answers, but reading into casual conversations gives you too much information. Words laced with the tiniest hint of bitterness tempt you to make connections to seemingly unrelated events and jump to an unexpected conclusion today. Be wary of hanging onto someone's every word while searching for answers. Instead of playing detective in your own bubble, talk through the logistics of a situation with someone else. Just hearing your fears out loud may ease most of them. Sometimes you worry about things that never happen anyway."
libra,2017-02-16,"Once you scratch the surface of your feelings, it's obvious that something has to shift. Your romantic desires are painfully clear now as you finally find the courage to talk about what you need. It takes two to tango; fortunately, a friendly alignment between logical Mercury and assertive Mars increases your emotional intelligence so you can play your part in the relationship dance of your choice. Steven Covey wrote, ""Seek first to understand, then to be understood."""
scorpio,2017-02-16,"Your emotional senses are on hyper-alert now that the responsive Moon is loitering in your sign, and you're more certain about what you want. Nevertheless, how you state your desires is just as important as making them known. Luckily, a favorable Mercury-Mars sextile supplies you with not only the conviction to speak your mind, but also the ability to follow through with the changes that must be made to get what you need the most. Follow your heart and happiness will follow."
sagittarius,2017-02-16,"Something you've been wondering about announces itself with small signs sprinkled throughout your day. While everything might not seem rationally connected, you know where the synchronicities are pointing and they confirm your suspicions. You may not like what you see, but instead of turning your back on uncovered facts, now is the time to look at them logically in the cold light of day. Thankfully, all the details fall into place when your actions align with your sense of purpose."
capricorn,2017-02-16,"Although you can often keep your real objectives under wraps until the right time, you may inadvertently reveal them today. However, once you acknowledge your aspirations, there's no use delaying the changes that must occur to support your dreams. Fortunately, the power to think through all the pros and cons is yours while mental Mercury connects with energetic Mars. Combining a high level of discernment with your determination is a formula for success."
aquarius,2017-02-16,"You're no longer afraid to state your case as you tap into the audacious part of your nature. A fated feeling lingers and you are acutely aware that the time to make your ideas known is now. Conceptual Mercury in your sign receives a boost of heat from fiery Mars, providing the fuel to transform your thoughts into actions. However, you must be willing to reshape your public image to match your bold statements. The powerful Scorpio Moon urges you to fixate on your ambitions and not let up until you achieve them."
pisces,2017-02-16,"A nudge from somewhere unseen pushes you to declare your feelings. You may not always be the most outspoken in the group, but it's in your best interest to share your core values today. However, if there are adjustments to be made at this time, they must first begin in the mind. A re-imagining of your dreams is in order so they can best support your material goals. Edgar Cayce wrote, ""Reality is built out of thought and our every thought begins to create reality."""
aries,2017-02-17,"There's a certain thrill involved in facing your fears and once you tug on one thread, you want to unravel the whole tangle. The obsessive Scorpio Moon inhabits your 8th House of Transformation, motivating you to dig for the facts with no plans for stopping until you uncover the truth. The trouble is that these profound realizations often don't make for very good dinner conversation; sharing your insights with your normal group of friends is tricky now. There's no point in forcing the issue if you're not reaching your audience. This path is for your steps alone. Richter Abend wrote, ""Courage is the magic that turns dreams into reality."""
taurus,2017-02-17,"Although you tend to be very patient with people, once you're on a roll it's hard to slow your momentum. A heart-to-heart conversation with a close friend or lover may seem like it could be a never-ending story if only you had the time. You're not happy cutting these meaningful exchanges short, but you know you must attend to work responsibilities which seem boring in comparison. This conflict of interests might irritate you so much that you end up snapping at people who didn't do anything wrong. Be kind; everyone you meet is fighting a battle you know nothing about."
gemini,2017-02-17,"You usually work hard just to play harder, but today your priorities are reversed. You are so engrossed in your tasks that all else seems to fade away because you are determined to get everything right. Your curious mind can often find food for thought in any situation, but right now you're more focused on doing rather than thinking. This singular drive could be challenging to parse later when you realize you spent so much time and effort on one goal that seems smaller once you put it into proper perspective. Nevertheless, it's always the tiny details that make the big picture."
cancer,2017-02-17,"You really want to be heard today, but it's difficult to convey your feelings in a casual conversation. The moody Scorpio Moon urges you to express your angst, while rational Mercury prefers you keep it all locked up. This planetary conflict could create an inner battle that adds to the stress of the moment. Instead of pulling your hair out, try channeling your emotions through a different medium like art or music. There are many ways to share your personal experience. Carrie Fisher said, ""Take your broken heart and make it into art."""
leo,2017-02-17,"You're diving for pearls in your psychological ocean and one thing after another draws you further into your memories. The introspective Scorpio Moon combs through your 4th House of Foundations, reacquainting you with underlying character traits that are usually out of sight and out of mind. You are eager to reveal your discoveries to your closest friends today, but unfortunately, people might not know how to respond to the nuggets of truth you uncovered. Making someone bear witness to your personal reflections can feel great to you but uncomfortable to them. Share at your own risk."
virgo,2017-02-17,"Your mind seems to magnetically stick to things today. Whether you're wondering if something you said earlier came out wrong or what someone meant by an offhand comment, it's not easy to move on. Unfortunately, this cycle of doubt may slow you down until you realize you're behind schedule on even the most habitual daily tasks. It's challenging to think about your work when you're fixated on something else. Nevertheless, you are in charge of your own thoughts and you can improve your focus in an instant once you change your attitude."
libra,2017-02-17,"Your emotions are flowing so strongly now that you secretly wonder if you'll be able to contain them. However, the intense Scorpio Moon stirs your pot of desires while objective Mercury attempts to translate your passions into cold hard facts. You wish you could convey the depth and meaning you find in the things that matter most to you, but it's impossible to formulate the right words today. The way you express yourself may sound more detached than you intend, but the time will come when your heart will harmoniously align with your head."
scorpio,2017-02-17,"You're even a mystery to yourself sometimes in the way you feel things so intensely. Others think you're brooding for no apparent reason, but to you the passion is real. You might attempt to explain your behavior to a family member who questions your intentions today. In fact, you may end up defending your actions if someone can't accept you unconditionally. Not everyone will understand your choices and it isn't worth the heartache to try and make them. The only person you need to impress is yourself."
sagittarius,2017-02-17,"It seems like the truth is just out of reach, and you're growing moodier by the minute. Obviously, there's more to the story, but unfortunately, trying to use logic to figure out what's going on today probably won't work. The supernatural Scorpio Moon creeps through your 12th House of Mystery, where compasses go haywire and language gets jumbled. The only way to curb your craving for understanding is to let go of rationalization, give yourself some privacy and relax into your feelings. Getting lost is a good way to find yourself."
capricorn,2017-02-17,"You feel like something might be fishy in your social circle, even if you're being told that everything is copacetic. Whether or not there are grounds for concern, you're likely to search out the reason for your uneasiness today. Unfortunately, you could create an awkward situation by sounding overly critical. Snap judgments may seem less reasonable later, so evaluate whether it's worth the drama to make your discomfort known at this time. Discretion is being able to raise your eyebrow instead of your voice."
aquarius,2017-02-17,"You're hyper-aware of how you appear to others as it feels like all eyes are on you today. It seems like it's necessary to explain your goals or prove your skills to the crowd. Ironically, the more you tell people about your accomplishments, the less it helps, causing the reverse reaction of what you were expecting. It could be less frustrating to channel your energy into your work now rather than trying to rationalize your behavior. Let your actions speak for themselves."
pisces,2017-02-17,"You're drawn to a faraway land where a change of scenery heals your soul. You may not have a private helicopter to set you down in the middle of some ancient ruins, but you can bring the magic of exotic cultures into your world with the help of books or online research. Sinking into a film or documentary could also satisfy your longing to immerse yourself in another landscape. The only true journey is the one within."
aries,2017-02-18,"A brief retreat from the front lines for a dose of renewal and recharging is exactly what the doctor ordered. The Sun's shift into peaceful Pisces illuminates your 12th House of Spirituality, prompting you to escape into your cozy cave for a break from the mundane world. You may think letting go of all your responsibilities is the best way to reconnect with your spiritual center but, truthfully, you don't need to extinguish your fire completely just to cool off. Thankfully, the promise of adventure will draw you back to reality before you know it."
taurus,2017-02-18,"The spirit of community warms your heart as you think fondly about your circle of friends. You appreciate being part of such a fun group and you hope to spend more time giving back some of the joy you receive. The compassionate Pisces Sun shines a light on your 11th House of Social Networking for the next four weeks, encouraging you to cultivate stronger bonds of friendship. While it may seem more important than ever to maintain harmony, the high-minded Sagittarius Moon reminds you to keep your eyes open to all possibilities rather than blindly following one path."
gemini,2017-02-18,"You're galvanized to move into a period of manifestation where your lofty ambitions become undeniably real. The Sun's shift into idealistic Pisces puts the spotlight on your 10th House of Profession, inspiring you to visualize exactly where you hope to be in your career. The more you polish your idea of success, the closer you get to making it a reality. Sharing your aspirations with a trusted friend can help prevent you from getting stuck in the dreaming phase. Antoine de Saint-Exupery wrote, ""A goal without a plan is just a wish."""
cancer,2017-02-18,"You tend to favor the comfort and safety of the familiar, but something stirs your desire to see more of the world now. Whether you decide to travel the globe or just feed your imagination with a captivating learning adventure, the possibilities seem endless. Honestly, it doesn't matter if your journeys take you outward or inward; you will get even more out of them if you incorporate your findings into your regular routine. Including bits of inspiration in your everyday surroundings keeps you uplifted without feeling like you must escape into fantasy-land to avoid the monotony. Dream globally, act locally."
leo,2017-02-18,"You feel a tug on your heartstrings that draws you into a reverie of pure love and trust. The Sun's move into surreal Pisces brightens your 8th House of Intimacy, urging you to surrender to the kind of connection that seems to transcend ordinary relationships. However, the extravagant Sagittarius Moon reminds you that you don't need to completely give up your individuality to nurture the soulful link you desire. Paradoxically, dissolving the rules to make room for personal freedom often brings people closer together."
virgo,2017-02-18,"Your focus shifts to your closest relationships and how to emotionally connect with the ones near and dear to you. You're prompted to reevaluate your expectations of love and friendship as the Sun swims into empathetic Pisces and your 7th House of Partnerships. Injecting more sensitivity into your interactions enables you to better consider the feelings of others while attempting to bridge the distance between you. It could seem like the lines are blurred, but staying grounded in your own core beliefs is as important as being open to another person's point of view. Acknowledging someone's position need not require self-sacrifice. Respect is a two-way street."
libra,2017-02-18,"All the late nights and fun times start to catch up with you and you need to turn your attention to your health. The Sun moves into healing Pisces and your 6th House of Well-Being, inspiring you to reassess the habits that are the building blocks of your normal routine. It's all too tempting to fly on autopilot and let time slip away when you could be developing patterns to support a more healthful existence. Thankfully, the Moon's entrance into optimistic Sagittarius introduces a spark of motivation to go along with your resolutions. Move it or lose it."
scorpio,2017-02-18,"A new phase is beginning in which your creativity takes the lead. It's the perfect time for exploring artistic pursuits or reconnecting with a childhood activity that brings you joy. The Sun's annual four-week glide through mystical Pisces accentuates your 5th House of Self-Expression, provoking you to pour your heart into a passion project. Daydreams may saturate your reality but striking the right balance between work and play will make your recreational time that much more fulfilling."
sagittarius,2017-02-18,"You may opt to stay home more often over the next four weeks as the Sun takes up residence in your 4th House of Domesticity. Reconnecting with your roots provides restorative healing for your heart. Nevertheless, it feels like the only thing that truly matters is getting in touch with the collective. However, the questing Moon in your sign reminds you to celebrate yourself as a piece of the whole without having to merge into oneness and out of reality. Take care of yourself before preaching to others to do the same."
capricorn,2017-02-18,"Your drive to achieve often compels you to take control of situations to ensure the best chance at success. However, a turn of the tide inspires you to adopt a more flexible approach. The Sun's shift into gentle Pisces highlights your 3rd House of Information, putting you in a place to be more receptive to messages rather than only pushing your point forward. Nevertheless, don't allow this new sensitivity to cloud your judgement when you intuitively know something is wrong. Gathering options before nailing down an action plan is a good change of pace from your usual persistence."
aquarius,2017-02-18,"Your eclecticism is apparent in the way you dress as you choose to reflect your individuality in most purchases. The Sun makes its entrance into whimsical Pisces and your 2nd House of Material Things, seducing you with the allure of a few unique pieces to add to your collection. If you're not careful, you might find more creative ways to spend than save, so make sure your acquisitions align not only with your immediate wishes but your long-term goals as well. Keep in mind your self-worth is not defined by what you wear but rather by what's in your heart."
pisces,2017-02-18,"Wipe the slate clean and start celebrating your birthday month. The radiant Sun moves into your sign, prompting your annual review of where you've been and where you're going. It's time to get back in touch with your dreams so you can set ambitious goals. Manage your expectations wisely, since it's easy to drift through the next four weeks in a haze of possibilities that could only serve to bewilder you if you mistakenly believe you can do them all. Tempering your intuition with some good old-fashioned initiative helps you make the most of a new beginning."
aries,2017-02-19,"Stillness may be good for the soul, but you're all about plugging into the here and now. You're anxious to get on the road to the next adventure even though a little voice in the back of your head is reminding you that you don't feel as sure as you act. Regardless, it seems like there are bigger fish to fry while canny Mercury stimulates your 11th House of Long-Term Goals. Your drive to succeed is stronger than your doubts, even if they're valid. Focus on the outcome, not the obstacle."
taurus,2017-02-19,"It seems as if the universe is saying ""show me the money"" today, prodding you to make your next move. You always appreciate a little more time to consider your options, but it feels like you must brush off any worries and proceed anyway. Fortunately, your ideal destination comes into focus once you take your first steps and your path becomes clear. You may even realize that your limiting beliefs are holding you back, galvanizing you to push forward even though nagging doubts try to anchor you in your comfort zone. Never let your fear decide your fate."
gemini,2017-02-19,"You're naturally inquisitive mind keeps you busy, but now you must put your ideas to work. You want to learn about your chosen endeavor in a way that goes beyond normal curiosity as penetrating Pluto whispers in trickster Mercury's ear. You may even block out the noise that usually distracts you because you wish to remain inspired rather than let inconsequential details hijack your focus. However, this same optimism could result in ignoring vital facts as you are swept up in the exhilaration of potentials. Don't trip over reality while chasing your dreams."
cancer,2017-02-19,"You're finally able to take a step back from a situation that hits close to home. It's less daunting to navigate delicate issues of the heart once you gain the perspective you need. Recalling words of wisdom from long ago reminds you of advice that you have since put on the shelf. You're inspired to embrace the future armed with objectivity, but be careful that you don't completely ignore your intuition now that you feel more empowered to view the situation rationally. Lessons from the past teach you how to handle the future."
leo,2017-02-19,"You're craving some thought-provoking debate to test your oratory skills, and you're likely to find someone who's willing to oblige today. The buoyant Sagittarius Moon inflates your confidence, prompting you to push buttons to provoke a strong reaction. While spirited discussion can feel like a game sometimes, you may not realize how harsh you're being until it's too late. Err on the side of consideration instead of getting carried away with the sound of your own voice. Knowing when to quit prevents unnecessary complications and hurt feelings. If you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all."
virgo,2017-02-19,"A sudden realization reveals ways to streamline your daily routine and improve the quality of your life. Small adjustments can change the whole game when it comes to your well-being, and there's something refreshing about rearranging your living space. However, in your haste to start your new projects, you might overlook that someone feels left out of your process. Be sure you don't get so obsessed with your own plans that you neglect the people who matter the most. Be inclusive for the sake of love."
libra,2017-02-19,"Your imagination is hooked up to cosmic jumper cables and it's firing on all cylinders. Your curiosity is piqued as innovative Mercury activates your 5th House of Creativity, while mysterious Pluto offers a jewel from the depth of your psyche. You might be so amused by playing with a concept that you purposely evade the truth that you could be spending your time more wisely. Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote, ""A single dream is more powerful than a thousand realities."""
scorpio,2017-02-19,"Taking a psychological stroll through the hidden recesses of your mind proves to be more fascinating than you initially imagined. However, you may get so engrossed in your own mental journey that you start to selectively connect only the dots that create the shape you want. Although your carefully managed thoughts are powerful enough to influence reality, it's not wise to deny your feelings now. Integrating your emotions serves you better in the long run."
sagittarius,2017-02-19,"It's as if you can hold ideas in your hands and turn them over to view all their different facets, giving you the all-encompassing perspective you crave. However, you may not be quite as objective as you think as old stories about self-worth seep into your thoughts without you noticing. If you take a moment to connect with your heart, you might realize not all is as it seems today. However, you're more keen to turn away from troublesome notions if it means you can linger another day in your mind."
capricorn,2017-02-19,"Sometimes it seems like a waste of time to fall prey to discomfort, and you prefer to focus on something more concrete. But today it's undeniable that the tangible and the unexplainable are more interwoven than you want to believe. You may find that a hidden aspect of your character is awakened while methodical Mercury visits your 2nd House of Self-Esteem. A mysterious intensity flavors your words now, and you want to channel it to your own ends. Rumi wrote, ""The door is wide and open, don't go back to sleep."""
aquarius,2017-02-19,"Speaking your dreams aloud makes them seem more real and you're searching for an outlet to vocalize your hopes and wishes. It's not that you need to be validated for your big ideas; you simply don't want to keep all your thoughts to yourself. However, once you start a conversation, you may be surprised by what spills off your tongue. You become so captivated by the potential of the moment that you spontaneously create new plans on the fly. Focusing on the big picture makes it impossible to sweat the small stuff."
pisces,2017-02-19,"Your current confidence allows you to comfortably look within to face the internal mechanisms that steer you when you're operating on automatic pilot. It's refreshing to see this part of yourself with new lucidity; however, don't mistake your ability to understand your secret desires conceptually with self-mastery. It's easy to let optimism slide into unrealistic idealism when dealing with the obscure elements that are at play. There's no reason to disbelieve your insights as long as you remain aware that they may seem slightly out of touch later. Perspective is everything."
aries,2017-02-20,"It seems like the cosmos has handed you every tool you need to mobilize an amazing enterprise. Support from other people boosts your confidence, confirming that you're not the only one who thinks your idea is impressive. You're feeling so certain you can get this thing off the ground that you're willing to raise your bet at the last minute. However, if you skip over any important details, you're likely to hit a roadblock just when you pick up speed. Stay humble as you climb the ladder of success."
taurus,2017-02-20,"You keep diving beneath the small talk today, exploring the meaning behind every interaction. It appears like all signs point to a deeper answer to your questions, urging you to peel back layers of a relationship until you find the core. Nevertheless, there are some boundaries that you don't know exist until you cross them. Remain mindful of the other person in the equation; otherwise your quest for understanding may end up being more self-serving when it has the potential to be beneficial for all involved. Sensitivity is a strength, not a weakness."
gemini,2017-02-20,"Inspiration has struck and you're restlessly poised to explore the myriad of possibilities. You're positive that the only thing that might make your plans more enjoyable is a companion to join you for all the excitement. However, if your friends are as enthusiastic as you are today, you may end up raising the energy to the point of distraction. But if you play your cards right, a travel buddy is not only a boisterous partner in crime, but a crucial fact-checker along the way. Half the work, double the fun."
cancer,2017-02-20,"Less doesn't seem like more today as you're confident you will knock out tasks in rapid succession. Every time you get one thing done, you want to add another chore to the bottom of the list, as if you're in a race to see how much you will accomplish. While you're capable of doing whatever you put your mind to now, stern Saturn warns against biting off more than you can chew. Consider quitting while you're ahead so you end the day on a positive note, rather than feeling like you have to throw in the towel due to exhaustion. Patience, grasshopper; Rome wasn't built in a day."
leo,2017-02-20,"You're feeling lucky and you can't wait to speak your mind to anyone who will listen. In fact, it's almost impossible to stop yourself from storytelling today, especially if you're trying to impress people you admire. It's always more fun to have an adoring audience, so you may inadvertently bend the truth to persuade a partner to join your cause. However, reality creeps up behind you at some point, so be sure starting another new project is worth the risk before swinging into action."
virgo,2017-02-20,"You're the busiest bee in the hive today, fervently looking to spend your energy on something productive. The anticipatory Sagittarius Moon arouses your restlessness when it contacts wild Uranus and fleet-footed Mercury. You're able to quicken your pace when tackling chores around the house or regular duties at work, especially if you begin as early as you can. Eventually you must turn an eye to fuel conservation so you don't end up with projects started but not finished. It takes a lot of practice to be spontaneous."
libra,2017-02-20,"Light bulbs flash as you conceptualize a topic in a totally unique way. The inflationary Sagittarius Moon is cheered on by four other rambunctious planetary players, convincing you to shout your message through a loudspeaker. However, don't be surprised if you end up having to stop and backtrack to clarify the facts when Luna runs into taskmaster Saturn later on. If you channel your cerebral intensity to keep up with the minutiae from the start, you can finish as strongly as you began."
scorpio,2017-02-20,"Your impatience drives you to change a part of your routine because you can't stand one more day of doing the same thing. It's such a relief to break away from the ordinary when mischievous Mercury rattles rebellious Uranus, encouraging you to ignore the rules if it means liberation from tedium. But shaking things up may lead to trouble; before you know it, you could throw the whole rule-book out the window. Of course, you can spend your mental and physical resources however you want, but too much of a good thing has very real consequences. Moderation is your friend."
sagittarius,2017-02-20,"Opportunities seem to crop up wherever you look now, and it seems like a risk not to go after every single one. This is a good time to write down your thoughts before they run off without you. Recording your schemes not only keeps them from slipping away, but gives you a chance to return to them later. The truth is you could be standing closer to the picture than you should, distorting the images to look more amazing than they are. If you attach your star power to ideas prematurely, you may end up getting an ego check that stings more than it would on another day. A splash of objectivity is critical for your peace of mind."
capricorn,2017-02-20,"Although you wish the weekend would never end, it's not long before you find a substantial topic to tackle. Intriguing insights into a financial issue give you something real on which to focus your attention. However, if you're using your responsibilities to distract you from lingering emotions, you may have no choice but to confront your feelings later when the indulgent Sagittarius Moon slams into strict Saturn. Withdrawing periodically to reclaim your center is preferable to powering through until you're forced to face the truth. Your heart counts more than your money."
aquarius,2017-02-20,"Your mind is buzzing as if your morning coffee was extra strong. Your thoughts are jumping as innovative Uranus blows the doors of possibility wide open. Taking advantage of this dynamic time is in your best interest as your power of manifestation grows, but make sure you think in particulars rather than allowing your excitement to create a delusion of grandeur. Karmic Saturn is sure to bring your long-term plans down to earth if you don't take necessary steps to establish grounding points from the beginning. Dreams don't work unless you do."
pisces,2017-02-20,"You don't want to let your aspirations out of your sight because it seems like they're close enough to touch. The questing Sagittarius Moon traverses your 10th House of Status, and her friendly alliances with four other planets feed your zeal. You can't resist the urge to say what you really think. Being clear with your intentions is essential since you're likely to get what you wish for today. There's no reason to wait any longer; start living the life you want."
aries,2017-02-21,"Buoyant thoughts lure you into pursuing your dreams, especially since your peers seem to have so much faith in you. Your hopes and wishes are at the forefront of your mind now, urging you to play to win. On the other hand, your instincts tell you to pause before rushing headlong toward your ideal future. The Moon's shift into practical Capricorn is the source of your hesitation, but some fences are made to protect not to imprison. Rather than fighting against the cosmic constraints, listen to your mind and your gut equally. Stop arguing with yourself and trust the wisdom that originates in silence."
taurus,2017-02-21,"It's almost a relief when you realize there are fewer options than you originally thought. After the Moon moves into fellow earth sign Capricorn, you can pare down your choices and be more selective about where you put your time and energy. Although you still want to maximize your potential, your narrow outlook forces you to focus only on the most productive activities instead of trying to do everything at once. Thankfully, your dependable work ethic enables you to experience satisfaction from a job well done."
gemini,2017-02-21,"It's confusing to think how differently you felt yesterday when it seemed like the world was at your fingertips. You can still see all the potential positive outcomes but somehow you linger more on the negative ones today. This mild anxiety is a symptom of the Moon's landing in suppressive Capricorn, where more rigorous testing is required for an idea to pass. Although it could feel like your bubble is bursting, this is a chance to observe how invested you are in your goals. Reevaluate your priorities and renew your commitments accordingly."
cancer,2017-02-21,"You've been putting a lot of effort into personal growth and it feels good to flex your intellectual muscles. Unfortunately, you were so immersed in your agenda that you might have neglected the people who matter the most. Ironically, a friend's petulant behavior is likely to be a reflection of your own emotional needs that aren't being met while you concentrate on self-discovery. Although solitude is good for your soul, spending time with those you love is good for your heart."
leo,2017-02-21,"You can tell you're getting ahead of yourself, but you still wish the world would catch up to your theories. Conversations could stretch on for days with the help of a harmonious connection between talkative Mercury and far-reaching Jupiter. However, this widened perspective allows you to perceive not only riveting possibilities but the banal obligations necessary to succeed. Taking the day off isn't really an option now, even if the mental gymnastics are more fun than the tedious legwork. Intention plus hard work equals magic."
virgo,2017-02-21,"You found your groove and you're taking full advantage of the cosmic momentum to carry out as many tasks as possible. It's odd when people don't understand your passion for hard work; in fact, you wonder why anyone wouldn't enjoy a productive streak. You may not realize that you're blinded by your own enthusiasm for efficacy today, yet it's unrealistic to expect others to follow suit. The more you can detach from judgement and stop worrying about everyone else, the easier it is to singularly focus on your own priorities."
libra,2017-02-21,"It's a bit harder to get out the door while there are so many things at home demanding your attention. You may secretly wish you could put these domestic obligations off for a while longer because you believe you have more important goals to chase. In reality, the opposite is true today; you need to take care of responsibilities around the house rather than neglect them in pursuit of your brightest new idea. Although it could sound less than exciting, grounding your energy in chores is actually good for your creative life. Shuffling your priorities to accommodate everyone is one of your talents -- just don't lose yourself in the process."
scorpio,2017-02-21,"Your ideas are steeping in the backwaters of your mind and will make some strong tea once you finally share them with others. You're naturally protective of your intellectual property; you prefer to maintain tight control over what remains private and what goes public. However, the matter-of-fact Capricorn Moon in your 3rd House of Communication advises that you tell the truth now instead of creatively eluding questions. You can sweeten your message but you can't dilute the facts."
sagittarius,2017-02-21,"It's as if your grand plans can't be contained by the current circumstances. You're itching to explore your aspirations with your peers -- the more the merrier. The problem is that your 2nd House of Resources is under scrutiny by the calculating Capricorn Moon, raising your awareness of what you have to spend both monetarily and physically. View this temporary obstacle as an opportunity to tie up loose ends in order to give your dreams the best chance for success."
capricorn,2017-02-21,"People depend on you for practical answers and you're usually willing to step up to the plate and deliver. However, you may get wrapped up in thoughts of how others perceive you since you're handing out advice and assistance left and right. Fortunately, the presence of the reflective Moon in your 1st House of Personality reminds you to keep your feelings in the equation now, rather than sacrificing your preferences just to boost your reputation for reliability. A whole new spectrum of possibilities comes into view when you open your heart."
aquarius,2017-02-21,"Although your extraordinary ideas are urging you to push the limits, your physical self would prefer to remain planted on the couch today. The conservative Capricorn Moon hides away in your 12th House of Rest, convincing you that now isn't the time to take flight. Even if you're irritated by a lack of energy, remember that recharging and brainstorming aren't incompatible activities. If you're bothered by the concept of meditating when you feel you could be out exploring, perhaps there's a deeper origin to your unrest that you have yet to discover."
pisces,2017-02-21,"A fascinating drama plays out in the back of your mind as you quietly carry on with your normal routine. An inquisitive Mercury-Jupiter alignment allows you to explore the mysteries within that you can't explain to anyone else. It's tempting to let this journey drive you to solitude, but it's crucial to stay connected to the here and now if you hope to integrate your findings. Calling on your friends as a link to reality is a smart strategy when you're lost in self-reflection and can't find your way back."
aries,2017-02-22,"You're poised to conquer the world no matter what comes your way. You're emboldened to seize what you desire without stopping to ask while warrior Mars calls your 1st House of Self his stronghold. Your unshakable confidence is sure to raise eyebrows, so don't expect to take the field without encountering a contender or two. Although you can expect to face challenges from authority figures or power players today, it's actually good practice for fortifying your intentions. Harnessing your argumentative urges for more productive uses will propel you further than fighting over minor differences in opinion."
taurus,2017-02-22,"Although you Bulls are known for your stoic nature, everyone's fuse runs out at some point. Your patience is quite short today as little irritations pile up until you're sure the next one will be the final straw. The sooner you become aware of your growing anger, the better you can manage it. It's amazing how much you can accomplish when you channel your energy toward breaking down old belief systems that no longer serve you. Consciously directing your powerful inner forces prevents a meltdown before it occurs."
gemini,2017-02-22,"The pressure builds deep within you and it's difficult to pinpoint exactly what is causing your sense of apprehension. You might even bow out of work early to contemplate your feelings now that the cautious Capricorn Moon meets domineering Pluto in your 8th House of Transformation. Feeling lost in your direction is disorienting, but you can look beneath your fear to see an opportunity for a greater shift. Difficult roads often lead to beautiful destinations."
cancer,2017-02-22,"It's hard to find your place before someone else makes their move, like an endless game of duck-duck-goose. Between your past experiences and your future aspirations, a compression takes place that seems to be funneled into your relationships. You may be projecting your stress onto the ones closest to you today, causing needless tension and unwelcome drama. Fortunately, if you're brave enough to reveal the source of your frustration, the climax of a situation could result in a breakthrough rather than a breakdown."
leo,2017-02-22,"Your long-term goals seem far off in the distance today, but that only makes you want to run faster to reach them. You're ready to do whatever it takes to bridge the gap between you and your future, but the mightiest tools for success may be right under your nose. The persistent Capricorn Moon channels potent energies from four planets straight into your 6th House of Work, indicating that your triumph comes from consistent efforts. Seek out sustainable daily actions that move you toward your dreams one step at a time."
virgo,2017-02-22,"Your natural propensity for serving others has made you very familiar with the feeling of being spread too thin. But things are different now, because it seems like you're nearly at an emotional tipping point. You're bound to become aware of how little energy is leftover after you spend the day giving to others when ardent Mars in your 8th House of Deep Sharing confronts passionate Pluto. It's imperative to sort through your emotions until you find your way back to what you've known in your heart all along. Sometimes loving yourself can be the most challenging task of all."
libra,2017-02-22,"Although you normally walk the path of compromise, you feel you must boldly assert yourself to be taken seriously today. A tense interaction with someone close to you may call your fundamental beliefs into question, initiating a major evaluation of the whys behind your behaviors. A weighty Moon-Pluto conjunction in your 4th House of Foundations is like an anchor sinking into the depths of your mind. The key to unlocking your own psychological mysteries lies in your readiness to confront the secrets you uncover. There's no reason to be afraid; the truth will set you free."
scorpio,2017-02-22,"It's not that any one event tipped the scales, but rather an accumulation of small occurrences that prompts you to feel like something has to give. You're ready to kick a habit that is holding you back, but that's quite a task when your immediate environment has shaped itself around it. Before you start hastily cutting things out of your life to make the alterations that seem so urgent, turn inward and question your beliefs around the situation. Shifts in your mental habits may produce more powerful results than rearranging external circumstances."
sagittarius,2017-02-22,"A little risk never hurt anyone, or so you say when others question your latest strategy for an exorbitant escapade. On a normal day you would stand by your plan, but today's events may lead you to a very different place. Your hunt for gratifying ways to express your creativity has profound implications when seen in the context of buried self-worth issues. And no matter how hard you try to deny them now, your insecurities are likely to haunt you. Carl Jung wrote, ""What you resist, persists."""
capricorn,2017-02-22,"The ground beneath your feet seems more like a volcanic zone, and you feel the heat rising up through your shoes. Handling professional concerns is easy enough on its own but when domestic issues start getting in the way, you want to put out the fire before it spreads. Snapping at anyone who dares to oppose you only makes matters worse. Examine your attitude and follow it back to the source. Perhaps you're just seeking an excuse to shed your skin and start fresh. You don't need to torch the building to get light."
aquarius,2017-02-22,"You're so passionate about a topic that you can't gobble up information fast enough. However, the verve with which you grasp for more knowledge may be an overcompensation. The somber Capricorn Moon joins mysterious Pluto in your 12th House of Dreams, unearthing aspects of yourself you intentionally buried. Once you remember your secrets, there's no erasing them; nevertheless, there is a bright side. Painful situations often signal the beginning of an accelerated period of spiritual growth, as long as you're willing to face your darkest shadows. James Russell Lowell wrote, ""A weed is no more than a flower in disguise."""
pisces,2017-02-22,"You can sense that the emotional atmosphere is turbulent from the start, and you may feel the need to barricade your defenses. Although you believe in authenticity, you might have to remake yourself to fit into the societal slot you've found yourself in as possessive Pluto squares off with pushy Mars. Your group of friends seemed like a perfect choice at first; but if you feel intimidated or forced to be something you're not, it's probably time for some pruning of your social network. Oprah Winfrey said, ""Only surround yourself with people who will lift you higher."""
aries,2017-02-23,"You don't know why anyone would wait around for an answer when they could just take matters into their own hands. Your get-it-done personality drives you to hit the gas for better or for worse, because anything is better than being a sitting duck. In reality, reckless behavior isn't the only option and it's wise to consider other avenues. Your friends are urging you to cool your jets and let things run their natural course; like it or not, they are more objective than you at this point. Count to ten before jumping to conclusions today, and take the advice you're given more seriously."
taurus,2017-02-23,"You're finally able to organize your thoughts and get back to business. But residual edginess bubbles just beneath the surface, leading you to believe that anything that doesn't go perfectly the first time should be immediately scrapped so you can start over. Fortunately, sticking to your well-laid plan is not only the most comfortable path for your natural down-to-earth approach, but also the one most likely to succeed now. Let your intellect take the lead today instead of allowing erratic emotions to sabotage your progress."
gemini,2017-02-23,"You're impatiently waiting for your expectations to be fulfilled as the minutes on the clock seem to tick by extra slowly. Although acting on your impulses doesn't make time go by any faster, you still yearn to advance your plan. Luckily, constructive Saturn lends a helping hand to your key planet, empowering you to lay your own railroad track instead of throwing a tantrum while waiting for someone else's train to arrive. Building structures takes time and you must work hard to see the fruits of your labor."
cancer,2017-02-23,"It's as if the atmosphere is pulled taut and you don't want to misstep for fear of breaking the tenuous connections holding it all together. At the same time, it feels like it's now or never in the realm of your professional goals as three planets grow restless in fiery Aries and your 10th House of Career. Balancing this combination of cosmic energies is best accomplished by formulating a concrete plan which you can follow consistently. Creating a simple list is the perfect medium between charging full speed ahead and spinning your wheels."
leo,2017-02-23,"You're so enamored with your ideals that you get bent out of shape when people don't understand your intentions. Ironically, the more fervently you argue your point today, the further away you get from your position. The key to making someone else see your perspective is to slow down and build your case from the ground up now, pausing to accept questions and listen to feedback. Although this may not be as satisfying as preaching from your soapbox, leading by example is the most effective way to share your passion."
virgo,2017-02-23,"It seems like an interpersonal matter must be attended to without delay today. A sense of urgency throws you into a state of discontent because you're not sure how to fix the problem in short order. Although your choices are limited, you actually have more possibilities at your disposal than are apparent. Remaining anchored to your agenda is the first step to slowly releasing the pent-up pressure without causing an outburst. Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""Adopt the pace of nature; her secret is patience."""
libra,2017-02-23,"Someone else's opinions are so strong that you're not certain if you have a choice but to go along with their plan. You would like to avoid a public confrontation today, yet you don't want to be seen as a pushover. Fortunately, your struggles are alleviated when the reflective Moon shifts from restrictive Capricorn into ingenious Aquarius, activating your 5th House of Creativity. There is nothing wrong with being assertive when it comes to your needs. Reclaiming your power enables you to passionately pursue your goals."
scorpio,2017-02-23,"The only sensible way to get everything done is to power through your to-do list, no matter what the cost. But in your haste to be expedient you may expend much more energy than necessary today. Rearranging your priorities is a better use of your time, even if it seems less productive at first. You might need to go home and sleep on an idea instead of pushing it forward now; keep in mind, a methodical pace wins the race in the long run. Work smarter, not harder."
sagittarius,2017-02-23,"You're ready to blow off some steam because the serious cosmic vibe is messing with your mojo. Nevertheless, you know that in reality it won't help to play the day away just because you don't want to face your responsibilities. Happily, once the Moon takes up residence in innovative Aquarius and your 3rd House of Immediate Environment, you can easily find things that stimulate your restless mind and keep you in the present moment. You can start by being the change you want to see in the world."
capricorn,2017-02-23,"You prefer to fly solo today so you can stay ahead of the game. Although you're working hard to create order amidst chaos, it's challenging to maintain the course when aggravating family dynamics lurk in the background. Luckily, strategic Saturn and meticulous Mercury partner up to help you sort out what's worth the cost of your time and what you must let fall to the wayside. The sooner you begin putting your plan into action, the more capable you'll be of keeping a cool head. Promise less, deliver more."
aquarius,2017-02-23,"Although you know there are more important priorities, you believe you need to defend your message against naysayers today. However, a dramatic conversation is less complicated if you take yourself off the front lines so you don't feel put on the spot. It's better to remain on the sidelines and concentrate on clarifying your own thoughts now, instead of charging back into the fray. Rather than bickering with anyone, choose to converse with those who support your aspirations. Never let anyone dull your sparkle."
pisces,2017-02-23,"It's tempting to resort to extreme measures to take the edge off as you sense something significant is looming on the horizon. You may try to distract your thoughts with retail therapy, mistakenly believing that adding a shiny new item to your life will be entertaining enough to lift your mood. In reality, you'll be better off if you take the time to stop and think about where you want to go in life compared to where you are now. Critical Mercury and practical Saturn make an auspicious alignment to help you commit to healthier forms of stress management. Channel your angst into your work."
aries,2017-02-24,"Although you're comfortable with your current group of friends, you still might wonder if this is really where you want to be. Nothing specific is wrong, but at the same time not everything seems right. Perhaps you notice the internal pressure rising and you can't help fretting about what kind of fallout you could expect if you make a dramatic change. Fortunately, the Moon's visit to free-thinking Aquarius gives you an opportunity to ponder these matters without getting caught up in the implications of hypothetical outcomes. Worry is a payment on a debt that isn't owed."
taurus,2017-02-24,"A lull in the action allows you a moment to steady yourself and enjoy a relatively quiet day. Although you're grateful for the change of speed, you can't help but think about what the next big event will entail. You can objectively reevaluate your ambitions today, and the range of possibilities is more apparent than before. However, you might be more comfortable playing spectator now instead of rushing to make a move. Using the calm before the storm to ground your energy keeps you rooted in your integrity."
gemini,2017-02-24,"It seems like the sky is clear today, even though you sense something big looming on the horizon. Nevertheless, you're happy to let your mind wander as you philosophize about the meaning of life. The futuristic Aquarius Moon sends a gentle breeze through your 9th House of Big Ideas, sweeping your vision higher so you can see your distant plans from a bird's eye view. They may just be dreams at the moment, but it's always revitalizing to reconnect with what inspires your creativity. John Keats wrote, ""The poetry of the earth is never dead."""
cancer,2017-02-24,"You know that you must step up your game soon, but for now you want to keep your cards close to your chest. You don't feel quite like yourself, but your mismatched mood has an unexpected upside. It's as if you can see the real you from an outsider's perspective today, allowing you to identify what's wrong in the dynamics of a close relationship. This moment of clarity might be slightly unnerving, but you could be pleasantly surprised by the difference in your feelings if you're willing to explore them. The Dalai Lama teaches, ""Do not let the behavior of others destroy your inner peace."""
leo,2017-02-24,"Spending quality time with a partner or close companion is just what you need during a reprieve from the hustle and bustle. Testy remarks are replaced by playful banter as life doesn't seem quite as serious today. However, you can tell that big shifts are on the way and it's likely to be a spectacle when they take place. For now, you're willing to put your worries on the shelf and just say no to negativity. A joy that's shared is a joy made double."
virgo,2017-02-24,"Although you feel certain that life will look completely different in the near future, you're also aware that there's not much you can do about it right now. You prefer to focus on actions that actually produce tangible results as the independent Aquarius Moon sets up shop in your 6th House of Work. Even if you're just doing basic chores and tying up loose ends, there's a restorative sense of satisfaction about bringing a set of tasks to completion. Ironically, getting back to basics injects a dose of gratitude into your life. Donna Karan said, ""It's all about finding the calm in the chaos."""
libra,2017-02-24,"You're excited to work on a pet project since you have some improvements in mind that you can't wait to share. It may seem frivolous to spend your time on recreation when you could be catching up on chores. However, the truth is that stepping away from the heavy responsibilities is important for creating a well-rounded life. Doing what makes your heart happy in the moment restores a sense of balance in your world. Erich Fromm wrote, ""Creativity requires the courage to let go of uncertainty."""
scorpio,2017-02-24,"While others are already packing their weekend with fun plans, you are eagerly anticipating some peace and quiet at home. Recognition for your recent contribution may not be forthcoming, even if you've been working hard to get noticed. Nevertheless, a tranquil evening by yourself or with your soul-family is just what you need now. The brilliant Aquarius Moon puts space between you and a complicated issue, empowering you to view the situation in a new light. There's nothing like counting your blessings to cure whatever ails the heart."
sagittarius,2017-02-24,"You have a lot to say and even more you want to do, but coming up with good ideas is only half the battle. Nevertheless, the astute Aquarius Moon meanders through your 3rd House of Communication, seeking an outlet for your forward-thinking opinions. Lively discourse inspires you to see a concept from a new angle, widening your frame of reference and allowing you to rehash your old ideas into something new. Emile Zola wrote, ""I would rather die of passion than of boredom."""
capricorn,2017-02-24,"Rumblings from the deep create concerns about your closest relationships. However, you're unable to draw any conclusions about their source yet. While internal stirrings occur, life is smooth on the surface today. As the detached Aquarius Moon peruses your 2nd House of Resources, you're preoccupied with assessing the usefulness of your belongings. Perhaps it's time to let go of some items with outdated sentimental value and look for more efficient replacements. Whatever you decide, it's easier to make choices when you don't feel tied up in emotional attachments."
aquarius,2017-02-24,"Arguments from the recent past don't seem as important today as you reflect on the part you played. Self-analysis confirms that you often do a great job of staying emotionally removed from the current topic of discussion. However, you may not be as unbiased as you think while the subjective Moon hangs out in your eccentric sign. There is no reason for alarm as long as you do your best to be fair-minded now; a tiny bit of awareness changes everything."
pisces,2017-02-24,"You're ready to block off a portion of your day to recharge your batteries and rest your bones. It feels wonderful to finally get a break from the recent chaotic circumstances, whether internal or external. Spending time in meditation or a favorite solo activity rejuvenates your mind and prepares you for the rocky road ahead. Ram Dass teaches, ""The quieter you become, the more you can hear."""
aries,2017-02-25,"You are traveling out beyond the Twilight Zone and well into the Outer Limits where the mundane world is but a faint memory. As much as you like exploring new territory, you might worry that you've gone too far this time. Instead of struggling to find your way back home, just open your senses to those around you. Reestablishing solid connections with others is more important than reaching a destination today. As Ringo Starr wrote, ""I get by with a little help from my friends."""
taurus,2017-02-25,"You long for the comfort that stability brings, but may be deprived of the facts today. It's as if you're barreling ahead but are unable to see what's around the sharp bend. A little assurance goes a long way now because you're finding it difficult to trust your internal GPS. Although your family and friends might come to your rescue, they only confuse matters even more if they misunderstand your intentions. There's really nothing to do about this dilemma. Sometimes you just have to wait for fate to makes its move. Keep calm and remain steadfast in your convictions."
gemini,2017-02-25,"You might feel a little lost as you look to your future today. Although you may have the weekend off from work, you still could be dreaming about where you want your career path to take you. Don't be concerned if you're lacking a concrete plan at this time. Instead, cultivate your ambitions without worrying about someone else's possible judgment. Be fearless in the pursuit of what sets your soul on fire."
cancer,2017-02-25,"Establishing ambitious goals is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it inspires you to apply yourself with greater determination. But, on the other hand, it can set you up for failure if you fall short of your expectations. Nevertheless, you don't have to let discouragement sabotage your accomplishments. Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""What lies behind you and what lies in front of you pales in comparison to what lies inside of you."" Believing in yourself is its own form of success."
leo,2017-02-25,"It's such a blessing today when people offer you encouragement and support. Nevertheless, you still might feel like something is missing from what they bring to the cause. Your problem stems from the fact that you can tell when someone's heart isn't connected with their actions, and their lack of passion could make you feel unloved. Maintaining objectivity is crucial to your happiness, so don't over-personalize the help you receive. Expect less; appreciate more."
virgo,2017-02-25,"You wish that your friends and relatives would pay more attention to your needs, but they seem to be wrapped up in their own worlds today. It's as if everyone is busy with their personal agendas and they will do whatever is necessary to achieve their goals. However, the potential for true cooperation is in the air. Combining your efforts compounds progress exponentially. Aristotle was defining synergy when he wrote, ""The whole is greater than the sum of its parts."""
libra,2017-02-25,"You may not have a list of things to do, but you intuitively know what needs to be accomplished today. Unfortunately, people won't likely leave you alone now; they ask for more details, insist on your commitment and demand your loyalty. However, your enthusiasm to work overshadows your refusal to be too specific in your answers. Understandably, rigidity can create more problems. Your willingness to adapt is an acknowledgement that life doesn't stay the same. The only constant is change."
scorpio,2017-02-25,"Being of service to others is particularly tricky since everyone seems to have very different ideas about what you should contribute today. Juggling the conflicting agendas is enough to make you crazy because you can't do it all. Meanwhile, you just want to be left alone with your creative muse, whether or not you have a specific inspiration in mind now. List the pros and cons of a team effort in order to untangle the subjective and the objective. Sometimes you just need to disconnect and enjoy your own company. Author Umberto Eco wrote, ""Solitude is a kind of freedom."""
sagittarius,2017-02-25,"You can easily visualize your success in the not-too-distant future, but you might not be enthused about doing the work to realize your dream. In fact, you may be feeling downright unmotivated today. Stop trying so hard; your well-intended efforts only stand in your own way now. What you need more than ever is a timeout so you can reestablish your equilibrium. The key to keeping your balance is knowing when you lost it. Rumi wrote, ""Live life as if everything is rigged in your favor."""
capricorn,2017-02-25,"Everything you see today appears like an opportunity to demonstrate your mastery of life. You want to deepen your friendships and you think that showing your competence gives people good reason to depend on you. Nevertheless, you may be unavailable to help someone else if you can't keep up with all the things on your plate now. Rather than trying to impress others, just put your shoulder to the wheel and continue to push forward little by little. Small progress is still progress."
aquarius,2017-02-25,"You can be the friendliest person on the block, but you still prefer to keep your feelings under wraps. Nevertheless, it's nearly impossible to hide your emotions when they seem to leak out in every interpersonal interaction today. You have a lot of leeway when it comes to personal disclosure now, because everyone appears to be tolerant of your quirkiness. However, respecting people's boundaries never goes out of style. As Dorothy Sarnoff cautioned, ""Make sure you have finished speaking before your audience has finished listening."""
pisces,2017-02-25,"You are like a psychic sponge today, soaking in vibrations from people all around you. Although your heightened empathy makes you more compassionate, you can take things too far now. Opening your heart allows everything to enter unfiltered, making it nearly impossible to separate your own personal feelings from those of everyone else. Groucho Marx quipped, ""Be open-minded, but not so open-minded that your brains fall out."" Setting boundaries doesn't make you selfish; it's just plain common sense to take care of yourself."
aries,2017-02-26,"Unexpected behind-the-scenes pressure requires you to make significant changes. Nevertheless, your excitement is irrepressible when impulsive Mars encounters radical Uranus, triggering you to spontaneously vent your nervous energy. Meanwhile, your subconscious opens like a portal, putting you in touch with profound symbolic messages from other dimensions as the Pisces Solar Eclipse stirs your 12th House of Destiny. Don't be surprised when your dreams grow so vivid that they overflow into your everyday life. Picasso said, ""Everything you can imagine is real."""
taurus,2017-02-26,"An unresolved emotional issue may explode into awareness, prompting you to walk away from an uncomfortable situation. The Pisces Solar Eclipse polarizes your 11th House of Friends and Associates, destabilizing relationships within a group. It's up to you to use the current chaos creatively to settle the energy. If your world is rocky, you might need to reconsider your social goals and, perhaps, set your course in a radical new direction. Socrates advised, ""The secret of change is to focus all of your energy, not on fighting the old, but on building the new."""
gemini,2017-02-26,"Your newfound ability to understand how others feel augments your communication skills, making you more popular at work. Fortunately, the psychic Pisces New Moon Eclipse falls in your 10th House of Career, initiating a new cycle of professional growth. However, an erratic Mars-Uranus conjunction suggests things can get out of control when buried tensions come to the surface, whether or not you are a willing participant in an argument. Preemptive action is better now than waiting for something to happen."
cancer,2017-02-26,"Although your idealistic fantasies of travel or education may seem out of reach, acting on your dreams could be well worth your effort. Luckily, the Pisces Solar Eclipse rains drops of inspiration in your 9th House of Big Ideas, watering visions of personal growth. Meanwhile, an electrifying Mars-Uranus conjunction provokes shocking comments when you can no longer keep your opinions to yourself. You might try to avoid conflict, yet the cosmos pushes you to make a radical move that can ultimately improve your life. Do it now; sometimes later becomes never."
leo,2017-02-26,"Decisions made now can be critical to your financial stability for many months. The Pisces Solar Eclipse in your 8th House of Investments leads to unexpected changes related to community property or a business partnership. Meanwhile, a reckless Mars-Uranus conjunction catalyzes unexpressed emotions. Don't ignore your sudden impulses; instead, do whatever it takes to move the stuck energy without jeopardizing your future. Manly P. Hall wrote, ""Moderation is the secret to survival."""
virgo,2017-02-26,"Circumstances mired down by the weight of their history can add to your frustration, tempting you to break free from the restrictions of the past. Although the Pisces Solar Eclipse rattles your 7th House of Partnerships, you won't necessarily have to end a relationship in order to stand up to someone else's control. Nevertheless, it is an option of last resort. Unfortunately, knee-jerk reactions to long-standing problems might not lead to satisfactory solution. Slow down but don't give up."
libra,2017-02-26,"An unexpected change in relationship dynamics can impact your life in surprising ways. The Pisces New Moon Eclipse shakes up the energy of your 6th House of Daily Routine, indicating that an overdue lifestyle overhaul may be in order. Outdated habits that keep you plugging along in a comfortable rut are brought into the spotlight, illuminating the need for healthy alternatives. A sudden twist of fate may be a real blessing in disguise. Get excited if your world starts to shift because the future is yours to create."
scorpio,2017-02-26,"You may want to reconsider your personal needs with respect to those around you. A compassionate Pisces Solar Eclipse shadows your 5th House of Fun, temporarily obscuring your road to satisfaction. You seek spontaneity, but you don't want to upset the status quo. Thankfully, you can probably get away with more outrageous behavior now, since rocking the boat won't necessarily tip it over. Nevertheless, your playful and romantic spirit is unleashed, inspiring you to plant seeds of joy everywhere you go."
sagittarius,2017-02-26,"The fires of passion are burning brightly, setting the stage for big changes at home. It might not take long to put your dreams into action because go-getter Mars rams into unconventional Uranus, provoking impulsive behavior. Meanwhile, the Pisces Solar Eclipse stirs the emotional waters in your 4th House of Home, making this an excellent time to cleanse an old family wound or mend a domestic squabble. But it's not enough to imagine an improvement; you must also be committed to putting your plan into action. Live less out of habit and more out of intent."
capricorn,2017-02-26,"Psychic channels open for you today, allowing you to understand things you might not be able to explain otherwise. The mystical gifts of the Pisces New Moon Eclipse are bestowed upon your 3rd House of Immediate Environment, enabling you to successfully rely upon your intuition to navigate through the current situation. But if you need to inspire people to follow your dream, wait until midweek when your persuasive skills are more highly attuned. Trust your instincts now even if others don't."
aquarius,2017-02-26,"Surprise repairs or other unplanned expenses can turn your finances upside down. A perplexing Pisces New Moon Eclipse upsets your 2nd House of Money and may be somewhat hazardous to your checkbook. The flowing adrenaline could revitalize you with thrills if you are up for a change. But too much resistance quickly fills your world with chaos. Obviously, it's challenging to contain the energy; however, this dilemma won't be solved by a quick emotional outburst. Stephen King wrote, ""If you don't control your temper, your temper will control you."""
pisces,2017-02-26,"It's time to break free of old habits, whether you feel trapped in a relationship or you can't stand to be alone for one more day. Experimenting with innovative ways of interacting with others can lead you into exciting unexplored territory as the Pisces Solar Eclipse prompts a thorough self-analysis. Be kind if you don't like everything you see because facing the negative is the first step to turning your life in a more positive direction. A flood of crazy new ideas may be thrilling or overwhelming. Pick one thought and try it on for size before exploring another."
aries,2017-02-27,"You have energy to spare today and you're willing to put it toward making a relationship more successful. You may be inspired to try something you've never done before, and a current challenge could excite your nerves more than it irritates. However, you're easily annoyed if the wrong person teases you, yet it feels flirtatiously playful from someone you like. A high-energy Mars-Jupiter opposition motivates you to sell your ideas with passion and back them up with decisive action. Nevertheless, don't promise more than you can deliver if your anticipation jumps too far ahead of your common sense."
taurus,2017-02-27,"You are like the proverbial Bull in a china shop today and need to be extra cautious lest you break something valuable. The boisterous Mars-Jupiter opposition bolsters you with enthusiasm, encouraging you to put on a colorful show. Take your happiest feelings from the past and drag them out into the open so everyone can enjoy your company even more. Joy that's shared is joy made double."
gemini,2017-02-27,"Your great expectations may have you believing you can conquer the world today. Your future looks unusually bright while overconfident Jupiter conspires with assertive Mars in your 11th House of Long-Term Goals. Nevertheless, maintaining your balance is challenging now because you are all jacked up and primed for action. However, the biggest obstacle could be your own delusional perspective if you allow it to inflate your ego. Henry Winkler said, ""Assumptions are the termites of relationships."""
cancer,2017-02-27,"The emotional support you receive at home acts as a stabilizing force today. Nevertheless, energetic Mars is engaged in a tug-of-war with boundless Jupiter, supplying you with unlimited enthusiasm. Paradoxically, as your optimism pushes you outside your protective shell, you'll actually feel safer than anyone else. Successful people take big risks, knowing that they might fall hard before they soar to great heights. Nothing ventured, nothing gained."
leo,2017-02-27,"A haunting recollection from the past may be accompanied by feelings of regret or guilt. Thankfully, your memory won't spoil your day while a buoyant Mars-Jupiter opposition fills you with passion. Competitive Mars triggers your adrenaline but don't let extravagant Jupiter pressure you into taking a foolish chance. Your playful nature is running wild and the sheer force of your personality could overpower a timid person. Overindulging is a risk, but now is not the time to sit on the sidelines. Those who don't jump will never fly."
virgo,2017-02-27,"Sometimes a period of recuperation is required after high-intensity social engagements. Although there is instability everywhere today, uncertainty holds the promise of profound change if you are willing to take an objective look at your basic values. You may be called upon to fight for your beliefs now, but you also must be willing to let go of the battle if it cannot be won. Know when to walk away without compromising your self-respect. A good retreat is better than a bad stand."
libra,2017-02-27,"Others look to you for advice today because you seem to have all the answers. Your colleagues lean on you and you're not one to let them down. However, you could easily underestimate the amount of work required to fulfill their expectations. Thankfully, a seemingly endless pool of energy allows you to navigate these intense times with grace. It might be helpful to let off some steam if you don't mind a little friendly combat. If you want to be trusted, just be honest right from the start."
scorpio,2017-02-27,"Your adrenaline rises today and your fervor can leave you longing for adventure. However, you may also feel increasingly frustrated by the daily grind. You are itching to break out of a rut, but you want to act in a manner that is not abrasive or obsessive. Instead of rebelling against a person or an idea now, explore your options with passion and common sense. Curbing your enthusiasm enables you to finish your work on time. Fredrick Lenz taught, ""From a Buddhist perspective, it is incorrect to always assume that we know what is best."""
sagittarius,2017-02-27,"Reining in your energy sounds like a great idea today, but self-discipline may continue to elude you. Fortunately, you're flexible enough now to respond to changing circumstances with boldness and originality as big-thinking Jupiter opposes energetic Mars in your 5th House of Creativity. Everything looks so good that you might dive right into an inviting pool before you realize there's no water in it. Although the opportunities could be quite rewarding, your tendency to skip over the fine print can create a sizable headache. Thinking before acting is wisdom but acting before thinking is regret."
capricorn,2017-02-27,"You are often a champion at managing your personal resources. Nevertheless, you're as busy as a bee today and could become totally distracted on the way to your destination while reckless Mars opposes far-reaching Jupiter. Spreading yourself too thin to gain recognition or success is a common consequence of this cosmic configuration. Tim Ferriss wrote, ""Focus on being productive instead of busy."""
aquarius,2017-02-27,"The emotional winds are shifting and you can feel the electricity of anticipation in the air. You're ready to rumble as feisty Mars opposes boundless Jupiter in your 9th House of Adventure, infusing you with buoyant enthusiasm. However, don't let down your guard no matter how amazing everything looks. Proceed with caution or you will quickly pay the price for over-committing. Khalil Gibran wrote, ""Progress lies not in enhancing what is, but in advancing toward what will be."""
pisces,2017-02-27,"You're ready to leap into a new project at work today, even if you're unsure where you will land. Be careful; observe the current circumstances carefully before you launch yourself into action. Your uncharacteristic competitive side can hijack your day by pushing you outside of your normal range of expression. Although you are driven by the best of intentions, you may not know your limits until you've overstepped them. Thankfully, a dash of common sense keeps you out of harm's way."
aries,2017-02-28,"You are happiest when you are busy because it feels good to be in motion. Unfortunately, you could end up exhausted by inadvertently carrying this strategy too far. Instead of blindly rushing into the next project now, block out time on your calendar to do nothing at all. As difficult as it may be to sit still for a while, a bit of downtime is the greatest gift you can give yourself today. Remember the Chinese proverb, ""Tension is who you think you should be. Relaxation is who you are."""
taurus,2017-02-28,"You may need some time to regroup today, especially if your hectic schedule has depleted your energy. You are relieved to see the dust settle and hope to catch up on some lost sleep. Nevertheless, circumstances at work could push back at your desire to retreat, pulling you into the spotlight. There's no reason to try to resolve the tension between withdrawal and engagement now. Pay close attention to the changing dynamics and follow the course of least resistance. Mooji teaches, ""Feelings are just visitors; let them come and go."""
gemini,2017-02-28,"You are less concerned with achieving your objectives today than you are in collaborating with your peers. The Moon's shift into your 11th House of Networks reminds you that a community derives its strength from the number of people that comprise the group. However, you might not be ready to completely set aside your personal goals. Ideally, convincing others to support your efforts would be the best-case scenario. Demonstrate your intelligence by knowing when to reshuffle your priorities for the sake of cooperation. The power of the many outweighs the power of one."
cancer,2017-02-28,"You might be unsure of your current role at work, especially if you're being asked to assume a position of leadership. Taking on new responsibilities pushes you into uncharted territory, yet you may not feel confident enough now to hold the reins of power. Nevertheless, this could be one of those times when swinging into action is so exciting that you forget about any lingering insecurities. Be the kind of leader you would follow."
leo,2017-02-28,"The wind is at your back now, filling your sails and steadily blowing you toward your destination. It's time to consciously acknowledge where you are coming from and where you are heading as you begin your next journey. Of course, there are still obstacles to overcome and decisions to be made, but don't let any uncertainties stand in the way of today's progress. Hold the vision; trust the process."
virgo,2017-02-28,"You are aware of the subtle emotional complexities that entangle you in a power struggle today. If someone -- even you -- recently overstepped their bounds, there may be unspoken concerns that are silently weighing on everyone's minds. You might be better equipped than anyone to bring the hidden truth out into the open because you can maintain an analytical approach without letting your biases get in the way. Author David Weinberger writes, ""Transparency is the new objectivity."""
libra,2017-02-28,"People seem to be very self-directed today, leaving little time for you and your needs. You are known for your ability to look beyond your personal desires and take everyone's feelings into consideration. The excitable Aries Moon entices you to project your spontaneity onto those around you while she visits your 7th House of Others. However, acknowledging your projections empowers you to be responsible for your own happiness and reduces the chances of it being stolen from you by someone else. Let the sunshine in your soul shine from the inside out."
scorpio,2017-02-28,"You can improve your life by taking steps to redefine your daily routine. Maybe you're in the process of reevaluating your current job or lifestyle with an eye to increasing your efficiency or optimizing your health. In any event, don't let old habits limit your thinking. There are more options than you realize and the most effective path into your future might mean making some very small adjustments that will have significant impact over time. What you do everyday matters more than something you do every now and then."
sagittarius,2017-02-28,"If you are riding a wave of high energy, you might be able to keep it going for a few more days. However, you could find yourself in over your head unless you are fully committed to maintaining your balance -- emotionally and physically -- moment by moment. Of course, you may have the time of your life while the spontaneous Aries Moon dances through your 5th House of Fun and Games, but overindulgence will lead to complications. Author Herbert Simon wrote, ""One finds limits by pushing them."""
capricorn,2017-02-28,"Your career objectives continue to inspire you to reach for the stars. However, sometimes even you aspiring Mountain Goats require some time to ease up on your drive to succeed. Rather than squeezing another meeting between two others, take a short walk. There are many moments during your day when you can shave off a few minutes for a little relaxation or contemplation. Disconnecting from the outer noise and listening to your own thoughts enables you to focus on the things that matter the most."
aquarius,2017-02-28,"You are easily bored today and seek out distractions of all types. Instead of jumping into your work and settling down to business, you're more interested in joining coworkers at the water cooler or procrastinating with a YouTube binge. Ironically, your diversionary tactics might increase your overall efficiency if you can keep your extracurricular activities within reason. A break in your routine may be enough to reset your brain and enable you to return to your less exciting tasks with an improved attitude. As Rumi wrote, ""We often need to be refreshed."""
pisces,2017-02-28,"Your sense of identity is changing yet you can't tell much about the end result. You might realize that your current plans have less to do with accomplishing specific tasks as you consider more emotional and spiritual pursuits. But don't take the easy way out by sinking into fantasies that have nothing to do with your goals. Instead, use your daydreams to explore alternative paths into your future. Having one option is not an option."
aries,2017-03-01,"You're certain you're in the right, but there's more to the story outside your field of vision. You don't care for tact today as you fall back on the most tried and true method known to you by speaking your piece without considering the consequences. Contentious exchanges seem unavoidable when the provocative Moon in your sign joins rebellious Uranus and competitive Mars, driving you to push for the win in any argument. Avoid spending someone else's feelings as currency to buy your victory. Holding your tongue now prevents saying things you'll regret when new information comes to light."
taurus,2017-03-01,"All you need is time, but that's the one thing you seem to lack today. Your long-term goals appear blurry and you can't make out defined shapes no matter how much you squint. The noble Sun and nebulous Neptune conjoin in your 11th House of Hopes and Wishes, awakening a longing for clarity. Although you want to reestablish stability as soon as possible, it's better to let yourself sit with the uncertainty until the fog lifts. Contending with metaphysical concepts is more exhausting than you expect. Socrates wrote, ""The only true wisdom is knowing that you know nothing."""
gemini,2017-03-01,"Starting slow to finish strong is a paradox than might not even cross your mind today. It seems as if you can just articulate yourself a little better, your friends and colleagues will understand just what you mean. Although you're driven to tell them your grand plan at a mile a minute, taking them on a crash course through your mind may backfire and do the opposite of what you intend. You can cover more ground when you speak less, so try moderating your pace to a comfortable trot rather than a verbal sprint. Taste your words before you spit them out."
cancer,2017-03-01,"You want to believe in something, but you're not sure where to put your faith. It's uncomfortable to feel like a safe haven is out of reach today and all you have to depend on is your own defenses. Fortunately, you have more support than you think as the brave Aries Moon joins ardent Mars in your 10th House of Reputation. Harnessing this fire gives you the courage to stand up for yourself. Remain strong in the face of doubt, but don't be too quick to judge anyone's character. Theodore Roosevelt said, ""Comparison is the thief of joy."""
leo,2017-03-01,"You're ready to journey far and wide for answers yet it seems like anyone who challenges your approach is just trying to bring you down. However, if your conclusions appear deceptively simple, they probably are. A mystical Sun-Neptune conjunction in your 8th House of Transformation is like a cosmic fog machine, clouding your vision and dissolving your identity. Although the journey has more curves and bends than the straight shot you prefer, the truth is that you must look inside for what you seek. Neale Donald Walsch wrote, ""Life begins at the end of your comfort zone."""
virgo,2017-03-01,"Bickering may be inevitable when you can't figure out what someone wants from you. However, blurred lines between give and take could be a reflection of your own uncertainty when it comes to what you expect from a close friend or lover. Instead of focusing on your differences, take time to think about the ideals you share. Reserve decision-making until clarity returns for the sake of harmony. Find common ground by moving to higher ground."
libra,2017-03-01,"Maintaining the peace requires extra effort today and you must constantly try to keep your balance. What begins as an impassioned dialogue can flip to a total free-for-all in the space of a moment. The blatant Aries Moon squares off with exaggerating Jupiter, leading you to believe that your opinion is obviously the right one. Unfortunately, matters aren't as simple as they seem. Thankfully, this wild ride will come to an end and it's better to resist taking the bait in the heat of the moment. Shakespeare wrote, ""Discretion is the better part of valor."""
scorpio,2017-03-01,"Although you're striving for transparency, the day is riddled with misunderstandings that baffle and perplex. You may not be coming across as clearly as you think now that the mighty Sun is joined with illusory Neptune in your 5th House of Self-Expression. You're more likely to create a beautiful work of art than lay out a business plan today. Instead of lashing out when you can't make your point, reel in your frustration and channel it into something creative when you have the chance. Energy flows where attention goes."
sagittarius,2017-03-01,"A situation at home may be so confusing today that you try to make sense of it by being even more direct in your inquiries. Unfortunately, emotional problems aren't likely to be resolved by sheer force, and you might end up pushing people's buttons instead. You're likely too close to the situation to see it objectively right now, making a drive for resolution a waste of energy for everyone. Instead of trying to prove your point to an unreceptive audience, use your frustration to fuel a creative endeavor of your own. If it doesn't open, it's not your door."
capricorn,2017-03-01,"You're gritting your teeth and trying to keep your eye on the task at hand but your mind is fuzzier than ever. You may believe that your efficiency will return if you push yourself harder, but the amorphous Sun-Neptune conjunction in your 3rd House of Communication grants no one exemption from its surreal influence. True productivity comes from using the tools you have now rather than wishing you had different ones. Making the best of the present moment empowers you to make the most yourself."
aquarius,2017-03-01,"Your witty remarks may carry more sting than you realize today. Your goal isn't to provoke, but unless you take great care to mind your acerbic tone, you could find yourself in more spats than you bargained for. The brash Aries Moon is out picking fights with unpredictable Uranus and plucky Mars, tapping you in for round after round. Anything you can do to cool your head will be beneficial until the cosmic heat wave passes. The Dali Lama teaches, ""Be kind whenever possible. It is always possible."""
pisces,2017-03-01,"A misty sheen coats the world today, making the ordinary magical and the facts slippery. You feel like you're on a different wavelength than everyone else, thanks to the annual meeting of the glorious Sun and otherworldly Neptune in your sign. Your acute sensitivity may make insignificant tiffs seem more upsetting than usual, so try not to take them too personally. It matters less that people relate to how you feel, and more that you experience the moment without resistance. Lao Tzu wrote, ""Those who flow as life flows know they need no other force."""
aries,2017-03-02,"You're ready to break off and blaze your own trail as even the most amicable agreements with others feel like dependence. A climax to a longer story between you and a partner or close friend is finally at hand when rebellious Uranus stands directly opposite preachy Jupiter in your 7th House of Relationships. Although you're eager to test your mettle in your own way, pausing for a moment to ground yourself will ensure that your trip off the beaten path is as adventurous as you hope. Author David Eddings wrote, ""Impatience is a poor substitute for a well-considered plan."""
taurus,2017-03-02,"When the structure of your daily routine gives way to internal stirrings, it's as if a latch that has been slowly slipping is at last unhinged. It could be hard to understand exactly what is going on, but it's clear that something is different. The supportive Taurus Moon takes up residence in your 1st House of Self, urging you to cling to what you can see in front of you when the rumbles of evolution are disconcerting. However, simply observing your feelings without judgment is all you need to do to usher in a new era of personal growth. Never let your fears decide your future."
gemini,2017-03-02,"You're dying to mix things up today, whether the people around you support or undermine your efforts. Electricity crackles through your 11th House of Social Circles when revolutionary Uranus opposes affirming Jupiter, prompting you to shake off anything stagnant in your network. However, what seems stuck may actually just be stable, but situations often look different when your nerves are overstimulated. It's imperative to rest your mind and body so your decisions are in alignment with what you want in the long run, not just in the moment."
cancer,2017-03-02,"You might think your prospects are limited by your past mistakes, but in reality you could be outgrowing the shoes you wear. You find yourself rethinking career possibilities, and for once the future doesn't seem as restricted by your personal history. This window of opportunity to refashion your loftiest ambitions may be so exciting as to be a bit overwhelming, but there's no need to fear what such changes portend. As the sensible Taurus Moon transits your 11th House of Friends, reach out to your pals for the moral support you need to face these developments with courage. Nothing is gained by looking for trouble where it doesn't exist."
leo,2017-03-02,"You long to be liberated from your previous concept of success now, and surge ahead without the help of conventional advice. They say slow and steady wins the race, but you can't seem to escape your craving for instant gratification when it comes to achieving your goals. At the same time, you care deeply about what others think of you. While you want to be seen as impressive, you also don't want to compromise your reputation in the process. Use this moment of hesitation to orient your trajectory in a more realistic way, instead of letting self-consciousness freeze you in place."
virgo,2017-03-02,"You're not often found without a plan, but today you might be questioning your projected course. You're wondering if it's time to cut your losses and move on from an energy sink that drains you. What seems like a tenuous connection between what is yours and what you share with others is plucked like a musical string. The reverberations may rattle you more than expected, but the sooner you acknowledge them, the easier it is to correct your course. Awareness is the secret to your success."
libra,2017-03-02,"You may think you finally calmed the waters, but this is precisely when your boat gets rocked. Although you are often busy navigating the seas of interpersonal relationships, someone close to you turns into a wild card that pits your desire for balance with their individualistic ideals. Rather than engaging in a power struggle today, keep an eye on your emotional compass to find your true north amidst the storm."
scorpio,2017-03-02,"You don't want to rely on anyone else to get you through the day, but right now your closest friend may be a much-needed ally. Realizing your health and happiness need a major overhaul can be too much to process if you take it all in at once. Nevertheless, a trustworthy shoulder can make all the difference today. Happily, dependence isn't required for forward progress in the long run. A healthy injection of moral support soothes your nerves and provides sweet serenity."
sagittarius,2017-03-02,"It's as if your best idea has been refracted by a prism, scattering it in different directions that each has its own unique appeal. As a lover of the road of many rather than of the path of few, you're more likely to be exhilarated than daunted by the colorful explosion of possibilities before you. However, you must take into account how much you can realistically fit on your plate before ordering everything on the cosmic menu. Oscar Wilde wrote, ""Everything in moderation, including moderation."""
capricorn,2017-03-02,"You believe you have explored all your options, but deeper analysis uncovers a previously overlooked avenue for improvement. Reframing your thought process eases your mind, giving you more mental energy to handle the transformations that are occurring within you. Although self-reflection could threaten your growing empire, it's the best time to be completely honest with yourself about what you want. Reconnecting with your heart results in tangible rewards."
aquarius,2017-03-02,"Your horizons are rapidly expanding now, but you're still anxious to shatter the monotony of the immediate situation and rearrange the pieces. Even if the resulting mosaic is crude in comparison to the bigger picture, you might feel that anything is better than waiting around for the present to catch up to your ultimate master plan. However, you may cut yourself on your sharp ideas in your haste to complete your design. Returning to your foundation allows you to reestablish stability before launching into the future."
pisces,2017-03-02,"A serious evaluation of your values is in order, especially if you are basing your decisions on others. While compromise is essential for healthy relationships, a conflict in priorities causes you to reconsider your choices. Fortunately, clever Mercury delivers instructions from authoritative Saturn, regarding which boundaries need to be abolished and which need fortification. Being your best self is more than adaptation; you must get in touch with your basic needs before you can reach your highest potential."
aries,2017-03-03,"You're ready to savor some simple comforts that remain timeless in an otherwise busy age. Indulgent foods and luxurious experiences evoke a sense of relaxation when the tactile Taurus Moon settles into your 2nd House of Material Goods. However, a little voice in your head keeps reminding you that spiritual pursuits can be as gratifying as pleasurable ones. There's no reason to think you can't chase both now as long as you keep moderation in mind. Olen Steinhauer wrote, ""Without balance a life is no longer worth the effort."""
taurus,2017-03-03,"You may think everything is right as rain, but disagreements with your friends and coworkers pop up seemingly out of the blue today. While daily differences in opinion are nothing new, you might be extra sensitive when the reflective Moon is in your sign. However, this receptivity also allows you to find beauty in even the most unlikely places. Choose to focus only on what you want to create now and let the positivity overflow to those around you. You hold the reins in your hands, so steering toward a peaceful destination is in your control."
gemini,2017-03-03,"You're facing the choice to participate in an impassioned dialogue or to sit this one out, and your decision is made more difficult now because of your strong feelings. While you care so deeply for a social cause that you feel it in your bones, it's difficult to express the details precisely enough now for your peers to understand. If the endless chatter drains you today, it's perfectly acceptable to bow out early and retreat to your happy place. You may learn more by listening to your body's call for rest than leaning into every chance for mental engagement. Talk less, meditate more."
cancer,2017-03-03,"You can hardly wait to get together with friends or family to seek the solace only they provide. Planning for your future seems like too much trouble today, especially when you could gather with your loved ones and reminisce about the good old days instead. Although you can't make your duties magically disappear today, focusing on your blessings brings a sense of ease to your workday until it's time to kick off your shoes and relax with your favorite people. A grateful mind is a powerful mind."
leo,2017-03-03,"Although you're confident you could win almost any argument, you stop just before the words leave your mouth today. Somehow you can tell that it's not worth your time to spar with anyone now. Stick to the facts without offering any personal commentary, especially with the sensible Taurus Moon's presence in your 10th House of Public Responsibility. Being someone people look to as a positive example is more rewarding than winning verbal skirmishes. A true leader doesn't have to shout."
virgo,2017-03-03,"Try as you might to sort out the mysteries of your heart, it could be difficult to discern anything past the fact that something just feels off. The situation becomes more maddening the more you dwell on it, even if you know it won't do you any good. Instead of spinning in circles of doubt, administer a healthy dose of the natural world by taking a long walk outside. Staying physically present is the key to staying mentally serene."
libra,2017-03-03,"A companion's impatience may rub off on you even if your intention is to maintain the peace. In fact, you wish you could open up about your feelings today, but it seems as if the moment isn't right. Fortunately, quiet time spent together might be more healing than talking issues over as the sensual Taurus Moon transits your 8th House of Intimacy. When words seem to complicate things, a friendly silence is often the best alternative. Sharing a memorable experience can deepen a connection without any awkwardness on anyone's part."
scorpio,2017-03-03,"You covet spending time with a person you love  because it seems like the exchange of affection will joyfully overpower all other concerns. You prefer to pursue creature comforts rather than attack your to-do list when capricious Mercury and insistent Mars make a stressful exchange. The longer you procrastinate today, the more you want to shirk your responsibilities. However, letting your mood affect your productivity may land you in a gridlock. Do your work as soon as possible so you can unwind at your leisure later on. Responsibility is your friend."
sagittarius,2017-03-03,"You're usually the first one to vote for a day off, but you're able to find a surprising amount of enjoyment in the daily grind today. Finding your groove and seeing measurable progress can be a source of joy, especially if minor contentions at home are aggravating you. Sticking to your agenda gives complex situations a chance to breathe and provides a healthy change of pace. Using work as a distraction is a good idea now as long as you don't avoid the truth."
capricorn,2017-03-03,"Your message is not getting heard by your peers today even when you try to appeal to their best interests. It's as if communication lines are crossed and you long for clear answers, but it's hard to give or receive them. In the end, you want  to bypass all the commotion and reestablish your center of gravity. The bucolic Taurus Moon grazes in your 5th House of Play, reminding you that you're not required to work all the time. Take a break from solving the world's problems and let yourself feel like a kid again."
aquarius,2017-03-03,"The more errands that demand your time and attention today, the longer you would like to stay in bed. Nothing sounds better now than walking through your door and melting into your couch like a contented cat in a warm beam of sunlight. Normal tasks seem more irritating, but that's probably because your vision of domestic bliss lies in stark contrast. Finding joy in the ordinary is the secret to your happiness."
pisces,2017-03-03,"It's challenging to not get caught up in your head today. You may wonder what people mean by their words and if they carry any hidden implications about how much you matter to them. However, the stable Taurus Moon illuminates your 3rd House of Information, imploring you to look at the basic facts instead of letting your imagination run wild. Shift your attention to what is real and beautiful today and let all negative assumptions go. Henry David Thoreau wrote, ""It's not what you look at, but what you see."""
aries,2017-03-04,"You're not shy about going after what you want; in fact, you consider it a basic right for everyone. But even you question the flavor of your pie in the sky when acquisitive Venus stops in her tracks in your 1st House of Self. Trusting your gut is more complicated now, and your preferences seem like they require a total overhaul. However, be careful that in your haste to align with your changing desires you don't burn bridges you'll need on your return trip. Resist your urge to do a complete one-eighty until you have more information on which to base your decisions. Better safe than sorry."
taurus,2017-03-04,"You're unsure of your feelings and it may not seem safe to open up to someone yet. You're likely to keep your wants and needs private as you sort them out when your key planet Venus begins her retrograde cycle in your 12th House of Secrets. But this emotional process can't be completed overnight. Thankfully, starting a discussion allows you to reestablish your priorities and gain clarity on the relationship dynamics. Sometimes making it up as you go along is the simplest strategy. Guitarist John McLaughlin said, ""Only in spontaneity can we be who we truly are."""
gemini,2017-03-04,"You want to make a proactive move now that it feels like you're back in the game, but the path to your goal isn't as clear as you think. Rational Mercury is entranced with the spell-binding powers of Neptune, and even the straightest of facts wiggle and bend as if viewed under rippling water. No matter how firm you think your proclamations are today, they're likely to be misconstrued by coworkers and friends. The more you speak, the less it helps; wait for better conditions instead of wasting your breath on words that will blow away in the changing winds."
cancer,2017-03-04,"It seems as if everything is in flux and you can't tell which way is up. Your ambitions are beginning a phase of revisions when magnetic Venus marches backward through your 10th House of Profession. Over the next several weeks, you may rethink your career objectives and question your ability to succeed, leaving you lost in unfamiliar territory. However, self-deprecating thoughts are not to be heeded while the cosmic weather is so foggy. Don't worry about the low visibility now; there will be time to figure out all the details once the sky is clear."
leo,2017-03-04,"The bright beacon on your horizon may seem to dim today, taking your enthusiasm with it. What you thought was the most ideal long-term goal is beginning to morph into something different now, and pulling back your investment could feel like defeat. However, re-imagining some aspects of your grand vision isn't a bad idea, although the process is likely to cause a good deal of confusion. Instead of remapping your entire voyage all at once, take a break and lean on your pals for healthy distraction and camaraderie. Hard times will always reveal true friends."
virgo,2017-03-04,"Everything seems stranger than fiction today, making it tricky to believe what you hear. You're right to not trust what someone tells you today as analytical Mercury is watered down by delusional Neptune in your 7th House of Others. It's nearly impossible to accurately distinguish the truth from deception now, and assuming one or the other might produce unsavory consequences if you get it wrong. Fortunately, time is on your side when mental acuity is not. Patience is your secret to survival."
libra,2017-03-04,"A cycle of reevaluation is beginning as you reflect on your expectations of your most important partnerships. Resourceful Venus turns retrograde in your 7th House of Relationships, shifting your emotions inward for processing. This introspective phase gives you the opportunity to assess what you're willing to give others and what you want to receive in return. However, sudden moves or quick changes of heart are not advisable today. Assume the role of observer rather than initiator for the best results."
scorpio,2017-03-04,"You want to share your passion for art, but what is beautiful to you may seem nonsensical to others. Truthfully, it doesn't matter what people think as long as you don't depend on their agreement for a sense of validation. A mystical Mercury-Neptune conjunction in your 5th House of Self-Expression stimulates your creative urges, but could muddle how your ideas sound to those who aren't living in your imaginative world. Try not to take a lack of acknowledgment personally; everyone is dealing with today's perplexities in their own way."
sagittarius,2017-03-04,"Your thoughts turn to a remembered passion today, whether it's an old flame or a beloved hobby. Although you're usually game to go wherever the wind blows you, you may end up in a very different place than you think if you follow your whims now. An illusory Mercury-Neptune combination in your 4th House of Foundations liquefies that which is usually solid, making your mind's eye about as accurate as a compass in the Bermuda Triangle. Instead of embarking on a journey that's likely to lead you in circles, ask a friend for a reality-check before making any significant decisions."
capricorn,2017-03-04,"Although you're willing to take on more than your share of the responsibilities, family troubles may be unavoidable now. Nevertheless, you might not be able to resolve the discord right away; only time and forgiveness will heal the wounds and soften the scars. Unfortunately, your practical calculations are of no use if your logical mind is taking the weekend off. Poor judgment and forgetfulness may frustrate you to no end if you expect to save the world today. Never stress over what you can't control. Life is a work in progress."
aquarius,2017-03-04,"It doesn't seem like the appropriate time or place to explain your true feelings now, so you try your best to keep conversations light and breezy. Skimming the surface and bouncing from one topic to another provides mindless entertainment today, enabling you to avoid heavier topics. While sticking to small talk is a good short-term strategy when necessary, be sure to face the music if it grows louder over the coming weeks. Honesty is the highest form of intimacy."
pisces,2017-03-04,"Although you would love to stay in your own little cocoon today, real life is knocking at the door and there are matters you must address. If your self-control is lacking when it comes to your spending habits, your wake-up call is on the way as luxurious Venus stations retrograde in your 2nd House of Money. Financial concerns are due for reassessment over the next several weeks, even if you don't reallocate resources right away. It's wise to recognize the situation no matter what the scope. Buddhist teacher Thich Nhat Hanh says, ""Awareness is like the Sun. When it shines on things, they are transformed."""
aries,2017-03-05,"Your assertive nature lends itself to advancing with speed and force, but the addition of tactical prowess can put you at an even greater advantage. Your key planet Mars partners with calculating Saturn, giving you the gift of strategy when brute force isn't enough. Although the path is not without obstacles, you're able to keep your eye on your destination and adjust your course accordingly without losing too much momentum. A concrete goal and faith in yourself are the key ingredients in your formula for success."
taurus,2017-03-05,"You may not realize how hard you've been working until someone points out all your accomplishments. You naturally gravitate towards flying solo on a project today because too much input from others dilutes the facts. Even if people mean well by adding their opinions to the mix, it's perfectly acceptable to thank them and move on so you aren't distracted for too long. Just don't stay in your own bubble from dawn to dusk lest you exhaust yourself before you reach your goals. Lewis Carroll wrote, ""The hurrier I go, the behinder I get."""
gemini,2017-03-05,"Picking one direction is the hardest choice of the day; you wish you could be two places at once to dip your toes in more experiences. Fortunately, your friends are likely to have more concrete plans and getting on board with them gives you a positive outlet for your energy. In the same way others help you focus your enthusiasm, you lend their rigid agenda the flexibility it needs to thrive. As Helen Keller wrote, ""Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much."""
cancer,2017-03-05,"You're bound by your will to achieve today, and you can already hear the accolades you'll receive once you prove yourself successful. However, a hidden fear of failure may tickle the back of your mind as the fickle Gemini Moon sneaks through your 12th House of Secrets. Nonetheless, you can endure momentary swerves that uncertainty places in your path thanks to your increasing stamina. Maintaining a list of objectives to serve as a map will keep you on course if your doubt threatens to make you flounder. Paulo Coelho wrote, ""You are what you believe yourself to be."""
leo,2017-03-05,"You're content to luxuriate in a sea of knowledge and drink it all in one sitting. Your insatiable craving for learning and experience drives you to throw yourself into an area of study while energetic Mars in your 9th House of Higher Education connects to industrious Saturn. You're envisioning just how far you can reach if everything goes your way, and every step toward your goal adds to your optimism. The great Michelangelo said at the age of eighty-seven, ""I am still learning."""
virgo,2017-03-05,"You are a pro at getting to the bottom of a mystery, willing to dig after everyone else gives up. Your loved ones may not understand why you won't let something go today, but you don't want to let it slide when you think there's more to the story. Unclear relationship dynamics recently make finding the truth even more important to you now. Nevertheless, steamrolling someone isn't the way to uncover their true feelings; practicing compassion and kindness is key. Your determination could turn to obsession if you put on blinders. A little less pressure creates space for everyone to breathe."
libra,2017-03-05,"You're not quite sure how to bring up an important topic to someone you know well. Fortunately, you can start anywhere and solidify your position as you go; the most important step is the first one. Working together allows you to sort out issues that you might otherwise ignore. You possess the endurance now to commit to the discussion until both parties state their cases. It's up to you whether you make yourself a partner or opponent. Cooperative enterprises build a better world."
scorpio,2017-03-05,"Teeth gritted and focus fixed, you're in it for the long haul. You're quite the utilitarian today, whether it's wrapping up loose ends or fitting a challenging workout into your schedule. However, mixed ideas about what to attack first may cause you to falter needlessly. The way forward is found through paring down possibilities and pursuing just one objective at a time. There are days when you're a jack of all trades, but right now you're the master of one."
sagittarius,2017-03-05,"A feeling of purpose impels you to stay off the couch and use your physical energy for the collective good. Action-hero Mars warms up in your 5th House of Fun while being coached by stern Saturn, adding a slightly serious tone to recreational activities. Fortunately, even when you play to win, it's all in good fun at the end of the day. Keeping competition friendly is more uplifting for all involved. In life there are no winners or losers, just different ways of playing the game."
capricorn,2017-03-05,"You're happy to finally have a chance to tackle chores around the house, even though lingering brain fog is trying to pull you off course. Thankfully, your fierce drive to get things done easily overcomes the fuzziness, and you may even want to add some extra things to the lineup since you're on a roll. Paradoxically, the less you have on your list the more you'll get done; maintaining a single-minded focus rather than juggling multiple things at once is a smoother path to success. Concentration is your friend."
aquarius,2017-03-05,You're ready to shake off the blahs from the past few days and do something that feels productive again. What begins as a reflection on how your short-term efforts support your long-term goals could turn into a marathon of planning when organizational Saturn helps brazen Mars manage your 3rd House of Information. Proactively making the most of your available resources while keeping your highest goals in mind is a wonderful way to utilize your enthusiasm today. People with great passion can make the impossible happen.
pisces,2017-03-05,"Getting out of your own way is always your choice. It may seem like you need to stay in the contemplation phase a bit longer before shedding your insecurities and stepping up to the plate. However, once you commit to believing in yourself, it's like boarding a cosmic elevator that lifts your confidence steadily higher. The first move is the hardest, but you won't regret making it in hindsight. Mark Twain wrote, ""Courage is not the absence of fear; it is acting in spite of it."""
aries,2017-03-06,"A realization from the bottom of your mental ocean rises toward the surface of your consciousness today. But your new awareness is only a starting point and you want to turn it into something practical. However, your ideas take on a life of their own as you attempt to shape them into tangible plans. No matter what you learn now, being gentle with the integration process is the most important thing to remember. Your attitude determines your direction."
taurus,2017-03-06,"An intimate gathering creates the perfect space to give voice to your dreams. Talking about your aspirations can be nerve-wracking now, especially if you're not entirely sure they're realistic. However, sharing your goals with people you trust  helps you recognize both their value and their risks. Your shyness will melt away as soon as you start a conversation, so don't be timid about speaking openly around those who know you best. Friends are like your backbone; they are always there when you need support."
gemini,2017-03-06,"You have a rare chance to clarify your intentions at work and clear up any recent misunderstandings. Communicator Mercury joins the shining Sun in your 10th House of Career, giving you a podium on which to stand and make your case. People are likely to hear your tone more than your words today, making what could be uncomfortable negotiations go more smoothly. You may be tempted to see how far you can take your sugar-coating skills, but they work the best when you speak from the heart. Say only what you honestly believe to prevent a sticky situation down the road. Transparency is your friend."
cancer,2017-03-06,"You can learn more than you expect today delving into a favorite topic for research. Whether you're busy broadening your horizons or just browsing ideas for a dream vacation, you're like a dry sponge  absorbing new information.

leo,2017-03-06,"Conversations about yours, mine, and ours are on the table when canny Mercury joins the golden Sun in your 8th House of Shared Resources. Although it can be uncomfortable to talk about such delicate matters, you're able to foster a sense of trust and privacy that facilitates mutual understanding. Giving everyone a fair chance to express their feelings is imperative now if you want to create a sense of community. Honest communication cultivates personal growth."
virgo,2017-03-06,"Your kind words stir the heart and soothe the soul today. Showing how much you care for another person comes naturally with the tender Sun-Mercury conjunction brightening your 7th House of Others. You can tailor your message to convey the sweetness and gratitude you feel for a partner or friend, even if recent disagreements have been driving you crazy.  You could open the door to a closer connection by acknowledging how much you appreciate their presence in your world. A grateful heart is a magnet for miracles."
libra,2017-03-06,"You may not realize how unkind you are to yourself until you pay close attention to your self-talk habits. If you wouldn't say it out loud to your best friend, you shouldn't say it mentally to yourself. Wordy Mercury joins the altruistic Sun in your 6th House of Routines, shining a light on how you consistently bring yourself down with negative thoughts. Transform this revelation into a more positive way of relating to yourself. Carrie Bradshaw said, ""Don't forget to fall in love with yourself first."""
scorpio,2017-03-06,"There's no pride to be taken in bottling up your feelings, even if letting them out seems childish. Messenger Mercury's role as a translator is activated by its meeting with the soulful Pisces Sun, allowing your thoughts to undergo a polish before they find their way into the outside world. Whether your emotions emerge as poetry, in a simple conversation, or a series of images, a sense of satisfaction will surely follow a healthy expression. Amy Poehler said, ""Continue to share your heart with people, even if it's broken."""
sagittarius,2017-03-06,"A small stream of light shines into the deep parts of your psyche, giving you just enough clarity to make sense of what's inside. The quiet thoughts you usually ignore are amplified now, enabling you to hear them in full detail. Although some are likely to make you feel vulnerable, be open to letting your guard down to learn a valuable lesson about yourself. Abraham Maslow wrote, ""What is necessary to change a person is to change his awareness of himself."""
capricorn,2017-03-06,"You offer a safe haven for someone who is searching for guidance today, since your listening and speaking skills are both on point. Vocal Mercury and the life-giving Sun join forces in your 3rd House of Communication, encouraging you to be extremely considerate and patient with others. If a friend or family member feels comfortable enough to cry on your shoulder now, don't be surprised if it ends up being just as much of a healing experience for you. A person never stands so tall as when they lean down to help one in need."
aquarius,2017-03-06,"You may currently feel like you're not working hard enough and you should up your game to remain competitive. It's true that the type of worker someone is often reflects their character, but it would be a mistake to base the entirety of your self-worth on your productivity. Your priorities are brought up for inspection when inquisitive Mercury joins the regal Sun in your 2nd House of Values. You may be perpetuating a cycle of unattainable expectations and consequent disappointments. Use the insights gleaned today to break unhealthy cycles and discover what actually matters. Dreams don't work unless you do."
pisces,2017-03-06,"Your words evoke a sense of magic today and you can paint whatever picture you wish with them. Although you could probably say almost anything without repercussions now, using this opportunity to creatively embellish your story would be a colossal waste of cosmic magic. The higher vibration potential is best channeled into uplifting people with your message of compassion and forgiveness. Kindness is contagious; your shining light inspires others to speak the language of love."
aries,2017-03-07,"You may pride yourself on your ability to separate work and home, leaving family or living situation issues out or your professional life. But there is only so much space left in your ""deal with it later"" folder and it's filling up fast. If you don't address the buildup in a timely manner, it may address you in a time and place much less appropriate."
taurus,2017-03-07,"There's a stew brewing inside your mind, and it's not the kind you think people will be happy to be served. Regardless, you've made too much of it for just yourself, and the pot may boil over if you don't dish it out. You may fear that someone will feel burned if you tell them how you really feel, but you're the one more likely to get hurt if you don't speak your mind. The sooner you speak up, the easier the conversation will be."
gemini,2017-03-07,"You may think you're doing someone else a favor by playing down how you feel. Pretending everything rolls right off you without affecting your mood may not be a stretch for a wordsmith like you, but it's not so easy today. The cautious Cancer Moon tiptoes through your 2nd House of Finances, indicating that you may have a sore spot around your spending habits that you want to protect. Unfortunately, what you try to hide most ardently is actually what will find its way out the fastest. Devote time to tending to this matter so you don't use up all your energy trying to avoid it."
cancer,2017-03-07,"You're wearing your heart on your sleeve even if you could swear that you left it in your pocket where it was safer. Your family and closest friends are especially apt to see what's going on in your head because it's written all over your face. Even your body language quickly responds to every nuance in your mood as the retentive Cancer Moon stimulates your 1st House of Self. Fortunately, there's no reason to be anything but yourself today and no one expects anything more."
leo,2017-03-07,"Your reticence isn't baseless; sometimes you just need to work through your feelings by yourself. Nonetheless, using this as a reason to not work through them at all won't serve you well in the long run. The needy Cancer Moon draws you out of the spotlight and into your 12th House of Privacy where you can take inventory without an audience. Identifying where you can fill in gaps to make sure all your needs are met will help you feel more like yourself."
virgo,2017-03-07,"When the going gets tough it's nice to have your group of like-minded individuals to connect with. The last thing you want to do is upset the harmony that exists in your social circle. However, if someone is uneasy then honesty is the best policy. You may try to protect the group by skimming over the real story, but your friendships are strong enough to be worth protecting, they're strong enough to endure honesty. Count on the familial love in your tribe to ameliorate strain in the group dynamic."
libra,2017-03-07,"You've already made up your mind and you don't want anything bringing you down today. Commiseration between coworkers may push your buttons more than usual as you wish everyone would get back to work. As the tenacious Cancer Moon funnels emotional energy into your 10th House of Status, you're both more concerned with protecting your reputation and more likely to overreact toward any perceived threats toward it. Try not to take out your insecurities on your peers as you cling to a public image that may not even be in danger."
scorpio,2017-03-07,"You can be a harsh judge when it comes to rooting out reasoning for different philosophies because you don't want anyone to pull the wool over your eyes. When the naive Cancer Moon floods your 9th House of Higher Truth, you could find yourself knee-deep in exploring all kinds of worldviews trying to make sense of them all. However, your investigative attitude may be a sign of unacknowledged turmoil towards spirituality. Studying your responses to these topics may teach more your than any book or article could."
sagittarius,2017-03-07,"You have the gift of optimism naturally which is why you make such a delightful friend. However, there's a different side of you that you'd rather not reveal while playing the life of the party. A partner or best friend can see through your facade to the core of your self-doubt, and there's no sense in trying to give them the runaround once they do. The stirring Cancer Moon in your 8th House of Deep Sharing encourages you to tell it like it is without fear of looking foolish."
capricorn,2017-03-07,"Underneath your sometimes stoic exterior, as soft spot exists for those who need help. You may be especially susceptible to sad stories and pleas for assistance while the empathetic Cancer Moon swims through your 7th House of Others. You may find that your only two settings are completely open or completely closed as you either want to believe the stories on faith or reject them completely. While you don't have to believe everything everyone tells you, if you tune into your instincts you may find that you have an easier time figuring out who you can trust."
aquarius,2017-03-07,"Even though it's easy for you to make a friend wherever you go, you're not the most touchy-feely of folk. You even keep long-time friends at arm's length sometimes if you don't want to get into mushy discussions. Oddly enough, you may find yourself opening up to a coworker or someone you barely know during the course of the day. Sometimes a completely detached individual can serve as the safest place to let out what's on your mind."
pisces,2017-03-07,"The mundane doesn't seem appealing when your imagination is more colorful than a sunset. You're called to create as the feeling Cancer Moon sails through your 5th House of Self-Expression, opening a wellspring of artistic impressions. However, this spring is also the source of angst and feelings that are not so pleasant to experience. If you woke up the more melancholy side of the bed, perhaps reading a sappy novel or watching a sad movie will lift your spirits. Ironically, a hair of the dog that bit you can become the cure."
aries,2017-03-08,"You appreciate when people prove themselves with actions instead of words, and that's the style you prefer personally. Though you're hoping your productivity speaks for itself, it's actually your personality that's turning heads today. Your air of authority is sponsored by the willful Sun's sextile to domineering Pluto in your 10th House of Status. There's no reason to change your approach as long as you're getting the job done, even if people are bit intimidated. In the end you're only responsible for yourself."
taurus,2017-03-08,"Your words carry more weight today, especially when you talk about a social cause or community effort you believe in. What you say can make a realistic difference because anyone can tell how much it matters to you. Additionally, the Moon's shift from meek Cancer to loyal Leo stabilizes your mood and provides a sense of heart-centered determination."
gemini,2017-03-08,"Water-cooler conversations that are usually quite forgettable have a special intrigue today. Without even trying, your off-hand remarks and jokes have an implicit intensity that adds a layer of juicy depth to office gossip. However, the same energy you use to dig further into workplace rumors can also be used to stay focused on your responsibilities, letting nothing escape your attention. The dose makes the poison: use your powers of persuasion wisely."
cancer,2017-03-08,"It's as if someone has tinkered with the contrast settings, throwing your world into greater relief. Though comparing yourself to others isn't the best daily practice, occasionally it can show you just how far you've come. A partner or friend may remind you to think about a previous version of yourself and how many proverbial miles you've traversed. Seeing the gaps you've bridged leaves you feeling inspired to keep moving toward bigger and better things, leaving outdated paradigms behind you."
leo,2017-03-08,"You know exactly what must be done today without anyone telling you. It's as if you can foresee obstacles and step right over them without effort, allowing not only a smoother day but a sense of self-reliance. Tapping into your intuition is useful and bound to be impressive to those who see you put it to work. However, don't let the awed reactions go to your head &#9472; egocentricity can diminish the potency of extrasensory perceptions. Keep your head down and do the work, and the applause will follow."
virgo,2017-03-08,"You're prepared to explain your point of view in as many ways as you need to make your point. However, you may not have to exhaust all your options because you're so thorough the first time. In fact, you may overpower a conversation with a friend without even realizing it at first, even if it's not your intention. It's not that you're looking for a fight, you just know you have all the facts and you're ready to recite them if need be. However, your delivery is so authentic that people probably wouldn't notice even if you didn't have your bases covered."
libra,2017-03-08,"As you bore through your list of obligations that have piled up, you find you don't even need to stop for frequent breaks because your initial thrust takes you so far. You may start like a well-oiled machine, but once the Moon moves into lively Leo and your 11th House of Friends your anticipation for a fun time later could draw you away from your tasks. You can move mountains today as long as you resolve to get the job done early."
scorpio,2017-03-08,"It's as if the universe has dropped the reins in your hands whether or not you wanted to steer. You simply have the aura of someone people can follow today and you may find yourself with a trail of people asking you what to do next. Your magnetic quality implores people to listen when you speak no matter what kind of words come out of your mouth. With this power behind you, choose to be a leader not a dictator."
sagittarius,2017-03-08,"You know you can believe in yourself when a grander scheme is what drives you. The search for truth is like a fountain of youth for you, making you believe that with a morally sound goal anything is possible. As the dignified Leo Moon lights up your 9th House of Philosophy, it's easy to have faith in your own growth and expansion. What inspires you filters down into your daily life, and even seeps into interactions with family and friends. The more you can convey how much potential really exists, the happier you feel because it lifts up everyone around you."
capricorn,2017-03-08,"You're holding yourself to a high standard because you want to do your very best the first time. You don't have to look far for the concentration you need when cerebral Mercury signs a contract with insatiable Pluto. The terms of this agreement include unrelenting focus and single-minded efforts, but the fine print states that everything you say sounds just like an order. You may be perceived as bossy even when you're honestly just minding your own business. Others may not respond as well to the kind of language that motivates you personally, so maintain that awareness to avoid estranging people."
aquarius,2017-03-08,"It's as if you have a sixth sense that you can use to determine the true value of things. You're able to find the best deals and make the most of your money today, but this quality goes beyond the material. Stripping down your own ideals you can see which parts make sense and which need to go, and in doing so your own sense of self-worth is allowed to rise. You're not afraid to let yourself be seen now because you're empowered by giving yourself permission to shine."
pisces,2017-03-08,"Whatever you're obsessing over is likely to find its way into your reality one way or another. This can be quite a downfall for a Negative Nancy, but for the hopeful dreamer it can be a gift. Transformational Pluto in your 11th House of Hope and Wishes collaborates with fleet-footed Mercury in your sign, elevating your manifestation abilities. Whatever you hold central in your thoughts is like sending the universe a link to your wish list. Make sure it's what you really want &#9472; life doesn't often come with a gift receipt."
aries,2017-03-09,"You want to jump in and add your two cents to the mix when you overhear an over-the-top conversation today. Luckily, something stops you before you get too wrapped up in all the he-said-she-said drama. Nevertheless, you can't win because you might later regret your silence. Thankfully, your competitive side softens when your key planet Mars moves into sensible Taurus. Be wise and focus your efforts on pragmatic progress rather than one-upping anyone else. Zen Shin teaches, ""A flower does not think of competing with the flower next to it. It just blooms."""
taurus,2017-03-09,"You're no longer reluctant to show your true colors and take your rightful place in the world. Brave Mars emerges from hiding today, entering your steadfast sign and energizing your 1st House of Self. You may have felt as if the solitary path was the only one that led to progress, but you're changing your tune and you want everyone to hear it. Taking the initiative feels more natural now, so set achievable goals for the next several weeks and enjoy tending the seeds. Audrey Hepburn said, ""To plant a garden is to believe in tomorrow."""
gemini,2017-03-09,"Everyone is enjoying your monologues so much that it's hard to know when to stop. Your entertaining storytelling skills are on point, and you're leaving no detail unmentioned -- even the ones that didn't really happen. Embellishing your story may seem harmless, but it's easy to go overboard now and wish you could take some of it back later. But words are like toothpaste in a tube: once they're out, there's no getting them back in. Make good choices today so you don't regret them tomorrow."
cancer,2017-03-09,"Family is important to you, whether it's your blood relatives or the community of friends you choose. Sometimes when you think about your differences for too long, you find yourself rearranging your priorities to match theirs. Although it's uncomfortable to disagree, you put your own destiny in danger if you adapt too much to what someone else thinks is best. Give yourself permission to blaze your own trail regardless of expectations. True friends will be proud of you even if they wouldn't do the same thing themselves."
leo,2017-03-09,"You don't want anyone to see your vulnerabilities because you fear it could change their view of you. You prefer to be admired as an achiever, especially now that aggressive Mars is stirring up trouble in your 10th House of Public Persona. However, you must show people who you are rather than tell them if you're going to truly establish the reputation you want. Concerted efforts based on realistic objectives are what really earn you the acclaim you're aiming for now. Don't worry about your elevator pitch as much as what floor you're exiting on."
virgo,2017-03-09,"You might question if you were ever on the same page as a friend when you can't find your footing in an awkward conversation. You're not the most social person in the first place, so lack of common ground may make you want to crawl into a hole to hide. However, there's no reason to be embarrassed just because you don't share your perspective with everyone. Nevertheless, you have a lot to offer by way of your opinion even if it's not received with applause. Freedom is being yourself without needing anyone's permission."
libra,2017-03-09,"You may have a habit of smiling and nodding whether you actually agree with someone or not. While you may think this is a common courtesy, your polite behavior could catch up with you and undermine your credibility. You don't have to bare your soul at the drop of a hat or to anyone that crosses your path, but relationships might reach a tipping point prior to becoming more meaningful. Joseph Campbell wrote, ""The cave you fear to enter holds the treasure that you seek."""
scorpio,2017-03-09,"You enjoy romantic intrigue like anyone else, but sometimes the love game grows exhausting for your heart. You may even creatively elude someone you admire because you're not up for the latest chase. Nevertheless, assertive Mars activates your 7th House of Relationships, urging you to methodically search for a more substantial partnership. Believe it or not, stability is more emotionally satisfying than flirtatious fun."
sagittarius,2017-03-09,"Knowing how to approach a situation delicately can be difficult when circumstances at home or with family cramp your style. You may blow a petty disagreement out of proportion as a way to get something off your chest today, causing undue stress and hurt feelings. Rather than exaggerating the details as an excuse, either wait until a more appropriate time to address the issue calmly or let it go. Think before you speak; wisdom is to the soul what health is to the body."
capricorn,2017-03-09,"You're constantly striving to improve long after the rest have called it quits. You may be a cut above others when it comes to endurance, but you wish life could be less complicated sometimes. It's possible to create the simplicity you crave when active Mars steps into earthy Taurus, accentuating your 5th House of Recreation. Directing your energy toward grounding activities like immersing yourself in nature or cooking a healthy meal reconnects you with the peaceful side of life."
aquarius,2017-03-09,"Your digressions into the abstract aren't necessarily meant to prove that you're right; they're to prove that you're original in your thinking. Although intelligence is often heralded by big words and complicated ideas, you're more likely to sound smart when you concisely explain fancy concepts in a way that anyone can understand. Simplifying your message inspires your audience to join your cause. Being yourself is the smartest move you can make if you feel the urge to be heard."
pisces,2017-03-09,"Your spiritual growth is often an intimate and private affair, but you feel like asking someone to bear witness to it today. Vulnerability often  precedes major breakthroughs, but can also elicit an unexpected response. You may end up enriching your accounts of your personal journey because you're worried the truth won't seem as impactful. However, you don't need to wrap up something so raw in a pretty package to show to someone. Just tell your story and keep it as real as possible; the right person will hear the truth of your tale no matter how rough or refined."
aries,2017-03-10,"You're skipping through your day with a smile on your face. Although today's events are nothing to write home about, everything seems like a game when the playful Leo Moon is brightening your 5th House of Recreation. But sooner or later, a lunar shift to exacting Virgo reminds you that there's work waiting with your name on it. Anticipating the shift in gears will help you maintain your good mood even after it appears the party is over. Gratitude changes everything."
taurus,2017-03-10,"You relish the opportunity to breathe a sigh of relief, knowing that your feet are back on solid ground again. Reestablishing your center of gravity enables you to feel more confident in your decisions. Although basking in your comfort zone is a nice reprieve, you naturally want to direct your energy toward something productive now. Find a hands-on activity to occupy your creativity before the Moon enters service-oriented Virgo later on. Leave the world more interesting than you found it."
gemini,2017-03-10,"Your positive message is believable today because it's coming from a place of true optimism. You're happy to offer uplifting words to anyone who needs them, knowing it reinforces your good mood as well. However, when you're back inside your familiar four walls at home it could seem like the light that brightened your disposition is just illuminating all the chores that must be done. Rather than being discouraged by this sudden change in the atmosphere, whistle while you work. Expect nothing and appreciate everything."
cancer,2017-03-10,"Your restlessness may increase throughout the day, but there are proactive measures you can take to stop one small slip from turning into a full-blown negative spiral. Putting your ducks in a row as early as possible prevents overwhelm later when the Moon gets serious about organization in meticulous Virgo. Writing down errands and tasks helps you keep grounded in your efforts instead of drowning in details. H. Jackson Brown, Jr. wrote, ""The best preparation for tomorrow is doing your best today."""
leo,2017-03-10,"People gravitate to you like a bonfire on a chilly night because your warmth is so inviting. You're happy to be generous at first, picking up the lunch tab and lending a friendly ear to someone who needs it. But you may grow more antsy as the clock ticks, recognizing your own house needs to be put in order. You start to realize how much you give away now that you need the resources yourself. Pacing yourself from the beginning prevents you from having to shift into crisis management mode later on."
virgo,2017-03-10,"You may begin the day with a plan to cut yourself some slack; honestly, you of all people deserve to take it easy sometimes. But oddly enough, you pick up speed throughout the day and before you know it you're searching for more things to do. The productive Virgo Moon enlivens your 1st House of Self, putting you in your element and pushing you to  reshuffle your priorities. There is no substitute for hard work. No rest is worth anything, except the rest that is earned."
libra,2017-03-10,"It's not easy to turn down an intriguing invitation, but recharging your batteries sounds like a better idea today. Social commitments you made earlier may hold little appeal after the virtuous Virgo Moon moves into your 12th House of Rest. There's no harm in canceling your plans now, but don't let unfounded anxiety keep you from connecting with others. An old English proverb cautions, ""Worrying is like sitting in a rocking chair. It gives you something to do but it doesn't get you anywhere."""
scorpio,2017-03-10,"You feel like a superstar when your peers recognize you for a job well done. Your industrious efforts are paying off now, and you're ready to ride this wave of accomplishment to even greater heights. However, your confidence can only carry you so far. The Moon's move into shrewd Virgo allows little room for subjectivity and a reality check could be disheartening if you have wandered too far off track. An objective evaluation of your goals early in the day improves your chances for success. Wake up with determination; go to bed with satisfaction."
sagittarius,2017-03-10,"You can see a gleaming future in your mind's eye but it's up to you to move toward your ultimate goal as you navigate through the real world. Sometimes doing the required work is less invigorating than imagining the end product, but both are required in order to make progress. Thankfully, the Moon's shift into your 10th House of Responsibility empowers you to intuitively make the right choices that lead to success. Joseph Campbell wrote, ""Follow your bliss and the universe will open doors where there were only walls."""
capricorn,2017-03-10,"Traversing your inner world is a major endeavor, but it can also give you a greater appreciation of yourself. Once you take a courageous step in the direction of self-acceptance, it's rewarding to see the speed at which you progress. Thankfully, you will be ready to reestablish yourself in the material world when your quest comes to an end. Sinking your teeth into an activity that grounds your energy aids in your process of self-actualization."
aquarius,2017-03-10,"Playful banter lifts your spirits, but something changes when the conversation goes deeper. The energy isn't the same once you start to explore the logistics of a relationship, and it could be disconcerting at first. It might seem like you're talking to a different person once the dialogue heats up to an uncomfortable temperature. Nevertheless, authenticity is more important now than emotional security. It's pointless to judge each other's behavior when neither one of you is perfect. The Dalai Lama teaches, ""Love and compassion are necessities, not luxuries. Without them humanity cannot survive."""
pisces,2017-03-10,"You keep saying yes today, because the longer your to-do list, the more excited you feel about accomplishing every last task. You might even volunteer to help someone else tie up their loose ends, feeling certain that luck is on your side. However, when the picky Virgo Moon moves into your 7th House of Others, your previous obligations demand your attention. You may need to let a friend down because you put too much on your own plate, compromising your ability to be in two places at once. Managing your time wisely is the best way to prevent over-commitment and under-delivery."
aries,2017-03-11,"You prefer to be left to your own devices today so you can make some headway on your daily list. You're trying to keep yourself busy because someone's mixed messages are too much to decipher. The moment you think everything is normal, an odd comment or behavior makes you question the situation. Looking for a logical answer probably won't get you anywhere when things seem stranger than fiction. Let go of the need for conclusive evidence and continue to make progress in other areas. Be so busy improving yourself that you have no time to criticize others."
taurus,2017-03-11,"You're willing to push yourself to the limit with your long-term aspirations in mind. Time and energy seem a worthy sacrifice today when you feel like you're on the verge of a major breakthrough. But a misalignment between the willful Sun and cheerful Jupiter warps your perception, tricking you into believing your gas tank is bigger than it is. By all means, put in the work necessary to move closer to your dreams; but set a reasonable daily goal before you run yourself into the ground. Shakespeare wrote, ""To climb steep hills requires a slow pace."""
gemini,2017-03-11,"You feel like a true visionary as your pool of ideas appears to overflow in a sparkling deluge. It seems like success is just a matter of picking a professional prospect and throwing yourself into it, letting your natural ability to think on your feet fill in any gaps. Annoyingly, the prudent Virgo Moon will not allow you to jump into just anything without having some semblance of a plan. Although holding off to double-check under the hood is restrictive, you'll be happier overall if you pay attention to the voice of reason in the back of your mind. Ben Franklin wrote, ""Caution is the parent of security."""
cancer,2017-03-11,"You genuinely want to be the best person you can be now, but you may idolize an ideal until it becomes untouchable. Theorizing about your future inspires you to grow, but discontent sets in when you believe you can't possibly catch up with your vision. You could worry so much nothing gets done, thinking of all the things you can't do yet. Simply introducing more organization and intention into your everyday routine stabilizes your life and enables you to proactively manage your schedule. Michael Altshuler wrote, ""The bad news is time flies; the good news is you're the pilot."""
leo,2017-03-11,"A sincere fascination with your feelings arises when you plumb the depths of your heart. You may feel the urge to communicate your revelations to someone, as if they're more real when acknowledged by another. While opening up can be a healthy practice, you might divulge more than necessary as exaggerating Jupiter feeds compliments to the illuminating Sun in your 8th House of Deep Sharing. What seems like an earth-shattering epiphany today could seem like business as usual tomorrow. Preserve your dignity by thinking twice before spilling the beans."
virgo,2017-03-11,"You're running a tight ship because you want every little thing in its place. You could be trying to impress a special someone by making sure everything is perfect. But what seems like a gleaming example of the ideal relationship or person may not be as exalted as it seems today. Micro-managing your every move only makes things uncomfortable when the object of your affection turns out only to sparkle when the light is just right. Loosen your grip and remember that nothing or no one is without flaw. Leo Tolstoy wrote, ""If you look for perfection, you'll never be content."""
libra,2017-03-11,"You're looking forward to some downtime after a recent flurry of hard work. But as much as you want a bit of privacy to recharge, you keep your nose to the grindstone, hoping someone will validate your fatigue and congratulate you for your efforts. Perhaps it's time to ask why you're seeking outside approval. The truth is that you don't need a reason to take some time off; put your guilt aside and place yourself first on your list. Ovid wrote, ""Take rest; a field that has rested yields a bountiful crop."""
scorpio,2017-03-11,"You believe that your latest creative endeavor will be one for the books. It seems like you managed to funnel your secret ideas into a poetic rendering, and you're sure everyone will marvel at your success. However, if your friends aren't overly enthusiastic, you may get irritated with their lack of interest. In reality, you're extremely critical of both your audience and yourself right now. Nevertheless, your creations have value even when they're not rushed to a gallery for exhibition. Robert Fry wrote, ""Art is a passion or it is nothing."""
sagittarius,2017-03-11,"You're convinced that nothing can go wrong today as long as you maintain a high level of optimism. Success seems inevitable when you feel like all your bases are covered and you have a rich network of connections to boot. But you may be overestimating just how much your friends will come through for you in a tight squeeze. You must be able to depend on your own resources and knowledge instead of assuming your social net will always be there to catch you if you make a mistake. Although meticulous planning isn't your first choice now, ample preparation solidifies the future you want."
capricorn,2017-03-11,"While it's true that advancement toward your goals begins with a single thought, it takes more than speaking your convictions to make them real. Viewing your objectives all in a row makes you feel like you're halfway there already, but an excessive Sun-Jupiter misalignment could be distorting your depth perception when it comes to your career aspirations. Keep going in the right direction, but hold off on assuming your level of progress until another day. Zig Ziglar taught, ""There is no elevator to success. You have to take the stairs."""
aquarius,2017-03-11,"Every time you think about your latest hypothesis you become more excited about its potential. But at the same time, your infatuation with your scheme could simply be a way to avoid some nagging doubts. Those thoughts that go bump in the night are just the fussy Virgo Moon in your 8th House of Self-Analysis clamoring to get your attention. You must acknowledge your feelings now, because they don't actually threaten your project like you think they do. Your fears are just paper tigers once you face them."
pisces,2017-03-11,"It feels like it's up to you to make it or break it right now, and the pressure is getting to be too much. While you always want to keep your options open, sorting through so many possibilities can be a burden. You may turn to a close friend for advice, but when they don't have the answer you want you might snap at them out of exasperation. However, you can't expect an immediate solution to your current problem. Cut yourself some slack before your exasperation gets the better of you. Saadi wrote, ""Have patience; everything is difficult before it is easy."""
aries,2017-03-12,"Your default setting might be full steam ahead, but even the warrior of the zodiac has a breaking point. You may have been letting yourself off the hook lately, noticing how comfortable it feels to slip into your cave when you prefer not to deal with the outside world. But it could become clear that relaxation efforts have morphed into escapism when the conscientious Virgo Full Moon illuminates your 6th House of Habits. Reevaluate how you balance the daily grind and fantasyland; both your body and mind will thank you for it. Success begins with self-discipline."
taurus,2017-03-12,"Some things can't be built with store-bought materials, and you're busy at work making such a structure. Your social life is important, and it deserves cultivation no matter how big or small. But you may realize how much energy you've expended when the hardworking Virgo Moon accentuates your 5th House of Self-Expression. If there's only a meager amount left after you spread yourself thin making connections, the very seed that grows into the tree that will shade you may not have what it needs to grow. Balance your long-term objectives with your short-term enjoyment or both will suffer."
gemini,2017-03-12,"It seems like everything you say lately is meant to shine up your reputation so there's not a scuff on it. It can be tiring to polish an image day after day, and you're wondering if your dedication will pay off. Asking advice from someone experienced with your situation can help you identify any missing connections, or if a shift in priorities would be a better use of your energy. The observant Virgo Full Moon lights up your 4th House of Foundations, urging you to reanalyze your core reasons for striving for approval. Nobody can make you happy until you're happy with yourself."
cancer,2017-03-12,"The only place safer than your comfort zone is the peaceful utopia you create in your own mind. You long for the bliss of wandering in your own imagination, free from worldly distractions. Fortunately, the sensible Virgo Full Moon grounds your 3rd House of Immediate Environment, offering an anchor point when escape seems like the only rescue. However, drifting into the silence for long periods of time can make it even harder to return to daily life. Establishing fixed commitments on your calendar adds necessary structure to your day. Balance is the secret to your happiness."
leo,2017-03-12,"There isn't much that can shake your allegiance once you decide where your loyalties lie. In the midst of fostering the intimate bonds between you and the most important people in your life, you may have made more concessions than you realized. The analytical Virgo Full Moon falls in your 2nd House of Values, calling you to reconsider the cost of your precious resources. Sacrificing too many of your own preferences to strengthen a connection will only dim your light with the darkness of resentment. Staying true to yourself inspires others to do the same."
virgo,2017-03-12,"It feels like you're losing your grip on your calendar and you're searching for a way to regain control. While setting boundaries is essential for healthy relationships, reexamining your fundamental principles is in order before you say something you can't take back. Identify whether your apprehensions are based on a fear of losing your freedom or a realistic need to draw a line while the clarifying Virgo Full Moon brightens your 1st House of Self. Nothing is black and white when you work with the entire spectrum."
libra,2017-03-12,"There's certainly nothing wrong with donating your time and energy to a worthy cause. But if you find yourself devoted to something just because you stumbled into it, it's time to take a good look at the value it brings to your life. The Virgo Full Moon in your 12th House of Destiny urges you to assess where your current daily efforts are leading you and whether you're filling your time with what you love or simply with what is closest to you. Don't dream your life; live your dream."
scorpio,2017-03-12,"You're so wrapped up in the here and now that you may have lost sight of the long-term goals you once diligently pursued. The Virgo Full Moon in your 11th House of Hopes and Wishes presses pause on your current playlist so you can hear the lyrics and melody of your future song. The tune you're singing is easily enriched by a few notes outside your current repertoire; jot down some options that resonate with the person you want to become. She who dares, wins."
sagittarius,2017-03-12,"There's an enjoyable serenity in allowing yourself to float, drifting back to a central position where you can look in all directions without rushing to commit to one. But you realize it's time to bring your ambitions back into focus while the pragmatic Virgo Full Moon spotlights your 10th House of Career. Somehow you know every step along the way must be very deliberate as you proceed over the next couple of weeks. Mixing inspired ideas with practical procedures points you in the right direction. Margaret Mead wrote, ""I learned the value of hard work by working hard."""
capricorn,2017-03-12,"You tend to favor a structured approach, but you're quickly learning to adapt to your current circumstances. Although it's hard to nail down a steady inflow and outflow of data today, you take what you can get and make the most out of it. But it's time to formulate a methodical plan to expand your horizons when the Virgo Full Moon stretches your 9th House of Vision. Life will go on even if you take a step back to pursue your dreams."
aquarius,2017-03-12,"You're scrambling to get your thoughts in order as the high energy of the day vibrates you all the way from your head to your toes. The Virgo Full Moon in your 8th House of Personal Truth opposes the sensitive Pisces Sun, highlighting the conflict between your search for meaning and your need for material security. Teasing out the origins of your complex feelings might seem a daunting task if you're worried about uncovering things you don't want to see. But acknowledging all the parts of yourself -- even the ones you usually hide -- will bring you closer to creating an authentic life with the originality you value."
pisces,2017-03-12,"Your sensitivity is so heightened today that you dream of spending hours waxing poetic. But words escape you when you imagine expressing your emotions in front of someone you admire. You're more interested in hearing what others think of things when the Virgo Full Moon shines in your 7th House of Partnerships, bestowing you with hyper-awareness of their opinions. While there's nothing wrong with honoring another person's feelings, don't lose faith in your own perceptions. It takes a bit of both for satisfying relationships to blossom."
aries,2017-03-13,"Although you know better, it's nearly impossible to keep your mouth shut today. You're likely to take an assertive approach once blabbermouth Mercury bursts into your fiery sign. You may not even realize what you said until it's already out in the open -- you need to be extremely mindful to control your tongue. It's not your problem if others can't handle the truth, but you can adapt your delivery to prevent your words from leaving burn marks. Kindness is an underrated commodity."
taurus,2017-03-13,"You want to start the week out on the right foot to avoid a case of the Monday Blues. Following a schedule to a tee sounds like a perfect idea but allows no room for surprises. Oddly enough, you may be the one to foil your own plan when you suddenly decide to veer off course. While you certainly possess the conviction to reach your goals, being open to feedback from your employer or coworkers is a must if you want the day to go smoothly. Intelligence is the ability to adapt to change."
gemini,2017-03-13,"You can barely keep your opinions to yourself today and you can't wait to find a friendly ear. Your sociable disposition may win you an audience, but it could be hard to convince them to stay and listen. You're coming across more aggressively than you think now that your key planet Mercury is in brash Aries. While this celestial update sets your mind on fire, it also makes your words more flammable. Cool your jets before someone does it for you."
cancer,2017-03-13,"You're thinking at the speed of light and you're ready to make a move into the next phase of your professional life. You're imbued with a new courage when swift Mercury flies into gutsy Aries, getting straight to work in your 10th House of Career. Your head swirls with bold ideas about all the things you could accomplish, but now isn't the best time to blurt out your desire for a promotion or a raise to your boss. Let your mind run wild in the creative realms for a while today; a healthy distraction stops you from speaking too soon. Ben Franklin wrote, ""It takes many good deeds to build a good reputation and only one bad one to lose it."""
leo,2017-03-13,"It's as if the lights are suddenly turned on in your brain and you can see just how many empty shelves there are to fill. However, it seems like you can't gather information fast enough as studious Mercury rushes into your 9th House of Higher Learning. Just remember that not everyone is as interested in your new passion as you are now. Resist the temptation to push your ideas on others until you assimilate all the incoming data and can find a more receptive audience. Charles Morgan wrote, ""As knowledge increases, wonder deepens."""
virgo,2017-03-13,"You can take a conciliatory approach to relationships, but your restlessness makes attempts at kind gestures feel irritating and shallow. You prefer to keep your real thoughts quiet today because they lure you into strange places in your mind. Mercury the Messenger journeys into your 8th House of Transformation, reacquainting you with parts of yourself you don't usually see. Although disorienting at first, getting back in touch with your core values makes you even stronger in the long run. True authenticity matters more than unattainable perfection."
libra,2017-03-13,"Your lethargy melts away once the pace picks up today; an irritating start is nothing more than a speed bump. Everything changes once verbal Mercury calls the shots in your 7th House of Others. You're more vocally assertive than you would be otherwise, but this celestial shift also allows you to think more like your partner or rival. This boost of mental juice can motivate you to talk out differences with someone at best, or pick fights for the sake of it at worst. Sometimes you must speak your truth, but honesty without tact is a beginner's mistake. Daniele Vare wrote, ""Diplomacy is the art of letting someone have your way."""
scorpio,2017-03-13,"You're considering disconnecting the doorbell and turning off your phone so nothing can disturb you today. Someone is likely to sneak in through the back door, but it won't take long for you to promptly show them out. You have better things to do when rational Mercury moves into your 6th House of Logistics, motivating you to craft a cunning strategy for success. You're not interested in collaboration; you want this plan to be all yours. However, beware of mental exhaustion if you attempt to burn the candle at both ends; Reserve some of your drive for the execution phase later on."
sagittarius,2017-03-13,"There's plenty of work to do but you're far more interested in searching for entertainment today. You may shove obligations to the back burner to chase pleasure now that the Moon is in lovely Libra. Additionally, your mischievous side is awakened when trickster Mercury skips into your 5th House of Fun and Games. While you're sure to enjoy this newfound mental friskiness, your listening skills may get left behind in the amusement. Remarks you find hilarious might offend or hurt other people, so take care not to start fires due to carelessness. Practice the Golden Rule; don't let your laughter come at someone else's expense."
capricorn,2017-03-13,"No one but you notices that something is on your mind because you're carrying on as efficiently as usual. But underneath the pleasantries, a much different story is playing out today. Your poker face hides the fact that you wish you were spending time on a side project, but as the day continues it's harder to keep up the act. You can't wait to be back in your own space where you focus more on your agenda instead of balancing other people's needs. Maintaining professional boundaries prevents drama from getting in the way of satisfaction."
aquarius,2017-03-13,"It's as if the cobwebs in your head are being swept clean, blasting open your neural pathways and creating space for anything you like. Sudden inspirations make you want to take action immediately, no matter whose toes might be stepped on. It's not that you want to hurt anyone's feelings, but you care more about the potential of your ideas than tiptoeing around alternate opinions. Besides, you're convinced that anyone who listens closely enough will figure out you're in the right. Nevertheless, it's not worth provoking a verbal sparring match just to prove your point. Conflict cannot occur without your participation."
pisces,2017-03-13,"Contrary to what you may think, the charitable choice is not always the best one. Trying to divvy up your resources equally may sound like a good theory, but true harmony is achieved by balancing your funds and your energy separately. It's time to step into the center of your financial universe when mercantile Mercury strides into ambitious Aries, emphasizing your 2nd House of Money. It's sensible, not selfish, to take care of your own business before helping others today. Confucius wrote, ""When prosperity comes, do not use all of it."""
aries,2017-03-14,"It's tricky to work out exactly what is going on between you and a friend. Even when you approach a miscommunication from multiple angles, it seems there's always something else wrong. It's as if you're trying to cut through a giant spider web: everything sticks to everything else until you're bound up in all the threads. Feeling like you're out of moves recalls a memory when you pursued every possibility and nothing worked, leaving both parties disheartened. But don't worry, moods change with the breeze and it's only a matter of time before the wind blows in a different direction."
taurus,2017-03-14,"Working around people's schedules proves to be a challenging task today. Trying to make room in your own daily routine to lend a helping hand is taxing your reserves of energy and patience. You're willing to do whatever it takes no matter what because past experience has taught you that if you don't accommodate others, they could call it quits on you all together. Instead of using a second wind for one last attempt to modify the situation, be honest about your trepidation and see if someone else can help unravel the knot."
gemini,2017-03-14,"There's something on your mind that you prefer not to think about. You're looking to shake things up, hoping some laughter will ease the tense atmosphere. You can usually count on your wicked humor to break the ice, but it's as if your jokes don't make sense and you can't read your audience. By avoiding a memory that makes you wince, you could be inadvertently creating a similar situation in which you embarrass yourself by going overboard trying to stir up reactions. Save yourself the do-over and phone a friend instead. Facing your challenges cultivates personal growth."
cancer,2017-03-14,"You keep looking over your shoulder today, wondering what else will come out of the blue. You're doing your best to maintain your optimism, but you might be distracted by behind-the-scenes tension with a family member or roommate. All you really want is for home to feel like a place everyone can relax, but the current instability may lead you to assume that's a pipe dream. However, take heart in knowing that you don't have to let your old story become your next chapter. Writing the future you want starts with closing the book on the past."
leo,2017-03-14,"It's easy to fill up your time with engagements and errands to give your mind something to do. An emotional sore spot is playing a sad song on low volume in the back of your head today, and you're doing everything you can to change the tune. Chatting up everyone you encounter is one way to drown out your feelings, but there's an even better solution available. Consciously set aside your distractions and be honest about what's bothering you now, so you can have a sense of closure. To reach your greatest potential you need to fight your greatest fears."
virgo,2017-03-14,"One second you're smiling with the breeze at your back, but the next moment you feel like you're fighting against the wind. Your moods are unpredictable even when you try to think ahead and prevent surprises that could throw you off kilter. Worrying about people criticizing your erratic behavior only adds to your anxiety, but they're probably not judging you as harshly as you are now. Releasing your attachment to the outcome of the day will do wonders to take the edge off. To move freely one must be deeply rooted."
libra,2017-03-14,"You have one eye trained on the people around you today, because your quick reaction time allows you to keep up. Rapidly changing moods make constant readjustment a necessity. Although you're willing to do the dance of social niceties, you can't help but hope that everyone will calm down soon. Your attempts to smooth things over leave little time to tend to your own feelings, which aren't in the best shape either. It may be best to withdraw from your role as peace-keeper for a bit to nurse your own heart back to health. Oscar Wilde wrote, ""To love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong romance."""
scorpio,2017-03-14,"The moment you find time to pencil in some downtime, it's as if another task magically appears at the bottom of your list. You may try to do as much as you can out of the public eye now, because you don't have the energy to deal with any more emotions than your own. Perhaps you remember a time when you took a risk yet went completely unnoticed. Hiding your feelings is one way to prevent a recurrence. However, your fear of repeating this pattern is unwarranted, but it's still a good idea to lay low today. Picasso said, ""Without great solitude no serious work is possible."""
sagittarius,2017-03-14,"There might have been a stage in your life when you were not allowed to do things your way, which contributes to your exaltation of freedom now. A childhood memory of just such a time may slip into your consciousness today, triggering your desire to take flight and rise above it. However, you're not doing yourself any favors by applying cheap thrills as an anesthetic for old emotional wounds. What goes up must come down, so take the gentler route and reach out to a friend or family member to help you process your very real feelings. Author Merle Miller wrote, ""Everyone has his burden; what counts is how you carry it."""
capricorn,2017-03-14,"You're doing your best to act the part today and maintain an air of professionalism. Sometimes it's easier to switch to manager mode and moderate everyone's disputes when your own inner sky is cloudy. However, turning away from your emotions won't make them go away, nor will working overtime save you from facing your own feelings. Making a gray sky blue takes time; but unless you accept the situation as it is now, you may get stuck in a downpour without an umbrella. Amy Tan wrote, ""If you can't change your fate, change your attitude."""
aquarius,2017-03-14,"You love floating in a cloud bank of ideas because you can sustain a more objective point of view. Some folks may consider your philosophical approach too intellectual, but it's actually just an extreme awareness of the risk of ignorance. Maybe it's not something you talk about very much, but you question your worth more than people know, and it informs your decisions daily. You don't want to sink into the quagmire that once held you captive and convinced you that you weren't smart enough. But don't fly too far away today; coming back down to earth is harder the farther up you go."
pisces,2017-03-14,"It's as if a time machine sent you back to an earlier chapter of your life. The past feels so vividly real that you almost expect to see your younger self in the mirror looking back at you. However, you are still accountable to everyone else's timeline now, and you must keep pace with the world as it rushes on. But don't make the mistake of thinking you can bury bittersweet feelings when they resurface. Carrie Fisher said, ""Take your broken heart and make it into art."""
aries,2017-03-15,"Noncommittal placation isn't a good enough response to your probing questions today. But when someone close to you won't give you a straight answer, you see right through their act and go looking for information yourself. Fortunately, your skepticism of the original appeasement leads you to clues that allow you to fill in the rest of the picture with near psychic accuracy. However, it's best to keep your ""I told you so"" to yourself rather than make your private victory a public proclamation. One day the tables could be turned."
taurus,2017-03-15,"People probably have good reasons for not revealing their every thought today, but you're willing to play their games and keep your lips sealed. Your ability to read subtle nuances in body language makes you more comfortable with the silence between you, especially when the magnanimous Sun and generous Jupiter give you a bird's eye view of the interpersonal dynamics. Things left unsaid are crystal clear when communication happens on another level. Let your sixth sense be your first sense."
gemini,2017-03-15,"They say the devil is in the details, and not a single one escapes your notice when you put your mind to it. It's as if you possess a cosmic magnifying glass when the incisive Scorpio Moon examines your 6th House of Minutiae, enabling you to pick up on things that would otherwise slip through the cracks. However, the outside world sees nothing but your smiling face today, leaving you to your investigation without arousing suspicion. Discretion is your secret to success."
cancer,2017-03-15,"You may have a fresh perspective on family matters now, but you're not yet ready to let go of the current situation. Your brooding mood carries over into your personal interactions as you replay a scene in your mind, remembering another detail that explains the lingering tension. Although your friends might ask if everything is okay because you appear a little gloomy today, you're actually just steeping in the emotional wake of your discoveries. Silence speaks when words can't."
leo,2017-03-15,"You're lost on a sentimental journey and you may be drawn to explore your family history now. There's something oddly fascinating about digging out old photo albums today and taking a trip down Memory Lane. Searching for ways the past shapes you can do a lot for your personal development, and even help you understand the motives of other people better. Russel N. Nelson wrote, ""When our hearts turn to our ancestors, something changes inside us."""
virgo,2017-03-15,"You may waffle back and forth at the start of an important conversation, but soon your laser focus kicks into action. You don't believe any nonsense today, and you're not dishing any out, either. Although your words are to the point, they contain layers of depth. Anyone reading between the lines sees the real connotations behind them. But don't assume you can pull the wool over everyone's eyes; you're not the only one with the persuasive Scorpio Moon in your corner now. Reaching a mutual understanding with someone is a better alternative than resorting to deception or subterfuge. Talk less; say more."
libra,2017-03-15,"You're often attracted to items that are beautiful or artful, tending toward frivolous purchases that provide temporary happiness. But there's no swindling you as the suspicious Scorpio Moon takes up post in your 2nd House of Values. You may be a harsh judge of how much something is worth today, but thankfully, an altruistic Sun-Jupiter connection validates your natural sense of fairness. Your evaluations might be piercing, but they aren't without warrant. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder."
scorpio,2017-03-15,"Nothing is out of your reach today as long as you channel your emotional intensity toward a specific purpose. Left to run amok, the swell of energy from the unrelenting Scorpio Moon in your 1st House of Self could overpower your other senses and leave you in a state of overload. But the good news is that with effort you can reach a depth of understanding that puts you in control of your personal power, harnessing an ability to temper unyielding conviction with spiritual attunement. Theodore Roosevelt said, ""With self-discipline most anything is possible."""
sagittarius,2017-03-15,"Although you want to stay behind closed doors today, your propensity for holding a wider outlook is not diminished. Retreating into your own private laboratory for some experiments yields surprisingly potent concoctions as the transformative Scorpio Moon hides out in your 12th House of Mystery. The best part about the theories you uncover now is that you can speculate about their potentials without the risk of putting them to the test publicly. Albert Einstein wrote, ""The monotony and solitude of a quiet life stimulates the creative mind."""
capricorn,2017-03-15,"You can't relate to people who seem content to dilly-dally and procrastinate in the workplace. You naturally gravitate toward others who share your single-minded approach, forming an alliance with which to march forward. Fortunately, you've not lost all your social graces and you can still interact amicably today, even with the most annoying coworkers. But keep your time with distractions limited and stick to your team of winners. It's better to be ambitious than ambivalent."
aquarius,2017-03-15,"You're fixated on your professional aspirations and you are passionately determined to achieve them. Conventional wisdom to keep your options open isn't helpful while the obsessive Scorpio Moon implores you to zero in on your target and brush everything else aside. However, don't underestimate the value of learning from those who already excel at what you seek to accomplish. Ask for the advice of a veteran in your field for inside information on how best to conquer your goals. Experience is a teacher that no book can match."
pisces,2017-03-15,"It's easy to sympathize with those who struggle to find their direction now, since you often feel that way yourself. But you don't want to wallow in the waters of indecisiveness today; you're longing to follow your intuition wherever it leads. Setting off on a journey for answers when your destination is yet undetermined could seem reckless, but surrendering to the unknown is one of the most powerful steps you can take toward an enlightened future. Be a warrior, not a worrier."
aries,2017-03-16,"Your current boredom could turn to sullenness if you don't find a way to spice things up. Since external circumstances might not challenge your skills, your work productivity may quickly turn to passivity. You're itching to try anything that will give you an adrenaline rush while saucy Venus and witty Mercury are hanging out in your brazen sign. If you must stir up drama to save yourself from the blahs today, make sure you exercise at least a little bit of restraint. Your actions create ripples that affect more than just you."
taurus,2017-03-16,"It's easy to hit your stride today as long as you choose activities that keep you physically occupied. Your mental acuity isn't one hundred percent while brainy Mercury is tucked away in your 12th House of Invisibility, but unrelenting Mars in your sign has your back. Your measured approach allows you to make steady progress, but make sure you get off to a strong start. You're more interested in following someone else's lead by the time your day comes to a close. Gandhi said, ""Action expresses priorities."""
gemini,2017-03-16,"As the day drones on you may catch yourself staring at the clock, wondering when you'll be free to let your hair down. Paradoxically, allowing your daydreams to drive your decisions can help you accomplish more when visionary Neptune supports the ruminating Scorpio Moon. Visualizing yourself as a busy worker bee about to be rewarded for its efforts is powerful enough to transform your apathy into efficiency. Competence is born in the imagination."
cancer,2017-03-16,"You feel like a petal floating down a river at the mercy of the currents, but content to drift along. Your emotions may win out over other concerns as the moody Scorpio Moon meanders through your 5th House of Self-Expression, lulling you into a state of melancholy. Prevent getting lost at sea by making port at a friend's dock. Sometimes connecting with someone else is all it takes to get your feet back on solid ground. People who hide their feelings usually care the most, but there's no reason to struggle with a burden too heavy to bear."
leo,2017-03-16,"You don't want to slow your pace because you're hungry for life's next big adventure. But your feelings are intensified today, making minimal alterations to your grand plan seem like a life or death situation. Your sense of urgency might lead to an embarrassing outburst if it weren't for deliberate Mars in sensible Taurus grounding your energy. Fortunately, funneling your passion into actionable steps helps keep you in the present moment. There are only two times in life: now and too late."
virgo,2017-03-16,"Assuming you know what someone else is thinking isn't a wise move no matter how certain you feel today. Your overactive imagination is searching for something to grab onto, and you might pounce on the slightest hint of an affront. But don't jump to any conclusions until you hear it directly from the horse's mouth because your conjectures aren't likely to be based in reality now. It's healthier to find a more constructive use of your mental energy. Don't let your emotions determine your decisions. Keep calm and mind your own business."
libra,2017-03-16,"It seems as if everyone you run into pushes your buttons today. You don't feel like compromising when someone isn't willing to meet you halfway, but magnetic Venus retrograde in your 7th House of Others keeps you coming back even if it's just for another quarrel. Unfortunately, you could continue repeating the same mistake until you find a way to break the cycle. Immerse yourself in doing something you love to give yourself and others space to breathe. Galileo wrote, ""Passion is the genesis of genius."""
scorpio,2017-03-16,"You're swimming in your element today, which means superficiality is simply not a setting on your dial. Everyday tasks won't hold your attention for long because they don't seem meaningful enough to spend time on. The mundane appears dull compared to the beautiful dreamscapes in your mind while the Moon receives spiritual Neptune's visions. Don't be afraid to completely give in to your feelings after you take care of your responsibilities. Indulging in a favorite movie or book could be just the remedy for your disenchantment. Lauren Bacall said, ""Imagination is the highest kite one can fly."""
sagittarius,2017-03-16,"You may automatically rebel against lethargy by trying to go faster and harder now. You don't want to miss any fun just to catch up on sleep. But if you refuse to rest, at least find an avenue that won't burn up all your energy in a short amount of time. You can do more with less with the help of tenacious Mars in your 6th House of Work. Pick some simple tasks you can easily complete today and start crossing them off your list one at a time. Small acts transform the world."
capricorn,2017-03-16,"Sometimes you feel more intimately connected to your close circle of friends than you do to your family. While ignoring issues at home isn't prudent in the long run, occasionally you need to take a break and spend your time where you know you can fully relax. Don't feel too guilty for choosing this route today as long as you resolve to address the problems waiting for you at a chosen time in the near future. The only way to take care of others is to first take care of yourself."
aquarius,2017-03-16,"People might stay out of your way because your energy is so intimidating today. You're a force to be reckoned with while the enigmatic Scorpio Moon teams up with Mercury in belligerent Aries. However, you don't mean to come across as too pushy; you just want to finish what you start. Stick to your guns and follow your convictions regardless of anyone else's impressions. But soften your words whenever possible. Holding your position can be done from a place of kindness."
pisces,2017-03-16,"You're bursting with creative ideas today and you're eager to show everyone what you have to offer. You may stumble over your words if you go too fast in your excitement to convey your inspiring visions to others. Getting all your thoughts out of the nonphysical realm and onto paper in the three-dimensional world will help you organize them, allowing you to communicate your visions with greater confidence. Power is gained by sharing knowledge, not hoarding it."
aries,2017-03-17,"The waters of doubt can corrode even the strongest of iron wills. You may feel like life's flow is carrying you away from your long-term goals today as Saturn the Tester issues a harsh reminder of the distance between you and your ultimate destination. You instinctively fight the current with all your might, but the smarter option is to tread water until you're out of the emotional rapids. Hold back your desire to impulsively make a change; waiting until your strength returns ensures your success."
taurus,2017-03-17,"The shadow of uncertainty darkens your doorstep, causing you to question recent choices. You start to wonder if you've fallen prey to a mirage even if your social life has recently been a source of support and inspiration. However, your concerns may be the real illusion today when the Sun's square to suppressive Saturn in your 8th House of Intimacy projects a fear of rejection into your world. Seeking a resolution to your dilemma will only lead you in circles now. Martin Luther King, Jr. said, ""Faith is taking the first step even when you don't see the whole staircase."""
gemini,2017-03-17,"The weight of someone else's expectations could feel like they're too much for your shoulders to bear today. You may have been trying to emulate an individual you admire in order to advance on the professional front, but you know what they say: never meet your heroes. Although a good role model can serve as inspiration, a series of pages taken from another person's book does not a novel make. Incorporate your own intuitive observations into your plan for success."
cancer,2017-03-17,"You may be stretched to your emotional limits and it appears like nothing short of a miracle can bail you out. But an extreme reaction today will seem more proportional in the near future. It could feel like your daily efforts will never be enough to deliver you to the heights you dream of as you see how your habits are impacting your grand plan. Although you are a summation of what you do each day, you are not your shortcomings; resigning to shame would be a waste. There will be time to readjust your routine later, but for now accept your changing moods and be gentle with yourself."
leo,2017-03-17,"Your quest to find yourself takes you many places, but you may have lost your way today. Perhaps you wandered off and ended up in someone else's brambly forest, leaving you wondering how you landed in this mess. But before you launch an emergency flare, calm down and review your journey. Mentally retracing your steps will be easier in the coming days, so use this time to sink into your feelings. You must regain your bearings before changing direction; you're probably closer to your path than you think. Wait until the light returns before you make a move."
virgo,2017-03-17,"Your tendency to over-analyze lends a sense of urgency to everything today, making it imperative to discipline your mind from the start. Allies start to look like enemies if you stare for too long; you could feel like you must retreat to your fortress and change your battle plan completely. However, input from other people may strengthen your position, whether by challenging you with a new perspective or offering assistance for the next phase of execution. Whatever you do, don't set fire to your master plan just to thwart resistance, imagined or real. Fear ends where faith begins."
libra,2017-03-17,"The power of planning can be a blessing or a curse depending on how you use it. Unfortunately, merging your daily schedule with bigger objectives seems impossible and you could feel overworked and under-rewarded today. However, it's difficult to see past what's right in front of you now, and determining the best time-management strategy is likely to go poorly. Your efforts might not produce the output expected, but more time is required to know if that's really the case. Hold your ground; you may not need to scrap your plan to save it."
scorpio,2017-03-17,"You might believe that your creative approach will transcend ordinary requirements for success now. But when the heavy realization of your lack of resources sets in, you worry your faith was ill placed. However, your emotions are an intoxicating elixir that can trick you into thinking that only the cynical can win the game of life. Although you may have to pare down your efforts and find a more sustainable approach, there's no reason to let the challenges of today dampen the dreams of tomorrow."
sagittarius,2017-03-17,"You may want to rip off your rearview mirror and never look back, but your past could have a lot to teach you about where you're going. When a formidable Sun-Saturn square triggers your 4th House of Roots, you're required to address emotional patterns and childhood conditioning that lurk in your subconscious. Whether you integrate emotional discoveries or eliminate excess baggage, coming to an understanding with your personal history is a crucial step in living life more authentically."
capricorn,2017-03-17,"Your inherent discipline makes it nearly impossible to accept anything less than procedural excellence. However, life is more than a static blueprint; three-dimensional living involves coloring outside the lines sometimes. Although time management is valuable, there's a lot to be said for going with the flow today. Instead of allowing panic to create fearful reactions that limit your choices, take a step back to explore your options. Jonathan Swift wrote, ""Vision is the art of seeing what's invisible to others."""
aquarius,2017-03-17,"Your natural awareness of social justice makes it hard to justify your need to be your own individual island. You may feel guilty for believing you must nurture your own desires when there are world problems that require selfless service to solve. But the truth is that society is made up of a group of individuals, each doing his or her own part; variety is what makes the world go round. Following your heart contributes to the highest good for everyone."
pisces,2017-03-17,"An authority figure may stand in the way of your plans today, making you doubt your choices. You might feel as if you're under personal attack for just being yourself when severe Saturn issues a harsh reprimand to the sensitive Pisces Sun. But what is really being called into question is whether or not your attitude is supporting your ambitions for success. It's too early to lose hope, even if you placed false faith in your ability to achieve your objectives. Stay focused on your lofty goals because this bump in the road will ultimately help you go further than you ever imagined."
aries,2017-03-18,"The world is starting to look brighter by the minute as you throw open the windows of your mind. Nothing seems off limits when it comes to how you fashion yourself, modeling different styles and attitudes like you try on new clothes. They're undoubtedly outside your usual image since chic Venus is retrograde in your sign, but the good news is that experimentation without decision is a safe move. There's a brand new chapter to write and it looks nothing like your past."
taurus,2017-03-18,"You may be harboring secret passions that no one else would guess today. Your inner world is extremely colorful when curious Mercury joins artful Venus in your 12th House of Fantasy, but you're unwilling to share your wildest dreams with just anyone. Only those in your closest circle are allowed a peek now, and even then it's only for a moment. Fortunately, your hunch not to tell too many people what you're planning is correct. Jared Brock wrote, ""Inner stillness in the key to outer strength."""
gemini,2017-03-18,"It feels as if the chains of your daily grind are falling away and you're eager to kick up your heels and make up for lost time. Although some of your friends might have slipped off your radar, older ones are coming back into the picture. Reaching out to an old or new buddy is the perfect way to start the weekend as the cheerful Sagittarius Moon harmonizes with chatty Mercury in your 11th House of Networking. A lift in spirits is guaranteed when you invite someone to share in the warmth of fellowship. Life is more enjoyable when you're in the company of those you love."
cancer,2017-03-18,"You're ready to shake off the blues and do something useful today. Sometimes the best way to give yourself an energetic boost is to get your blood pumping; making the time for a walk or even a fun workout is favored as the sassy Sagittarius Moon bounces through your 6th House of Wellbeing. Even if fitness isn't your speed, any activity that ignites your enthusiasm is sure to bolster your sense of self-worth. The body may reflect the mind, but physical activity can get the mind moving."
leo,2017-03-18,"The limitless possibilities of worlds beyond your own hold a strong fascination. You want to intellectually sample all kinds of exotica when delectable Venus joins interactive Mercury in your 9th House of Adventure. Some things may be so stimulating that you wish to give them a permanent place in your bag of tricks, but there might not be enough room in your suitcase. Your tastes are bound to keep expanding, so indulge without committing your heart. Don't make a final decision based upon a fleeting fancy."
virgo,2017-03-18,"There's a lot weighing on your mind and it's easy to get frazzled by all the recent changes. But today you have a chance to settle in and process your feelings while the affirming Sagittarius Moon resides in your 4th House of Security. A supportive lunar contact to rational Mercury makes analyzing your psychological riddles less daunting now, allowing you to see them through a wider lens. Although you still want to resolve these issues as soon as possible, appreciating the developments as they unfold will make your growth more meaningful. Strive for progress, not perfection."
libra,2017-03-18,"You don't have to look far to introduce some levity into your day. There are a few juicy stories to share when talkative Mercury bumps into amorous Venus retrograde, who is backtracking through your 7th House of Relationships. Although unusual recurrences may be happening in your love life, sometimes laughter is the best way to navigate emotional drama. Reba McEntire said, ""To succeed in life, you need three things: a wishbone, a backbone and a funny bone."""
scorpio,2017-03-18,"It's the little things that catch your eye today. However, rather than dwelling on what is wrong, it's more fun to only acknowledge what's right. As the optimistic Sagittarius Moon trines analytical Mercury in your 6th House of Minutiae, it's easier to see how the details figure into the life you want to build. Although you may not be completely certain what that future looks like yet, you're happy to entertain a brighter outlook in the present moment. Beautiful things happen when you distance yourself from negativity."
sagittarius,2017-03-18,"Dawn breaks in your personal world as you breathe in the crisp air of a new day. You're enthusiastic about taking off the training wheels and debuting your skills. But don't overestimate your proficiency or your passion just yet. Although the cavalier Moon in your sign encourages ardent Venus to run wild in your 5th House of Self-Expression, her retrograde motion indicates you will probably play the field even more before deciding what makes you tick. Sampling life's pleasures is sometimes more rewarding than pursuing a single path."
capricorn,2017-03-18,"Oddly enough, you can ascertain more information from behind the walls of your fortress than out in the field today. It's almost as if you're able to see with your eyes closed as the far-sighted Sagittarius Moon traverses your 12th House of Invisibility. Although conversation flows freely, it's most likely regarding lingering family issues. Staying close to home allows you to sort out matters of the heart with those who know you best and are sure to keep your confidence. Rumi wrote, ""Remember, the entrance door to the sanctuary is inside you."""
aquarius,2017-03-18,"Your mind is quick to grab onto any brilliant idea passing by today. Fortunately, there are plenty to go around now that mental Mercury and resourceful Venus are teaming up in your 3rd House of Information. Many of the concepts appear to have the potential to morph into marvelous plans, but determining which are just diversions is a challenge now. However, gathering your friends for an impromptu think-tank is a perfect panacea for a case of too many options. It takes a village to narrow your focus."
pisces,2017-03-18,"Although your preferences are rearranging themselves before your eyes, today ushers in an ease with which you can ponder this mental evolution. A favorable alignment between the expansive Sagittarius Moon and a passionate Mercury-Venus pairing emphasizes your 2nd House of Values, opening your mind to the ways your emotional needs align with your material goals. Prosperity begins with a state of mind."
aries,2017-03-19,"It doesn't matter where you're going today, you just want to get there as fast as possible. But you may pick the express train only to belatedly realize that the next stop isn't for another hundred miles. Unless you want to end up at a station far far away, the smarter choice is to slow down a bit and enjoy the circuitous ride. Tony Robbins said, ""The only impossible journey is the one you never begin."""
taurus,2017-03-19,"It's the kind of day when you wish there was a troubleshooting manual for life. It's not that anything is broken, but something seems to be a bit off and you can't put your finger on what it is today. Thankfully, your attraction to the tangible allows you to focus on an activity to take your mind off the confusing kaleidoscope of your internal musings. However, events lurking at the edge of your awareness reach a critical point when shocking Uranus connects with the reckless Sagittarius Moon in your 8th House of Transformation. Roll with the punches and the rest will take care of itself."
gemini,2017-03-19,"Delightful chemistry with a friend or an acquaintance takes tangential conversations up a notch, seeming almost as if they're being orchestrated from another dimension. These detours and departures from the norm may be somewhat of a time sink, but they're far from boring. In fact, you may walk away from a chat wondering where this person has been your whole life. The exaggerating Sagittarius Moon in your 7th House of Others can make anyone seem like a twin spirit when the conditions are right, and the cosmic weather happens to be perfect now for sailing the seas of speculation. Synchronicity is the universe saying yes."
cancer,2017-03-19,"Nothing is quite to scale today as menial tasks seem to grow to fill the container they're placed in. Spare time vanishes as you keep finding additional ways to tweak your work. Before you know it, you may have prolonged a chore that should have taken no time at all. Luckily, in the midst of making a big deal out of something small you could gain unexpected insights. Socrates wrote, ""Wonder is the beginning of wisdom."""
leo,2017-03-19,"Moderation is not in your vocabulary today as you see no valid reason to hold yourself back. A number of pleasant diversions are at your fingertips, and your creative mind is buzzing with possibilities. However, deciding where to start could feel like trying to go left and right at the same time. Happily, dabbling in a number of things can be just as gratifying as being in something for the long haul. But there's no telling when inspiration will strike; be ready for a radical change in plans to chase whatever makes your heart sing."
virgo,2017-03-19,"The past intertwines with the present as you sift through your closets and drawers. Nostalgic thoughts are vivified by the presence of the questing Sagittarius Moon in your 4th House of Roots, tinging your recollections with gold and inspiring a fondness not often awakened. It's strange that you might remember such days with a smile, since not all of the memories are the happiest. But Luna's connection to ingenious Uranus reveals a new perspective on your personal history, transforming resentment into gratitude. A thankful heart is a happy heart."
libra,2017-03-19,"The world right outside your door seems to sparkle with possibility today, and sitting still is the last thing you want to do. You don't have to go far to find excitement when the buoyant Sagittarius Moon traverses your 3rd House of Short Trips. Stimulating conversations happen organically at the grocery store, post office or other local stop. However, someone could appear out of left field with shocking comments that turn your thinking upside down. Awareness changes everything."
scorpio,2017-03-19,"You're off to greener pastures, searching for a treasure to boost your state of mind. Your wandering eye is likely to find every little thing fascinating as the inflationary Sagittarius Moon travels through your 2nd House of Material Goods. But when eccentric Uranus joins the shopping trip, you may see an extravagant item that's too unique to pass up even if it's outside your budget. There's no harm in treating yourself, but keep your receipt in case you suffer buyer's remorse. Remember, you're not rich until you own something that money can't buy."
sagittarius,2017-03-19,"The only leash long enough is no leash at all, especially when the Moon is flying through your free-spirited sign. The only way you want to go is up today, but the cosmos is drafty and you are blown in every which direction. Fortunately, you don't mind a bit of a wild ride, even if you drift off your original course. Savor every moment from the mundane to the bizarre and you may find hidden gems along the way. Life is a journey, not a competition."
capricorn,2017-03-19,"You're ready to wind down and take advantage of some alone time, but your mind continues to hum with activity. The moment you try to rest your brain, another intriguing idea bubbles to the top. The philosophical Sagittarius Moon may be luring you into your 12th House of Rest, but a trine from unpredictable Uranus inserts wild notions out of nowhere that rattle your cage. Achieving a perfect Zen state isn't in the cards today, but recording thoughts as they arrive can help you remain calm without wearing yourself out with resistance. Ma Jaya Sati Bhagavati wrote, ""Quiet the mind and the soul will speak."""
aquarius,2017-03-19,"The impossible seems possible today, but the road to success is a winding one. Unexpected detours may delay your progress, but you could find something amazing along the way if you take time to enjoy the scenic route. However, this meandering tour loses allure when unfinished duties loom overhead. Fortunately, applying a little bit of focus enables you to work toward accomplishing your goals in both business and pleasure. With great privilege comes great responsibility."
pisces,2017-03-19,"Thinking about your career direction is exciting and overwhelming all at once. Pursuing a research path inevitably intersects with others, and the next thing you know your road frays into a multitude of choices. In the midst of your mental cat's cradle, an epiphany may occur when electric Uranus zaps the bountiful Sagittarius Moon in your 10th House of Profession. Elevating your standing is surely an ongoing process, but the key is to trust your personal convictions. Following your own star leads to happiness."
aries,2017-03-20,"It's as if your electrical cord has been plugged back in and you finally have the power to get to work. It's the start of your personal new year as the mighty Sun bursts into your sign, throwing fuel on your fire and propelling you along your own individual path. But the Moon's shift into conservative Capricorn points a finger at your 10th House of Career, reminding you that speed without direction is the road to ruin. Keep your eye on the prize and harness your renewed vigor for your ambitions rather than a reckless release of energy. Follow your own star and don't look back."
taurus,2017-03-20,"You are busy making valuable connections and finalizing your plans. But now you must take your dreams into the workshop for honing and shaping. Personal time without any distraction becomes a top priority when the golden Sun moves into your 12th House of Privacy; in fact, you may even be slightly aggressive in your insistence for solitude. However important it is to seek solace and contemplation, don't neglect your long-term goals in the process. Rather than waiting for better conditions today, strengthen your resolve and pave the way for your future."
gemini,2017-03-20,"It feels as if time is of the essence when it comes to making your voice heard in your community. You're moved to get involved and speak your truth when the radiant Sun marches into trail-blazing Aries and your 11th House of Social Groups. You possess the courage to be yourself while networking with the right people, and are willing to sever some relationships that no longer serve you. However, the ambitious Capricorn Moon reminds you that to truly transform your social life or the world around you, you must first transform yourself."
cancer,2017-03-20,"You're ready to steel your nerves and go after your ambitions with renewed fervor. However, in the back of your mind you're wondering how your aspirations affect the people around you. You wouldn't want to do anything to compromise your closest relationships but at the same time you are pulled to create your own success while the Sun brightens your 10th House of Career. You could feel like you have to sacrifice one for the other but luckily, this tension fades in the days to come. Tim McGraw sings, ""Chase your dreams but always know the road that will lead you home again."""
leo,2017-03-20,"Your inner explorer is stirred by the call of distant and uncharted territory. You're prepared to travel as far as you need to satisfy your hunger for learning, whether you actually visit a faraway location or plunge into a new course of study. The Sun's entrance into your 9th House of Journeys could take you many places, but the responsible Capricorn Moon expects you to do the leg work once you set off on your adventures. Before you pick your new frontier, make sure you can shoulder the weight."
virgo,2017-03-20,"Experience tells you avoiding unnecessary risk is the safest bet, but there's a part of you that longs to gamble everything for the chance to shine. Perfecting yourself is always the ultimate goal, but self-improvement takes on a whole new level of meaning when the Sun moves into visceral Aries, shining the light of consciousness into your 8th House of Transformation. Although you want to dig into your core and emerge gleaming on the other side, you're reluctant to diverge from your normal way of being. Going from better to best takes courage and patience in equal measure."
libra,2017-03-20,"It seems as if you might lose a precious opportunity if you don't tell a certain someone how you feel today. As the illuminating Sun moves into candid Aries, your 7th House of Relationships becomes a cosmic stage on which all manner of plays will take place. Whether it's a comedy or a drama, the theatre is booked for the next several weeks. But don't be too hasty to jump into the spotlight; a little stage fright might actually be your saving grace if you still need time to rehearse your lines. Wait until your head catches up to your heart."
scorpio,2017-03-20,"As spring officially begins, you're ready to start fresh and take better care of yourself. Ambitious exercise regimens and a schedule tailored to your optimal lifestyle seem attainable now that the Sun is in energetic Aries, emphasizing your 6th House of Health. However, the structured Capricorn Moon warns that your plan must be sustainable for it to do any good. Burnout is a very real potential now, so methodically pace your efforts so they will last. Confucius said, ""The man who moves a mountain begins by carrying away small stones."""
sagittarius,2017-03-20,"Stepping out the door today feels like heading outside for the first time in months. It's as if an invisible gate is swinging open now that the Sun lights up your 5th House of Spontaneity, leaving you free to pursue whatever desires are burning in your heart. However, if there is a daring enterprise you wish to explore, be sure you have a buffer of resources available instead of being reckless with your funds. The most powerful weapon on earth is the human soul on fire."
capricorn,2017-03-20,"It's essential to your goat-like nature that you continue to climb higher, slowly but surely. But sometimes you need to take a good hard look at the ground beneath your feet to know where to step next. Although you don't want to let your past confine you, you must do your housekeeping inside and out to reach the next level of success. As the Sun casts its light into your 4th House of Foundations, you're asked to reconnect to your roots over the next four weeks. Your future success depends on creating stability in the present moment."
aquarius,2017-03-20,"There are so many things you want to say, but even more you want to know. What enters your mind goes back out quickly with your own original twist. The assertive Aries Sun turns on a floodlight in your 3rd House of Information, urging you to exploit your mental machine to crank out even more. But the patient Capricorn Moon advises you to wait and integrate what you learn before forging ahead into new territory. Benjamin Franklin wrote, ""An investment in knowledge pays the best interest."""
pisces,2017-03-20,"The struggles of yesterday seem to shrink as you move through the day. It's as if you are wearing a pair of magical winged shoes, turning each step into a leap that propels you further ahead. The gift of self-assurance accompanies the Sun's entry into courageous Aries, accentuating your 2nd House of Self-Esteem. But you can't help looking back over your shoulder now, wondering if your forward motion is carrying you away from the very ideals that are the core of your identity. Before you get too high on confidence, reconsider what inspired you to start moving in the first place."
aries,2017-03-21,"There are plenty of things you wish you could express with your trademark frankness, but you are aware of how brutal honesty might harm your reputation. You must decide which is more important: getting along with coworkers and associates or allowing yourself to pop off at someone who deserves a piece of your mind. Although it's frustrating to suppress your opinion today, your struggle can be alleviated somewhat by focusing on producing measurable progress as you work. Shout praise, whisper criticism."
taurus,2017-03-21,"While many people rush through their days at top speed, you're taking a tip from the tortoise and keeping it slow and steady. You wish you could say that your optimistic outlook is what enables you to maintain a sustainable pace, but it's really the opposite today. Uncertainty swirls in the periphery of your mind as you struggle to choose the best route for reaching your destination. Fortunately, getting your hands dirty instead of sitting around worrying is a great way to turn stress into success."
gemini,2017-03-21,"It seems like the more you try to let loose today, the harder it is to justify your frivolity. Unexpressed frustration finds its way into your conversations now, even if the person on the other end of your ranting has nothing to do with what's bothering you. Rather than making an innocent bystander a sounding board for your problems, go directly to the source and seek the origins of your current discontent. Words won't soothe the soul now; you must consult the heart."
cancer,2017-03-21,"Talking about professional aspirations with a friend or partner may be uncomfortable if they start to scold you for your ambition. Although their intentions are likely well-intended, you might feel judged when the cold Capricorn Moon clashes with an overzealous Mercury-Venus duo in your 10th House of Career. However, you must be willing to proceed without validation from others now, even if it means drawing from your spiritual practice to feel at peace. The only approval that really matters is your own."
leo,2017-03-21,"Your vision for the future is so vibrant that you wonder how normal life hasn't caught up to it yet. No matter how diligently you work on making steps toward your highest potential, it could seem like you just can't make it happen as fast as you want. While imagining your desired outcome is an essential part of reaching your goals, the grit it takes to make progress is generated by tapping into your deepest power reserves. Make a wish, then make it come true."
virgo,2017-03-21,"The clay is yours to shape, but translating abstract ideas into reality is a unique challenge today. You would almost rather edit what already exists than try to create something new from scratch. However, true satisfaction comes only from molding your raw materials into a finished product, even though you face the risk of falling short of perfection. Ironically, what matters more to your personal development is the shaping process itself."
libra,2017-03-21,"Attractions swirl and insinuations abound, but something puts a bit of a drag on your aerodynamics. Flirty Venus and crafty Mercury in your 7th House of Relationships are down for a game of chance, but the guarded Capricorn Moon makes you wonder how safe it is to gamble with your heart. It's impossible to calculate the odds of life with numbers and figures. Instead, put your finger to the pulse of your deepest longings and sync your actions to the rhythm. No risk, no reward."
scorpio,2017-03-21,"Figuring out what to do would be less of a headache if you could just get your hands on some solid facts. But you're torn between frankly stating your case and trying to find a way to show someone what you mean with your actions. But sometimes neither logical analysis nor back-breaking effort can fully convey your position. Your energy is better spent viewing your situation in a different light than ferreting out the logistics. Albert Einstein reminds us, ""No problem can be solved from the same level of consciousness that created it."""
sagittarius,2017-03-21,"You're hard-pressed to care about anything but satisfying your immediate desires today; however, a nagging cognizance of potential consequences gives you pause. Fulfilling your responsibilities can feel like slaving away while the rest of the world is having fun, but there is another layer to this cake that underlies your restlessness. Your cravings may be a symptom of a lack of creative nutrients; look for a way to treat the root of the problem, not just band-aid the pain with more shenanigans. Picasso said, ""Art washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life."""
capricorn,2017-03-21,"You think your message will finally get across if you just strip your words down to bare bones. Unfortunately, you may shoot yourself in the foot by stubbornly clinging to a cold communication style. You might be less forgiving of family members and close friends than you realize because you feel they know you so well already. However, a magical Sun-Pluto connection beckons you to take a different approach to domestic disputes, looking beyond the ordinary and into the veiled reasons for your attitude. Dig deep for the answers buried in your heart."
aquarius,2017-03-21,"You want to take the solo route today and rely on your own moral compass to keep you grounded. But temptations to ignore reason are everywhere while there are four fiery planets cavorting in your 3rd House of Distractions. However, an earthy trine between the consistent Capricorn Moon and pragmatic Mars encourages you to keep it simple rather than expending your mental energy on things that may not pan out. Staying out of trouble allows you to stay on track."
pisces,2017-03-21,"You feel the weight of societal expectations today as if a hundred pairs of eyes are peering at you. Sometimes it seems like you have a responsibility to people you've never met and you experience a pang of anxiety now, wondering how to live up to it all. Use the questions that arise as prompts to listen for authentic answers. However, the best gift you can give to the world is being unequivocally yourself. Martin Luther King Jr. said, ""Only in the darkness can you see the stars."""
aries,2017-03-22,"Nothing moves fast enough for your liking as you race toward the finish line today. However, obstacles remain and quick reflexes are required to avoid taking a spill. In addition to agility, a firm resolve and both eyes on your final objective will determine your ability to continue in the face of unexpected adversity. Clearer skies and lighter spirits are just around the corner; keep your nose to the grindstone now so you can fully enjoy yourself later."
taurus,2017-03-22,"There's so much going on internally right now that it's hard to return to your senses. It's easy to get lost when your mind feels like an enchanted labyrinth whose walls shift and change; you might want to sit still until you get your bearings. But the sure-footed Capricorn Moon in your 9th House of Long-Term Goals bids you to stand up and keep inching forward, even when your progress is uncertain. Focus on the details when the broad strokes are in flux."
gemini,2017-03-22,"Your busy life keeps you on your toes but you always seem to have a hidden pocket of energy to use whenever you need it. However, relationship dynamics could reach an emotional peak while the accountable Capricorn Moon tangos with passionate Pluto in your 8th House of Intimacy. Although you can hardly be blamed for the hectic nature of your schedule, you need to make time to mend a bond that may have grown thin. Reach out and reconnect today; don't lose a diamond while chasing glitter."
cancer,2017-03-22,"It doesn't seem right that it's so difficult to fit your closest friends into your schedule. However, you're being pulled in so many directions now that it's tricky to know what to prioritize. Chances are there are people missing you too, and you may need to erase activities you penciled in to be with the ones you love. The dutiful Capricorn Moon in your 7th House of Companions nudges you to spend quality time with someone near and dear to you. Rumi teaches, ""With life as short as a half-taken breath, don't plant anything but love."""
leo,2017-03-22,"You're willing to work hard to earn your ticket to the top, but sometimes it seems like one obstacle after another deters you from reaching the summit. When one road gets bumpier than you expect, it's tempting to switch to the path of least resistance. However, the steadfast Capricorn Moon's presence in your 6th House of Logistics attests to the value of having a list and sticking to it today. Organizing your goals into manageable tasks enables you to focus when things appear to go awry. Controlling the external details calms the inner chaos."
virgo,2017-03-22,"You're convinced that if you just try hard enough, you can do everything you promised and more today. However, you may be overestimating your capabilities when inflationary Jupiter pumps up the committed Capricorn Moon in your 5th House of Self-Expression. You want to show everyone how dedicated you are by not giving up; you might even feel like paring back your list of projects reflects badly on your worth as a person. But the fact is you'll only disappoint your fans if you get carried away with your ambitions now. Set achievable goals instead of setting yourself up for failure."
libra,2017-03-22,"Your life can feel like a teeter-totter when constant ups and downs become a normal feature. Although so much change keeps things interesting, sometimes you want to get off the ride and feel the solid earth beneath your feet. The traditional Capricorn Moon moves through your 4th House of Roots, urging you to lean on family or close friends for emotional support now. Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz said, ""There's no place like home."""
scorpio,2017-03-22,"Wild prognostications and dismissive reassurances are all rustling around in today's grab bag, making you skeptical of every piece of information you pull out. You may be prone to mild paranoia even on a good day, but right now it's essential to take things with a grain of salt. Although rushing through everything is typical in this modern age, the reasonable Capricorn Moon recommends that you proceed slowly and examine each alternative thoroughly. Gandhi said, ""There is more to life than simply increasing its speed."""
sagittarius,2017-03-22,"Your ideas seem to grow more colorful with each passing day, filling you with giddy anticipation. However, expanding dreams requires extra resources and you may run into the budgeting blues as the structured Capricorn Moon audits your 2nd House of Finances. Fortunately, the sooner you assess your position the more you can gather the support your endeavors need. Prudent planning now will save you from many headaches down the road. Thomas Jefferson said, ""Never spend your money before you have it."""
capricorn,2017-03-22,"You're hardly ready to give up on your objectives, but maintaining a work-life balance is quite challenging today. A sense of urgency makes lofty professional goals sound even loftier and shifting domestic circumstances seem even more unstable. All the noise might get overwhelming when the reflective Moon acts as a receiver in your sign. Fortunately, Luna's shift into objective Aquarius will take you out of the emotional crossfire so you can calmly observe your reactions. Exploring your options is best done with a cool head."
aquarius,2017-03-22,"You're starting to wonder if you've bitten off more than you can chew as papers pile up on your desk and your inbox overflows. Although you thrive with plenty of mental stimulation, a break from a constant influx of information could be just the ticket to ease your doubts today. The seasoned Capricorn Moon's presence in your 12th House of Inner Peace convinces you to retreat to a quiet space for much-needed rest. Sometimes letting go of all the pieces allows them to fall into place."
pisces,2017-03-22,"Your momentum is cresting and it's exciting to feel like you're advancing now; however, you falter momentarily when you look down in search of a landing point. Although you can't always predict your future when fate has swept you up, you can control how you respond to the changing winds. Seek the stability of your social circle while the reliable Capricorn Moon resides in your 11th House of Networking. No matter where you are on your personal timeline, the company of a supportive group of people could be reassuring enough to stabilize your mood. When all else fails, count on your friends."
aries,2017-03-23,"You don't see how you can keep your ideas to yourself for one more day. Whether you're passionate about your work or pent-up frustration is making you crazy, someone is bound to hear about it today. While there's nothing wrong with speaking your mind, a tense configuration between intimidating Pluto and vocal Mercury in your 1st House of Personality transforms typical venting into steamrolling rants. Others could feel attacked by your gusto if you don't consciously rein in your intensity. Although moderating your tone for your audience is wise, remember Ralph Waldo Emerson's words, ""Nothing great was ever achieved without enthusiasm."""
taurus,2017-03-23,"You're certainly privy to all the changes happening to everyone else, but you still may not realize how much you have changed. You prefer to stick to the obvious, but you might experience an epiphany today that's been organically developing behind the scenes. Fortunately, the detached Aquarius Moon helps you see what could feel like an internal watershed from a cool-headed perspective. St. Thomas Aquinas wrote, ""A man has free choice to the extent that he is rational."""
gemini,2017-03-23,"You're a natural when it comes to chatting about every topic from A to Z, but talking about deep feelings doesn't come as easily. But more goes on behind your lighthearted veneer than you let on, and the pressure may build up so much that it begins to color your language a few shades darker. Your friends are likely to pick up on the fact that something is on your mind today, so choosing an appropriate time and place to express your emotions is ideal over spilling the beans without any warning. Choose proactive over reactive for the best results."
cancer,2017-03-23,"You feel the words rising in your throat and you're not sure if you can bite your tongue for much longer. Although you know that stress at work is inevitable, things may reach a boiling point where you're unable to keep silent. Defending your position is essential and you should stand your ground with confidence. But if there's something on your mind unrelated to your job, don't take it out on your coworkers. Discussing your thoughts with the right people turns a frustrating conversation into a healing experience."
leo,2017-03-23,"You're extremely excited about a long-term project, and it's gratifying to see the progress as it takes shape. However, you may get fed up with the lack of recognition today if others aren't noticing the jewel you're polishing so diligently. You might think that an impassioned speech will wake everyone up to the reality of your efforts, but what is zeal to you might sound like a lecture to someone else. If you really want feedback or acknowledgment, all you have to do is ask."
virgo,2017-03-23,"Your schedule is your best friend today as it gives you a reason to politely decline people's well-meaning inquiries. You don't feel like discussing what's on your mind now, even if you could use an objective ear to help you process your thoughts. However, you may find yourself at a dead end with fewer options if you don't face your feelings from the start. It's better to have an uncomfortable conversation on your own terms than a shouting match when you're at the end of your rope. Timing is everything."
libra,2017-03-23,"Any good captain worth their salt knows to steer their ship early to avoid last-minute turns that could capsize the vessel. But even the most experienced sailors misjudge distance sometimes, and today you may be closer to a quick change in direction than you think. Inconspicuous cues from a friend or partner might only be the tip of the iceberg, and collision is unavoidable if you realize what's happening too late. Fortunately, the astute Aquarius Moon lends you the impartiality needed to handle any conflict that arises. Erring on the side of kindness inspires others to do the same."
scorpio,2017-03-23,"You don't want anyone to waste your time today because every moment seems critical to your success. Your obligations may be stressing you out more than you wish, but that just makes you more adamant to fulfill them as quickly as possible. Harnessing your anger for productivity works to your advantage rather than allowing aggravation to stop you in your tracks. Never underestimate the power of persistence."
sagittarius,2017-03-23,"Your passion takes you to amazing places and you're excited about your creations. You hope your friends are impressed by your deeds and you may even think that luck is on your side as you continue to push the envelope. But you might be annoyed if everyone doesn't agree with your approach to living the good life. You could feel like your integrity is at stake when your actions aren't met with applause and acclaim. However, you must evaluate your own sense of self-esteem for the validation you seek because it could be an internal issue rather than one with your audience."
capricorn,2017-03-23,"Your ability to conduct yourself with maturity is a strength that blends well with your tendency to not dance around a subject. However, that same calculated approach enables you to evade issues that you prefer not to discuss. But you're forced to confront your changing motivations when transformative Pluto pushes discerning Mercury. Talking about your dilemma could help you evaluate the situation in a clear-headed manner, even if you wish you could figure the answer out by yourself. Nevertheless, it's perfectly acceptable to lean on someone else for a change."
aquarius,2017-03-23,"You are hoping that no one sees past your poker face because you only want to share your secrets with someone you know will keep them. However, voices carry today when cathartic Pluto influences capricious Mercury in your 3rd House of Communication, and you may end up outing yourself when you thought you had total control. Although you feel chagrin over your slip of the tongue, it's better to have your thoughts out in the open now where everyone can see them more clearly. Psychologist Brene Brown writes, ""What makes you vulnerable makes you beautiful."""
pisces,2017-03-23,"Doing what's best for your own mental and emotional health must be top priority today. Even though you feel strongly about taking a stand for your beliefs, you won't be an effective leader unless you renew your energy with a well-deserved timeout. Neglecting your needs only results in poorly communicated intentions, especially when intense Pluto and argumentative Mercury add a formidable force behind your words. Thinking before you speak requires extra effort now, indicating your best bet is to retreat to the cozy comfort of your castle before you say something you regret."
aries,2017-03-24,"You are running out of patience with people who can't get their stories straight. But some mental gymnastics help to ease tensions by allowing you to see a different side of the picture. There's no harm in listening to someone's point of view today, and you might even strengthen your own position in the process. Don't be afraid to give up some ground to let another person be in the spotlight now, in the spirit of camaraderie if nothing else. Cheryl Richardson wrote, ""People start to heal the moment they feel heard."""
taurus,2017-03-24,"You're wondering if everyone could benefit from a temporary spring hibernation in light of recent discord. You want to pull the covers back over your head today and close your eyes to the stress, hoping it will all come out in the wash. But your silence could serve as inaccurate confirmation or complicit denial if you don't participate in discussions that involve you now. Step out of your comfort zone to ensure your assumptions don't cause problems you will only have to fix later. When in doubt, ask."
gemini,2017-03-24,"You're willing to do whatever it takes to keep the waters calm today, making a concerted effort to listen and speak in equal measure. Others appreciate your open-mindedness, but don't abandon common sense and become a yes-person just to avoid potential conflict. You may end up inadvertently ignoring the voice of discernment in your attempts to maintain harmony now, creating tangles that will only get tighter later on. Focus on the big picture while you play the game of compromise."
cancer,2017-03-24,"You may be overly protective of your opinions now as you recall past experiences when speaking up didn't go very well. However, letting your guard down just enough to listen to a coworker or friend could prove to be worthwhile when benevolent Jupiter stands opposite clever Mercury in your 10th House of Reputation. You might even win some points for being willing to put differences aside and welcome someone's input. Life is too short not to try and find common ground. Maya Angelou writes, ""We are more alike, my friends, than unalike."""
leo,2017-03-24,"You're proud of all the work you're doing to cultivate your big ideas and you can't wait to watch them bloom. But you may look at your garden of seeds through rose-colored glasses today, believing that they will break ground in no time at all. Calling on a second pair of eyes is prudent when something appears too good to be true. The advice from a friend who isn't as invested in the outcome just might save you from overlooking details you assumed you already covered. Two minds are better than one."
virgo,2017-03-24,"You might have unwittingly developed a tough outer shell to filter out bothersome noise that detracts from your ability to remain calm. However, you want to let in considerations from someone close to you  today, instead of stubbornly shutting down when encouraging Jupiter opposes critical Mercury in your 8th House of Intimacy. You may be surprised by how understanding others can be when you allow them to see the inner chambers of your heart. Vulnerability is your friend."
libra,2017-03-24,"You're the first to step in and try to smooth things over when the road gets bumpy. Fortunately, you can use your power of reconciliation for the good of someone close to you when high-minded Jupiter beckons to clever Mercury in your 7th House of Others. Creatively framing both sides of an issue allows everyone to see the situation more clearly. However, don't get so caught up in chasing harmony that you overstate one piece of the puzzle just to make the crowd happy. Pope Paul VI stated, ""If you want peace, work for justice."""
scorpio,2017-03-24,"You assume you can handle anything life throws at you today because you have painstakingly examined every detail of your plan. You're sure nothing could go wrong if you just follow along with each preconceived step. Although your detective's nose has rooted out many of the facts, you may still be overlooking something that can only be seen from a wider perspective. Continue moving toward your goal, but don't get so invested in the framework that you're unwilling to adjust your methods. Adaptability is the secret to your success."
sagittarius,2017-03-24,"Sometimes all it takes are a few simple words to make you realize your fortunate position. You don't lack for personal initiative while fleet-footed Mercury plays in your 5th House of Creativity. However, an opposition from magnanimous Jupiter reminds you that including your friends in your activities is just as important as pursuing them yourself. Even if you don't always see eye to eye, never underestimate the value of community. A joy that's shared is a joy made double."
capricorn,2017-03-24,"You're eager to pick up the pace again, even if it means letting go of an unresolved argument. It's clearly evident that your ambitions will suffer if you hold onto negativity that roots you in place, regardless of its origin. While a healthy dose of forgive-and-forget is always a good idea, be sure you don't sweep anything under the rug for the sake of laying an issue to rest. William Shakespeare wrote, ""No legacy is so rich as honesty."""
aquarius,2017-03-24,"You may still be slightly rattled by a recent misunderstanding, but you're beginning to see the importance of widening your outlook to be more inclusive. It's easy to lose sight of the big picture when you're devoted to making your point. However, today's enlightening Mercury-Jupiter alignment refreshes your fundamental belief that everyone is entitled to their own opinions. Taking yourself less seriously now is the key to moving forward."
pisces,2017-03-24,"Your belief in second chances is a strength that many forsake once they've been hurt once or twice. But strength can become weakness if you're trying to overcompensate for a past offense that you still regret. There's a fine line between empathizing with someone's feelings and granting them a get-out-of-jail-free card just to help you absolve your guilt over an unpleasant incident. Sometimes moving on doesn't include a pretty resolution with a bow on top. Legendary Artist Prince said, ""Compassion is an action word with no boundaries."""
aries,2017-03-25,"You may question where some of your fire has gone today as your lust for the future conflicts with your longings from the past. It's no surprise that your eyes drift back and forth on the timeline when the Sun's rays fall on tender Venus retrograde in your sign. Reflecting on earlier desires might make you wonder if you made a mistake somewhere along the line. However, sudden corrections of presumed blunders impede your progress. Instead, observe your feelings and let them pass like clouds in the sky. Love works in mysterious ways."
taurus,2017-03-25,"A dreamy haze settles over your day, glossing over nettlesome details and mellowing your mood. Silhouettes enter your daydreams as murky recollections of past aspirations join the shadow play. Fondly remembering what you used to love most may reawaken an old goal that you want to put back on your agenda. However, in this foggy climate it's best to just savor the memories without renewing a commitment. Author Susan Gale wrote, ""Sometimes a short walk down Memory Lane is all it takes to appreciate where you are today."""
gemini,2017-03-25,"You're looking forward to catching up with your tribe, but in the back of your mind you're remembering an awkward incident that still affects the group dynamic. However, there's no reason to let prior misunderstandings spoil the fun, and your friends might be more willing to talk it out than you expect. Fortunately, the sympathetic Pisces Moon in your 10th House of Reputation augments your ability to empathize, allowing you to facilitate discussions with kindness. Rachel Joy Scott wrote, ""Compassion is the greatest form of love humans have to offer."""
cancer,2017-03-25,"You want to make the very most of your aptitudes and leave a good impression today. You're willing to put some extra time into your appearance, following the advice to dress for the job you want. You're eager to review your current progress and evaluate how best to proceed while the visionary Pisces Moon floats through your 9th House of Long-Term Goals. Although you may not be a paragon of success quite yet, patience with yourself and faith in the process can carry you a long way toward achieving your dreams."
leo,2017-03-25,"You're captivated by an exotic idea that fills your mind with wonder and curiosity. In fact, you might be so drawn to a foreign place that you're tempted to book a vacation so you can experience it in person. However, the journey you need to take may be within as the spiritual Pisces Moon swims through your 8th House of Deep Feelings. Observe how your inner adventure mirrors the outer and you could find the most fascinating treasures of all."
virgo,2017-03-25,"You might feel as if you're all out of words today, preferring more subtle forms of communication. Sometimes just being in someone's presence is enough to comfort a troubled mind, even if you speak very little of the details. It's perfectly alright to reach out to a friend for support when your emotions are confusing. Although you're hesitant to ask for help since you dislike being a burden, sharing time is beneficial to the other person as well. You don't have to walk through life alone, especially while the deep work of the soul is at hand."
libra,2017-03-25,"It seems as if everywhere you go today people are talking about their romantic antics. You may find yourself in the position of both the giver and seeker of advice when the spirited Sun and magnetic Venus dance in your 7th House of Relationships. However, perhaps the best tip you could offer or receive now is to stop asking what others can do for you and start asking what you can do for yourself. In the end, you have the final say on your own feelings; a regimen of compassionate self-care might be more valuable than anything else."
scorpio,2017-03-25,"Fulfilling your obligations is always easier if you enjoy the chores you're doing. You're determined to keep as many plates spinning as possible now but sometimes the best way to stay motivated is to take a break from the action. Find a space where you can do something creative just for fun, and you'll be pleasantly surprised by how much simpler it is to manage all the things on your to-do list when you return. Absence makes the heart grow fonder, even when it comes to work."
sagittarius,2017-03-25,"The passion that stirs you originates from a deeply felt place today and you're looking for ways to show your appreciation. Whether you need to make amends with a family member or just tell a close friend how much you care, a joyful Sun-Venus combination in your 5th House of Love makes your heart swell with gratitude. Shine your light brightly; your positivity is a beacon of hope for everyone traveling in your orbit."
capricorn,2017-03-25,"The more softly you speak, the more impact your words will have today. A compassionate tone makes a world of difference when reconciliation is on the agenda, even if you simply feel the need for closure. The people closest to you will respond well to extra time taken to not only bring up matters of the heart, but to phrase them mindfully. Your sincerity is your greatest ally. Leading with vulnerability demonstrates your strength of character."
aquarius,2017-03-25,"Sometimes it's challenging to express your feelings with words for fear of sounding clumsy when it comes to emotional topics. In lieu of writing a poem or singing a song, you may decide that picking out a meaningful gift is a better way to communicate your intentions. However, you might end up agonizing just as much over finding the perfect present as finding the perfect words. It's much simpler than you think; any earnest gesture will suffice as long as it has the power of love behind it."
pisces,2017-03-25,"Your friends are lucky to have you by their side. Always looking for ways to help, you're quick to remind people that they should feel good about themselves. However, you may not be practicing what you preach today as retrograde Venus and the noble Sun align in your 2nd House of Self-Esteem. Subscribing to a victim narrative when it's within your own power to recognize your worth is a disservice. Change your mindset and find new ways to lift yourself up. Heed your own advice and love yourself as much as you love others."
aries,2017-03-26,"A single word can be enough to cause a chain reaction that both starts and ends before you know it. You may feel like you blanked out today, not realizing what you said until the looks on people's faces give you pause. Feigning confidence works sometimes, but you might be inwardly cringing at your improv performance now. However, dwelling on your mistakes will only make you feel worse when nothing can be done to change the past. Learn as you go and watch your tongue more closely in the future."
taurus,2017-03-26,"You're not sure if you can believe what you're hearing as words from a friend spark mental connections that you didn't know existed. It's as if a stick of metaphorical dynamite has been tossed into your mind, blasting a hole in what you thought you knew. However, every ending is also a beginning; abrupt changes tend to reveal new opportunities. A door may open with a bang, but walking through it can take you to wonderful places."
gemini,2017-03-26,"It's as if a flash bulb goes off that ignites your imagination, dazzling you with a brilliant idea about your future. You might wonder why this inspiration has never crossed your mind before, but sharing your epiphany with friends may receive a mixed reception. Be aware that you tend toward delusions of grandeur today, and schemes that seem destined for greatness could look completely different tomorrow. C.S. Lewis wrote, ""What you see and what you hear depends a great deal on where you are standing."""
cancer,2017-03-26,"New information on the job front may make you second guess your course. You don't want to let go of something that has been a constant in your life, but gripping tightly to an ideal that has become brittle will only cause it to crumble faster. Fortunately, when the pieces fall away there might be something even better underneath. Being brave enough to open your eyes when it feels safer to keep them shut is the first step to recovering from an unsettling realization. Reconsidering your options today can set you on an exciting new trajectory at work tomorrow."
leo,2017-03-26,"Casual research into an area of interest could lead you to places you never expected today. You're down the rabbit hole before you know it when brainy Mercury conspires with ingenious Uranus in your 9th House of Big Ideas, rocking your worldview. You're inspired to shout your discoveries from the rooftops, but don't move so fast. Incorporate your findings internally before trying to revolutionize the way others think. Eckhart Tolle teaches, ""The world can only change from within."""
virgo,2017-03-26,"You may be on guard today when a discussion with a close friend takes an unpredictable turn. It could feel as if you're traversing an emotional minefield, unsure of where to step next to prevent detonation. Although you might be mystified by the words and actions of others, yours could be equally befuddled. Instead of adopting an every-man-for-himself approach, work together to seek clarity and foster progress. Steven Anderson said, ""Alone we are smart. Together we are brilliant."""
libra,2017-03-26,"You might do a double take when a close friend blurts out something you didn't see coming. You're likely to react quickly, which could exacerbate an already precarious interaction. Although you don't have a crystal ball to predict the future, checking your ego at the door and being receptive to another person's opinions is the shortest route to resolution. Respect is a two-way street, but often one person has to make the first move."
scorpio,2017-03-26,"Your daily routine isn't so routine today as one thing after another throws a wrench in your plans. The more rigidly you adhere to your list, the more it seems to wiggle away from you. Instead of draining your energy trying to keep it together, find a way to creatively adapt to changing circumstances. You may not complete your agenda in a linear fashion, but there's much to be said for a flexible mindset. John Barrymore said, ""Happiness often sneaks in through a door you didn't know you left open."""
sagittarius,2017-03-26,"There's something irresistible about setting off for an excursion with no idea of your destination. You're confident enough to make it up as you go along when speedy Mercury and reckless Uranus team up in your 5th House of Spontaneity, urging you to ditch your map and hit the road. However, the fast-paced energy may lure out your inner opportunist, causing you to pay no heed to the consequences of your actions. You might think your escapades only affect you, but you could experience regret if you don't tune into the feelings of those around you. Sensitivity is strength."
capricorn,2017-03-26,"It's as if the ground rumbles with each step, and you sense that something is amiss today. But tension with a family member or roommate may peak so quickly that you don't have time to brace for impact. Although you want to avoid an argument if possible, sometimes getting things off your chest must happen one way or another. Try not to stir the pot any more than necessary and proceed with an open mind when listening to someone else's position. Thich Nhat Hanh teaches, ""In true dialogue, both sides are willing to change."""
aquarius,2017-03-26,"Your mind is buzzing with electricity as there seems to be no end to the data available. You're taking it all in as fast as you can, but the information overload may blind you to the way you're communicating with others. Even if your ideas are resplendent now, they might come as a shock to those who are attached to different ideologies. Although it seems urgent to speak up right away, people will be more receptive to a calm and rational delivery. Part of the package of being a trendsetter is that you must patiently wait for the rest of the world to catch up to your brilliance."
pisces,2017-03-26,"You have time and energy to spare today and you're feeling quite generous. However, you may end up agreeing to something hastily, assuming you'll be able to follow through without a hitch. But details are likely to come out of the woodwork only after your consent, which could put you in a pickle. It's prudent to double-check the fine print before you make any commitments, or even hold off until a day when you can ensure your participation won't put a strain on your resources. Decline now rather than disappoint later."
aries,2017-03-27,"You're pleased to find that your vigor has returned just in time to start the week, and you're eager to up your game. It's your job to direct your strength in the most productive way possible when the ardent Aries New Moon activates your 1st House of Self. You're likely to be so zealous that you throw yourself into the first thing that strikes you as relevant. While you're anxious to make the most of the day, you must also think in terms of the long haul instead of rushing toward instant gratification. Do something today that your future self will thank you for."
taurus,2017-03-27,"Your imagination is wide awake and you can't wait to put it to good use. You're convinced that your efforts will result in something marvelous when magical Neptune casts a spell on macho Mars in your sign. Applying your energy now will have effects that outlast the creations you produce while the pioneering Aries New Moon highlights your 12th House of Destiny. You're planting seeds today, whether or not you're aware of it, so make sure your projects are birthed from positive intentions. Stop watering the weeds in your life and start watering the flowers."
gemini,2017-03-27,"There are some considerations that you prefer to leave in the back of your mind for a time when you feel more ready to tackle them. But frittering away today's cosmic gifts to escape into a private fantasy isn't in your best interest, even if doing anything else sounds like too much trouble. You won't regret pulling it together when the passionate Aries New Moon blesses your 11th House of Hopes and Wishes, inviting you to sketch your dreams and create a bold plan to achieve them. You can rest easy once you know you're investing wisely in your future."
cancer,2017-03-27,"You're beginning to realize that yearning isn't enough and you need to give your dreams substance to make them real. Fortunately, the courageous Aries New Moon lands in your 10th House of Ambitions, reigniting your sense of purpose and motivating you to get down to business.

leo,2017-03-27,"There is always more you could learn in this ever-expanding world, but it's time to consolidate your knowledge and transform it into a plan for action. The enterprising Aries New Moon broadens your 9th House of Vision, where conceptual understanding becomes a fuel source for realistic progress. Aldous Huxley wrote, ""Dream in a pragmatic way."" Shoot high enough to push yourself, but low enough to guarantee victory."
virgo,2017-03-27,"It's all too easy to listen selectively when there are matters that seem too complicated to unravel on a normal day. But you have a chance to set things right by choosing a healthier way to cope when the Aries New Moon falls in your 8th House of Intimacy. Although discomfort may be unavoidable when broaching sensitive subjects, everyone will feel better once they understand the complexities of the situation. Nat Turner said, ""Good communication is the bridge between confusion and clarity."""
libra,2017-03-27,"You're willing to go to considerable lengths to keep others happy, but your ability to compromise can be utilized in a more productive manner. Your own needs must factor into the equation when the Aries New Moon galvanizes your 7th House of Others, even if it seems like altruism is the solution. You may find yourself putting your foot down today, fortifying your boundaries or simply reinstating a policy of honesty with someone close to you. A promise of perfection isn't worth as much as a promise you can keep, no matter how small."
scorpio,2017-03-27,"It's tempting to let someone persuade you to indulge in some worldly pleasures today. But you have an obligation as custodian of your own body to take better care of yourself. There's no more time for excuses now that the dauntless Aries New Moon energizes your 6th House of Health. Strengthen your resolve, kick bad habits, and immediately replace them with good ones. However, your plan must be sustainable for you to benefit from it; start slow and finish strong."
sagittarius,2017-03-27,"You're secretly wondering if anyone would care if you flaked on your responsibilities today. You might figure if everyone else pitches in, no one will notice you're missing from the action. Although you could feel invincible when the daring Aries New Moon fires up your 5th House of Play, you're likely to get caught if you skip out on your boss or coworkers. If you just stick to your work until it is finished, your free time will be all that much better. Dorothy Parker wrote, ""Creativity is a wild mind and a disciplined eye."""
capricorn,2017-03-27,"It seems as if things are coming full circle on the home front. There may be remaining static in the air, but happily it can be channeled into a new plan to move forward when the Aries New Moon catalyzes your 4th House of Home and Family. A shift in dynamics could be as simple as giving someone a chance to vent their frustrations or finding creative ways to have more fun with the ones you love. Regardless, it feels good to finally address the issue directly instead of tiptoeing around it. Amma says, ""We are all beads strung together on the same thread of love."""
aquarius,2017-03-27,"You're often so self-sufficient that you honestly forget that there are valuable assets other people can offer you. You may already have a project in mind when the Aries New Moon pulsates in your 3rd House of Information, but the cosmos encourages you to ask a friend to assist you in your new endeavor. You can pull it off if you step out of your research lab every once in a while to get an outside opinion. Expanding your horizons ensures the success of anything you touch."
pisces,2017-03-27,"You're living by the motto, ""if you don't stand for something, you'll fall for anything,"" and you're passionate about letting people know how you feel today. The Aries New Moon in your 2nd House of Values reinvigorates your desire to recommit to your highest priorities, and naturally you want to share your excitement with others. But make sure to verify your sources before you spread the word. Although attitude is important, so are the facts. If you don't do your research now, you may lose credibility; integrity is the name of the game."
aries,2017-03-28,"You're anxious to step into a position of control when something at work needs to get done in a hurry. You're certain you can handle it all on your own, and you're not sure why others are hesitating to let you assume responsibility. But you might not have to redo something you overlooked if you slow down to listen to someone's input today. Taking a little longer and doing your job right is much more satisfying now than nursing your pride. Leaving your ego at the door is the secret to your success."
taurus,2017-03-28,"You know there are important matters that deserve your time, but you don't feel like opening a can of worms today. Even though resistance can be just as unpleasant as change, you're more accustomed to taking your time and you don't want to do anything to rock the boat now. However, there's no reason to shake things up to make meaningful progress. Simply checking in on the status of your thoughts and the reactions of others could be enough to prevent the issue from growing into something unmanageable. Awareness is the first step to transformation."
gemini,2017-03-28,"You may get riled up by an enthusiastic call to action even if you were planning to keep things low key today. You're more sensitive to the needs of your community while the restless Aries Moon strides through your 11th House of Friends, and it's hard to say no when your participation is requested. However, bountiful Jupiter suggests that you find a constructive way to contribute rather than rushing in without knowing what to do. You don't need to have all the answers in order to lend a helping hand."
cancer,2017-03-28,"You want nothing but the essentials today, because you're unwilling to be pulled off course. You're sure that you will earn the respect of someone you admire if you get enough accomplished. Working overtime may be a great way to express your nervous energy, but might not be as effective in winning recognition. Demonstrating the ability to know your limits is more commendable than your willingness to push yourself past exhaustion. Admitting you're human gives others a chance to help you out for a change."
leo,2017-03-28,Overextending your limited energy reserves now will only discourage the pursuit of your dreams. You may be disheartened when you think your goals are too lofty to undertake at this time in your life; but the good news is that you could still make a lot of progress. Breaking things down into bite-size pieces gives you something you can chew on without choking. Embarking on a short journey you can complete with confidence is better than a longer one you have to quit halfway. Success breeds success.
virgo,2017-03-28,"Emotional debts either accrued or owed to you might be growing annoyingly apparent. You may yearn for resolution today, but lack of certainty over who owes what could keep you from bringing the subject up with a close friend. Perhaps it's best to mull over your predicament privately before introducing someone else into the equation. However, avoid building a case in preparation to defend it. Overthinking the situation now only makes matters worse. Release your fear and be open to the possibility of a positive outcome. Your attitude determines your fate."
libra,2017-03-28,"It's prudent to set healthy limits on how much information you're willing to disclose today. However, you may become upset if you feel coerced into talking about something that you're not ready to address. Although discussing your concerns is usually a good idea, a confrontation isn't worth the drama if your emotions are bent out of shape now. Don't only do right by other people; do right by yourself, too."
scorpio,2017-03-28,"It could seem like the more you exercise your work ethic, the less people notice. This probably isn't the case, but that doesn't stop you from feeling unrecognized for your efforts today. Truth be told, the number of tasks crossed off your list may have less impact than the care you take while completing them. Nonetheless, it's wise to lower your expectations of others so you don't end up disappointed. Work for the cause, not the applause."
sagittarius,2017-03-28,"You're loathe to cancel a special event today, but your resources may be needed elsewhere at the moment. Fortunately, you're not out of luck because a change of plans could offer you a much better opportunity than what was originally on your calendar. Although spontaneous gestures can lead to exciting encounters, sometimes staying in with the right person is just as much fun as an extravagant outing. In order to say yes to your priorities, you have to be willing to say no to something else."
capricorn,2017-03-28,"Growing pangs of cabin fever compel you to rearrange your living space. It is gratifying to make a difference by conquering a challenging project, but your zeal may cause you to bite off more than you can chew. Remember that things done by halves will only leave a bad taste in your mouth. You won't be satisfied unless you follow through to the end with whatever you start. Expect less; deliver more."
aquarius,2017-03-28,"Your mind is bouncing off the walls and you're determined to do things in your unique style. However, it's as if your attempts at creativity are being thwarted by unseen forces, prompting you to modify your approach. It's crucial to remember that one day is just a drop in the ocean of time. Trying to carry out your entire agenda covertly is likely to backfire faster than you think. The more attached you are to the outcome, the more unsettling change becomes. Arnold Palmer said, ""The road to success is always under construction."""
pisces,2017-03-28,"Small expenses could accumulate rather quickly today. While it seems like purchasing a specific item will help you accomplish your goals, you may be overestimating your need and underestimating your capacity. Before you waste your resources on more tools for your kit, utilize what you already have at your disposal. If you can tap into your willpower, there won't be any damage done to your wallet."
aries,2017-03-29,"Things start to make more sense and it seems like the answer to your questions was right in front of you all along. It's as if the cosmos hands you a map while brainy Mercury and tactical Saturn work together to carve away unnecessary bulk from your plans. The resulting lightness makes you want to begin your journey right away, but there are parts of your itinerary that still need clarification. Do your research so you get it right the first time. Author Tobias Wolff wrote, ""We are made to persist; that's how we find out who we are."""
taurus,2017-03-29,"You can arrive at a more accurate conclusion on your own than with the help of others today. You have an idea up your sleeve that's beginning to take shape, but you're inclined to keep it close to the chest now. Give yourself permission to wait until your intuition tells you to begin. In the meantime, there's no urgency to push outside your comfort zone. Your energy builds organically when you synchronize with your natural rhythm. Lao Tzu wrote, ""Those who flow as life flows know they need no other force."""
gemini,2017-03-29,"Talking with a friend about your long-term goals helps clarify the details in a cohesive manner. Things seem to be falling into place now, but rather than push for more progress, utilize rational Mercury's support from structured Saturn to crystallize your strategy. Collaborating with others enables you to take your thinking to the next level so you can execute your plan over time. Malcom Gladwell wrote, ""Achievement is talent plus preparation."""
cancer,2017-03-29,"It's as if the filter between your thoughts and your spoken words is made of a fine mesh today, enabling you to remain on topic without feeling restricted. It's easier to weed out distractions and stay on task when your duties are a satisfying outlet for your emotional expression. Listen to your instincts to know when to push forward and when to call it quits. Channel your productive energy into your work early so you can enjoy guilt-free recreational time later with your friends."
leo,2017-03-29,"An array of potential ventures is spread out before you today, and you wish you could pursue them all. But sometimes paring down and reorganizing your options is even more constructive than adding more projects to the pile. Persistent Saturn trines nimble Mercury in your 9th House of Ideas, encouraging you to narrow your focus and refine one of your existing innovations. Salvador Dali said, ""No masterpiece was ever created by a lazy artist."""
virgo,2017-03-29,"Just like your living space needs to be swept and mopped regularly, your mind could use a spring cleaning now. A favorable trine between disciplined Saturn and analytical Mercury in your 8th House of Self-Analysis is like wiping the dust off of the window to your psyche. A willingness to get your hands dirty enables you to arrive at a greater transparency with yourself and reach a better understanding about your emotional status. Once you finish your mental purging, there's more room for bigger and better thoughts."
libra,2017-03-29,"Adopting a no-frills and no-strings-attached approach is the most efficient way to communicate your thoughts today. Although you're prepared to do whatever is required to persuade someone to see things your way, you won't need to jump through any hoops if you stick to the facts. Let go of your worries and give it to them straight; keeping your message short and sweet guarantees it will be heard."
scorpio,2017-03-29,"You're whistling while you work today, and it's almost as if you're operating with twice the efficiency. You're looking for more things to do since you're actually running out of loose ends to tie up. Luckily, finishing your list early gives you time to channel some of your productivity into setting yourself up for success in the days ahead. You'll be glad you did once the end of the day rolls around and you're putting your feet up in the company of your favorite people. Dave Ramsey said, ""Contentment is both the fruit and the tree."""
sagittarius,2017-03-29,"You're looking for entertainment of a different sort; your mind needs the kind of exercise that only playful competition provides. Thankfully, laying out a plan for a larger project feels like a game while calculating Saturn collaborates with discerning Mercury in your 5th House of Fun. But don't roll the dice just yet; it's better to sort out all the moving parts before launching an exciting new enterprise. Yogi Berra said, ""You don't have to swing hard to hit a home run. If you got the timing, it'll go."""
capricorn,2017-03-29,"It's as if you stumble upon the lost-and-found box in your own mind today. Forgotten ideas return, ready to be dusted off and put back into action. However, some old thought patterns may have lost relevance over time; they need to be tossed out and replaced. Happily, your skills of discrimination are honed to a fine point now, creating an excellent time to separate the wheat from the chaff. One person's junk is another person's treasure."
aquarius,2017-03-29,"You're not a big fan of the rules unless you make them yourself. Fortunately, the how-to manual is yours to write when traditional Saturn turns cerebral Mercury into a mastermind. But you may outwit yourself if you're not careful to prepare for more than just the immediate concerns. Temper your intellectual adrenaline with methodical pacing so you can handle multiple contingencies. A Chinese proverb states, ""A wise man adapts himself to circumstances as water shapes itself to the vessel that contains it."""
pisces,2017-03-29,"Your perceptions are sharp today and you can see past the obstructions that usually impede them. It's easier to gain clarity on how to optimize your budget when strict Saturn aligns with mercantile Mercury in your 2nd House of Money. Whether you're paying bills or searching for ways to stretch your cash further, sit down and put your figures in order before it's too late. Just make sure to set aside discretionary funds for enjoyment. Author Chris Brogan wrote, ""The goal isn't more money. The goal is living life on your terms."""
aries,2017-03-30,"Striving to earn your keep makes you feel good about yourself today, but your work ethic can turn into a power trip if you don't maintain a humble perspective. Although an obstinate Moon-Mars conjunction in your 2nd House of Self-Worth bulks up your ego, someone you respect may call out your authoritarian attitude. Your ambitions often pull you away from meaningful relationships, but no amount of professional achievement will replace the emotional growth you can experience by sharing your success with those you love."
taurus,2017-03-30,"While adaptability is often a useful trait, your infamous stubbornness could prove to be an even more valuable asset today. You're no stranger to sticking to your word, but if your list of rules is more like a restrictive belief system, it may be adversely affecting your health now. Consider ditching your devotion to a paradigm and putting your own personal wellbeing back at the top of your list."
gemini,2017-03-30,"You're the happiest when you are free to flit from one activity to another, gathering experiences at your fancy. You can imagine all sorts of things you would love to put your heart into while the leisurely Taurus Moon plods through your 12th House of Fantasy. But sometimes you secretly doubt if any of your creative efforts make a difference. Your homework is to find ways to allow your authentic self to blossom without restraint. The only feeling stronger than the fear of failure is fear of success."
cancer,2017-03-30,"You covet quality time spent with your circle of friends today because you could use some steady support. You may be grappling with a relationship issue now, and as much as you try to envision living up to what seems like a demanding standard, you're not sure if it's possible. However, leaning on your buddies for encouragement can help remind you of your emotional resilience. Remembering who you really are renews your faith in yourself."
leo,2017-03-30,"You may wonder why the actions that once earned you recognition from your peers seem to no longer have the same effect. You're called to recognize how much you've grown beyond your old patterns when expansive Jupiter clashes with powerhouse Pluto in your 6th House of Routine. Small changes in your daily habits can add up to big rewards as long as you remain open-minded. Author Bernie Siegel wrote, ""Embrace each challenge in your life as an opportunity for self-transformation."""
virgo,2017-03-30,"You can't help but feel a twinge of longing when you dream about your future prospects. Unfortunately, you may not think you have the right stuff to make your vision a reality. However, the dynamic Jupiter-Pluto square encourages you to believe in your abilities, even when your goals seem unreachable. Creatively reframing how you see yourself in a larger context will help you focus on the journey of becoming rather than the distance between you and your ideal destination. You can be both a masterpiece and a work in progress at the same time."
libra,2017-03-30,"It's not easy to understand your feelings today and you may choose to ignore them instead. However, you could just be creating a pit of emotional quicksand by struggling to keep your worries at arm's length. Stop resisting the inevitable and face your demons so limiting beliefs won't have the same hold they once did. Identifying the root of your fears takes away their power. Follow Eleanor Roosevelt's advice, ""Do one thing every day that scares you."""
scorpio,2017-03-30,"You might end up in a heated exchange with someone close to you today. You don't want to back down when you know you're in the right, but chances are the other person is just as adamant as you are now. If you take the low road, you're bound to wind up regretting your journey. Instead, loosen your grip and pursue the moral high ground, even if you feel like you're missing out on a good argument. Some people create their own storms, and then get upset when it rains."
sagittarius,2017-03-30,"Your obligations weigh you down now when you would rather be fighting the good fight for a conviction that really matters. However, there's more to participating in a social cause than your public persona. Developing your own sense of moral integrity and personal responsibility is just as important as being on the front lines. Growing into your highest potential enables you to be a powerful warrior for your beliefs."
capricorn,2017-03-30,"You're known for your resilience, and you're apt to put it to the test today just to see how far you can go. But you may not realize that what seems like a healthy ambition to you may be perceived as overly aggressive by others. Your obstinacy can be a blessing in disguise, but you could benefit from taking a more generous approach when it comes to relationships. Although your determination earns you respect, graciousness earns you the admiration you seek."
aquarius,2017-03-30,"It could seem like there are invisible boundaries in place that confine you to a certain path now, even when you do your best to abolish ignorance at every turn. Your love of learning is no secret, but when high-minded Jupiter in your 9th House of Philosophy argues with shadowy Pluto, there are some factors that are beyond cognitive understanding. Although this may be mildly infuriating for an intellectual type, the sooner you can embrace life's mysteries, the more you will be at peace. Picasso said, ""The hidden harmony is better than the obvious."""
pisces,2017-03-30,"There are few greater joys than being fully recognized by someone you love. However, conveying your intentions isn't always that easy and you could feel like you don't have what it takes to make someone happy today. However, the emotional dynamics are too complicated for any one person to accept the blame. Although it's wise to consider your role in the larger picture, there is much nuance when it comes to intimate relationships. Take responsibility for your own emotional state before expending energy trying to change anyone else's."
aries,2017-03-31,"You don't want to take anyone's word for anything today. You must verify the facts and see the evidence with your own eyes. While you're quick to gather data now that the nimble Gemini Moon is in your 3rd House of Information, you need a bit longer to digest what you learn. Fortunately, you can turn a jumble of bits and pieces into a useful set of knowledge as long as you don't rush the process. You will know when the time is right once everything falls into place."
taurus,2017-03-31,"You may finally decide to show your hand today. Although you want to play your cards right, it's not your style to make the first move. Perhaps it makes more sense to share your strategy with a confidant before committing to a course of action. Whatever you choose, you want to do it right the first time; you can't just push the undo button in real life. Unfortunately, bluffing your way through an interaction might cause you to lose the game. Neil Armstrong said, ""There can be no great accomplishment without risk."""
gemini,2017-03-31,"You're more emotionally sensitive today and you prefer to avoid any long and drawn out discussions. In fact, the witty retorts you usually keep on hand seem fewer in number now. Your words fail to express your deeper feelings when your key planet Mercury drifts into your 12th House of Destiny, encouraging introspection over connection. You may even get a peek at unpublished chapters of your story as you explore the hallways of your imagination. Dieter Uchtdorf wrote, ""The desire to create is one of the deepest yearnings of the human soul."""
cancer,2017-03-31,"You would love to call it quits early in the day so you can let your mind float in and out of fantasies at your leisure. However, it's nearly impossible to capture your feelings with words and your most vivid ideas lose their sparkle when you try to share them with your friends. But don't worry if you can't translate the images from your imagination into language just yet. What matters the most is that you cultivate your inspiration and let it feed your heart."
leo,2017-03-31,"It's odd that as the weekend approaches you should start to feel more serious about your work. But that may be exactly what happens as shrewd Mercury strides into your 10th House of Career, urging you to consider the concrete steps that must be taken to achieve your professional aims. Your dramatic speaking skills garner the attention of associates and superiors. However, don't forget that you need dependable connections just as much as oratory excellence. Building your network as you build your plan for advancement is a winning combination."
virgo,2017-03-31,"It's as if you're stepping out of the shadows and into the light, where you can clearly see the landscape and the myriad of paths before you. You're ready to methodically explore various prospects in search of the best way to manifest your dreams when your key planet Mercury moves into your 9th House of Future Vision. However, you're not blind to the hard work that also awaits you. Fortunately, there's no one better suited to the task; put your natural talents to work right away so you can enjoy the fruits of your labor even sooner."
libra,2017-03-31,"Always the limber conversationalist, your mind stretches into a different direction today when your thoughts lead you to more profound places. You're interested in ferreting out the deeper meaning as Mercury the Messenger descends into your 8th House of Transformation, lighting the way to increased self-awareness. However, your sociability is still in play; you're likely to keep your friendly exterior and only share your innermost discoveries with those closest to you. Actress Emma Watson quipped, ""The less you reveal, the more people can wonder."""
scorpio,2017-03-31,"Although your feelings are complicated, you don't have to speak in metaphors to make your point today. In fact, keeping your message simple increases the odds of engaging in a meaningful conversation. After all, you don't want to sacrifice the truth for the sake of expediency. Being honest is the first step to creating a stronger emotional bond. Ultimately, it's not distance that keeps people apart, but the lack of communication."
sagittarius,2017-03-31,"Normally, you're more than happy to go along with a friend on a little adventure. But today you're strangely aware of your looming responsibilities, making it difficult to say yes and feel good about it. Listen to your conscience; it's best to politely decline now and get to work. It's surprisingly gratifying to delay the fun while you dig into the list of chores you typically avoid. French author Gustave Flaubert wrote, ""Pleasure is found first in anticipation, later in memory."""
capricorn,2017-03-31,"Although you might already have big plans for the weekend, more appealing ideas begin to take shape today. Perhaps it's been too long since you did something nice just for yourself, yet fleet-footed Mercury tempts you to follow your bliss as the Trickster flies into your 5th House of Play. Giving your brain another activity to focus on broadens your horizons and improves your attitude. Albert Einstein wrote, ""Creativity is intelligence having fun."""
aquarius,2017-03-31,"You're looking forward to taking a break from the serious side of life. You're up for just about anything when the playful Gemini Moon dances into your 5th House of Recreation, but you're still stashing away thoughts and ideas to revisit later. There seems to be no end to your intellectual savvy today as you impress your friends by explaining complex concepts in a way that hits home for everyone. Your lighthearted demeanor makes you the life of the party. Groucho Marx said, ""If you're not having fun, you're doing something wrong."""
pisces,2017-03-31,"Sometimes the best cure for a restless mind is a quiet night in. However, if you leave yourself with nothing much to do now, your jitters could get the best of you. Wordy Mercury moves into your 3rd House of Writing, inviting you to reacquaint yourself with your journal or your blog. Letting your thoughts spill onto the page is cathartic, and there may be some clever gems hidden in between your numerous recollections. William Faulkner wrote, ""If a story is in you, it has got to come out."""
aries,2017-04-01,"A sense of panic hangs right at the edge of your awareness. You're curious about the source but don't want to feed it any energy. You might feel as if an opportunity for personal growth is passing you by and you could miss your chance if you don't take action now. Nevertheless, you know better than to strike before the iron is hot. Don't let your impulsive reaction spoil your chances of finding lasting happiness. Leo Tolstoy wrote, ""The two most powerful warriors are patience and time."""
taurus,2017-04-01,"You might have trouble expressing your feelings today, but no one will realize it because kind platitudes seem to roll off your tongue. Your words have heightened impact while the glib Gemini Moon harmonizes with propitious Jupiter. But all this cheerful energy prevents you from being in touch with your real emotions, especially if they are pulling you into deeper and darker spaces. There's no need to pretend everything is okay when it's not, especially in the company of those you trust. Remember, if you never get lost, you have no chance of being found."
gemini,2017-04-01,"It's hard to sit still and do nothing today, making it extremely easy to start a project or two. Unfortunately, sticking with a task until it's finished is much more challenging now that the Moon is in your fickle sign. In fact, whatever happens in your immediate environment seems like another excuse to ignore your work and explore something new. But leaving loose ends everywhere you go only leads to a feeling of frustration by the end of the day. Starve your distraction; feed your focus."
cancer,2017-04-01,"Everyone thinks you're being overly efficient today, but you know better. Although your thoughts may be running amok, you can keep them contained enough so they don't negatively impact your activities. But appearing calm on the surface requires psychic energy and your emotional defenses could flag as the day wears on. Nevertheless, it's still worth the effort to maintain your composure for the sake of progress. Grenville Kleiser wrote, ""By constant self-discipline and self-control you can develop greatness of character."""
leo,2017-04-01,"You long to be the center of attention, but you can take your extroverted behavior too far today. Your big ideas drive you to share them with others, but your plans don't sound as feasible once they are spoken aloud. Part of the problem may stem from the fact that more details are needed and you might come across as if your head is in the clouds. Nevertheless, you're more grounded than others realize when it comes to your aspirations. Work in silence; let your success be your noise."
virgo,2017-04-01,"You may try to assert your authority by reclaiming your power, but you're more productive today being part of a team than its leader. Although you have a viable plan, the more you try to impose it on those around you, the more they will resist. Nevertheless, when you temporarily set your agenda aside and cheerfully cooperate with your friends or coworkers, others will naturally look to you for guidance. Author Robyn Benincasa wrote, ""You don't inspire your teammates by showing them how amazing you are. You inspire them by showing them how amazing they are."""
libra,2017-04-01,"Everyone seems to have things to do and places to go. Meanwhile, you're content to aimlessly dream about your future without necessarily expending much energy today. Although you may be looking forward to some downtime, it's all too easy to get caught up in someone's excitement only to find yourself busier than you intended. Offering to help is one thing, but sacrificing your entire day is something else. More caution in the beginning decreases the need to use your emergency brakes later on."
scorpio,2017-04-01,"Your to-do list is extensive today as you optimistically attempt to finish several projects that are near completion. Unfortunately, there might not be enough time to complete everything on your plate. Luckily, there's no reason to panic over a self-imposed deadline. Scaling back your intentions makes sense if you understand that it actually helps you accomplish more, not less. Setting realistic goals is nearly as important now as working hard to achieve them."
sagittarius,2017-04-01,"Your optimism sets the tone for a spectacular day, and you may not even be all that surprised when your fantasies start turning into reality. But don't push your luck too far today, or you might not be able to find your way home. Fortunately, observing the fine line between just enough and too much is your ticket to satisfaction now. Pursue your dreams, for they are the guiding hands of your heart, but bring along your common sense just in case."
capricorn,2017-04-01,"Although you often excel at choosing a destination and sticking with a specific course until you arrive, today's cosmic energy presents you with a dilemma. You have multiple goals in your sites yet might be unable to focus on any one of them for very long. Unfortunately, this uncharacteristic ambivalence could temporarily put your dreams out of reach. Instead of working yourself into a frenzy of frustration now, follow your whims without worrying about your accomplishments. Idle pursuits cultivate a fertile imagination."
aquarius,2017-04-01,"You might be gleefully anticipating a day off, only to be confronted by one interruption after another. People are speaking with a sense of urgency about their problems today, and you may feel obliged to drop your agenda of rest and relaxation in order to help a friend in need. Your kindness is admirable and won't go unnoticed. Nevertheless, your heart won't be happy until you find time to nurture your inner child. Serve first, play later."
pisces,2017-04-01,"There are lots of things to do around the house and you can't decide where to jump in. Oddly enough, you're not overwhelmed by the choices as it is nice to have all these options available today. But there is a potential danger in having so many alternatives that you end up wasting your time trying to pick the right one to pursue. Shifting your frame of reference empowers you with the knowledge that your path is created by the priorities you establish now. Psychologist Leo Buscaglia wrote, ""The person who risks nothing does nothing."""
aries,2017-04-02,"Issues of self-doubt step out of the shadows if you run into an obstacle that stops you in your tracks today. However, a current delay gives you time to reexamine your methods and make necessary modifications. Although you might not want to focus on the details, the cosmos is offering you a chance to improve your game. Remain open to the feedback you receive from the complex circumstances you face now, but don't change your long-term goals just because the going gets tough. Arianna Huffington said, ""Failure isn't the opposite of success; it's part of success."""
taurus,2017-04-02,"Sometimes your commitment to fulfilling your obligations is readily apparent by watching you at work. Your one-track mind is a wonder to behold; distractions don't seem to affect your determination. However, people might mistakenly think you are being lazy today, when in fact you are regrouping and preparing for your next round of observable progress. Joyce Meyer teaches, ""Patience is not simply the ability to wait; it's how we behave while we're waiting."""
gemini,2017-04-02,"Although you're a natural when it comes to keeping busy, sometimes it's necessary to step back from all the hustle and bustle in order to gain a new perspective on your life. Sadly, good intentions aren't enough to keep you in motion today; you might feel as if you are hitting a wall and no amount of extra effort will make a difference. Shifting into a contemplative mode now is not a sign of defeat, but rather one of intelligence. Apoorve Dubey wrote, ""Silence is the music of wisdom."""
cancer,2017-04-02,"You might have plans for a peaceful day of rest and relaxation, but pressing circumstances require you to assume responsibility rather than avoid it. Thankfully, you're capable of evaluating the current dynamics and taking necessary action before things grow out of hand. If you fall into the trap of silence when there's something to be said or done today, it will be more difficult later on to get what you want. Elton John said, ""Live for each second without hesitation."""
leo,2017-04-02,"You may be licking your emotional wounds today as you replay recent social events in your mind's eye. Thankfully, pulling back into your private space enables you to see things from a different angle, shifting your role from that of a victim in someone else's drama into the star of your own show. Seeking refuge while the Moon visits your 12th House of Inner Peace is a perfect way to feed your spirit and cultivate your resiliency. Marcus Aurelius wrote, ""Nowhere can man find a quieter or more untroubled retreat than in his own soul."""
virgo,2017-04-02,"Being a cog in a larger set of gear works might upset someone who is insecure and needs individual acknowledgment. However, you're happy to see the spotlight shining on others as long as you feel as if you're contributing to the greater whole. But finding satisfaction in the accomplishments of a group won't be enough to satisfy your long-term ambitions. Luckily, this is a win-win situation if you're willing to play both ends of the spectrum. Bask in your anonymity now while you plot a path toward personal success."
libra,2017-04-02,"Thinking about your place in the outer world is more of a mental exercise today than a practical one. Although you don't need to take direct action yet, having additional time before committing to a final decision makes it easier to consider all your options carefully now. In fact, you're not even required to share your process while you fantasize about your future. Luxuriate in the freedom of stretching your imagination. Creating the world you want starts in your mind."
scorpio,2017-04-02,"You're tired of being the responsible one, especially if you must demonstrate your commitment to pragmatism one more time today. Although this may not be your regular modus operandi, current circumstances are requiring you to keep your feet on solid ground. Nevertheless, nothing can prevent you from exploring your fantasies as long as you maintain outer appearances. Thankfully, living in two worlds seems natural now, enabling you to nourish your dreams while also fulfilling your mundane obligations."
sagittarius,2017-04-02,"Although you may swing into action early in the day with high hopes of tying up loose ends around the house, you might lose momentum once you encounter an unexpected obstacle. It's not that you're unable to overcome a problem or two; it's just that you aren't interested in working so hard today. Fortunately, you can get away with some well-deserved relaxation while the reflective Cancer Moon moves through your 8th House of Regeneration. Remember, honoring the ebbs and flows of your energy cycles vastly improves your chances of success."
capricorn,2017-04-02,"People in your immediate environment may be the cause of emotional conflict today, but you're not interested in feeding into any dramas. In fact, you're likely to withdraw if you encounter someone's dissatisfaction now, instead of facing the music and searching for a solution. Unfortunately, acting like an ostrich and burying your head in the sand will only prolong the tension. The sooner you address uncomfortable dynamics, the quicker you'll be able to enjoy the rest of your day. Meister Eckhart wrote, ""The price of inaction is far greater than the cost of making a mistake."""
aquarius,2017-04-02,"You love the idea of running around today, whether you're doing chores or just amusing yourself with one distraction after another. However, you grow weary of staying in motion and long to find a comfortable place to rest after the self-protective Cancer Moon seeks solace in your 6th House of Logistics. Slowing down means that you won't be as productive, but it's a price you're willing to pay now. Instead of judging yourself by how far you still must go, celebrate how far you've already come."
pisces,2017-04-02,"It's as if you are flying past a deadline today and you belatedly realize that you're far behind schedule. Oddly enough, you might be secretly relieved that you no longer need to pretend that you'll accomplish the impossible. But this is not about failure, for the extra time you gain now makes all the difference in the world. You are being granted a reprieve to create something special, rather than trying to slap together a finished product just to meet someone else's deadline. Coach Vince Lombardi said, ""Perfection is not attainable, but if we chase perfection, we can catch excellence."""
aries,2017-04-03,"It's as if someone turned up the volume on your emotions today, but you don't want the entire world to know about your uncharacteristic sensitivity. You're afraid that you could appear weak if people thought you were uncertain about your choices. However, it's not very productive if you end up putting more energy into hiding your doubts than into the tasks at hand. Honesty is your fastest route to moving forward. Mark Twain said, ""If you tell the truth, you don't have to remember anything."""
taurus,2017-04-03,"Although your intuition is functioning at a very high level today, you still prefer working with verifiable data. But don't be too quick to dismiss a hunch, even if you can't substantiate it with a shred of facts. The receptive Cancer Moon in your 3rd House of Communication acts like a radio tuning into signals that are coming from unidentifiable broadcast stations. Your extrasensory perceptions are on point now, so trust what you feel in your gut, whether or not you can justify your sources. Sonia Choquette  wrote, ""Your sixth sense should be your first sense."""
gemini,2017-04-03,"Financial limitations can drag their negative consequences into other parts of your life today. For example, concerns about a lack of cash on hand may prompt you to decline an invitation to a social event. But your fear of missing out could foster feelings of low self-esteem now. Don't turn unexpressed emotions inward where they might do real damage; instead, share your process with a trustworthy friend and listen closely to the sage advice you receive. John Locke wrote, ""What worries you, masters you."""
cancer,2017-04-03,"You might respond to a moral dilemma at work by remaining quiet and hoping the ill winds will blow by quickly. However, your silence does not indicate a lack of a viable plan; it only reveals your fear of potential rejection. You are worried that the support you need could fall short of your expectations once you go out on a limb. But inaction is a luxury you can't afford. Albert Einstein wrote, ""The world is a dangerous place to live; not because of the people who are evil, but because of the people who don't do anything about it."""
leo,2017-04-03,"It takes so little effort to put on a good show today that people assume you're doing fine on your own. But you're navigating through some very tricky emotional territory, and every ounce of concentration may be required to get you over this rough patch. Luckily, you are likely to receive cosmic help from other dimensions while dreamy Neptune kisses the Moon in your 12th House of Spiritual Mystery. Rumi wrote, ""This universe is not outside of you. Look inside yourself; everything that you want, you already are."""
virgo,2017-04-03,"You're not necessarily the most vocal one in your group, but you still have something very important to say today. Everyone could seem so busy that they have no time to listen to you. Your message needs to be heard sooner than later, but the words get stuck in your throat when you start to talk. You may choose to remain quiet, even if you know you should do your part by sharing your feelings. Unfortunately, there's no time to wallow; speak now or forever hold your peace."
libra,2017-04-03,"It might feel as if others are pushing you around today, but you don't have to play second fiddle to someone else just because he or she is issuing orders. There are those times when it's in your best interest to maintain harmony by acquiescing to the group. But you know exactly what needs to be done now as the nurturing Cancer Moon moves through your 10th House of Authority. Instead of suffering fools, step up to the plate and take charge. Act like the kind of leader you would want to follow."
scorpio,2017-04-03,"You could be quite tenacious today, clinging to a cherished dream in spite of it seeming unattainable. However, miracles do happen and your extra efforts might be the tipping point. Nevertheless, your obsessive drive may lead to frustration if you're not willing to adjust your goals as dictated by reality. It's a tricky dance you must do now with one foot in your imagination and the other one on solid ground. The good news is that enigmatic Scorpions are at their best when operating in multiple dimensions."
sagittarius,2017-04-03,"You can see beyond someone's negativity today and right into the heart of the matter. You don't even need to hear the whole story; you know the score and swiftly create a winning strategy that shifts the energy. However, you might lack the patience to stick with your plan, especially if you expect immediate results. Nevertheless, Napoleon Hill wrote, ""Most great people have attained their greatest success just one step beyond their greatest failure."""
capricorn,2017-04-03,"Your straightforward communication isn't nearly as clear as you believe it to be today. The proof that your messages are muddled is observable in the puzzled responses of those around you. If others seem reserved or even withdrawn, they probably are busy trying to figure out what you want. Instead of blaming anyone else for his or her lack of enthusiasm over your plan, head back to the drawing board and find a creative way to present your ideas. Don't change your destination, just modify your method for getting there."
aquarius,2017-04-03,"You hope to retreat to your office and work in relative silence today, removed from the distracting noise of your friends and associates. But your escape isn't a simple matter now because you might miss the adrenaline rush as soon as everything settles down. Thankfully, you don't need to eliminate the exciting hustle and bustle of your life in order to find enough peace and quiet to do your job. Author Susan Gale wrote, ""Sometimes, when two worlds collide, a better one is created."""
pisces,2017-04-03,"You could work with such a passionate intent today that you inadvertently close yourself off in a creative bubble. All seems copacetic at first, until your productivity begins to falter. Finding your way back into the social network you left behind can be more complicated than you think. Coming to grips with your isolation is tougher when you remember that you did it to yourself. Nevertheless, the path to enlightenment is often walked alone. Terence McKenna said, ""The cost of sanity in this society is a certain level of alienation."""
aries,2017-04-04,"One inner voice tells you to do it while another voice yells stop. Although you clearly understand the reason for caution, you're still likely to go ahead with your plan -- whether or not it's a good idea. The problem is that logic won't lead you to a sensible resolution today. Nevertheless, don't give up; continue to aim toward your goal even if you need to retreat prior to your next push forward. Believe it or not, uneven progress is better than none at all."
taurus,2017-04-04,"An overdose of enthusiasm is particularly troublesome for you slow-and-steady Bulls today. But it's nearly impossible to avoid the effects of overblown Jupiter when it increases your confidence so much that you believe you can do anything. Unfortunately, you may disappoint your coworkers when you bump up against limitations of time, energy or resources. Don't wait until difficult circumstances require you to address your miscalculation. Reassess your commitments early in the day so you can take preemptive measures and readjust expectations as soon as possible."
gemini,2017-04-04,"You're more interested in the act of creation today than you are in fulfilling your professional responsibilities. It's as if you have a duty to yourself to step outside your normal routine and make something original. Unfortunately, your peers might not be enamored with your unconventional choices. Training your mind to see the good in every situation bends the odds for success in your favor. But ignoring potential problems stretches the odds too far and sets up the potential for failure. Muhammad Ali Jinnah said, ""Expect the best, prepare for the worst."""
cancer,2017-04-04,"A quick and easy way to stabilize your mood swings is to relentlessly work toward making your dreams come true. Your perspective changes and your emotions begin to settle down when you are focusing on the potential of the future. Nevertheless, asking others for feedback is especially useful since you can still misread someone's intentions when it comes to your plans. Get as many people involved in your project as possible. Many hands lighten the work for all."
leo,2017-04-04,"There is a method to your madness as you attempt to keep everyone's emotions at bay. You believe that discussing your feelings is an obvious trap that distracts you from the serious work at hand. Thankfully, the cautious Cancer Moon's current visit to your 12th House of Privacy makes it easy to remain silent while still appearing sympathetic. French author Eliphas Levi wrote, ""Weak people talk and do not act, strong people act and keep quiet."""
virgo,2017-04-04,"Social activities may be on the calendar today, but you aren't sure you can afford the time or money that's required for your participation. Naturally, saying no would be the smart thing to do, but you're confident that you can be in two places at the same time. Unfortunately, your inflationary thinking could draw you into a group project that distracts you from your personal pursuits. Abdul Kalam said, ""To succeed in your mission, you must have single-minded devotion to your goal."""
libra,2017-04-04,"You want to dig in your heels today and resist change, especially if others are pushing you to take a chance. You tend to prefer the sure bet now that militant Mars is visiting sensible Taurus. However, optimistic Jupiter offers you an amazing array of future opportunities. The choice is yours; you can continue to vacillate or you can seek that sweet spot between the extremes that allows both personal progress and emotional safety. Rumi wrote, ""The middle path is the way to wisdom."""
scorpio,2017-04-04,"You might wish a friend or partner would lighten up a little today, especially if they seem to be perpetually insistent about getting their way. You understand the passion involved when someone has an agenda, since you're often the one with the non-negotiable goals. However, you must cover a bit of tricky territory now and you need all the help you can get. Don't be afraid to acquiesce to another person's plan. But make sure there is a quid pro quo arrangement in place. Compromise only exists when both parties give and take."
sagittarius,2017-04-04,"Nothing will deter you from fulfilling your ambitions once your mind is set. Your key planet Jupiter is expanding the energy of your 11th House of Dreams and Wishes, but action-hero Mars in plodding Taurus tells your story at a slower pace. Your goals are more practical now and nature won't let you build your case on a wing and a prayer. Demonstrating your willingness to work hard is essential if you want to achieve your dreams. Martial artist Bruce Lee said, ""Long-term consistency trumps short-term intensity."""
capricorn,2017-04-04,"You don't like surprises when you're already on a path with a specific destination. You recently made your numerous calculations and narrowed your choice down to one; now you're happily heading toward the bright horizon. However, everything suddenly seems more complicated today when you realize you might not be able to maintain the rigorous pace. Some people succeed because it is their destiny. But most people are successful because of their unwavering determination. Winners never quit and quitters never win."
aquarius,2017-04-04,"Nothing is holding back your imagination now, freeing you to explore the outer edges of possibilities life has to offer. But just because you dream something today doesn't mean you can turn your fantasies into reality. In fact, you may grow frustrated when personal responsibilities prevent you from experimenting with something new. Don't let your annoyance morph into hot anger or cold resentment. A bad attitude is like a flat tire; if you don't change it, you'll never go anywhere."
pisces,2017-04-04,"Of course, you want to be recognized for your contributions on the job but you continue to work hard now even if you feel slighted. In fact, you will likely apply yourself with more zeal once you realize that your efforts are going unnoticed. However, admiration is most powerful when it's working in both directions. Undoubtedly, one of the greatest gifts you can give anyone is a heart-felt expression of gratitude for being part of your life. Voltaire wrote, ""Appreciation is a wonderful thing; it makes what is excellent in others belong to us as well."""
aries,2017-04-05,"You are a force to be reckoned with wherever you go  now, and you believe there's very little that can get in your way. Your rise in confidence is less a statement of your ego than the result of your profound connection to a deeper source of meaning. Although the fiery Leo Moon harmonizes with the radiant Sun in your 1st House of Self, it's the invincible Mars-Pluto combo that makes you an undeniable winner. Remember, you didn't wake up today to be mediocre."
taurus,2017-04-05,"Your unwavering resolve might be the key to putting things back on track today. You have an opportunity to shift the dynamics professionally, especially if you recently promised more than you could deliver or fell short of someone's expectations. But you won't get something for nothing; you must stay focused on your goal and be relentless in your pursuit of completion. An intense burst of effort now is worth a bit of exhaustion later. Anne Frank wrote, ""Laziness may appear attractive, but work gives satisfaction."""
gemini,2017-04-05,"Making changes that endure isn't always as straightforward as it seems; your attention shifts and what was important one day may abruptly drop off your radar screen the next. Fortunately, there is cosmic superglue at work today, enabling a modification to your daily routine to become a part of your foundation rather than just a passing whim. Within reasonable limits, you really can do anything you imagine as long as you persist until you succeed."
cancer,2017-04-05,"You feel invincible because everything you do now furthers your cause without running into resistance.    Powerful allies show up to encourage your dreams today, and you would be wise to ask them to be a part of your team. Warrior Mars in your 11th House of Groups conspires with domineering Pluto, infusing you with a robust air of authority. Using this power for the good of all solidifies your reputation for kindness by leaving waves of positive energy in your wake."
leo,2017-04-05,"You're on a roll today and everything you encounter seems to add a little extra boost to your momentum. Unfortunately, you could be so engrossed with your forward movement that you overlook a co-worker's feelings or ride roughshod over the wishes of those who might be your biggest fans. No goal is so urgent now that you can justify hurting anyone on your quest for success. Winnie the Pooh quipped, ""A little consideration, a little thought for others, makes all the difference."""
virgo,2017-04-05,"Your creativity bubbles up from a very deep well today, bringing thoughts into awareness that could change your life. A monumental idea is given a strong push by perceptive Pluto in your 5th House of Self-Expression. But you must take the next step by telling others about your intuitive vision for a better tomorrow or it will slip back into the recesses of your imagination. Ultimately, power is amplified by sharing knowledge, not by hoarding it."
libra,2017-04-05,"You prefer to work with others now as part of a team on a larger project. Nevertheless, you're unable to let down your guard while the melodramatic Leo Moon in your 11th House of Networks bumps into uncomfortable aspects with four planets. Thankfully, a resourceful Mars-Pluto trine motivates you to prevail today even when facing strong opposition. Educator Sir Ken Robinson says, ""Collaboration is the stuff of growth."""
scorpio,2017-04-05,"Woe be to those who attempt to block your progress today, for you're not likely to be deterred by mere mortals. An inexhaustible trine between your key planets, Mars and Pluto, turns you into an action-hero transformer. If you don't possess the right superpower to overcome an obstacle, you just morph into something else. But you're not interested in wasting energy by demonstrating your capabilities just to put on a show now. Results are all that count."
sagittarius,2017-04-05,"You may lose your sense of purpose, only to uncover a more meaningful mission later in the day. You're normally not one to give up prematurely, but you're tempted to toss in the towel when things don't go your way today. It's been said that quitting because of a setback is like slashing your other three tires after finding the first one flat. Tenacity is your friend. Rumi advises, ""Live your life as if everything is rigged in your favor."""
capricorn,2017-04-05,"There's no reason to treat your current situation as normal since everything you do has wider ramifications than you are aware of now. You're willing to work long hours when you see the potential for a positive outcome. Everyone knows that once you make up your mind, you put your heart and soul into reaching your goals. But spend a little time reassessing what motivates you. Satisfaction is within reach if you can stay true to your original intentions. Success without integrity is failure."
aquarius,2017-04-05,"You are as steady as a rock today and people close to you feel like you are an effective anchor in the midst of a storm. However, you may find that playing the role of the dependable one grows too restrictive over time. Fortunately, honoring your priorities allows you to plot your own trajectory while also being present for someone else's benefit. Freeing your imagination is the first step toward freeing the rest of your life."
pisces,2017-04-05,"Creating a tight agenda for the day is only one piece of the puzzle needed to manifest your hopes and dreams. In fact, willful Mars teams up with dark Pluto to channel news clips from the Underworld. Inexplicably, sharing your highly opinionated perspective doesn't scare others off. Instead, your friends stand by ready to support your efforts as you forge a new path to success. If you are persistent, you are likely to receive the respect and admiration you seek. If you are consistent, you'll keep it."
aries,2017-04-06,"You might be puzzled today when you realize that your plans are not unfolding as quickly as expected. It's not that you encounter a serious setback; it's just that you're beginning to understand the overly ambitious scope of your objectives. Nevertheless, don't lower your goals or narrow your vision. Instead, reconsider your schedule and give yourself as much time as you need to complete your current project. Ultimately, you are judged by what you finish, not by what you start."
taurus,2017-04-06,"A sinking feeling in the pit of your stomach arises from your apparent lack of progress today. However, no one has the right to judge your story after only reading the cover notes on your book. Believe it or not, your current uncertainty has an upside because detours can bring you closer to the truth. Nothing is as straightforward as it appears now; not even your intentions. William Blake wrote, ""Improvement makes straight roads, but the crooked roads without improvement are roads of genius."""
gemini,2017-04-06,"Your enthusiasm is not dampened by the logistical problems you face today. You won't allow yourself to lose sight of the big picture, however out of focus it may be now. You fully understand that you are on a trajectory and you're on board for the long-haul. Nevertheless, it's wise to reexamine all your facts, reassess your priorities and recommit to achieving satisfaction. Don't let anyone or anything prevent you from reaching your goals."
cancer,2017-04-06,"You're still riding on the incoming waves of positive energy, but you're starting to fear that it won't last forever. Fortunately, you may be close enough to reaching success that you're not willing to walk away from it now. Nevertheless, you can refresh your attitude and recommit to your relationships by indulging in a healthy dose of gratitude. Count your blessings while you consider the words of Marcel Proust: ""Love is space and time measured by the heart."""
leo,2017-04-06,"Your current superpower is the ability to discern when to push toward your goals and when to kick back and relax. Harmonizing trines from the lively Leo Moon to risk-taking Uranus and reliable Saturn empower you to denounce authority while simultaneously assuming leadership. Although balancing the extremes is a safe strategy, you must be willing to stretch the envelope. Thomas Watson, the founder of IBM, wrote, ""If you want to increase your success rate, double your failure rate."""
virgo,2017-04-06,"You aren't yet ready to round up people to help you bring your master plan to life. Nevertheless, your eyes are peeled for potential allies you can enlist once all the pieces are in place. The best strategy  is to roll up your sleeves now and get down to work. Scheming in advance will only complicate your progress or reduce your effectiveness if you tip your cards too soon. Success is ultimately a matter of positive attitude and proper timing."
libra,2017-04-06,"You intuitively know what must be done to increase your efficiency at work. But knowledge isn't always enough to make a difference, especially if fate appears to be working against you now. Paradoxically, the more you strive to reach a goal, the further away it seems. Thankfully, emotionally detaching yourself from the outcome breaks the spell and disengages you from a frustrating cycle. As Buddha said, ""You only lose what you cling to."""
scorpio,2017-04-06,"Working extra hard isn't a problem for you passionate Scorpios once you make a commitment. Thankfully, your efforts are rewarded today, but you might find it difficult to maintain a consistent pace. Ironically, you can accomplish more now when you take intermittent breaks to clear your head by walking away from your job for a bit. Bill Gates said, ""Success requires the agility and drive to constantly rethink, reinvigorate, react and reinvent."""
sagittarius,2017-04-06,"It's nearly impossible to see the downside of a plan today. In fact, your sunny outlook might enable you to live in a world without any apparent shadows. Needless to say, there is something incomplete about your current perspective and your inability to discern the darkness will likely backfire on you. Naturally, you can't live a positive life with a negative mind. Walt Disney said, ""I always like to look on the optimistic side of life, but I am realistic enough to know that life is a complex matter."""
capricorn,2017-04-06,"Your legendary determination motivates you to logically calculate your odds for success while considering every option. Others might grow weary of the mental gymnastics and find it easier to pick a path and then fine tune their strategies along the way. Nevertheless, you're unwilling to leave anything to chance today. Industrious Saturn's retrograde turn is a reminder that you can take all the time you need before committing to a course of action. The only thing greater than your ambition now is your will to succeed."
aquarius,2017-04-06,"You're not interested in pursuing stale goals; you need to have excitement in your life or you quickly lose interest. Thankfully, adventurous people will enter your world now, offering you the thrills you seek. At first, you might be unsure about letting someone in because you fear a loss of stability. However, adding a dash of uncertainty into the mix also reveals new possibilities. Go ahead and take a risk. If it works out in your favor, you'll be happy. If not, you'll be wiser for the experience. You win either way."
pisces,2017-04-06,"You understand the importance of striking a balance between performance and authenticity today. The showy Leo Moon illuminates your 6th House of Self-Improvement, inspiring you to give the presentation of your life. But you will sound mechanical and boring if you memorize a script. However, if you speak extemporaneously, you could easily forget an important part of your pitch. In the final analysis, mastery of your subject matter is key so your delivery is passionate and persuasive. Pianist Vladimir Horowitz said, ""The difference between ordinary and extraordinary is practice."""
aries,2017-04-07,"These are the cosmic waves you've been waiting for, so grab your metaphorical surfboard and gear up for the action. Opportunistic Jupiter's presence in your 7th House of Partnerships offers you new ways to work with the existing dynamics. But nothing monumental can occur if you fearfully cling to the past; it's up to you to make something amazing happen. Today's dreams become tomorrow's reality if you're willing to do the work."
taurus,2017-04-07,"Everything seems to be falling into place today. However, there's no reason to assume that your good luck will carry you all the way to the top. Your legendary follow-through is arguably more important than making a big move today. Although you're looking forward to personal time over the weekend, pursuing your professional goals is necessary now if you want to generate the best possible outcome. Action always beats intention."
gemini,2017-04-07,"There's an inherent instability in the atmosphere today, but you might choose to ignore it because you want to express your hopes for the future. Although you may feel extra lucky, it's not wise to bet the farm on an emotional hunch. Ironically, you could win big now, but not without paying for your success by leaving a simpler world behind. Instead of losing yourself in philosophical discussions that have no practical use, stick to the facts as you encounter them. The truth will set you free."
cancer,2017-04-07,"A simple mood change could turn your day upside down, pulling you into intriguing and complex relationship dynamics. No matter how positive you are feeling about the future, you are driven to express unresolved feelings for the sake of clearing the air. Meanwhile, professional success seems elusive now, progress slips into the shadows every time you approach it. Temporarily set logic aside and listen to your intuition today; tapping into other dimensions works in your favor."
leo,2017-04-07,"A lack of clear boundaries only leads to more confusion now. Maintaining an open mind and a flexible attitude is essential, but your readiness to entertain everyone else's point of view isn't enough to get you off the hook. It helps to turn down your volume today, especially if you're overly confident in your own abilities. Softening your approach won't make your day any less fun; in fact, it will enable you to find happiness in the long run. Roar less, purr more."
virgo,2017-04-07,"Creative possibilities are blossoming all around you today. But the Moon's visit to your perfectionist sign can be a hook that's loaded with the bait of unrealistic expectations. You might fall into the trap that jolly Jupiter sets in your 2nd House of Values and temporarily lose sight of your convictions. Thankfully, you will soar through this period of excess as long as you are willing to downsize when your resources start to run low. Dream big; act small."
libra,2017-04-07,"Seeing both sides of an argument is not a new dilemma for most fair-minded Libras. However, making a final deliberation is tough when opposing views are equally compelling. Someone else's opinion adds another variable to the mix while  the Sun in your 7th House of Relationships opposes auspicious Jupiter in your sign. Don't hide your true feelings just to avoid the unpleasantness of emotional tension. Tony Robbins says, ""The quality of your communication is the quality of your life."""
scorpio,2017-04-07,"You're feeling a sense of professional pride today, stemming from your recent accomplishments. However, you're reluctant to completely buy into the trappings of the material world, even if you're in a position to amass power or wealth. On one hand, you're tempted to pick the fruits of your labor but on the other hand, you realize that success without spiritual meaning is a hollow victory. Paulo Coelho wrote, ""When we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better, too."""
sagittarius,2017-04-07,"It's an all-too-familiar lesson for you Archers: more of a good thing is better, but too much can be problematic. Your key planet Jupiter improves the dynamics of your relationships today as it expands the energy of your 11th House of Social Networking. Unfortunately, your current optimism can blow up like a balloon past the point of no return. Once popped, the game is over. Be safe and move through your day with a trace of caution so you don't experience regret later on."
capricorn,2017-04-07,"Your clear vision of success motivates you to reach higher to achieve your ambitions. However, buoyant Jupiter creates an inflationary spiral in your 10th House of Public Life, possibly lifting you right off the ground. You are poised to handle this energy as long as you can work your way back down to earth. Be pragmatic today; rational thinking guarantees the most straightforward course. Playwright Anton Chekov wrote, ""Knowledge is of no value unless you put it into practice."""
aquarius,2017-04-07,"It's tempting to create an action plan based on the bright blue sky of big ideas today. But you can easily mislead yourself into believing that your life is on track, even if it's not. Reacting with extreme optimism will likely result in a setback while bombastic Jupiter is magnifying your 9th House of Distant Horizons. Remember, the goal is not as near as it appears now. Nevertheless, as the challenges increase, so does the potential for growth."
pisces,2017-04-07,"Your success is tied to someone else's dreams while the Sun's opposition to propitious Jupiter in your 8th House of Intimacy encourages collaboration. The power of cooperation is synergistic; when two people share a common goal, the result is more powerful than a simple one plus one. Joint enterprises hold the keys to your happiness now. Senator Elizabeth Warren said, ""It's a simple idea: We all do better when we work together and invest in our future."""
aries,2017-04-08,"You may be not-so-secretly exploring a variety of strategies to pull back from an overextended position today. It's one thing to realize you've gone a bridge too far, but it's entirely different when you commit to returning to a place of emotional safety. Although you're normally attracted to the adrenaline rush, you will feel a welcome sense of relief when you reduce the current stress. Choosing your battles carefully now makes the difference between experiencing anxiety or happiness."
taurus,2017-04-08,"You might be disgruntled with your current social standing because it feels as if someone is working against you behind the scenes. Unfortunately, it's nearly impossible to respond with some kind of coherent plan when you can't figure out what is really going on. The closer you get to the truth today, the less confidence you have in the facts you're uncovering. Worry less about other people now and more about taking care of your own needs. Albert Einstein quipped, ""Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler."""
gemini,2017-04-08,"Descending into uncertainty is a healthy journey today, even if you resist it every step of the way. Nevertheless, confronting self-doubt puts you on the road to renewed confidence if you're willing to admit you don't have all the answers. Although you're a champion at tap-dancing around shadows, it's to your advantage now to explore what's hidden in the dark. Robert Frost wrote, ""The best way out is always through."""
cancer,2017-04-08,"You are determined to do everything you can to accomplish your agenda today. However, a close friend or partner might take you to task, demanding that you justify your choices. Steer clear of an emotional trap; you are not required to explain every little decision. Err on the side of caution now, especially if you sense that sharing your dreams will leave you feeling too vulnerable. Act on your gut instincts rather than second-guessing them. As the Chinese proverb advises, ""The person who says it cannot be done should not interrupt the person doing it."""
leo,2017-04-08,"You are trying a new approach to doing your chores today. You believe that the most practical course of action is to finish everything early in the day while the efficient Virgo Moon is busy activating trines with Pluto and Mars. But you could easily underestimate the time it takes to meet your obligations. It might even feel as if circumstances are somehow conspiring to complicate the simplest of tasks. Stop chasing your tail; the sooner you learn to let go of those things you cannot control, the better."
virgo,2017-04-08,"Your life is a study of extremes today. On one hand, you're in tune with your emotions and feel as if everything should unfold as planned. On the other hand, you're aware of the fact that other people aren't necessarily seeing things from your point of view. Engaging in endless discussions won't necessarily bring about resolution because your overall agendas have different endpoints. Instead of seeking common ground, it's best to go your own way now. Mutual respect is the basis for friendships that endure."
libra,2017-04-08,"Communication with family members and friends may seem constrained today. It's as if everyone is holding something back for fear of initiating an uncomfortable discussion. But the avoidance of a topic is actually worse than talking about it. Nevertheless, it takes two to bridge the gulf, so you might as well leave an intense conversation for another day if both parties are unwilling to fully engage now. An Irish proverb claims, ""A good retreat is better than a bad stand."""
scorpio,2017-04-08,"You can bury your feelings as effectively as the next person, but you're not one to shy away from confrontation once someone steps on your toes. It's like a breaker in the fuse box is tripped and you reach a point of no return. However, you might choose to withdraw deep into a shell today instead of defending your position. It makes sense to sidestep an argument if the issue isn't important. But it's not healthy to smile if there's a viable reason to speak your piece. The Dalai Lama teaches, ""Dialogue is the most effective way of resolving conflict."""
sagittarius,2017-04-08,"You are acutely aware of your commitments today, but you're not happy about needing to put pleasurable pursuits on hold. In fact, your annoyance could turn to resentment if you can't join others in their fun adventures. Avoid the temptation to spread negativity now just because you're envious of someone else's freedom. Instead, lift your spirits by accepting your current situation for what it is. Dale Carnegie wrote, ""Happiness doesn't depend on any external conditions; it is governed by our mental attitude."""
capricorn,2017-04-08,"Everything seems simple enough until someone close to you decides to break a promise today. You're not happy when you must adjust your plans to adapt to changes that are contrary to your wishes. Your initial instinct is to confront the other person by reminding them of their responsibility to follow through on a recent commitment. However, this only adds to the emotional distance and does nothing to encourage resolution. The only sensible path is the high road. Love cannot be controlled; it is meant to be given without expectation of anything in return."
aquarius,2017-04-08,"You want the ability to be free from other people's demands today, but you won't likely get your way without causing a scene. You can attempt to ignore what you learn about someone else's needs, but denial is not a path to happiness. Unfortunately, unexpressed dissatisfaction turns into emotional heartbreak if left untended. Although bringing your concerns out into the open might be a frightening prospect, it's the most efficient way to clear the tension. H.G. Wells said, ""Let your love be stronger than your hate or anger. Learn the wisdom of compromise, for it is better to bend a little than to break."""
pisces,2017-04-08,"Participating in a group, whether with friends or family, is a transformational experience today. You can't stay emotionally detached for very long, even if you don't want to get involved. Instead of wasting energy on resisting your fate, jump willingly into the fire. Holding onto your old beliefs or previous goals will only lead to unnecessary suffering. Viktor Frankl wrote, ""When we are no longer able to change a situation, we are challenged to change ourselves."""
aries,2017-04-09,"Your values are changing; what was once important to you is not nearly as significant now. But it's not about your perceptions as much as it's about communication. Unfortunately, there are so many thoughts buzzing around in your head that you can't decide where to jump in today. Nevertheless, you must regain your bearings before bringing someone else into the picture. Reconsider your priorities, especially where relationships are concerned. Focus on collaboration instead of competition."
taurus,2017-04-09,"Hanging out with others today is good for your heart, but it comes with an emotional cost. People might not understand your intentions, even if you slow down to explain your plans. Mercury's back-stepping in your sign over the next three weeks sets up delays and fosters miscommunication. There's no reason to convince anyone to take your side, especially when you have time to recreate a solid foundation based upon confronting your own reality. Cicero wrote, ""Silence is one of the great arts of conversation."""
gemini,2017-04-09,"Your thoughts shift inward now, beginning a journey to the center of your soul. There are buried treasures hidden in the recesses of your imagination waiting to be discovered. But you can't choose a direct route today, since there are no established paths to your preferred destination. Everything takes longer when logical Mercury turns retrograde in your 12th House of Destiny. Problems arise if you think that your current realizations must be put into action right away. Lessen the urgency by focusing on the future rather than the present moment. Keep calm and dream on."
cancer,2017-04-09,"Finding peace and quiet at home might not be as fulfilling as you wish today. You need to connect with people outside your immediate environment when interactive Mercury stands still in your 11th House of Groups. Nevertheless, satisfaction remains elusive if you burn more energy than you have available. Nothing is gained by trying to experience all the fun in one day since your desire for social contact will only continue to grow. Your superpower is self-control when it comes to making the good times last."
leo,2017-04-09,"Ironically, your confidence about your path in life may be waning as your horizon widens. It's increasingly difficult to reconcile previous decisions with your newly expanding perspective. Nevertheless, you're determined to follow through on your current trajectory today, even if it creates additional stress in your world. Although this high level of determination is admirable, it might be equally advantageous to reevaluate your plans, rather than rushing forward too soon. Stephen Hawking claims, ""Intelligence is the ability to adapt to change."""
virgo,2017-04-09,"Gathering the most pertinent information enables you to make the best decisions throughout your life. You already have plenty of data at your disposal now, but you want more facts so you can select the best route to your future. However, logic falls short as you try to sift through the noise while rational Mercury begins its retrograde cycle in your 9th House of Big Ideas. Don't let anyone pressure you into making a commitment today; stall until you have done the sufficient research to choose wisely. Paulo Coelho wrote, ""Listen to your heart. It knows everything."""
libra,2017-04-09,"You might prefer to withdraw into seclusion today but your attempts to hide won't likely work. After all, it's nearly impossible to disappear once the responsive Moon returns to your sign. Fighting the distractions may seem like a hopeless cause, especially when people draw you into such fascinating conversations. Fortunately, there's no reason to panic. Flow in and out of social encounters without resistance because there's plenty of time over the next few weeks to delve into the magic of your own imagination. Goethe wrote, ""You see in the world what you have in your heart."""
scorpio,2017-04-09,"Lively conversations with friends and family dominate your day. But others might misinterpret your quick wit and your eagerness to continue a dialogue as an attempt to avoid more serious responsibilities. However, you are simultaneously  sorting through all your options as you refine a strategy to fulfill your commitments. There's no reason to keep up appearances now. You have more to gain by bypassing trivial discussions so you can put all your brain power where you need it most. Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""Concentration is the secret of strength."""
sagittarius,2017-04-09,"An unexpected social opportunity can disrupt your regular routine today. Although your first reaction might be to adhere to your set schedule, recreating your day on the fly opens doors to new possibilities. Sticking to your previous agenda will only bring frustration while trickster Mercury turns retrograde in your 6th House of Logistics. Magically, stress dissipates once you decide to soar with the prevailing winds. A change of plans could be the catalyst that places you on the road to accomplishment. Let life catch you by surprise."
capricorn,2017-04-09,"Maintaining a sense of purpose can be complicated when you finally have a bit of free time on your hands. There is a pet project you wish to revisit now, only to discover something standing in your way. Applying creative ingenuity might compensate for a lack of materials, but don't push your agenda if circumstances continue to block your progress. Mischievous Mercury's retrograde turn in your 5th House of Self-Expression may temporarily frustrate your efforts if you take yourself too seriously. William Pollard wrote, ""Change is difficult; not changing is fatal."""
aquarius,2017-04-09,"It's not fun when you're backed into a corner, wondering whether or not it's wise to resist or give in. You might still be integrating recent changes while hoping the pace slows down soon. Actually, the current instability isn't quite over, but a reprieve is likely today. Step off the merry-go-round long enough to catch your breath. Thankfully, everything will unfold less stressfully now if you can relax. Simply knowing when to call it quits for a while lightens the mood for everyone."
pisces,2017-04-09,"There's no way you can deny that you're dancing on the edge of a cliff today. Keeping up the illusion of competence is exhausting when you feel as if you're running out of energy. Your smartest strategy may include scheduling time to collect your thoughts without firing up another distracting activity. Gathering your strength now means it will be available when you need it down the road. Thomas Carlyle wrote, ""Endurance is patience concentrated."""
aries,2017-04-10,"Saying yes to every amazing opportunity that comes your way seems like the natural thing to do. However, the problem is that each offer sounds better than the previous one and you cannot possibly keep up with all the work you create. Avoid the temptation of wearing a happy face while swearing you can do it all. Paradoxically, acknowledging your limitations enables you to accomplish more than you expect. Barry Schwartz wrote, ""The secret to happiness is low expectations."""
taurus,2017-04-10,"You might fall victim to your own positive thinking today if you think you deserve something for nothing. You're willing to work for your goals, but you could easily believe that your contributions are more significant than they are in reality. Your current efforts produce the greatest impact if you give each and every task your absolute best effort. Emphasizing quality over quantity increases your chances of being recognized for your excellence. Stephen Covey taught, ""The key is not to prioritize what's on your schedule but to schedule your priorities."""
gemini,2017-04-10,"You are brimming with many wonderful ideas today and can't wait to put them out in the open for all to see. However, expressing what's on your mind isn't as easy as you hope. You assume the right time has arrived, only to discover that others are too busy to stop and listen. But don't give up now; if your ingenuity can produce results, then your peers will eventually applaud your accomplishments. Thomas Edison wrote, ""Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work."""
cancer,2017-04-10,"Although you are quite capable of keeping up appearances at work, it is in your best interest to take off your mask now and let the real you shine. Sometimes you wonder if others will accept you if they know your true thoughts and feelings. Wearing your heart on your sleeve leaves you in a vulnerable position; however, there's no need to reveal everything all at once. Taking it step by step helps to remove the pressure and lighten your load. As Benjamin Franklin wrote, ""Honesty is the best policy."""
leo,2017-04-10,"You want to tell your story to everyone you meet today. Unfortunately, some people are too busy with their own commitments to listen. Don't take someone's apparent disinterest personally; it's less about you than about their schedule. Fortunately, there are others who are ready to hear your message of hope and inspiration. Share your thoughts without expecting help on your personal campaign. Simply getting the word out is a gift of its own and enables you to clarify your next move."
virgo,2017-04-10,"Your excitement grows as you contemplate a new business prospect or revisit an existing project that is currently lying dormant. But you're not just looking for something to occupy your time; you're on the hunt for your next money-making venture. Your interest in increasing your income is well-timed but you must make a solid commitment to a concrete plan. As long as your expectations aren't blown out of proportion, continue to follow your whim wherever it leads. Greek philosopher Atticus asked, ""What good are wings if you don't have the courage to fly?"""
libra,2017-04-10,"You are at the top of your game today as you channel your inner diplomat. You're quite comfortable running back and forth between others now, helping them find common ground on which to build a relationship. You're an asset to any community when you're allowed -- or even encouraged -- to work your gracious magic. Remember, your power comes from staying in touch with your feelings; pay attention to your heart, not your head. Walther Rathenau said, ""Truth is inner harmony."""
scorpio,2017-04-10,"You are on a spiritual quest today that's bolstered by letting go of your connections in the real world. But stepping back from a hectic lifestyle isn't enough to ensure the reawakening that you seek. Luckily, you are enchanted by the positive energies that are being stirred everywhere around you. Nevertheless, the good vibes can pass you by unless you actually make a move. Thoreau wrote, ""Live your beliefs and you can turn the world around."""
sagittarius,2017-04-10,"Although it's a back-to-work day for many, you're on very familiar turf as you flirt with procrastination. Your commitments are screaming for attention today, but you are more interested in returning to your routine for its social, rather than business, interests. Instead of spending your time hanging by the water cooler or tending to your social media network, do the right thing and deliver on your promises. You can only accomplish greatness if you're free from unnecessary distraction. Work now, play later."
capricorn,2017-04-10,"Your professional ambitions know no bounds today and you're excited to start a new project at work. You don't even mind how much responsibility you must carry; you're eager for the assignment of your lifetime. However, you are not viewing your future through a practical lens now as if everything is inflated by your over-productive imagination. Just because you can weave an idea into a dream, doesn't mean it's possible to manifest it. Nevertheless, as noted by Tim Ferriss, ""Reality is negotiable."""
aquarius,2017-04-10,"Concentrating on the work at hand is challenging when you're fascinated by thoughts of a journey to a distant land. Although the farthest corners of the globe are calling your name, you might settle for a getaway that's closer to home. In either case, your travel fantasies can prevent you from achieving success now. Consciously shift your focus away from escape plans and back to your current responsibilities. Eckhart Tolle wrote, ""Realize deeply that the present moment is all you will ever have."""
pisces,2017-04-10,"You might be tumbling into a magical relationship or revisiting an emotional issue that is recycling from the recent past. Either way, you're committed to maintaining a healthy perspective now; you don't want the intensity to swallow you up. Fortunately, your friends rush to your rescue today by offering their perspectives on the current situation, enabling you to discern the facts from the fantasies. Don't be in too much of a hurry to resolve everything from the past. Consistency and communication build the foundation to your future."
aries,2017-04-11,"You aren't one to let random people run your life, but you're overly sensitive to the needs of a friend or partner now. The Libra Full Moon illuminates your 7th House of Companions, revealing the emotions of those closest to you. Concentrating on your own desires is easier than focusing on anyone else's, but circumstances won't let you take the mindless way out. Instead of playing the ignorance card, demonstrate your concern by reaching out and letting others know you care. Opening your heart is a sign of strength."
taurus,2017-04-11,"Relationships involve hard work, but you're willing to lean into the tasks at hand in order to achieve positive results. In fact, establishing a regular practice of checking in with a significant other makes sense now that the Libra Full Moon lands in your 6th House of Habits. However, one day of conscious behavior won't be enough to create a new partnership or save a flagging one. What you do within your daily routine is the secret to your long-term success."
gemini,2017-04-11,"You're eager to demonstrate your creativity to others today, but the ideas don't flow as effortlessly as you wish. The most ingenious thoughts cross your mind, yet you worry about what people will think once they see past your lighthearted veneer. Nevertheless, the Libra Full Moon emboldens your 5th House of Self-Expression -- and even the fear of upsetting your peers won't shut you down. When it comes to sharing your inspirations, there are only two times: now and too late."
cancer,2017-04-11,"An old conflict between home and career is suddenly back on your plate, demanding resolution once and for all. But someone's hidden agenda complicates matters as secretive Pluto squares the Libra Full Moon in your 4th House of Domestic Affairs. It may seem as if you're forced into a no-win situation now because you can't choose between your personal and professional life without damaging the other. Acknowledging how your family matters are interconnected with your job is a healthy start. Don't push for a final answer yet; as screenwriter Syd Field wrote, ""Confusion is the first step toward clarity."""
leo,2017-04-11,"You can see many roads diverging ahead of you and you're not sure which way you should go. Although each has its own destination, you don't want to narrow your choices just yet. Thankfully, the Libra Full Moon gives you permission to keep your options open as it activates your 3rd House of Multiple Choices. Discuss your dilemma with those you trust and listen to their feedback. Incorporating a variety of perspectives into your decision-making process offers you a better chance at a brighter future."
virgo,2017-04-11,"You're weary of so many good ideas coming and going without producing lasting impact on your life. The Libra Full Moon rattles your 2nd House of Personal Possessions and you want concrete results now, especially when it comes to your finances. Display your brilliance by keeping your heart open. Thankfully, wearing your feelings on your sleeve today adds the integrity you need to increase your income. Your self-esteem is directly related to your earning power. Prosperity begins with a state of mind."
libra,2017-04-11,"Hiding your true feelings is nearly impossible today, even if you believe your happiness depends on it. Nevertheless, the Libra Full Moon's presence in your 1st House of Self motivates you to place complete emotional disclosure ahead of your personal comfort. Revealing your fears frees you to look ahead, instead of seeking causes for current events in the past. Gandhi said, ""The future depends on what we do in the present."""
scorpio,2017-04-11,"People can't figure out what you're up to because they aren't interested in digging up the facts. Your general anxiety is triggered by every minor conflict today, but you prefer to avoid escalating the tension. Unfortunately, you might struggle to share your complex feelings while the Full Moon is flooding your 12th House of Secrets. Rather than emotionally withdrawing, use your cool and collected logic to reevaluate your intimate relationships. Facing your insecurities helps to morph your negativity into a positively memorable experience. Author Dan Zadra wrote, ""Worry is the misuse of the imagination."""
sagittarius,2017-04-11,"You only have so much time to go around, but you are determined to remain socially active, even if it's at the expense of work. Although you face real limitations now, you're being tested by the cosmos to see if you can establish clear boundaries. The Libra Full Moon amplifies the energy of your 11th House of Community, but you might take group participation too far. Draw a line so you don't waste your energy on activities that don't further your goals. In life there are no shortcuts to any place worth going."
capricorn,2017-04-11,"Although you don't often disappoint when it comes to delivering on your promises, your schedule may be overly demanding now. Everyone seems to want a piece of your attention, and you're worried that you won't be able to fulfill your commitments. The Libra Full Moon highlights your 10th House of Public Status, preventing you from running from your responsibilities. Set a sustainable work pace and be proud of whatever you finish. Adele Leon said, ""A work of art was once a work in progress."" The struggle is part of the story."
aquarius,2017-04-11,"You may be blinded by your own need for adventure today, especially as the Libra Full Moon shines in your 9th House of Big Ideas. You want to make a decision based upon your highest ideals, but it's natural to exaggerate now -- and you won't even realize you're stretching the truth until it's too late. However, a potentially difficult situation is possible if others take everything you say at face value. Methodically separating your fantasies from the facts saves you and your friends from unnecessary headaches. Open your mind before you open your mouth."
pisces,2017-04-11,"You don't want to relinquish control today, but you may not have a choice in the matter without causing a fuss. The Libra Full Moon emphasizes your 8th House of Deep Sharing, breaking down the artificial distinctions between you and someone else. Unfortunately, you're not comfortable with the speed at which the current disintegration occurs. Nevertheless, delving into unfamiliar emotional territory can reveal hidden treasures. Don't waste your energy fighting the currents; hope anchors the soul."
aries,2017-04-12,"You may be elated when you discover solutions to problems that were irresolvable just yesterday. However, your enthusiasm wanes when you realize that your ideas sound brilliant but are totally impractical. Even the most ingenious intellectual breakthrough is irrelevant if you can't turn it into an executable plan. Don't lose heart if you need to return to the drawing board to start again. Just remember the words of Dr. Seuss, ""Fantasy is a necessary ingredient in living."""
taurus,2017-04-12,"Your sensitivity to the feelings of others is a mixed blessing today. Your willingness to understand someone else's point of view seems like a positive gesture, but putting your emotional intuition ahead of everything else can lead you astray. There's no reason to withdraw completely; but you don't need to be more entangled in a major drama that's not your business. Steve Maraboli wrote, ""Be careful; not all are what they seem. Some people pretend to be by the beach, but they're actually in quicksand."""
gemini,2017-04-12,"You must get something important off your chest today. Unfortunately, the emotional temperature is dropping and the longer you wait, the cooler the reception will be to your ideas. Although you may face resistance at first, persistence is your friend. Once a new behavior has turned into a habit, it magically begins to resonate and ripple throughout other parts of your life. Think big, start slowly and don't give up."
cancer,2017-04-12,"It seems as if people drop into your world now to play the part of an angel on earth, extending offers of assistance and dependable shoulders upon which you can lean. But you're not all fun and games today; you need to assess your current commitments and decide how much time you can afford to devote to creative play. Don't wait too long or reality will narrow your choices. If you want something you've never had, you must do something you've never done."
leo,2017-04-12,"You may be at odds now with the very same people who should be your allies. Perhaps a dear friend, close relative or congenial coworker has adopted a political position that challenges your values. You must decide whether to openly confront the brewing resistance or just let it be for now. Unfortunately, no one can help you with this question because what is real and important are priorities that only you can set. Anne Frank wrote, ""First we make our choices, then our choices make us."""
virgo,2017-04-12,"You have a strong opinion about someone's plan at work today, and you're wondering how assertive you should be when sharing your thoughts. If you decide to go all in, your delivery could be so intense now that it backfires. People need to stick around long enough to hear your argument and no one will learn from your indisputable logic if your presentation ends too soon. Access your creativity to invent an original approach. Know your audience and work with passion until they acknowledge your message."
libra,2017-04-12,"Your values are being tested today and you must demonstrate the strength of your convictions. A coworker may say something that contradicts one of your basic beliefs and you can't just let it slide. But you're not looking for an endless debate; you don't need to prove that you are right. Ultimately, you just want people to know exactly where you stand. Being honest may not get you a lot of friends, but it will always get you the right ones."
scorpio,2017-04-12,"Your deepest emotions seem to sit right on the surface today, making you a target for people's self-interests. You can't help but feel everything more acutely now that the Moon has returned to passionate Scorpio. It's healthy to retreat if you are overly vulnerable since you cannot operate effectively in the outer world if you're preoccupied with your emotional safety. Nevertheless, comedian Gilda Radner observed, ""There is no real security except for whatever you build inside yourself."""
sagittarius,2017-04-12,"You're unlikely to express your emotions today because they are too powerfully intense for your comfort. You worry that others won't be able to take the true you, so you put your feelings under lock and key for safe keeping. Unfortunately, there is psychic leakage and even your deepest secrets leave a Hansel-and-Gretel breadcrumb trail for others to follow. The choice is yours: you can either plaster a smile on your face now or you can tell the truth. Author Janet Louise Stevenson wrote, ""Authenticity requires vulnerability, transparency and integrity."""
capricorn,2017-04-12,"You have a fixed idea of how you want people to fit into your life today. It might sound harsh, but they either conform to your expectations or you move on. You're not interested now in negotiating for what you want; it's all or nothing where relationships are concerned. Unfortunately, this extremist approach doesn't serve you well because you are ready to eliminate someone who only wants to help. Don't blame people for disappointing you; blame yourself for expecting too much from them."
aquarius,2017-04-12,"You're not one to be pulled off course today because you're fixed on your goal like a dog tracking its bone. Luckily, you can see beyond the edges of your plans, enabling you to take advantage of assistance being offered -- even if it's not exactly what you expected. Dreaming of professional success can be magical, but don't lose sight of the bigger picture. Mandy Hale wrote, ""Happiness is letting go of what you think your life is supposed to look like and celebrating it for everything that it is."""
pisces,2017-04-12,"Your fantasies are larger than life today and you're willing to let a commitment slide if your current behavior moves you closer to your dreams. However, it may not be healthy to focus on possibilities in the distant future when there is so much going on in your immediate world. Stepping away from your assumptions gives you a better perspective so you can see them in a new light. Author Elizabeth Gilbert wrote, ""You have to participate relentlessly in the manifestation of your own blessings."""
aries,2017-04-13,"Nothing is more thrilling to you pioneering Aries than the anticipation of change. Just the thought of a new lease on life is enough to get your adrenaline flowing today. However, restlessness could turn to frustration if you feel trapped by your current circumstances. Thankfully, the Aries Sun bumps into irrepressible Uranus, sending shockwaves through those parts of your world that have grown stagnant. The currents are moving fast; push away from the safety of the shore and ride the rapids downstream. John A. Shedd wrote, ""A ship in port is safe but that's not what ships are built for."""
taurus,2017-04-13,"A lingering feeling of dissatisfaction is driving you right to the edge today. Perhaps you've wandered from your established course and realize that something must be done to set your life back on track. The fear of coming up short has your mind racing with brilliant ideas and unconventional desires that may seem crazy. Rest assured that you don't need to have all the answers now; everything doesn't have to follow according to your plan. Instead of judging yourself against some arbitrary standard, loosen the reins of control. Toni Morrison wrote, ""If you want to fly, you have to give up the things that weigh you down."""
gemini,2017-04-13,"Life seems to be growing more unpredictable now and you're not sure whether you like it or not. It's difficult to be productive when your coworkers are not as reliable as you expect, especially if you're counting on their support. Nevertheless, you still must deliver on your promises even if you can't rely on others. Don't get sidetracked by self-doubt and worry; simply continue on your own without expecting outside help. British novelist Margaret Drabble wrote, ""When nothing is sure, everything is possible."""
cancer,2017-04-13,"Something is about to shift in your community or professional life. An unexpected change of position could come out of the blue, for better or for worse. A setback is the cosmos' way of showing you what needs to be improved. However, the universe can just as well acknowledge your brilliance by pushing you into a leadership role. In either case, you must let go of the status quo today. Holding onto the past is like running into the future with shackles on your legs. As Gandhi taught, ""Be truthful, gentle and fearless."""
leo,2017-04-13,"Maintaining your efficiency is challenging today because you're caught between following your gut instincts and listening to the voice of reason. But attempts to stick to logic won't solve the problem; the more you resist the future, the quicker it will arrive. You can try to block out the noise that's coming from over the horizon, but you actually want to have all the new information at your disposal now, even if it's overwhelming. President Barack Obama said, ""Fear, uncertainty and discomfort are your compasses toward growth. If you run you stand a chance of losing, but if you don't run, you've already lost."""
virgo,2017-04-13,"Unknowable mysteries are made known today, satisfying your current fascination with the perpetual riddles of life. Fortunately, your mind is lightning-quick to grasp a new concept. But don't make the mistake of closing down your heart as a matter of convenience while you're opening your mind. Adding your emotional perspective ensures that your current breakthrough will endure. Tony Robbins said, ""For changes to be of any true value, they must be lasting and consistent."""
libra,2017-04-13,"People are tempting you to take a risk today and you might even act so radically that it surprises everyone, including yourself. However, you might overcompensate by fearfully suppressing your desire to initiate action. Your caution could unexpectedly resurface in your outer world in the form of a projection. Buried tension is released whether triggered by you or someone else. Naturally, playing out your role preemptively is wiser than waiting for something to happen. She who hesitates is lost."
scorpio,2017-04-13,"Managing extreme emotions can be really tricky for Scorpions today, especially while the wild Sun-Uranus conjunction rattles your 6th House of Trivial Matters. Everything seems to be too much or not enough, making it nearly impossible to gain a clear perspective on a situation before making a decision. Although your healthy sense of self-restraint works in your favor now, it's best to cultivate and nurture your plans before making them public. Don't rush the process. Jean-Jacques Rousseau wrote, ""Patience is bitter but its fruit is sweet."""
sagittarius,2017-04-13,"You've lost any semblance of being practical today, especially if you're enchanted by a new social cause or a romantic attraction. Luckily, you might be able to escape your work-related responsibilities, but you could go overboard in your quest for fun. You don't need to follow every whim; you can seek alternative avenues of expression through a favorite hobby or a team sport. Nevertheless, the game of life has two participants: spectators and players. Pick one."
capricorn,2017-04-13,"When life becomes too predictable, it's Uranus that arrives on the scene to disrupt an otherwise regular pattern that is keeping you in a rut. Thankfully, your home and family create an emotionally safe environment where it seems you can freely express your restlessness. Unfortunately, you might make a mess because words and actions flow quickly once the floodgates of the dam are opened. Life may be uncomfortable for a while as you respond to the radical changes. Although the interpersonal dynamics appear unstable, clearing the air of tension feels good to everyone. If anyone can create order out of chaos, it is you."
aquarius,2017-04-13,"Your unflagging sense of duty helps you stay focused on your career now. However, you're no longer interested in repeating old performances; in fact, you're cruising for something completely off the map. The radical Sun-Uranus partnership shakes up your 3rd House of Communication, daring you to take risks in all forms of interactions today. When you think you're being original, step even further away from the center. The biggest mistake you could ever make is being too afraid to make one."
pisces,2017-04-13,"Embracing an activity that pulls you off balance may not be such a good idea today, since throwing distractions into the picture is the cosmos' way of keeping you guessing. Ultimately, your current dilemma is all about your core beliefs; when they are in flux, so is your entire life. You are being gifted with a unique opportunity to heal a wound you have carried around inside you for a long time. Soften your hard edges and trust your compassionate heart. Acknowledging the truth allows you to move on."
aries,2017-04-14,"You're on a roll and there's not much that can slow you down today. However, your high level of self-confidence doesn't necessarily make you right. Be careful; you can react to a situation so fast that you jump to a conclusion before you have all the facts. Although you might see a shortcut, it's still prudent to take the regular route that gives you time to logically process the incoming information. Author Libba Bray wrote, ""Your mind is not a cage. It is a garden and it requires cultivating."""
taurus,2017-04-14,"You might believe you're standing at the edge of a metaphysical awakening and your impatience is making you crazy. You can't concentrate on the present moment because your mind is already in the future where life is better than it is now. Ironically, your heightened anticipation prevents you from taking the next step in your spiritual development. Rather than thinking about your potential growth, bring your thoughts back to your current circumstances. True enlightenment is not something to aspire toward; it's how you live your life every single minute of every single day."
gemini,2017-04-14,"Although you gain stability from your social network, your friends are the source of unexpected news today. Thankfully, you are quite skilled at rolling with the punches and whatever you learn now is taken into consideration in a calm and collected manner. Nevertheless, you're pulled off center as you're captivated by someone's fantastic vision. Allow yourself to be entertained by other people's dreams, but don't substitute your own with them. Benjamin Franklin said, ""The Constitution only guarantees you the right to pursue happiness. You have to catch it yourself."""
cancer,2017-04-14,"You prefer to step into a new role gradually, taking your time as you slowly assume ownership. However, the shift may be quite abrupt now, requiring you to make a significant change on a moment's notice. You don't have the luxury of morphing into your new character and learning your lines. Thankfully, you can move at lightning speeds when pushed by circumstance. Don't let your past limit your future; embrace the unknown."
leo,2017-04-14,"You are able to magically alter your physical characteristics today by elevating your consciousness. Your bold confidence makes you appear larger to others while sheepish embarrassment reduces your stature. However, you are eager to play with the newfound energy, giving you a new lease on life. But don't misuse your power to influence other people's perceptions. Restate your truth as concisely as possible and let the chips fall as they will. What is life but one grand adventure?"
virgo,2017-04-14,"A complex working arrangement continues to go through a period of readjustment. The conflict between your head and your heart is a core issue today and there seems to be little on the horizon in the way of a solution. Although you might believe that the most sensible path runs through a dense jungle, you still must cut your way through the undergrowth step by step. It doesn't matter how fast or slow you go now, as long as you don't stop. Bill Bradley said, ""Ambition is the path to success. Persistence is the vehicle you arrive in."""
libra,2017-04-14,"Everyone seems to be agitated today, as if they are flirting with the edge of a great change. You don't know whether you should intervene and try to calm each person down or if you should join in their state of high anxiety. Both choices are attractive to you now for very different reasons. Being the voice of reason allows you to lead by example. The Dalai Lama said, ""Do not let the behavior of others destroy your inner peace."""
scorpio,2017-04-14,"No matter how hard you've been trying to maintain the status quo, your patience has run so thin that you're not fully in control of your words and deeds. You have reached the end of your rope and are motivated to take drastic action now. Something has to give and it may not be pleasant or graceful when the pent-up energy is released. Nevertheless, it's not in your best interest to bottle up your truth and fake a smile for the crowd. Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""Honesty is the first chapter in the Book of Wisdom."""
sagittarius,2017-04-14,"You're willing to deal with the consequences of your words and actions as they unfold, even if you're making it up as you go along. Although you may take the time to analyze your alternatives before doing anything, it's nearly impossible to isolate every possible outcome today. Nevertheless, going through the motions of considering different paths into the future is still a valuable tool that enables you to eliminate all but a few choices. Gandhi said, ""You may never know what results come from your action. But if you do nothing, there will be no result."""
capricorn,2017-04-14,"You have temporarily lost your ability to know where you stand, where you are going and how to get there. For a change, your imagination is strong enough to overpower your common sense today. It's as if your practical nature has been untethered from your body and it's drifting into space. Give yourself permission to enjoy the ride. Ferris Bueller -- on his day off -- quipped, ""Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it."""
aquarius,2017-04-14,"You might be surprised how far some people will go to avoid missing out on a fun activity. You have big social plans for the weekend but may be sent back to the drawing board to rework your schedule once the word is out. You're eager to talk up a thought storm and then watch the ideas precipitate back down to the earth. Playing both ends of the deal makes sense today because sensory limitations keep your perspective contained to a narrow spectrum. John Lennon said, ""Reality leaves a lot to the imagination."""
pisces,2017-04-14,"You intuitively know what must be done at work today. Getting further ahead is the single-most important item on your list, but you don't want it to be the only thing. You're eager to put effort into a creative project that might have no socially redeeming value. It's not all about productivity now; sometimes the sheer joy of self-expression is more gratifying than climbing another rung on the ladder of success. Aldous Huxley wrote, ""The secret of genius is to carry the spirit of the child into old age."""
aries,2017-04-15,"You don't need to shout your love from the mountaintops. You're happy sharing your heartfelt feelings quietly today as romantic Venus starts a fresh cycle in your 12th House of Privacy. But even if you speak softly, choose your words carefully because they carry more emotional weight than you realize. Opera singer Robert Breault said, ""Love is not about grand intentions. It is about small attentions."""
taurus,2017-04-15,"You might wake up with a smile today for no particular reason. You just sense that something good is coming your way, even if you can't put your finger on the source. Thankfully, your key planet Venus ends her retrograde phase in your 11th House of Friends, signaling an improvement in the social arena. It's not just your imagination; your happy face is a harbinger of magic that's brewing just around the corner. Vincent Van Gogh said, ""I don't know anything with certainty, but seeing the stars makes me dream."""
gemini,2017-04-15,"A close friend or partner could save the day with  her unwavering optimism, or a stroke of luck might pull you out of a tight spot. You can tell that one phase is ending and another is about to begin as enriching Venus turns direct in your 10th House of Fame and Fortune. But you must be patient, since it will take several days for the new momentum to build to a crescendo. In the meantime, don't be afraid to dance if you feel the energy in your toes. Science fiction author Frank Herbert wrote, ""The real universe is always one step beyond logic."""
cancer,2017-04-15,"Your great expectations could get the best of you today, especially if they are so unrealistic that you don't have a clue how to reach them. Indulgent Venus resumes her forward movement in your 9th House of Big Ideas, making it nearly impossible to focus on the relevant details du jour. But you might inadvertently set your goals so high that there's little chance you will ever need to deal with the trappings that accompany success. Remember, limits, like fears, are often just an illusion."
leo,2017-04-15,"Naturally, you're enjoying the current cosmic buzz, since the fiery Sagittarius Moon is happily camped out in your 5th House of Creativity. Although you often like to distract yourself with everyone else's antics, there's no escape for you now. Luckily, you're willing to stretch further to find deeper meaning once resourceful Venus turns direct in your 8th House of Regeneration. The surface may be quite beautiful, but the real action is lurking in the shadows."
virgo,2017-04-15,"Sometimes it's tricky to know when a relationship is actually over. However, it's not wise to write off an old acquaintance too soon because someone is likely to recycle back into your life now. Loving Venus turns direct in your 7th House of Significant Others, reminding you of the magic you encounter when you reconnect with an old friend. But don't make any long-term decisions yet or expect anyone else to, either. Although you might know what you want to do, everyone else needs more time to sort out their hearts."
libra,2017-04-15,"There's a lot on your plate today, but you don't mind hard work once you get started. However, you might struggle with the specific instructions you receive while your ruling planet Venus stands still in your 6th House of Details. Everything is about to take off, but you can't get any traction just yet. Instead of trying harder, withdraw and gather your strength for the battle ahead. Good things come to those who wait."
scorpio,2017-04-15,"Your big ideas about making money don't sound as good once you sit down to think them over today. You want your schemes to hold up under scrutiny, but they don't. Rather than lingering in buyer's remorse, you can simply walk away from a project that's never been started. Thankfully, there are many other potential ventures vying for your attention now that enriching Venus is proactive in your 5th House of Self-Expression. Maya Angelou wrote, ""You can't use up creativity. The more you use, the more you have."""
sagittarius,2017-04-15,"You're more sensitive to the needs of others now that the emotional Moon is back in your sign. However, being aware of someone else's perspective doesn't mean much unless you're willing to act on your convictions. Meanwhile, delicious Venus is preparing to resume her forward campaign, but she's still hanging out in your 4th House of Family Roots. If you don't know how to help, just ask. The best of intentions can still land you in trouble if your assumptions are false."
capricorn,2017-04-15,"You might feel alienated from your world today, even if there are a variety of activities to keep you socially involved. You want to come out of your protective shell while sweet Venus turns direct in your 3rd House of Communication. You like the idea of interacting with others, but there's a barrier to overcome. The Moon's presence in your 12th House of Invisibility reflects your need to fly under the radar. Don't try to check back into the real world until you're ready. The timing is for you to decide, not anyone else."
aquarius,2017-04-15,"Your friends are your connection to the future today, so set aside some quality time to hang out with those who know you best. Sharing your dreams brings them closer to manifestation, whether or not you receive validation. Instead, use your visions and ideas as the grist for the mill of friendship. Your goal is to deepen long-term relationships based upon shared experiences now that magnetic Venus holds your 2nd House of Values captive. Dr. Mark Hyman claims, ""The power of community to create health is far greater than any physician, clinic or hospital."""
pisces,2017-04-15,"Take advantage of every opportunity to contemplate your current situation versus your objectives in life. There's much to be gained from cultivating a healthy relationship with your own body and mind. Affectionate Venus starts her forward dance in your 1st House of Self, placing your desires up front where everyone can see. Although you might feel more vulnerable now, you are also cast in a charming light. Beauty might attract the eye, but your good-natured personality captures the heart."
aries,2017-04-16,"You have the power to change your destiny, but you must initiate action now rather than just think about it. Your intuition is on point, but that's only the first part of this cosmic double whammy. You possess the natural confidence to express your desires in a way that magically allows your dreams to manifest without resistance. However, whatever you start today will require follow-through tomorrow, so choose your path judiciously and then make your move. French existentialist Simone de Beauvoir wrote, ""Don't gamble on the future; act now, without delay."""
taurus,2017-04-16,"You may worry your plans won't pan out as you expect today. Ironically, your concerns could turn out to be true if you focus on them too much. Although it's wise to put your ducks in a row before involving others in your scheme, everything could fall apart if you ignore the details. Nevertheless, your current path might lead to satisfaction if you start slowly and build momentum as you go along. Gold medalist Kim Collins said, ""Strive for continuous improvement, instead of perfection."""
gemini,2017-04-16,All the pieces of the puzzle might fall into place just as you wish today with one minor exception. Someone may be overly critical of your choices when the Moon whispers to naysaying Saturn in your 7th House of Others. You have the ability to make your day even better if you receive the advice with an open mind. But the good times could unravel if you're overly resistant to constructive feedback. Accepting the fact that you can improve your game is not the same as giving up. It's growing up.
cancer,2017-04-16,"You are inspired by your dreams and restrained by your memories. However, you also can choose to revisit your past and retell your story from a different perspective. Instead of glorifying a painful event by giving it power in the present moment, reframe your life in terms of future potential. Philosopher George Santayana wrote, ""Wisdom comes by disillusionment. Once we see our history from a new perspective, we are free to make more informed choices in the present moment and thereby realize our greatest potential."""
leo,2017-04-16,"A child's play can be serious business, for it's this process of creative exploration that teaches you what's possible. You might think that setting fun and games aside is the mature thing to do today, but taking yourself too seriously is a tactical error. Engaging in joyful activities is an important learning experience now, but also replenishes your soul. Finish your chores quickly so you can participate in more enjoyable pursuits. As Tom Robbins wrote, ""It's never too late to have a happy childhood."""
virgo,2017-04-16,"You are quite aware of your shortcomings as a human being and don't need anyone else to remind you today. Thankfully, you're comfortable with your limitations and can so skillfully work around them that others don't even notice. Deciding which emotions to keep to yourself comes naturally now, allowing you to show off your most admirable traits. Don't be overly concerned if you slip into an unexpected inner conversation with self-doubt. Neither push it away nor embrace it; Mooji said, ""Feelings are just visitors, let them come and go."""
libra,2017-04-16,"It's as if you wrote a screenplay for a romantic comedy and now the people in your life are acting out their parts according to your script. Needless to say, you're quite content when so many things go the way you envisioned them. Don't freak out if you hit a speed bump; just because others start improvising their lines doesn't mean the entire plot will be lost. It's counterproductive to enforce your expectations on anyone else. In general terms, the lighter your touch, the smoother everything will flow. Life would come with a remote if it was meant to be controlled."
scorpio,2017-04-16,"You are a champion when it comes to withholding inconvenient emotions, but there's a price to pay for keeping so many secrets buried within. First of all, others will notice that the energy isn't quite right, even if they don't know why. Second, you will feel the existential discomfort in your body that constantly reminds you of your dishonesty. Telling the truth right from the start saves you from a situation that will only grow more awkward. Futurist Bucky Fuller wrote, ""Integrity is the essence of everything successful."""
sagittarius,2017-04-16,"You are an enigma today because you're feeling an odd combination of enthusiasm and seriousness. You're excited about your current creativity and hopeful that you'll capture a brilliant idea or two before the day is gone. Nevertheless, you're also aware of the uphill climb in front of you. You know that you're shouldering extra responsibilities and take your role to heart. Nevertheless, the results can be very fulfilling when you hold onto both ends of the emotional spectrum while clearing a path in the middle."
capricorn,2017-04-16,"People might not see your fun-loving side today, but it's present nonetheless. In fact, you might intentionally bury your capricious attitude because you don't want others to think you're behaving frivolously. Of course, your specialty is acting lighthearted in the moment while still holding onto a more calculated course of action. Don't take your eyes off the goal; your single-minded approach is your ticket to success. Special-effects guru George Lucas said, ""Always remember, your focus determines your reality."""
aquarius,2017-04-16,"Taking a day off isn't the same for you as it is for most people. Your idea of perfection is to be free of responsibilities so you can push the edges of the universe out just a little further. Fortunately, stretching the envelope might lead to a creative breakthrough today. Without trying to accomplish anything purposeful, you could change your future with what you learn now. It's just as William Blake wrote, ""If the fool would persist in his folly, he would become wise."""
pisces,2017-04-16,"You're more concerned with your accomplishments today than with anything else. Whether unfinished chores, unfulfilled commitments or an incomplete project, you can't relax until you demonstrate your maturity by delivering on your promises. But there's also an inner child who is feeling deprived of attention. Thankfully, it's not an all-or-nothing proposition; you can be accountable while also making time for a bit of fun and frivolity. Jack Torrance wrote, ""All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy."""
aries,2017-04-17,"You're more than willing to go the extra mile at work today because you know that your positive attitude will be rewarded. Thankfully, you'll probably accomplish more than you expect while the enthusiastic Aries Sun harmonizes with karmic Saturn. Nevertheless, your dissatisfaction grows throughout the day after cranky Mars enters the picture. Harboring negative thoughts does nothing except move you further from success. What you think, you become."
taurus,2017-04-17,"Your goal is to establish clear priorities and then stick to your plan, regardless of the expectations of others. The Sun and Mars activate sobering Saturn in your 8th House of Deep Sharing, reminding you that you don't need external success. Instead of trying to please everyone else, the only lasting source of satisfaction is found in making your heart happy. Bob Marley sang, ""Open your eyes, look within. Are you satisfied with the life you're living?"""
gemini,2017-04-17,"Your professional and personal relationships seem stable enough to support you through a work crunch of hectic deadlines. Luckily, you can put a plan into place quickly enough to create an immediate positive effect. However, you still may need to face the fact that you are behind schedule. Don't waste any time or energy on worrying about what happens next. Just put your shoulder to the wheel and keep on pushing today. Will Smith said, ""Stop letting people who do so little for you control so much of your mind, feelings and emotions."""
cancer,2017-04-17,"Your skin starts to crawl when people criticize your work in public. The truth is you're open to receiving useful feedback, but you prefer it to be given in a more private setting. However, you may believe that it's important to keep up appearances today, so no one will realize that you're upset. Unfortunately, stifling your humiliation or frustration impacts the current interpersonal dynamics. Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""For every minute you remain angry, you give up sixty seconds of peace of mind."""
leo,2017-04-17,"Your unrestrained confidence works in your favor only for so long today. Believing in your ability to put on a good show is not a substitute for actually turning in a world class performance. Instant karma will stop you in your tracks if you're not fully capable of meeting your obligations. Thankfully, with proper preparation, Saturn's progress-stopping roadblock will morph into a minor speed bump before you even reach it. Stephen Hawking wrote, ""However difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at. It matters that you don't just give up."""
virgo,2017-04-17,"You are a shining example of Virgo's efficiency in action today. You want to work smarter, not harder. But previously hidden factors turn a simple contract into a complicated mess of half-finished projects. Instead of just assuming that everything will magically unfold in the best interests of everyone, revise your plan and jump in wherever progress is blocked. But remember, success alone will not bring happiness; love is the key to your heart."
libra,2017-04-17,"You don't need to make a big deal out of your current position; you're just anxious to lend a helping hand wherever you're needed. Unfortunately, people might not seek your assistance today, even if they could draw on your unused talents. Although their lack of interest may be annoying, it's not polite to overstep into anyone else's private affairs. Think of this as a gift from the universe and do something nice for yourself instead."
scorpio,2017-04-17,"You're not one to be seduced by the calm; you want to find the problem that hasn't yet made it out into the open. But rather than looking for trouble, you're actually trying to avoid it. Nevertheless, don't take the easy way out because there's no satisfaction in maintaining the illusion of perfection. Sometimes the tiniest adjustment is all it takes to get the engine of progress purring again. Mark Twain said, ""Do the right thing. It will gratify some people and astonish the rest."""
sagittarius,2017-04-17,"You're often the one who is pouring over maps, cooking up the next great escape plan. However, you have no intention of going anywhere today. In fact, you're not interested in doing anything that distracts you from your predetermined agenda. Happily, showing up is most of the challenge now. But unfortunately, sticking to the script of your regular routine creates a new set of dilemmas when you realize there are better things you could be doing with your time. Gandhi taught, ""Action expresses priorities."""
capricorn,2017-04-17,"You are extremely serious today because you intuitively know how much you can do if you remain singularly focused. Thankfully, the hardworking Capricorn Moon gets you off to a good start, while the Sun's trine to your key planet Saturn is like a planetary insurance policy on your success. Everything you do falls into place without too much effort. But as the day wears on, the tension becomes palpable. Don't squander precious resources trying to fix something that's not broken. The awkward energy will come and go on its own, leaving your trail of accomplishments in its wake."
aquarius,2017-04-17,"No one knows how to read your energy today as you remain a bit of a mystery. Nevertheless, people begin to see how driven you are to make a social impact through your personal interactions. Authoritative Saturn harmonizes with the willful Sun in your 3rd House of Communication, giving you an extra set of tools as you step into a leadership role. But your followers will abandon you as quickly as they sign up if they think you are assuming too much power too fast. Abraham Lincoln said, ""Nearly all men can stand adversity, but if you want to test a man's character, give him power."""
pisces,2017-04-17,"Working extra hours now directly impacts your pocketbook. Whether you're punching the clock for wages or working on an idea that could lead to a new source of income, take advantage of your enterprising spirit while it's buzzing. Don't complain if you're missing out on more pleasurable pursuits; there's no room for distractions today. There will be plenty of time later on for stirring up mischief, but the current opportunities will knock on someone else's door if you miss your chance to make magic happen."
aries,2017-04-18,"Raising your expectations now doesn't necessarily make you more productive. In fact, your ambitious aspirations might only lead to disappointment or a sense of failure. Your domineering nature seeks an outlet in the real world, but someone could feel threatened by your show of power today. Soothing ruffled feathers may not be your favorite activity, yet well-aimed words can suddenly flip the dynamics in your favor. Isaac Newton wrote, ""Tact is the knack of making a point without making an enemy."""
taurus,2017-04-18,"You are goal-oriented today and will not take no for an answer, regardless of the resistance that you face. Paradoxically, the more driven you are now, the more obstacles you must overcome before reaching satisfaction. It seems as if you are on an endless roller coaster ride and you may quickly grow weary of being involved in one melodrama after another. But it might just be your attitude that needs a fix. Every unstable situation should be seen as an opportunity and not a crisis."
gemini,2017-04-18,"You are like a dog with a bone today; once you have a plan in mind you're unwilling to let go of it until you are good and ready. However, your ideas might not be as brilliant as you think. Unfortunately, you're not in the mood to compromise now and won't likely step down without a fight. Your obsession plays a significant role in the events unfolding around you. Author Chester Karrass wrote, ""You don't get what you deserve; you get what you negotiate."""
cancer,2017-04-18,"You're almost certain that someone is secretly trying to control your actions today. However, it's nearly impossible to tell where your logical thinking ends and your paranoia begins. There's nothing wrong with being cautious now; paying careful attention to the signs around you could keep you on track. Unfortunately, spinning yarns of fictional enemies won't help boost your productivity. Let your beliefs acquiesce to the facts if you want results."
leo,2017-04-18,"Setting your priorities early in the day enables you to build a schedule around your production goals. Unfortunately, your personal agenda could unravel if someone opposes your ideas at every possible point. However, you're not one to turn a minor squabble into a bigger one just so you can let it go. All bets are off if your wounded pride enters the picture. Maintaining objectivity isn't always a simple matter; Plato wrote, ""Opinion is the medium between knowledge and ignorance."""
virgo,2017-04-18,"Expressing your feelings is a logical and necessary behavior today, for your emotions keep you in the physical realms. Unfortunately, your words elicit strong reactions that aren't helpful to your cause. Nevertheless, you must slow down and respond to each situation as it arises or negativity will silently take root in hidden pockets. Thankfully, Pierre Omidyar reminds us, ""An honest, open environment can bring out the best in people."""
libra,2017-04-18,"Your home is like an active hotbed of unexpressed emotions. You don't want to miss anything that's happening now, but neither do you want to get involved in a situation that is like quicksand. You have the power to move in and out of conversations at will. Take your cues from others; they will let you know the best moment for your escape. Marketing guru Katherine Sullivan wrote, ""Stop telling yourself you don't know what to do. Yes, you do. Listen to your intuition and trust yourself."""
scorpio,2017-04-18,"You're not afraid of leaning on those in your immediate environment who seem the most stable today. However, you aren't always comfortable revealing your vulnerability and may only do so under duress. Get over your awkwardness; start tentatively by beginning the process of full disclosure with a few tidbits of information. Peter Drucker cautions, ""The most important thing in communication is hearing what isn't said."""
sagittarius,2017-04-18,"Although the air is full of birds singing, ""It's springtime,"" you aren't quite prepared for the new season. You're still working on tying up loose ends on an old project and you're not interested in following anyone else's timetable now. However, the future is tugging on your sleeve, beckoning you to let go of the past. Sometimes all you need is a fresh start, but the real secret of achieving success is being ready when your opportunity comes."
capricorn,2017-04-18,"People might appear to be avoiding you today, leaving you puzzled about what you did wrong. But the truth is your extreme emotions are the source of the current dilemma. Your behavior may be uncharacteristically volatile as you declare your intense feelings. However, the most powerful outbursts occur only after you deny your passion for too long. Ultimately, the more you hide from others, the greater the energetic imbalance. Don't wait until it's too late; express what's in your heart while you have the chance."
aquarius,2017-04-18,"You're no stranger to shocking others with your out-of-the-box behavior, but you might get more validation than you bargained for today. People react to you on two different levels. First, they are exhilarated by your sense of purpose. Second, your most ardent supporters project your words into the future and are inspired when they see their own potential. Luckily, your friends feel compelled to encourage your adventures. Anything is possible once your ideas are out in the open."
pisces,2017-04-18,"You have work to do managing your social networks today and need to maintain a single-mindedness until you are finished. Whether you're posting pictures or organizing a community event, it's nearly impossible to sit quietly on the sidelines now. Nevertheless, you could be so involved that you lose your sense of time, only to realize that you let important chores slip in the real world. Continuous vigilance prevents you from having to play a game of catch-up later on."
aries,2017-04-19,"You prefer to engage reality at full speed, especially when you're enthusiastic about your current activities. Nevertheless, it's time to take your foot off the accelerator so you can enjoy the scenery for a change. Unfortunately, relaxation won't come easily, even though the Sun plods into earthy Taurus today. Although you may believe it's a good idea to slow down now, it's not natural for you to apply the brakes. Give yourself a chance to acclimate to the new pace without much resistance. Stop and smell the flowers; life is not a race."
taurus,2017-04-19,"You are eager to establish a new rhythm that you can sustain throughout the season. Thankfully, the Sun's return to your sign boosts your energy today, bringing a new wave of confidence. Although you are certain you will finish whatever you begin, your rigidity increases when you start to realize your current strategy might not be good enough now. Obviously, it's just as crucial to be aware of your limitations as it is to have faith in yourself. However, focusing on your strengths rather than lamenting your weaknesses enables you to soldier on with a positive attitude."
gemini,2017-04-19,"These days you might find it refreshing when the craziness of life settles down, giving you time to catch your breath. Although you appreciate the leisurely pace, you may worry about losing ground now, especially since your key planet Mercury is deep into its retrograde phase. It seems as if the cosmos is conspiring against you, but it's unlikely you are the subject of a secret plot. Tighten the loose nuts and bolts of your plan before asking for a final review by your peers. There's no need to make excuses or embellish your story; the facts will speak for themselves."
cancer,2017-04-19,"Thankfully, you can already see how your life is improving in little ways, even if you don't fully trust your observations now. The Sun's shift into your 11th House of Hopes and Wishes shines a bright light on those things that make you happy. However, old fears may resurface to sabotage your current endeavors. Luckily, you no longer need to fight alone for the survival of your ideas; your friends are more than willing to stand up with you. Author Kiera Cass wrote, ""Accepting help is its own kind of strength."""
leo,2017-04-19,"Someone may surprise you with harsh criticism today that stands to threaten your professional status. Unfortunately, a misunderstanding could escalate into a conflict that turns sour, even if your behavior is impeccable. Naturally, it's unwise to admit fault if you did nothing wrong. However, an apology is in order if your actions made the situation any worse. Taking your fair share of the blame inspires others to do the same, clearing the air of negativity and freeing everyone to move on."
virgo,2017-04-19,"You may believe that you have a smarter answer and better idea for almost anything that pops up today. However, your self-confidence doesn't necessarily indicate that your plan is the right course of action. You could be so certain of your logic now that you're willing to fight anyone who disagrees with your strategy. Thankfully, taking time for reflection brings you back to your senses. There are no winners in an argument. Finding common ground gives you a platform on which to build a consensus that serves the needs of all."
libra,2017-04-19,"A flood of interesting and creative ideas weave a captivating spell in your mind today, yet you can't seem to express them because you're feeling a bit spacey. Normally, you excel at maintaining objectivity, but it's challenging to plant your feet on the ground now. Unfortunately, it's even harder to make your point if you obsess about being understood; worrying about what others think doesn't help your cause. The best thing you can do is to simply share what's on your mind and then let it go. Buddha taught, ""The root of suffering is attachment."""
scorpio,2017-04-19,"A casual conversation could morph into a power struggle today, even if your intention is to keep things simple. You may convince yourself that relationships should be peaceful when the Sun shifts into placid Taurus, but conflict returns once you remember that your zest for life is not something you can compromise away. Others might opt to take the easy way out, but not you. You're a Scorpio --  passion is crucial while comfort is not."
sagittarius,2017-04-19,"The pressure is on because endless conversations with coworkers must come to an end. Emotions are blown out of proportion if someone fears a solution won't be forthcoming. The more you try to talk around the awkwardness now, the more complicated everything becomes. Unfortunately, making sweeping statements that are based upon vague generalities only increases the tension. Instead, overcompensate by being picky about the tiniest details today. Increasing your specificity helps to resolve misunderstandings. Abolitionist Sojourner Truth wrote, ""Truth is powerful and it prevails."""
capricorn,2017-04-19,"Your strength is on the rebound and you're eager to demonstrate a higher level of productivity. However, there may be complicated communication issues that demand your attention today. You might be tempted to jump in without forethought so you can tackle a problem head-on, but spontaneity is not your friend now. Your irrepressible drive to gain closure on an emotional issue could warp your perspective, making it wiser to wait for objectivity to return before saying something you will regret. Steve Maraboli wrote, ""A lack of clarity could put the brakes on any journey to success."""
aquarius,2017-04-19,"Talking about your ideas while they are still in the development stage makes you nervous today. Meanwhile, you wish you felt comfortable enough to share your profound thoughts. However, your concerns aren't likely connected to current events; instead, memories of someone stealing your thunder are recycling in the present. Don't project your fears onto unsuspecting bystanders. Re-experiencing an old disappointment can be a significant part of a therapeutic healing process if you separate reality from your imagination. Tony Robbins teaches, ""If you change nothing, nothing will change."""
pisces,2017-04-19,"Although your dreams seem more vivid than ever, you won't drown in them today; the Sun enters earthy Taurus and anchors you to reality. However, turning your awareness inward is a tragic distraction now unless you link the metaphysical work to physical action. Listen closely to your intuition as it reveals the solutions to your mundane problems. Japanese guru Morihei Ueshiba taught, ""All life is a manifestation of the spirit."""
aries,2017-04-20,"Your sense of time is all messed up today. On one hand, you're in new territory now that the Sun has left Aries for the verdant meadows of Taurus. But messenger Mercury is retracing his steps into Aries, making you think the clocks are running backward. You've already been here, yet the calendar is marching on. Rather than attempting to untangle this esoteric mystery, focus on mundane matters that could positively impact your life. What is the universe trying to teach you by recycling the past? Henna Sohail wrote, ""The moment you learn the lesson, the test will be over."""
taurus,2017-04-20,"It's wonderful to reconnect with your place in the world but you're not so sure that everything is moving along according to schedule. In fact, you might be worried that your friends will choose a path into the future that doesn't include you. Your insecurities must be resolved now or things will get worse before they start to improve. The truth is your concerns are valid, but your conclusions are not. If you are navigating by your metaphysical center of gravity, someone else's judgments won't deter you from your course."
gemini,2017-04-20,"You're all over the map today, as if your metaphysical GPS is registering you everywhere at once. You actually like the feeling of being free from the constraints of space, but something holds you back anyhow. Don't bother trying to rationalize your current buzz to everyone else. In fact, the real magic in your life is now coming from parallel universes. Your only job to is to remain open to the experience. Nathanial Hawthorne wrote, ""A single dream is more powerful than a thousand realities."""
cancer,2017-04-20,"Discussions at the water cooler and chat conversations online are not distractions from your life. Rather than an accessory, they are part of the fabric to your world. In fact, an informal exchange could turn into a significant interaction that impacts the direction of your career. Don't be afraid of entertaining all possibilities now; stretching your mind by remaining open to the craziest ideas invites more options to enter the dialogue. From little things, big things grow."
leo,2017-04-20,"Although your main focus is clearing a path for professional development now, you might not be able to easily choose one way over the others. Each choice has benefits and complications, leaving you to untangle the good news from the bad. Forget about burying your head in books and losing yourself in the research. Instead, integrate your feelings with your abstract ideas; when your brain and your heart are working together, you derive benefits from both."
virgo,2017-04-20,"You have a fresh perspective on your daily routine, allowing you to consider changes that would have been impossible only a few days ago. Your objective now is not to maintain continuity; you really don't care what familiar patterns are being set aside in the name of progress and efficiency. Your newly adopted schedule may be an upgrade, but it helps to look at it as an experiment before making any permanent plans. Personal growth occurs when you're willing to be boldly innovative in your choices."
libra,2017-04-20,"Your newly reawakened interest in an old partner may be cause for contemplation today. Or, perhaps, a relationship issue that was recently put to rest is now back on your plate while mischievous Mercury retraces his steps into your 7th House of Others. Start a conversation while you have the chance; your thoughts need to be expressed or they will continue to wreak havoc from the twilight zone of your subconscious mind. Playwright George Bernard Shaw wrote, ""The single biggest problem in communication is the illusion that it has taken place."""
scorpio,2017-04-20,"Although you're interested in exploring powerful feelings with trusted friends now, it's difficult to get beyond the polite conversation to reach the good stuff. You are stuck on minor details and you can't seem to move on. Unfortunately, there might be nothing more to do in your current search for resolution. The rest of the story will surface on its own; the harder you push, the greater your frustration. It's times like these when you need to remember that discontent is your own creation. You won't discover what matters until you let go of what doesn't."
sagittarius,2017-04-20,"You have a message to deliver but you can't decide whether to shout it from a mountaintop or only tell a few of your closest friends. Your news may feel important enough that everyone should know. But you're worried about diluting your thoughts by spreading them before they are fully developed. Adopt a cautious approach now; your best ideas will only be better if you wait until Mercury turns direct. In the meantime, your work is cut out for you. Take full advantage of this opportunity to fine-tune your plans. Ralph Marston wrote, ""What you do today can improve all your tomorrows."""
capricorn,2017-04-20,"You measure your progress on a daily basis as an objective way to evaluate your work. Unfortunately, sometimes the most significant movement occurs in realms that are not visible. Don't be overly concerned about outward appearances while cerebral Mercury is visiting your 4th House of Foundations. Strengthen your infrastructure now so later developments have the support needed to make them endure. Ovid wrote, ""The cause is hidden; the effect is visible to all."""
aquarius,2017-04-20,"Your moodiness is apparent to everyone today and you wear it like a badge of honor. It's less about your changing emotions than it is about your commitment to transparency. Your logical approach encourages you to express all your feelings without concern for the consequences. Unfortunately, interpersonal relationships are often irrational and you might quickly regret your spoken words without any recourse to take them back. Writer Lori Palatnik observed, ""Those who boast about being brutally honest are usually more brutal than honest."""
pisces,2017-04-20,"A sudden wave of realism washes over you today, shifting your focus back to the mundane world. Analytical Mercury retrogrades into your 2nd House of Personal Resources, encouraging you to reassess your holdings. But this inquiry goes beyond money and material possessions, for your most important assets include your body and mind. Consider how  you can sustain your energy while putting it to good use. By making the best of all things you make the most of yourself."
aries,2017-04-21,"You might start your day with the greatest of intentions only to run into a wall that stops you dead in your tracks. Your initial reaction is to do an end run around the obstacle, but it turns out to be more substantial than you thought. Your fallback strategy takes longer to execute but is more reliable now than other flashier approaches. Methodical hard work enables you to overcome nearly any impediment to success. Mark Cuban said, ""Sweat equity is the most valuable equity there is."""
taurus,2017-04-21,"You wish you could take it easy today, but you have prior commitments you want to honor. Although you might rather carve out some time for rest and relaxation, you're fully capable of delaying satisfaction in the name of productivity. Nevertheless, your acceptance of the present situation still can turn to resentment if you see others make their exit. Don't be tempted by the illusion of immediate gratification. Abraham Lincoln said, ""You cannot escape the responsibility of tomorrow by evading it today."""
gemini,2017-04-21,"It's as if a new power plant came online today and all the electricity is being delivered to your door. Suddenly, you possess a seemingly inexhaustible supply of energy as physical Mars recharges your sign. But you might not have a stable enough infrastructure to handle the upgrade. Exercising self-discipline is your most effective strategy now; saying no gives you time to reinforce your foundation. The harder you work for something, the greater your sense of accomplishment when you achieve it."
cancer,2017-04-21,"Working long hours isn't very much fun, yet it may lead to personal satisfaction when you reflect on the minor sacrifices you made in the name of success. In fact, meeting deadlines can be turned into a game that you actually win today. But instead of crossing one item at a time off your list, make optimal use of enterprising Mars by jumping all around on your agenda. Shaking up your work schedule keeps your energy reserves high and prevents you from getting bored. Hank Williams, Jr. sang, ""Go on and do things your own way."" There's nothing to be gained by conforming to mediocrity."
leo,2017-04-21,"You're eager to slip away from work early so you can hang out with your friends today. But you're afraid that you might get caught and the results won't be pretty. Further analysis of the situation doesn't help; reconsidering your options is useless now because your heart still says do it while your brain says no. There's almost nothing so urgent it's worth losing your credibility. Inaction may seem easier on the surface but it grows harder as time passes. C.S. Lewis wrote, ""Integrity is doing the right thing, even when no one is watching."""
virgo,2017-04-21,"You have plenty of fresh ideas about how to further your career objectives. However, your innovative thoughts come quickly in clusters today, like schools of fish, making them nearly impossible to record. Your desire to capture a transitory moment could turn into an obsession now, making you emotionally unavailable to those close to you. Nevertheless, your current isolation is most likely a product of your own decisions. Letting go of your need to achieve results in the outer world can enrich your personal life. The choices you make determine your destiny."
libra,2017-04-21,"Your efforts at work might seem rather ineffectual today, but you probably are making more of an impact than you realize. Austere Saturn is blocking your key planet Venus, preventing you from experiencing the joy that is present in your life. Just because you're not as connected to people now doesn't mean the gulf is permanent or even real. It helps to employ the Golden Rule: treat others as you wish to be treated. The fear of losing love can be enough to push it away. Nelson Mandela claimed, ""I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it."""
scorpio,2017-04-21,"You may be bitten by a playful bug, leaving you with a repetitive happy tune in your head today. Your key planet Mars flies into breezy Gemini, enticing you to overcome your caution and assume a more flirtatious attitude with life in general. Simultaneously, a heavy Venus-Saturn square weighs on your heart, admonishing your emotions and warning you about the consequences of sharing your feelings indiscriminately. You are a master of the words you don't say and a slave to the ones you do."
sagittarius,2017-04-21,"Rigid expectations can prove to be your downfall in a relationship now. Thankfully, a friend or lover might teach you something very important about the benefits of flexibility. But this may not be an easy lesson while contentious Mars is camped out in your 7th House of Others. Resist the urge to overreact and erect boundaries; your walls protect your heart but they also keep those you love at a distance. Charles Darwin wrote, ""It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is the most adaptable to change."""
capricorn,2017-04-21,"You're most content when you're in control of your environment, yet you tend to withdraw emotionally when you find yourself standing in the midst of uncertainty. Anxiety builds when your sensory input conflicts with the facts as you know them. You don't know what to do when you can't resolve the differences, so you often quit before you even start. Unfortunately, this is like a self-fulfilling prophesy; results turn sour because you assume they will. Terrell Owens says, ""If you align expectations with reality, you will never be disappointed."""
aquarius,2017-04-21,"The further into your future you can imagine, the greater the chances for your success. However, your vision might be constricted now as naysaying Saturn blocks your view and frustrates your efforts to keep your eye on the distant prize. Instead of pushing up against an impenetrable barrier, exercise your strategic intelligence and temporarily halt your operation. Use this valuable time to reconsider your methods until the sky clears. Finnish journalist Erno Paasilinna wrote, ""It is also a victory to know when to retreat."""
pisces,2017-04-21,"Your emotions are subdued today but your actions are not. There is a disconnect between your desires and what you are willing to do to achieve satisfaction. Paradoxically, you seem to be spinning a lot of wheels, especially if you're unsure of what you want now. You might set a goal early in the day and head out in that direction, only to change your mind later. Postpone important decisions while you continue to explore your options. Voltaire wrote, ""Uncertainty is an uncomfortable position. But certainty is an absurd one."""
aries,2017-04-22,"You might feel safe in your bubble today, as if the real world is far away and cannot disturb your inner peace. Your dreams are so vivid that you could talk yourself into believing they are real. Nevertheless, you learn things that don't seem to jive with your current perspective and the more you try to justify your opinions now, the worse it gets. Remember, ignoring the truth doesn't change the facts; it just distracts you from your work. Practicality is the essential ingredient for making your dreams come true."
taurus,2017-04-22,"You may struggle to get a solid commitment from your friends about a group activity today. Your frustration grows because you want to firm up your own plans but can't proceed until you know who else is involved. Paradoxically, even if others drop out, you still might not be able to make up your mind. Don't blame the uncertainty in your life on anyone else. Elisabeth Elliot wrote, ""Muddled thinking inevitably results in muddled living."""
gemini,2017-04-22,"You need a day off to reassess your professional objectives. Unfortunately, your critical thinking is not as critical as you think today. You could make up information or bend the truth to prove your point without even realizing that you're deviating from reality. Nevertheless, you are in a powerful frame of mind since your visionary faculties are not restrained by insignificant things such as facts now. Ironically, your imagination is your superpower; whatever you dream you can manifest."
cancer,2017-04-22,"You may still be licking your wounds from a recent emotional skirmish, but the tide has shifted and you can see the clear skies ahead. In the meantime, your imagination is untethered from the events in your life. No one can prevent you from embarking on your physical or metaphysical travels now. But this newly found freedom is built on a lack of constraint, which could make you feel slightly nervous. Fight your fear or pay the price of regret. Basketball Coach Jerry Dunn said, ""Don't limit your challenges, challenge your limits."""
leo,2017-04-22,"Like most felines, you typically enjoy basking in the bright rays of the radiant Sun. However, a cluster of planets lurking in your mysterious 8th House of Transformation enchants you with the shadows between dark and light. Your sense of reality is being tested as the limits of your awareness are stretched. Avoid the temptation to say too much about this evolutionary process because the magic remains in the unknown and the unknowable. Author Elbert Hubbard wrote, ""He who does not understand your silence will probably not understand your words."""
virgo,2017-04-22,"Concentrating on one path throughout the day is highly unlikely because exciting options continue to magically materialize in front of you. Walking into one unresolved dilemma after another is enough to make you weary now, but warrior Mars in your 10th House of Public Status counterbalances any thoughts about taking the easy way out. Nevertheless, just as you reach a conclusion, a close friend or partner dreams up another possible avenue to explore. Choose carefully; you're one decision away from a totally different life."
libra,2017-04-22,"It appears as if you've misplaced the address of your current destination and your GPS is on the blink. Obviously, your chances are not looking good if you are unsure of where you are or which direction you're going. Unfortunately, you won't likely locate your missing information today, so it makes more sense to stop trying so hard to sort everything out. Sidney J. Harris wrote, ""The time to relax is -- when you don't have the time for it."""
scorpio,2017-04-22,"Although you may be desperately trying to simplify your life, you don't appreciate people telling you how to do it. Receiving a well-intended ultimatum couched as constructive advice from someone close to you is not perceived as a friendly gesture. In fact, you wish your supporters would keep their good intentions to themselves now. If anyone continues to meddle in your business, you might need to set him straight by restating your boundaries in no uncertain terms. Today's clarity paves the road to tomorrow's success."
sagittarius,2017-04-22,"Your home is truly your castle today and you are happy to explore the untapped resources within your imagination. Whether you choose to hide from the real world by watching movies all day or digging into a long-anticipated novel, the dreamy Moon-Neptune combo in your 4th House of Personal Roots offers you a perfect escape route. Although this introspective behavior isn't a permanent condition, you can utilize its magic to envision your ideal future. Professor Mason Cooley wrote, ""Fantasy mirrors desire. Imagination reshapes it."""
capricorn,2017-04-22,"Although you are most often a realist, you're a natural teller of tales today. You can spin yarns that fascinate adults and children of all ages. However, problems mount when you mix up the subject matter of your stories with actual events. Unfortunately, people will believe nearly anything you share because of your well-known penchant for the facts. Mark Twain wrote, ""Truth is stranger than fiction, but it is because fiction is obliged to stick to possibilities; truth is not."""
aquarius,2017-04-22,"Ironically, you could be misled by your own beliefs today. The reflective Moon's alignment with deceptive Neptune occurs in your 2nd House of Core Values, warping your perspective just enough to deviate from reality. Adhering to a set of principles is admirable, but you lose respect when you start to stretch the truth to make your creed more credible to others. Without change there can be no growth. Without growth there can be no future."
pisces,2017-04-22,"You are like a boat adrift on the seas of your dreams today. Thankfully, this day of wandering through your fantasies can revitalize your life with a much-needed shot of inspiration. However, you could miss the positive benefits of this magical detour from reality if you're afraid of losing grasp of time. Fighting against the flow of the images floating in your mind is a waste of mental energy. Embrace the potential of creativity instead of suppressing it. You are what you believe; your only limit is you."
aries,2017-04-23,You can't decide whether to give up on your search for happiness or to jump for joy because you believe satisfaction is within your grasp. Chances are your exuberance will lead you forward until you experience a setback that you take to heart. But a disappointment is not the end of the world and probably isn't even as troubling as it seems in the moment. Fill your day with activities that leave little time for worry or doubt. Negativity is a woeful misuse of your imagination.
taurus,2017-04-23,"You think you're doing everything right today, so you can't understand why you still feel like an outsider. Unfortunately, overcompensating doesn't seem to change the dynamics; being extra nice only makes others suspicious of your motives. Attempting to outsmart the cosmic energy won't help you fit in now and could zap your confidence in the process. Remain consistently true to yourself in all social interactions. Authenticity will win you fans sooner than you expect."
gemini,2017-04-23,"You have a long list of things to do today and you're eager to hit the ground running. You don't want to waste any time because you can imagine the wonderful sense of relief you will feel once your obligations are fulfilled and you are free to relax. However, your schedule might start to crumble when you realize that you bit off more than you can chew now. Letting go of your expectations early in the day saves you from falling short on a serious deadline. Nevertheless, people with good intentions make promises; people with good character keep them."
cancer,2017-04-23,"Your energy doesn't express directly today, making others unsure about where you stand. However, you want to be heard and could make multiple attempts at communicating your perspective. But the noise of the cosmos is blowing up a storm that threatens your emotional security and drowns out your voice. You aren't happy about being put on the spot; you might even seriously consider walking away from the whole situation. Don't give up until you exhaust all options. A river cuts through rock, not because of its power, but because of its persistence."
leo,2017-04-23,"Breaking an old pattern can be challenging for you proud Lions, especially if a current situation reminds you of a recent failure. But today's events are quite different than yesterday's crises. Nevertheless, residual feelings probably do more to hold you back from the potential of love than to protect your heart. It requires courage to reveal your human frailties. Brene Brown wrote, ""Vulnerability is the birthplace of innovation, creativity and change."""
virgo,2017-04-23,"A relationship may seem strained today because someone close to you is emotionally withdrawn. Unfortunately, the more you push for reconnection, the less likely you are to succeed. Appealing to their sense of loyalty only widens the gulf. Everyone needs a little space now and then. Turn the tables on your world by depersonalizing current events. If people are retreating from you, let them. ""No resistance to the outcome"" could be the mantra that flips the energy in your favor."
libra,2017-04-23,"You long for a day off when you can drift in and out of the real world without your regular pile of cares. Much to your chagrin, you might feel the heat if someone accuses you of not holding up your end of an agreement. You know you must do the mature thing by jumping in and tackling your chores, even if you're fighting an internal battle against your commitments. However, it's your struggle that makes your work so difficult, not the tasks themselves. Change your attitude, change your reality."
scorpio,2017-04-23,"Too much planning takes the spontaneity out of your day. However, setting aside preexisting plans may be the catalyst for turning a boring day into one filled with excitement. But you can't just walk away from promises you made. Juggling your responsibilities with your desires is a never-ending task, but a little cosmic shuffling enables you to serve two masters now. Hillary Clinton said, ""Don't confuse having a career with having a life."""
sagittarius,2017-04-23,"Much to the surprise of those who know you well, you actually might want to stay home and chill out today. Scheduling as little as possible gives you a greater ability to control your own time throughout the day. But you may grow concerned that you made a mistake when you realize your friends are playing and you're missing all of the fun. Thankfully, you can join the party later in the day after you take care of your own personal needs. Balance is the secret to your good nature."
capricorn,2017-04-23,"Although it may be a day of rest for some people, you are unwilling to throw away an opportunity to finish some chores. You can work in a non-linear fashion today, exhibiting great flexibility about which task you start first and jumping around from one to another before any are completed. It might appear as if your energy is scattered, but this is just an illusion. Follow your instincts and don't bother explaining your methods to others. The proof is in the pudding."
aquarius,2017-04-23,"You're unable to contain your imagination today. In fact, your fantasies are so strong they could pull you off track. Although you might try to narrow your focus, your thoughts continue to drift into magical realms. Rather than resisting your current mental wanderlust, postpone your mundane tasks for another day. Pursue conversations that are out of the box; the more philosophically edgy, the better. Following your dreams is the fastest way to find yourself."
pisces,2017-04-23,"You are in your element today as you bounce around from one wild thought to another, without worrying about your impact in the real world. Your dreams have a life of their own -- and there's no reason to try to limit their expression. Take your craziest ideas out for a ride, just to see what it feels like. Although you might experience a mid-afternoon bout with self-doubt, it won't last. Don't cave by succumbing to the pressures of life. Aristotle wrote, ""There is no great genius without some touch of madness."""
aries,2017-04-24,"You are all too familiar with people telling you to slow down. Honestly, you're sick and tired of being told to think before you speak. Nevertheless, your critics are friendly today and you welcome their sage advice. Although the impetuous Aries Moon escalates your sense of urgency, a pragmatic Mercury-Saturn trine allows cautionary messages to hit home without triggering your defenses. Mark Twain wrote, ""An open mind leaves a chance for someone to drop a worthwhile thought in it."""
taurus,2017-04-24,"You know that it's sometimes wiser to say nothing than to fill the silence with meaningless words. On another day you might jump in and express your feelings, but you don't want to give too much away  today. Nevertheless, remaining quiet leads others to believe you have something to hide. Instead of withdrawing, push beyond your comfort zone and speak your piece. You can become someone's superhero by sharing your thoughts in a way that touches the truth for those who can't find their voice."
gemini,2017-04-24,"You're often quite comfortable starting a sentence before you know where it's going to end up. However, your key planet Mercury is working in cahoots with calculating Saturn today, advising you to consider all the ramifications of your words before you open your mouth. Writing down your thoughts before sharing them can help you organize your ideas so others are more likely to agree with your perspective. Zig Ziglar wrote, ""Success occurs when opportunity meets preparation."""
cancer,2017-04-24,"Your interactions tend to grow emotional only when you're in the company of those you trust. You're unable to decide how much you want to reveal today because you're afraid of placing yourself in a vulnerable position. It's prudent to keep your feelings in check now, since you could easily overwhelm people with your intensity, especially at work. Your associates may not share your desire to dredge water up from the bottom of the well. Taking the rational route enables you to make your point without upsetting or offending anyone along the way."
leo,2017-04-24,"You want to put your best foot forward and still let people know exactly what's on your mind. However, you may catch your audience off guard with your powerful feelings. Your delivery can be so convincing that no one will suspect the complexity of thoughts and emotions that are swirling around just beneath the surface. Don't second guess your judgment; if you think it's wise to keep something to yourself, just do it. Katherine Neville wrote, ""Privacy, like eating and breathing, is one of life's basic requirements."" Where you draw the line is your decision alone."
virgo,2017-04-24,"You can effectively use your analytical skills to improve your chances for success at nearly every intersection of life. Although you might try to avoid the subjective biases that creep into a conversation when emotions cloud logic, your thinking can still be convoluted at times. Fortunately, your key planet Mercury creates a flowing trine with industrious Saturn today, further improving your ability to discern the truth. But satisfaction will elude you unless you  concentrate on reaching your goals. Thankfully, from hard work comes great rewards."
libra,2017-04-24,"You can improve your chances of relationship satisfaction if you take the time to create a plan with your partner today. Although success isn't guaranteed, your words clearly convey your intentions while your 7th House of Others is supported by karmic Saturn. Instead of pie-in-the-sky dreaming, stick to the most pragmatic issues. But talking is only half the game; you must listen and assimilate what you hear to truly benefit from this mutual exchange. Communication is a two-way street."
scorpio,2017-04-24,"You are looking at your job through a very practical lens today. Analytical Mercury and ambitious Saturn work together to ensure your financial success as long as you have a solid plan. There's no time to waste on idle fantasies while this cosmic opportunity anchors your dreams in the real world. Visualizing your life as you want it is the first step to creating your ideal future, but the rest of the journey is all about determination and hard work. Tony Robbins says, ""Life's greatest rewards are reserved for those who demonstrate a never-ending commitment to act until they achieve."""
sagittarius,2017-04-24,"You are being offered important life lessons today as you search for meaning in whatever projects you undertake. The cosmos is pushing you into a more contemplative state of being and you're wise to go along for the ride. You might want to express your joy, but it's more beneficial to first explore its origins. Grab every opportunity you can to dig your way further beneath the surface. Happily, your natural tendency to rise will bring you back up into more lighthearted realms soon enough. Out of difficulties grow miracles; out of shadows comes light."
capricorn,2017-04-24,"You may want to spend more time alone while there are critical issues requiring your undivided attention now. Although you are in a positive frame of mind, you can't afford to be distracted by frivolous play. Instead of making a total retreat, consider discussing your concerns with the people who you trust the most. The feedback you receive can be instrumental in your ongoing analysis. Don't let your fear of vulnerability keep you from opening your heart."
aquarius,2017-04-24,You might lose patience with people who refuse to take you seriously today. You mean business and aren't interested in wasting time with small talk as sobering Saturn trines communicator Mercury in your 3rd House of Information. You need solid data to make important decisions and don't have the energy to explain your motives to everyone who asks. Be direct and to the point; continue to work in the manner that makes sense to you. Your only consideration now is getting positive results.
pisces,2017-04-24,"All the practical issues weighing on your mind make it nearly impossible to relax and enjoy yourself today. But postponing the good times makes sense if you need to take care of business. After all, you're motivated by achieving professional success while clever Mercury harmonizes with ambitious Saturn in your 10th House of Status. Nevertheless, it's tempting to get so wrapped up in your concrete goals that you forget how important it is to have a little fun. Musician Billy Cox said, ""Work while others play so you can play while others work."""
aries,2017-04-25,"You can get so wrapped up in your current activities that your forget about everyone else. The Moon's run-in with shocking Uranus in your spontaneous sign releases hidden tension wherever it is stored. Unfortunately, you're not the only person with an agenda and your lack of concern for others can create immediate waves that end up rocking everyone's boat. Checking in with those in your sphere of influence may be all it takes to sidestep an unnecessary crisis. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure."
taurus,2017-04-25,"You are at your finest when you move methodically toward your destination. But something at work could spark your imagination so suddenly today that you momentarily forget your regular modus operandi. Fortunately, recognizing the potential danger of impetuosity enables you to minimize the damage. Acknowledge your excitement, but don't rush into a new venture. Even the best idea will develop into something better if you stick with your tried-and-true formula for success."
gemini,2017-04-25,"Nearly everyone seems a bit on edge today and you secretly like it. You get the strange feeling that something extraordinary could happen at any given moment. Nevertheless, you grow tired of waiting for someone else to make a move as your restlessness increases. It's almost as if it's your job now to wake up those who are asleep at the wheel. Unfortunately, you could inadvertently kick a hornet's nest if you are careless with your words. Author Pearl Cleage wrote, ""Discomfort is always a necessary part of the process of enlightenment."""
cancer,2017-04-25,"An unbalanced situation at work may be creating a funky tension between you and your coworkers. It seems as if it's best to ignore your feelings today, since your words are likely to be upsetting to others. Unfortunately, your silence only feeds the negative energy. Ironically, speaking up is the fastest path to reestablishing equilibrium. It's your turn to strike like lightning and shock others with the truth. Hopefully, the calm after the storm will be proof you did the right thing."
leo,2017-04-25,"You want the freedom to choose a new direction in life, and will bristle if anyone tries to tell you what to do today. If you want to quit your job and move to a tropical island, it's your decision. In the end, it doesn't matter whether or not you actually embark on a new adventure or mission now; what's important is your ability to explore all your options without outside interference. Your best friends will understand your motives and encourage your dreams, rather than bursting your bubble. Cicero wrote, ""What then is freedom? The power to live as one wishes."""
virgo,2017-04-25,"You might surprise a close friend or lover with an unexpected emotional disclosure. At first, your honesty is shocking and the other person might be at a loss for words. However, your goal isn't to manipulate anyone or create an awkward discomfort. You just want to come clean by getting your feelings out into the open. Taking it slowly allows time for your message to sink in rather than be deflected. A heartfelt conversation could be a significant turning point in a relationship that's destined to matter."
libra,2017-04-25,"You are not a happy camper if someone close to you breaks his or her word today. Although there may be a justifiable reason for their actions, your disappointment is obvious. There are times when your cool and collected approach to an emotional situation is the best possible response. However, it's critical to let others know exactly how you feel now, even if it makes everyone uncomfortable. You don't have to let anyone off the hook. Your current job is to be true to your own reactions and speak directly from your heart."
scorpio,2017-04-25,"Although your emotions run deep, you're usually capable of managing the intensity so it doesn't have a negative impact at work. However, your filter for social acceptability isn't working now; you'll express it if you feel it. The good news is that others will know exactly where you stand on a subject. The bad news is they may not like your opinion at all. Nevertheless, don't hold any punches today. The Moon's shift into sensible Taurus will smooth things out later. There's no need to trade in your authenticity for approval."
sagittarius,2017-04-25,"People can count on you today, but not for your mature and responsible behavior. In fact, the heightened activity in your 5th House of Fun and Games is a reminder of how easy it is to forget about your responsibilities while you're in the pursuit of something more enjoyable than work. Fortunately, it's not really necessarily to choose one over the other now. You can find ways to express yourself creatively even while meeting your obligations. It's time to be like Tom Sawyer and turn the burden of your chores into the magic of a good time."
capricorn,2017-04-25,"In order to take advantage of an amazing opportunity today, you may need to extend well beyond your normal comfort zone. You're not one to retreat from hard work; you are willing to do whatever is necessary to achieve your goals. Paradoxically, you prefer to push boundaries without taking a risk now. Although this strategy sounds good in theory, in practice it's impossible. Facing your fears and breaking through your own resistance enables you to reach for the stars."
aquarius,2017-04-25,"Your schedule appears to be out of control before you even get started today. Although you know you won't be able to do everything that's on your agenda, you're willing to try anyhow. But it's going to require more than a positive attitude to fit everything into place and you could be setting yourself up for trouble later on. Postponing the non-essentials is a smart strategy. Instead of attempting to perform a miracle, set priorities and only bite off what you can realistically chew."
pisces,2017-04-25,"Although lots of money-making ideas pop into your head today, it's difficult to know which ones are worth pursuit. Every thought sounds more lucrative than the previous one as the Moon conspires with intelligent Mercury and innovative Uranus in your 2nd House of Income. But even your best plans could meet unexpected resistance from your peers who seem to be withholding their support. Don't give up just because there are obstacles in your path. Frank Lloyd Wright wrote, ""I know the price of success: dedication, hard work and an unremitting devotion to the things you want to see happen."""
aries,2017-04-26,"It may seem as if your life is easier to manage today because you're at the top of your game. You don't need to push yourself very hard to demonstrate your competence while you make your tired old routines look completely new and different. But the easygoing Taurus New Moon in your 2nd House of Self-Esteem can lead to overconfidence, and too much self-assuredness creates its own kind of trouble. Sloppy logic inspires you to jump to conclusions and tempts you to take unnecessary risks. Stick to the basics and the details will quietly fall into place."
taurus,2017-04-26,"It's fantastic that you can be so productive now, even if the countless distractions in your life won't leave you alone. You're so wrapped up in your work while the pragmatic Taurus New Moon grounds the energy in your 1st House of Self that no one is able to talk you out of your current ambitions. Your infamous bullheadedness emboldens you to plow through obstacles and overcome resistance. With a little extra effort, you will surpass your own expectations; aim high and focus on your target with singular intent."
gemini,2017-04-26,"An odd mixture of mundane responsibilities and hopeful visions can confuse your progress. The  Taurus New Moon shadows your 12th House of Spiritual Mystery, increasing tension between reality and fantasy. However, the earthy Taurus energy blesses you with enough stability to manifest form from an apparently unreachable dream. Don't withdraw from the amorphous realms of unlimited potential because whatever transforms into your future starts within your imagination. Plant your garden and watch it grow."
cancer,2017-04-26,"Solid opportunities to build enduring relationships with your peers add richness to your world. The sensible Taurus New Moon highlights your 11th House of Groups, strengthening your social network and increasing your popularity. Nevertheless, it's up to you to make the first move. Taking the lead and sharing your goals shifts the dynamics and turns a casual acquaintance into a lasting friendship. It may seem risky to initiate a conversation, but a well-intended overture to the right person could benefit you for a long time to come. If you don't take a chance, you don't stand a chance."
leo,2017-04-26,"Your inspirational words can motivate people to continue on their individual paths with great determination. Thankfully, the reliable Taurus New Moon falls in your 10th House of Status, making it easier to express yourself on the job. Although you can succinctly explain your complicated recipe for success, you still worry about your inability to execute your own strategy. Unfortunately, playing the role of an entertaining speaker isn't enough to make your dreams come true. Face your fears and lead by example. Don't be afraid to fail; be afraid not to try."
virgo,2017-04-26,"You may be considering a major decision to alter the direction of your life. Or, perhaps, you're overwhelmed with an array of projects at work. In either case, it helps to break down the dilemma into several smaller pieces and then attack them one at a time. Fortunately, the earthy Taurus New Moon adds structure to your 9th House of Big Ideas, enabling you to manage the complexity. Avoid the temptation to treat your agenda as a sprint because your destination is not as close as you think. Sustainability is your friend."
libra,2017-04-26,"Although Libra the Scales is all about creating balance in relationships, you crave more than harmonious interactions with others. The Taurus New Moon emphasizes your 8th House of Transformation, requiring you to sink beneath the social veneer. Unless you're willing to go deep, you'll likely be left feeling emotionally unsatisfied. You want to experience all the pleasures that life has to offer. Unfortunately, you could appear desperate if you act too obsessively. Intimacy is built on a strong foundation when it develops naturally on its own."
scorpio,2017-04-26,"Your relationships are often complicated by your tendency to feel things in the extreme. You aren't one to moderate your passions just to put someone at ease. However, the practical Taurus New Moon focuses on your 7th House of Partners, encouraging you to seek salvation from life's complexities through an easygoing interaction with someone you admire. You are being offered the gift of emotional security, even if you're afraid of being trapped by the simplicity. Be happy; relinquish your attachment to drama and overcome your fear of boredom. Love isn't meant to be so hard."
sagittarius,2017-04-26,"There's a pile of things to do on your desk and attacking it immediately enables you to finish it sooner. But beginning your work is only the first step. It's critical to establish a sustainable pace and create a consistent schedule since the dependable Taurus New Moon influences your 6th House of Habits. Starting a new job is a no-brainer now with planets kicking up dust in feisty Aries and flighty Gemini. Nevertheless, turning your excitement into an ongoing practice assures your success. Jim Rohn said, ""Discipline is the bridge between goals and accomplishment."""
capricorn,2017-04-26,"You appear to express yourself without much forethought today, but you need a viable strategy if you want to be a success. The Taurus New Moon occurs in your 5th House of Creativity, helping you justify a calculated risk. However, you must follow through on whatever you begin or your efforts will be pointless. Under the right circumstances, trying something new can be a lot of fun. But to be safe, come back to your senses and step through your plan one more time before doing something you might regret. Haste makes waste."
aquarius,2017-04-26,"Although you can be an innovative thinker, your lack of flexibility makes it difficult to integrate the amazing ideas that continue to spark your imagination. Fortunately, your friends and coworkers are probably quite supportive of your efforts now. But the obstinate Taurus New Moon grows roots in your 4th House of Foundations, convincing you that your point of view is the only relevant one. Nevertheless, remaining open to feedback lightens your load and makes your work much less of a challenge. An old proverb declares, ""A problem shared is a problem halved."""
pisces,2017-04-26,"Thankfully, the hectic pace is settling down, but the noise is far from quiet. Don't wait any longer; it's time to reflect on all the recent events before you take a few deep breaths and turn your attention elsewhere. But moving on isn't about escaping the present moment; it's about interacting with others while you adjust to your current position. The Taurus New Moon stabilizes  your 3rd House of Communication, helping to ground the energy around you. Every conversation is an opportunity to learn; every person you meet is a teacher."
aries,2017-04-27,"There are many ways to improve your life and today you're likely to do it by exercising financial control. Your attention naturally gravitates to increasing your income while the Moon is camped out in your 2nd House of Money. However, it's not just a matter of making a plan because resistance surfaces when you tell others what you're going to do. Back up a few steps and rethink your approach. Decreasing expenditures may be a more reliable way of boosting your cash reserves now. Ben Franklin wrote, ""Beware of little expenses; a small leak will sink a great ship."""
taurus,2017-04-27,"You want people to recognize your contribution to the group effort today. But they might not be aware of what you are personally sacrificing in order to be a significant part of the team. Nevertheless, it's less important to be acknowledged by others than it is for you to see concrete results from your work. Harry S. Truman, a fellow Taurus, wrote, ""It is amazing what you can accomplish if you do not care who gets the credit."""
gemini,2017-04-27,"You're not sure why someone is on your case today, especially since you're just quietly going about your business. However, you might not be able to see yourself clearly while the obstinate Moon plods through your 12th House of Invisibility. Nevertheless, your current behavior may reveal a hidden agenda that steps on the toes of your coworkers. Michael Foucault wrote, ""Where there is power, there is resistance."" The energy lifts later in the day when the Moon shifts into your sign. Thankfully, you will soon see a light at the end of the tunnel."
cancer,2017-04-27,"You can rely on your friends and coworkers to support your efforts today. Magically, people seem to show up with the right skill or piece of information just as you need it. Thankfully, the Moon's receptivity in your 11th House of Networks enables your actions to resonate within your larger group or community. Nevertheless, you might worry that trouble is brewing beneath the surface. There is no reason to be shy; ask questions to bring unspoken feelings out into the open. Author Terry Pratchett wrote, ""The best research you can do is to talk to people."""
leo,2017-04-27,"Your prime directive today is to seek ways to stabilize your place in your profession or on the job. Happily, the steady Taurus Moon's presence in your 10th House of Career creates harmonious hookups with powerful Pluto and resourceful Venus, giving you the communication tools you need to accomplish your goal. You can rely on receiving the support you want as long as you don't step into anyone else's territory. You may not be looking for trouble, but be prepared to find it if you push your agenda too far."
virgo,2017-04-27,"Sometimes taking a major trip is tricky for you detail-oriented Virgos because balancing the big picture with the specifics can be challenging. Happily, the practical Taurus Moon stabilizes your 9th House of Faraway Places, inspiring you to dream about an upcoming vacation. You don't need to make concrete plans yet; just imagining the journey is enough to put a smile on your face. Oprah Winfrey said, ""The biggest adventure you can take is to live the life of your dreams."""
libra,2017-04-27,"You are relentless in your drive to uncover the facts today. Perhaps something puzzling at work is pointing to a whole layer of intrigue you are not yet aware of. Or maybe a close friend or partner's behavior has raised your eyebrows because it doesn't fit in with what you know. Go ahead and delve into the unknown, even if it makes you uncomfortable. Albert Camus wrote, ""Always go too far because that's where you'll find the truth."""
scorpio,2017-04-27,"Hiding your annoyance becomes more challenging as someone close to you grows more obstinate. You fully respect people who passionately defend a cause, but the fixed Taurus Moon's visit to your 7th House of Others seems to make everyone stubborn for no reason at all. Unfortunately, engaging in a discussion to resolve the issue will likely only deepen the conflict, rather than squash it. It takes courage to walk away but sometimes it's the most intelligent strategy. Coco Chanel said, ""Don't spend time beating a wall, hoping to transform it into a door."""
sagittarius,2017-04-27,"People seem to be moving faster today and you're not sure you can keep up with them. Acknowledging that your agenda is different from everyone else's allows you to detach and set your own pace. You won't likely run ahead of the pack while the plodding Taurus Moon is hanging out in your 6th House of Service. Nevertheless, you still have an excellent chance of reaching your destination as long as you don't get swept up in anyone's drama. Author Dodinsky wrote, ""You can find inspiration from others, but determination is solely your responsibility."""
capricorn,2017-04-27,"You're ready for a bit of lighthearted fun today, but you could anger others if you just run off and leave them to their own devices. Ironically, you are better scheduling your playtime if you are serious about making it happen. You need structure wrapped around your unstructured time now or you might feel lost. It's easier for you to be spontaneous when it's written on your calendar. Fortunately, once you can justify your exit, you're not likely to look back. Sometimes an ""oops"" is better than a ""what if"" when it comes to personal satisfaction."
aquarius,2017-04-27,"It's much easier to head out into the world today if you know that your family is safe and everything is stable on the home front. The back-to-basics Taurus Moon is bringing a new wave of dependability to your 4th House of Emotional Security. Although you can count on those closest to you, the more casual interactions still stir up unrest. Nevertheless, the most difficult conversations will produce the most amazing breakthroughs. Psychologist Alfred Adler wrote, ""The chief danger in life is that you may take too many precautions."""
pisces,2017-04-27,"You're tired of bouncing around from one task to another and look forward to settling into one project today. The solid Taurus Moon creates its own momentum, making it difficult to keep changing your focus now. Although you want to stay on a single topic, Luna is busy dancing in your 3rd House of Distractions, pulling conversations hither, thither and yon. It's best to accept the current energy as it is, for this cosmic conflict won't likely dissipate until the weekend. Lao Tzu wrote, ""Anticipate the difficult by managing the easy."""
aries,2017-04-28,"A refreshing wave of energy washes through your life today and you are exhilarated by the variety of options on your doorstep. Although you're tempted to talk about your brilliant ideas, it's not wise to let others in on your plans yet. Instead of openly sharing what's on your mind, it's more efficient to keep your intentions quiet until you're sure of your new direction. Cultivate your newfound power by conserving it until you're ready to make your move."
taurus,2017-04-28,"You've been fighting an uphill battle and running into one obstacle after another. However, the energy shifts today, opening a path to an exciting new spectrum of possibilities. Your friends might surprise you with support, but you can't plan on their consistency now that retrograde Mercury joins unpredictable Uranus in independent Aries. Rather than trying to dazzle everyone with your innovative ideas, step back and take time to further develop your thoughts before moving forward. Persistence and patience are a winning combination."
gemini,2017-04-28,"You are eager to say yes to a political cause, a social invitation or a new project at work now that your mind is on fire with enthusiasm. Your participation is coveted partly because your positive attitude spreads so quickly. You have all the makings of a natural born leader. But don't let anyone persuade you into joining the crowd unless you are following your heart. Set boundaries with a smile. There's absolutely no reason to apologize for honoring your needs first."
cancer,2017-04-28,"Someone enters your life today with a thrilling opportunity that seems too good to be true. Unfortunately, it probably is. Much to your chagrin, progress on all projects is excruciatingly slow now and nothing much will change the dynamics, unless you decide to put in the extra time and energy. Thankfully, everything speeds up once messenger Mercury aligns with authoritative Saturn. Proactively drag potential problems into the open before they turn things sour. As is often the case, clearing the air is a cathartic process for everyone involved."
leo,2017-04-28,"Your future is calling and you're ready to take charge when given a chance. You can impress people with your stellar show by setting your sites on a lofty goal today, and then deliberately moving in that direction. However, shortcuts will not be rewarded, so start at the very beginning and take each step in the correct order. There's no reason to stress about deadlines since everything is likely to take longer than you expect anyway. Time may be an illusion but your heart-centered authenticity endures."
virgo,2017-04-28,"Recent disappointment won't stop you from doing important business today. However, you may need a remedial course in how to sustain a healthy level of confidence. Reevaluate the practicality of your goals from an objective perspective and be prepared to put in long hours of concentrated work to achieve them. Success might not come as easily as you wish, but it's assuredly worth the effort if you really want to make a difference. Nelson Mandela said, ""It always seems impossible until it's done."""
libra,2017-04-28,"You can express yourself so smoothly that you might think it's possible to circumvent authority. However, you still may experience a setback now if your current plans are overly ambitious. Nevertheless, you don't like people delaying your progress or being told no for arbitrary reasons. Turning on the diplomatic charm slips you past the resistance today. Fortunately, engaging in honest dialogue sets the stage for a mutually beneficial compromise and a harmonious working environment."
scorpio,2017-04-28,"Navigating through the tangle of relationships issues is complex enough on its own, yet an intense interaction with someone could make interpersonal dynamics even more complicated today. You may be scheming to control the information as you grow more aware of the differences of opinions. Nevertheless, pushing for resolution right away is not wise because an assertive tactic might precipitate an emotional meltdown. Communicate your position as clearly as possible and then just let it go. Keep your heart open and move on."
sagittarius,2017-04-28,"Your emotional detachment enables you to explore a complex situation at work today. However, trying to convince people of your moral superiority could alienate the very same folks you want to count as your allies. Rethink your strategy before deep-diving directly into the most intense topic on the table. Allow the discussion to flow on its own without manipulating the direction. You might be shocked to find yourself arriving at your appointed destination much sooner than you expect."
capricorn,2017-04-28,"You may have to acquiesce to someone who successfully wrestles the controls away from you today. Nevertheless, you're not happy if anyone impedes your progress. You could be tempted to fight back at first, but defensive maneuvers will only create more problems than they are worth. Instead of setting up an adversarial situation, it's more productive to cooperate so you're not wasting energy in needless competition. Choose your battles wisely or you might lose the war."
aquarius,2017-04-28,"You might feel as if time is running out and unexpected panic ensues if you realize how many loose ends you still must tie up. Some tasks may just have to be left unfinished. Resetting your priorities early in the day makes more sense than waiting until you're under pressure. Avoid temptations to struggle against the current constraints; instead, let go of your previous expectations and move on. Your ability to change with the changing circumstances is your secret weapon today."
pisces,2017-04-28,"Current financial struggles might require you to be fiscally conservative today. Although proceeding with caution may be the most sensible approach for now, it's not the best long-term solution. Tightening the controls is prudent at first because you can't spend what you don't have. Nevertheless, the problem is convoluted and will benefit from a multiple-tiered strategy. Investing some money in your future can be just as important as saving it in the present."
aries,2017-04-29,"It seems as if one thing after another happens today without leaving you time in between to collect your thoughts. Although someone else might find this pace exhausting, you find it exhilarating and eagerly look ahead in anticipation to the next activity. No matter how upbeat you may be now, there are still real limits to your apparently bottomless well of stamina as sobering Saturn stops the interactive Gemini Moon in your 3rd House of Distractions. Nevertheless, you probably agree with Thomas Carlyle who wrote, ""I've got a great ambition to die of exhaustion rather than boredom."""
taurus,2017-04-29,"You believe it's going to be nothing but smooth sailing today, so it's a surprise when you suddenly run into a wall. Something happens when the same people who were supporting you cool off and resist your efforts instead. Don't try to avoid the criticism you receive when it is actually a gift in disguise. What you learn now can ultimately increase your confidence, offering you the key to a happier and more productive life."
gemini,2017-04-29,"You can change your mind faster than a fickle spring breeze. Your attachment to multiple answers is even more obvious now that the inconsistent Moon is visiting your sign. Although you're quite familiar with your dual nature, it may be discomforting to others who desire singular resolution to an ongoing discussion. Thankfully, all you need to do is be totally honest and let people know you're still considering your options. If you want to be trusted, just tell the truth."
cancer,2017-04-29,"Moderating your emotions is challenging when there's nothing to ground you. In fact, you might have better luck keeping your shifting moods to yourself today, instead of trying to manage them in conversations with others. Unfortunately, everything becomes more complicated once you express your feelings. Thankfully, you will have better luck sharing your heart once the evocative Moon shifts into your sign later tonight. Xenocrates wrote, ""I have often regretted my speech, never my silence."""
leo,2017-04-29,"Social activities are a wonderful source of enthusiastic support, but your friends could become more reserved as the day wears on. Nevertheless, the clever Gemini Moon stirs up fun interactions in your 11th House of Networking. However, your emotions may be swinging back and forth today, causing you to react impulsively one moment and then cautiously the next. It's easier to accept other people's contrary natures once you acknowledge the two sides of your own complex personality. German theologian Thomas Kempis wrote, ""First keep peace with yourself, then you can also bring peace to others."""
virgo,2017-04-29,"Your high hopes inspire you to look ahead today and see opportunities and possibilities where others only see work. However, nothing is as certain as you think and your day might not unfold according to your wishes. You could end up in a state of high anxiety if you continue to force your personal agenda onto the changing social landscape. Loosening your reins of control creates immediate positive results. When you let go of what you are, you open the door to what you might become."
libra,2017-04-29,"You may be playing out a classic Libra archetype today as you struggle to pick a path into the future. You're standing at a fork in the road and rather than choosing one route with confidence, your life hangs in the balance while you wonder if you should go back to school, do some long-overdue traveling or just continue your routine exactly as it is. Oddly enough, what you decide now may be less important than simply making a decision. As you move forward, the details will sort themselves out and you can modify your plans as you go."
scorpio,2017-04-29,"You are naturally drawn into the shadows where profound emotions are released. Although your passions may be raw and deep now, the lighthearted Gemini Moon allows you to rapidly move in and out of transformational states. Paradoxically, the great speed with which you process your current experiences is not about trying to avoid them. You can accomplish plenty on a metaphysical level when you jump into the center of the volcano, surrender to the heat and then let go as the metamorphosis reorganizes your consciousness. Comedian Aries Spears says, ""To sustain longevity, you have to evolve."""
sagittarius,2017-04-29,"You have much to learn from others today, but everyone is moving so quickly and talking so fast that you wish they would just sit still for a few minutes. However, another person's needs will likely differ from yours and could stymie your desire to create your own future. But don't allow your frustration to block your pathway to success. Turn the tide by meeting someone halfway. Rather than blindly rushing forward, improve your current plans and run them by those who are spinning in your orbit."
capricorn,2017-04-29,"Sorting through incoming information might be more tedious work than you want to endure, but someone might be waiting for your decision now. The scattered Gemini Moon is finishing up her visit to your 6th House of Daily Routine, amplifying your energy and tricking you into taking on too much. Thankfully, you can ameliorate potential problems by establishing boundaries and eliminating non-essential activities early in the day. Author Robin Sharma wrote, ""Never overlook the power of simplicity."""
aquarius,2017-04-29,"Your lighthearted attitude makes you a pleasure to be around, but you can't let anything interfere with your previous commitments. The easygoing Gemini Moon breezes her way through your 5th House of Spontaneity, awakening your inner child and inviting it out to play. If you're feeling constrained by obligations that cannot be avoided, taking a new approach might be enough to replace old habits. Shake up the energy however you can; change will do you good."
pisces,2017-04-29,"Your compassion is at once a gift and a curse today. Naturally, you want to help others who are less fortunate than you, but current circumstances might require you to withhold your feelings. Nevertheless, you can't escape your tender heart because you rely on it to navigate through tricky waters. In fact, you don't trust the facts, since they can hide what's important. Ultimately, moving out of your head and into your body clears the air and reveals your path. Never apologize for following your intuition."
aries,2017-04-30,"You are well intended when you ask pointed questions today, but people might think you are overstepping boundaries. However, the sensitive Cancer Moon connects you to the moods of others, and you could overcompensate in an attempt to smooth over an awkward situation. You may be so eager to make things right that you appear to be someone's champion. Nevertheless, assuming responsibility for another person's emotions leads you down the road toward codependency issues and power struggles. Take a deep breath and be a good friend without attempting to run the entire show."
taurus,2017-04-30,"Your positive outlook may be hiding a deeper set of concerns. Your strategy of sharing lots of personal information could be a smokescreen to lure others off track. However, this tactic won't likely work now as instant karma lurks in the shadows, ready to strike if you overdo your evasive maneuvers. Although revealing your vulnerability is challenging today, it's still smarter to acknowledge your shortcomings instead of sidestepping them. Keeping your words simple and to the point paves a road to happiness."
gemini,2017-04-30,"You're searching for your groove today, and it may be a rough ride until you find it. Thankfully, once you discern what works best for you, it's easier to focus on your skills instead of denying your weaknesses. But overbearing Jupiter is in the picture, so you must pay attention to how much energy you expend. Knowing when to call it quits can make the difference between success and failure, especially since your overconfidence sets you up for disappointment. Don't blame others for letting you down; accept the responsibility for expecting too much from them."
cancer,2017-04-30,"Your moodiness can be quite overwhelming now that the emotional Moon is visiting your self-protective sign. Luckily, you're able to overcome lingering insecurities and pursue whatever is in your heart. But you could inadvertently stir up unnecessary trouble by demanding more than you need. Instead of focusing on what's missing from your life, count your blessings; expect nothing and appreciate everything."
leo,2017-04-30,"You might know exactly what you want and how you're going to change the dynamics of the day to work in your favor. Unfortunately, reality isn't necessarily following your script. Instead of digging in and preparing for a fight with anyone who blocks your progress, try a different approach. Rather than isolating differences, adapt to the needs of others. Once they are at ease, you can find your way back to your original intentions. It's counter-intuitive, but sometimes the most direct route isn't as effective as the scenic one."
virgo,2017-04-30,"You grow tired of ferreting out people's hidden agendas and buried emotional pains today. Ultimately, you may decide to refrain from engaging in games of hide and seek, but your withdrawal sends its own message -- especially since everyone assumes that you Virgos analyze a situation to death before making your move. Don't let your impulsive actions burn any bridges that you might want to cross in the future. Author Henry Boye wrote, ""The most important trip you may take in life is meeting people halfway."""
libra,2017-04-30,"Your ambivalence about a significant relationship  reaches a critical turning point today. You're eager to put your life back on track and will do nearly anything to earn the approval of those you love. However, you're tired of being the one who carries the weight and does the work no one else offers to do. Whatever you decide, you might end up wishing you took the other course of action. Fortunately, the solution is simple: keep busy in your pursuit of success without expecting too much from others. Take responsibility for your own happiness without depending on anyone else."
scorpio,2017-04-30,"You want to benefit from the wisdom of your friends and family, but everyone appears to be giving you different advice. Finding the most effective balance between trusting your own conclusions and learning from others is tricky now. Rather than seeking another perspective, you can best see what's around the corner by relying on your powerful intuition. Although it's often advantageous to obtain an outsider's point of view, your own perceptions count more today than anyone else's."
sagittarius,2017-04-30,"You are known for your enthusiasm and it's as contagious as ever now. You are an inspiration to others as you tell them about a pet project of yours that's in the works. Although the reactive Cancer Moon squares optimistic Jupiter to magnify your confidence, it's also an all-too-familiar trap that makes everything seem better than it actually is. Fortunately, there's no reason to be overly concerned if you're willing to act with a well-considered plan tomorrow rather than with urgent abandon today. Be unrelenting in the pursuit of whatever sets your soul on fire."
capricorn,2017-04-30,"An emotionally needy person may show up on your doorstep today. Unfortunately, it's all too easy to manipulate your feelings while the clingy Cancer Moon is traveling through your 7th House of Partners. But you don't like the possibility of someone toying with your heart. Attempting to reach a compromise raises the stakes on a developing power struggle. Luckily, you have the capability of changing the parameters of the game. Choose the high road and disengage from the conflict. Taking a few steps back might be the most effective strategy of all."
aquarius,2017-04-30,"You might seek refuge from an emotional tug of war today by taking a more intellectual approach to the situation. You naturally excel when moving in conceptual realms, but the sensitive Cancer Moon is blown out of proportion by the magnifying lens of Jupiter, pushing you out of your comfort zone. Avoiding the immediate urgency of your feelings sounds like a good idea when it's really a distraction from the work at hand. J.K. Rowling wrote, ""Anything's possible if you've got enough nerve."""
pisces,2017-04-30,"Ironically, your imagination frees you from fear, anxiety and other emotional constraints today. Your drive to express what's in your heart overpowers any concerns you might be harboring as the reflective Cancer Moon in your 5th House of Creativity teams up with dreamy Neptune. Your unbridled fantasies can carry you on the wings of song, taking you nearly anywhere. Why dwell on all the things that could go wrong when you can visualize your life anyway you want it? Eleanor Roosevelt said, ""The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams."""
aries,2017-05-01,"Your fighting spirit is aroused today if someone questions your integrity. Unfortunately, your angry response won't convince people to change their minds. In fact, the more defensive you are now, the less likely others will believe you. Although it might seem like a no-win situation at first, your consistent behavior is your strongest ally. Instead of leaning on words to make your case, let every action you take contribute to the fabric of your story."
taurus,2017-05-01,"Your feelings are running so deep today that others could miss them entirely. Of course, your ability to create stability amidst chaos is a trait that everyone appreciates, but it comes at a personal cost. Although it might seem as if your head and heart are struggling for dominance now, there is no competition. Cooperation is necessary if you want to maximize your clarity. The sooner you integrate your emotional longings with your practical ideas, the sooner you can make your dreams come true."
gemini,2017-05-01,"You are unwilling to compromise your core values just to make an authority figure or questionable source appear to be correct. Nevertheless, you are still considering all your options today, although the smartest choice doesn't necessarily come from logic. When you're tied up in linear thinking, there's no room for brilliant ideas to develop in your brain. Shut off your mind with yoga, meditation or physical exercise to allow your creative juices to flow. Plant a garden in your imagination and watch it grow."
cancer,2017-05-01,"Your moods seem to change quickly today and there's not much you can do to stop them from ebbing and flowing. Although this constant emotional flux might be tiring, you quickly realize it's less exhausting when you keep your feelings to yourself. Involving others in your internal machinations just gives you another level of boundaries to manage when the atmosphere is too unstable. Margaret Atwood wrote, ""When nothing is sure, everything is possible."""
leo,2017-05-01,"Everything the books say about Leo is not true for you today. You don't want to be onstage garnering everyone's love and adoration; you prefer to hide out at home. You're less goal-oriented and more contemplative while the tender Cancer Moon travels through your 12th House of Invisibility. Still, your actions can be significant even if they are out of sight, so don't wait to make your move. Mattie Stepanek wrote, ""Even though the future seems far away, it is actually beginning right now."""
virgo,2017-05-01,"Everything you do now is aimed at some future goal. Your brain is stretched to the limit as you try to juggle the immediacy of your feelings with your long-term visions. It's as if your head and your heart will not communicate with each other today, adding frustration to the developing complexity of your current situation. Fortunately, you're not one to walk away from difficult decisions. Your ability to analyze all the facts is still your most viable strategy. Zig Ziglar said, ""You are free to choose, but you're not free from the consequences of your choice."""
libra,2017-05-01,"Instead of gathering facts to make a critical decision at work today, you're ready to close your eyes and go with your intuition. Luckily, your psychic powers are on point now, yet your gut instincts might still create tricky cross currents in the real world. The receptive Cancer Moon is  up against the wall in your 10th House of Public Recognition, requiring you to fight for your beliefs. Don't back down if your position conflicts with anyone else's. Stand up for your convictions, even if you must stand alone."
scorpio,2017-05-01,"You are in possession of a secret escape plan but it's so radical you can't reveal it to anyone else for fear of rejection. However, you need another person's assistance to carry out your scheme now, which places you in an awkward position. Your best tactic is to share on a need-to-know basis today, but not more -- even if you want to shout your independence from the tallest mountain. Meanwhile, hold onto your dream with fierce determination. Johnny Depp said, ""One day the people that didn't believe in you will tell everyone how they met you."""
sagittarius,2017-05-01,"Think twice before heading off on your own today. Although a positive attitude is empowering your plans, you still must communicate your intentions to others. Even if there isn't enough time or sufficient resources needed to tell your entire story, it's important to keep people involved in your process. However, your information may not match the other big news of the day, so make each of your points as succinctly as you can. Clarity precedes mastery."
capricorn,2017-05-01,"It's discomforting when a close friend or ally suddenly shows an embarrassing attachment to you. You don't mind receiving the admiration from those you love, but the emotional intensity seems out of proportion now. Instead of immediately creating personal distance, share your predicament with someone who knows all the players involved. Don't purposefully push anyone away. Gandhi said, ""I suppose leadership at one time meant muscles; but today it means getting along with people."""
aquarius,2017-05-01,"There's no reason to waste time or energy telling people your plans; instead, work quietly behind the scenes today until each task on your agenda is completed. The emotionally reserved Cancer Moon's visit to your 6th House of Logistics urges you to silently plug away on your to-do list. Rather than worrying about what others think, just maximize your productivity by maintaining a singular focus. In the end, you will be judged by your actions, not your promises."
pisces,2017-05-01,"Sometimes your soporific dreams are the source of your colorful imagination. However, it's more likely that emotional conflict is producing high anxiety now, spurring your subconscious into action. Unfortunately, it's not as much fun when your feelings are agitated. You can't escape the free-floating stress as several planets dynamically aspect the reflective Moon in your 5th House of Self-Expression. Attempting to avoid your destiny only leaves you wandering in circles. Channel your angst into your art."
aries,2017-05-02,"You're ready to take the next step on a project at work, but it may be more complicated than you bargained for. Although you might think you handled all the potential problems in advance, new ones surface today to test your resolve and resiliency. Although you could be tempted to throw in the towel, this is the worst possible time to consider giving up. There are no failures now, unless you quit too soon. If you can't handle stress, you won't manage success."
taurus,2017-05-02,"You can easily fool yourself into believing you're on the right track today. However, you're in for a rude awakening if you run out of resources before you finish your work. But you're not one to take no for an answer once you've made a plan to reach your destination. You might need some assistance, so don't let pride stand in your way of asking for help now. Brene Brown wrote, ""What makes you vulnerable makes you beautiful."""
gemini,2017-05-02,"The very same issues that pile up in everyone else's life today are merely annoying assignments for you to finish along the way. You like the extra challenge of engaging in many different discussions and projects at once. Unfortunately, none of the incomplete tasks gain predominance over all the others, so you're resigned to keep your juggling act going for now. Sufi poet Rumi wrote, ""Every object, every being, is a jar full of delight."""
cancer,2017-05-02,"Your goals are set but you still must state your intentions so others in your network know what you're doing with your time. Nevertheless, logistical problems rise to the surface today, revealing the unrealistic optimism present in your original thinking. Doing better is not an option; it's the only option. Giving up on your goal because of one setback is like slashing your other three tires after finding the first one flat. When you feel like quitting, think about why you started. Dust yourself off and try again."
leo,2017-05-02,"Your leadership skills are solid as a rock today but that doesn't mean a team of experts is at your beck and call. Your ability to hold a position is impressive to your coworkers, and you're likely to continue on your mission no matter what. Don't get sidetracked into thinking that others need to shift their priorities to make more time to support yours. Musician Andy Biersack said, ""Stand up for what you believe in, even if that means to stand alone."""
virgo,2017-05-02,"Your conflicted emotions send mixed signals to your coworkers today. The extroverted Leo Moon encourages you to express your creativity and bask in the recognition of a job well done. But the Moon is hiding in your 12th House of Secrets, prompting you to work behind the scenes. You prefer the spotlight to be on anyone but you. Nevertheless, this is a time to reexamine your priorities and reassess your spiritual journey. Happiness is not out there, it's in you."
libra,2017-05-02,"You believe that the cure to all that ails you today will be found in your relationship with your network of friends and coworkers. Naturally, support from your peers can ease most burdens, but their enthusiasm could fall short of your current expectations. In fact, your problems won't be solved by someone else's intervention now. In the words of biologist John Lubbock, ""To do something, however small, to make others happier and better, is the highest ambition, the most elevating hope, which can inspire a human being."""
scorpio,2017-05-02,"You want to demonstrate the strength of your convictions with powerful words and decisive actions that send a clear message to your coworkers. Unfortunately, they might not be reading off the same page, and there may be significant differences between what you say now and what others actually hear. Don't bother going back over old territory today; instead of explaining your intentions one more time, just trust your intuition. Ultimately, your behavior will be your greatest champion."
sagittarius,2017-05-02,"You can see the distant horizons today, but have little inclination to visit them. You must singularly focus on your immediate surroundings, dealing with one subject at a time. Nevertheless, you don't possess the patience to continue concentrating on the tiniest minutiae when you want to be wrapping your mind around the entire picture. Generalist thinking will need to wait; like it or not, the devil is in the details."
capricorn,2017-05-02,"Success means different things to different people and whatever your version of it is today, you're likely to change your mind tomorrow. You're drawn into the realm of unexpressed feelings and you want everyone to know how deep you are diving to recover these sunken treasures. Don't worry about material gain now; just follow your instincts and continue to gather information along the way. Slow down if the tides are shifting, but do not stop or arbitrarily change direction. Sinking isn't an option when there's so much at stake."
aquarius,2017-05-02,"Relationships are both the problem and the solution today. Nearly everyone seems to be jumping out of their skin as they react to complicated changes in their lives. However, for some unknown reason, it appears that you have escaped the brunt of the storm. Unfortunately, you still must deal with the people in your immediate environment, even if they're envious of your position. Your expectations are more annoying than anyone's behavior. Wayne Dyer wrote, ""Real magic in relationships means an absence of judgment of others."""
pisces,2017-05-02,"You can't stand it if anyone thinks you're not being effective in your current job. You might go out of the way to demonstrate your contribution now, but you're not allowed to do it directly. Tooting your own horn is in bad taste if your goal is to garner attention. Showing up and doing your work doesn't sound glorious, but recognition will come in time. An old proverb cautions, ""If you wish your merit to be known, acknowledge that of other people."""
aries,2017-05-03,"It's time to get to work and put your recent ideas into motion. If you already have a concrete action plan in mind, don't hesitate to execute it today. But be aware that you may need to make substantial modifications to your current strategy as the circumstances continue to change. New information multiplies your options after Mercury turns direct in your sign. Your flexibility will be rewarded, yet the slower you proceed the better, since your goals are more important now than your ideologies."
taurus,2017-05-03,"It's increasingly difficult to separate the real facts from the fake facts as yesterday's truths become today's fantasies. Nevertheless, talking about your desires opens the door to a wide range of experiences. Thankfully, mischievous Mercury starts to regain lost ground in your 12th House of Spiritual Mystery, encouraging you to uncover hidden aspects of your feelings and to explore your unacknowledged biases. Eleanor Roosevelt said, ""It's better to light a candle than to curse the darkness."""
gemini,2017-05-03,"Your social universe may be recovering from a sudden barrage of information that altered the lens through which you view the world. Your unwavering optimism isn't so bright that it blinds you, allowing you to see the possible pitfalls ahead. But don't overcompensate and withdraw from your friends and associates because you're afraid of what might happen now. In fact, you could use a trustworthy ally who is willing to offer you a second opinion today. Consider the potential in the problem rather than the problem with the opportunity."
cancer,2017-05-03,"Although unresolved tensions have been floating around at work for weeks, you might have an ""aha!"" moment today when all the pieces suddenly fall into place. But whatever you learn now is likely to be only one part of an unfinished story that's still being told. Avoid jumping to conclusions while new data is still coming in or you may become the victim of inadvertently believing your own fantasies. Author Stieg Larsson writes that impulsive actions lead to trouble, ""and trouble could have unpleasant consequences."""
leo,2017-05-03,"You might have temporarily shelved big plans for self-improvement, but it's now time to place them front and center. Perhaps you weren't quite ready to make a commitment to a long-term educational goal because you were too busy to begin something new. Maybe a lack of funds required you to delay your enrollment. Thankfully, the waiting game is over. Review your blueprint for the future one more time before creating the structure for the next phase of your life. Danielle LaPorte wrote, ""Use your dissatisfaction to start a personal revolution."""
virgo,2017-05-03,"You're not known for your reckless attitude, but you're likely to surprise people now with your out-of-character behavior. Logic may play second fiddle to your emotions while you pursue intense feelings that are usually safely tucked away in the shadows. However, your key planet, Mercury, turns direct in your 8th House of Deep Sharing, encouraging you to listen to your heart. Detached intellectual thinking seems dry and uninteresting while there's juicier and more pressing matters to be uncovered. Israeli model Bar Refaeli said, ""Have the passion, take the action and magic will happen."""
libra,2017-05-03,"You might not be able to believe what comes out of people's mouths today. Honestly, it's as if they're not thinking before speaking. Although unpremeditated revelations can create an awkward situation now, it's not as discomforting as being stuck with no one saying anything at all. Thankfully, common sense prevails; it's obviously simpler to modify a thought that has been said than one that hasn't."
scorpio,2017-05-03,"You're not interested in censoring your sharp wit that's being fueled by your overactive imagination now. It's as if you're standing in the path of a fire hose that is streaming innovative ideas and unprocessed images. It's at once exhilarating and overwhelming, making it a challenge to settle the tension in the emotional landscape. Nevertheless, others have the power to shine their lovelights so brightly that they are catalysts in your current changes. Neale Donald Walsch wrote, ""Life begins at the end of your comfort zone."""
sagittarius,2017-05-03,"A major breakthrough in your communication may be showier than productive. Clever Mercury turns direct in your 5th House of Self-Expression, prompting you to speak your truth, even if it's an irrelevant one. Nevertheless, your brilliant repartee won't likely improve on Einstein's ""E=mc2"", nor will you single-handedly resolve the world's hunger problem. You're still one person among eight billion and there's only so much you can do at once. Gandhi said, ""Whatever you do will be insignificant, but it is very important that you do it."""
capricorn,2017-05-03,"You're normally quite adept at balancing opposite forces in your life, however they play out. You apply the laws to the known situation and visualize the various outcomes based upon your choices. Nevertheless, you're likely to disengage from personal and professional interactions now so you can focus on your spiritual practice. Your contemplative nature is your saving grace today, for you can explore every possible path while reserving your commitment until you're ready. However, do not confuse the voice of ego with the voice of intuition."
aquarius,2017-05-03,"You don't understand why everyone else seems so certain about their actions while you're wandering around lost in space. In fact, there's so much busy noise now that you can't even hear yourself think. There's no peace and quiet to be found when loquacious Mercury turns direct in your 3rd House of Endless Chatter. Demonstrate your wisdom by pulling the plug on superfluous conversations and unnecessary interactions today. Silence speaks volumes when words have run their course."
pisces,2017-05-03,"You have often wondered which personally held beliefs were important enough to be non-negotiable. Perhaps a particular conversation stumbled onto a sensitive topic today, prompting you to reevaluate your priorities. However, you may be more drawn to reconsider your relationship to the material world. Making small changes to how you manage your money might appear inconsequential now, yet could influence your life for weeks to come. Roy Disney wrote, ""When your values are clear to you, making decisions becomes easier."""
aries,2017-05-04,"Your energy is uncontainable today and you see signals to go ahead everywhere you look. But reality isn't as kind as you wish and the green lights don't tell the whole story. Your head-on approach might not be working in your favor now; in fact, the resistance you face is likely your own creation. There's no need to push so hard or go so fast. You might be happily surprised at how things start to fall your way when you relax just a little bit. Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""Life is a journey, not a destination."""
taurus,2017-05-04,"You have a lot on your mind today, but might choose to keep your thoughts to yourself. It's not that you're unsure of your position. Actually, the opposite may be true: you're so certain of your perspective that you have no tolerance for anyone else's. You could even be afraid that you'll instigate a fight just so you can prove your point. However, the purpose now is not to win an argument. Understanding is attainable only once you let go of your need to be right."
gemini,2017-05-04,"You appear to have a finger in nearly every pie today, and your friends might be judgmental of how you're spending your resources. They may remind you that spreading yourself too thin means you can't give your best to any one activity. On the other hand, you feel as if everyone is vying for your time and it annoys you that anyone is asking for more. Unfortunately, a gentle nudge from an ally could feel like an act of aggression now. Don't overreact; Anais Nin wrote, ""We don't see things as they are, we see them as we are."""
cancer,2017-05-04,"You might feel as if your private life is too public today. You may be required to deliver a report, make an introduction or just be on display when you wish you were working quietly in a more sheltered space. Remember that you are still in complete control of what you disclose and what you keep to yourself. Demonstrating your competence right from the start enables you to meet the expectations of others before you honor your own needs. Shine now; reflect later."
leo,2017-05-04,"It doesn't seem to matter how much planning you put into an endeavor because there are still loose ends that defy your attempts at wrapping them up. You want to keep your pet project on track, but progress is like greased lightning today. Instead of seeing external circumstances as annoyances that must be eliminated, think like a coyote and engage your competition in play. Mary Oliver wrote, ""I believe in kindness. Also in mischief."""
virgo,2017-05-04,"You don't want people to notice your moodiness, so you might go out of your way to speak in a logical manner. However, your mechanical approach makes it readily apparent that you're hiding something now, prompting others to ferret out the missing pieces by asking questions. But your current sensitivity could trigger a defensive reaction, thereby escalating a conflict. Actually, it's easier on everyone if you just express your changing emotions as you experience them. Harboring no secrets today means fewer problems tomorrow."
libra,2017-05-04,"You may have extensive conversations with yourself today, lost in the intricacy of details that don't ultimately matter. Nevertheless, something drives you to untangle the finer points of possible plans that never come to fruition. Fortunately, you can take control of your own mental process by establishing priorities early in the day. It's easier to leave a train of thoughts aside when you have already established their lack of importance. Philanthropist Michael Friedsam wrote, ""Concentrate on finding your goal, then concentrate on reaching it."""
scorpio,2017-05-04,"Getting along with your friends can be a struggle today because you're unwilling to put up with anyone's inconsistencies. However, your lack of flexibility likely stems from your extreme level of self-criticism, and it's less stressful to judge others than yourself. Of course, there's no reason to compromise high standards when it comes to production or personal interactions. Nevertheless, cutting everyone a little slack contributes to a more harmonious atmosphere today. You may be happily surprised when you realize that quality was not sacrificed in the process."
sagittarius,2017-05-04,"You're more than willing to rearrange your day in order to accommodate your creative instincts. Although you might be struck by a flash of inspiration concerning a current project, it's tough to set aside your previous commitments to follow an out-of-the-box idea today. Nevertheless, pursuing your passion is worth a try, even if you must stir up a bit of conflict along the way. It is said that in the end you only regret the chances you didn't take."
capricorn,2017-05-04,"Your coworkers seem on edge today, as if they have lost patience with you. But you are quickly irritated with their attitude and might not hesitate to let them know of your displeasure. However, you're moving through tricky territory now. It's likely that someone else's short temper originates with your unwillingness to acknowledge your own. Although confronting your shortcomings isn't easy, it's more challenging to deal with your feelings in projected form. Psychologist Carl Jung taught that it's hard to see others; instead, you see people where your shadows fall on them."
aquarius,2017-05-04,"You might think you can successfully make your schedule up as you go along today. Unfortunately, there's a severe price to pay for winging it now and you're much better off to make a plan and stick with it. But you can't put the work off; you must start early to gain the maximum benefits. Even if you run into complications, keep returning to your original intentions. If needed, modify your methods, but don't compromise your goals."
pisces,2017-05-04,"A close friend or partner may surprise you with his or her criticism today. Although you might not expect this kind of feedback, remain open to the silver lining behind the storm cloud. Author Bryant McGill wrote, ""We are never taught more deeply and more truthfully than by pain."" Instead of taking anyone's advice as a slap in the face, acknowledge where you can improve your game. When offered a chance to grow, demonstrate your courage and make the most of the opportunity."
aries,2017-05-05,"Establishing a sustainable pace can be an elusive goal today when you're pushing too hard one minute and not hard enough the next. You might find your groove, only to lose it when someone encourages you to take on additional responsibilities. Unfortunately, you'll continue to dig your hole deeper without making progress as long as you let others define your limits. Indian mystic Kabir wrote, ""If you listen to that Self within, then you find Truth."""
taurus,2017-05-05,"You're fully capable of expressing yourself in such a way today that people raptly listen to your wisdom. However, you are not immune from falling into a trap where your sense of self-importance stands between you and the truth. Charles Darwin wrote, ""It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is the most adaptable to change."" Keeping a lid on the bottle of your stubbornness enables you to explore beyond your limits."
gemini,2017-05-05,"You like it when there's nothing holding you back, but oddly enough, you perform better when there are some restrictions placed on you. You may start out today with clear skies and high hopes, but your imagination can quickly carry your expectations too far. Fortunately, you're able to rein in your fantasies by refocusing your attention on mundane matters. Tempering your dreams with the facts puts satisfaction within reach."
cancer,2017-05-05,"Your practical side saves you from going over the emotional edge today. It's natural to put extra energy into your social world when you're so confident in your mind. But one doesn't necessarily translate to the other. You still might find it awkward to share your hopes and dreams with those around you. Nevertheless, your communication skills are solid now and you connect with your peers more consistently than you realize. Confucius wrote, ""Life is really simple, but we insist on making it complicated."""
leo,2017-05-05,"You might think that exaggeration works in your favor today, especially if you can make yourself look better to your boss. Unfortunately, flavoring real events to your advantage doesn't help in the long run because reality has this annoying tendency to creep back into your stories. Don't worry about how people may react; just show up and do your job the best you can. Plato wrote, ""Good actions give strength to ourselves and inspire good action in others."""
virgo,2017-05-05,"You're a bastion of sensibility today, and your personal and professional opinions are right on target. Thankfully, you don't need to fight for airspace. Your voice has already earned a place in the hearts and minds of others, and they are happy to support you once you begin to share your ideas. Keep in mind that you're not in competition with your peers; you're in competition with yourself."
libra,2017-05-05,"You have a secret roadmap to success in your possession now. But you're not interested in sharing it with anyone until all the kinks are eliminated. Obviously, leading a cloak-and-dagger lifestyle is exciting, but it also has its own level of complications. It's nearly impossible to find your feet when your head is in the clouds. Demonstrate your competence by setting realistic goals and then making your dreams come true. Opera singer Beverly Sills said, ""There are no shortcuts to any place worth going."""
scorpio,2017-05-05,"People in your life tend to be so stuck on their ideas today that they seem to think you are missing the boat. On another day, you might take their apparent criticism to heart, but your current confidence will not be dampened by someone else's negativity. Just make sure you aren't overcompensating by bolstering your own ideas with faulty reasoning. Taking the time for one last reassessment of your plans dramatically increases your chances for success."
sagittarius,2017-05-05,"You're all about getting ahead on the job today and don't want to be distracted by anything that pulls you off course. However, your key planet Jupiter continues to tease you with possibilities that look good on the surface. Nevertheless, don't believe everything you see now; appearances can be misleading. Fortunately, your single-mindedness will bring you the results you seek. Alexander Graham Bell wrote, ""Concentrate all your thoughts upon the work at hand. The Sun's rays do not burn until brought into focus."""
capricorn,2017-05-05,"You're a champion when it comes to setting long-term goals, making a plan and following through on execution. Luckily, the cosmos is conjuring a bit of magic today to help you along on your path. Although you have the necessary pieces in place to accomplish the extraordinary, you could jeopardize your current trajectory if you take on more than is required. Avoid temptations to scatter your energy now. Simplicity is your key to brilliance."
aquarius,2017-05-05,"You relish the idea of being free enough to say yes to anyone who presents you with an exciting new opportunity. Unfortunately, you can't just accept every offer you receive or you won't have the time or energy to follow through on any of them. It's crucial that you establish sensible priorities today and then eliminate all activities that don't contribute specifically to your intended progress. Energy flows where attention goes."
pisces,2017-05-05,"You are in the process of waking up from a dream and now must integrate your visions into the real world. Sometimes, coming back down to Earth is an unpleasant jolt, but today it feels as easy and natural as slipping into your favorite shoes. In fact, you might experience a wave of relief when you realize you are walking on solid ground again. But don't waste time reveling in your newfound pragmatism. There's work to be done and the sooner you get started, the sooner you'll have the satisfaction of accomplishing your goal."
aries,2017-05-06,"You may try to hide the fact that you have run out of patience but the deeper you bury your frustration, the more unstable you become. Red-hot Mars taunts you with immediate solutions to long-standing problems, but it's a cosmic setup because there are no quick fixes today. Nevertheless, you might believe that letting others know exactly what you're thinking now will alleviate any interpersonal tension. Unfortunately, playing your cards while you're angry is not a good idea. You'll make more progress when you're able to maintain your cool. Author Frank Herbert wrote, ""Emotions are the curse of logic."""
taurus,2017-05-06,"Your ability to sustain a steady pace is normally a blessing, but it can get in the way of your success today. Something may be bothering you and yet your emotional ballast keeps you even-keeled through most any storm. However, pretending that you have everything under control isn't your smartest move now, even if you can stop some of the edges from fraying. There's a deeper struggle underway and you must simply show up and do your best while remaining true to your heart. Robin Sharma wrote, ""Change is hard at first, messy in the middle and gorgeous at the end."""
gemini,2017-05-06,"You're like a modern-day Mary Poppins, ready to fly out on the changing winds. However, impulsive Mars is scattering his energy in your 1st House of Self, trying on an endless variety of styles as you explore the world in a series of ill-fated adventures. Unfortunately, the old look you sported now seems to be quite dated, making it impossible to return to your previous life. Stepping forward into the unknown is more fun when you treat it like a game. Play is the brain's favorite way of learning; let your inner kid run wild."
cancer,2017-05-06,"You are being pushed out of your comfortable nest today, but you're actually ready for the experience. You're the one who tends to cling onto familiar places and people from the past. Nevertheless, you're eager to toss your emotional baggage and head into the future, unencumbered with unnecessary weight. Enjoy the adrenaline surging through your body and go where you feel the most alive. Terry Litwiller wrote, ""Success comes from having dreams that are bigger than your fears."""
leo,2017-05-06,"You're like a bee that's buzzing around in a field of your family, friends and social acquaintances. You don't want to stop and have an in-depth conversation with any one person because there are so many varieties of people yet to discover. Nevertheless, you could end up exhausted before you sample the treasures all around you. You might be evolving in deeper ways than you realize, so give yourself time to process what you're now learning. Change doesn't happen overnight."
virgo,2017-05-06,"You don't like being pushed to the edge because you're afraid of losing your cool when you're at your wit's end. Nevertheless, you're likely to bite off more than you can chew today, even if you know better. Somewhere along the way you become more enamored with the future than with the present moment. You're eager to try anything that ups the technological ante, but you might go too fast. If you find yourself spinning in ecstasy, know that it will not last. Tom Petty sings, ""I'm learning to fly but I ain't got wings. Coming down is the hardest thing."""
libra,2017-05-06,"Your entire life seems like a test to see if you can maintain an enlightened state of mind while dealing with mundane matters. Fortunately, you're like Neo in ""The Matrix""; reality is no match for your Zen state. The Moon's return to objective Libra enables you to remain detached from the unexpected obstacles coming your way. Everything and everyone appears to be in high-speed motion while you, in your stillness, hold your space at the center of the cosmos. Nevertheless, the pressure is building and your nervous system is on hyper-alert. Your mantra for the day is, ""Every moment matters."""
scorpio,2017-05-06,"You're torn between two contradictory approaches to life today. On one hand, you want to put all your eggs into a social basket so you can forget about your personal problems. On the other hand, you're ready to walk away from all emotional entanglements so you can spend your time deepening your spiritual quest. Don't underestimate the strength of your desire for transformation. Goethe wrote, ""Magic is believing in yourself. If you can do that, you can make anything happen."""
sagittarius,2017-05-06,"You might as well be living in a video game as the intensity of your world amps up to another level today. Nevertheless, you are entranced by the sequence of surprising events. You're more amused than overwhelmed, even if you aren't sure you're ready for the next phase. Your desire for reestablishing equilibrium outweighs your caution, prompting you to jump in and face the rapidly changing circumstances. But don't let your faith in the power of communication waver even for a moment. Ultimately, it's the people you meet along the way that help you appreciate the journey."
capricorn,2017-05-06,"You can see the complexity of these times everywhere you look, but you're not eager to give up all that you have gained for the sake of simplicity. You're cognitively aware that shifts in social consciousness lead to personal transformation. Nevertheless, you may choose to resist the upcoming changes, even if the alarm bells are ringing. Eckhart Tolle said, ""Sometimes surrender means giving up trying to understand and being comfortable with not knowing."""
aquarius,2017-05-06,"People around you freak out when things happen today for no apparent reason. However, the abruptness of change is exhilarating to you because there's a sense of freedom once tension is brought out into the open. You're hopeful that worn-out systems will fall apart, releasing you from deeply rooted beliefs that no longer serve your purpose. Nevertheless, letting go of the past isn't as easy as you think. Alice Walker wrote, ""Look closely at the present you are constructing. It should look like the future you are dreaming."""
pisces,2017-05-06,"You're unapologetic about simultaneously choosing two personal paths to pursue. However, those closest to you might think you're talking out of both sides of your mouth. Nevertheless, making others comfortable with your life choices is not the best use of your energy. It's wiser to get on with living and work toward contributing to the future you want to create. Edward Abbey wrote, ""Society is like a stew. If you don't stir it up every once in a while, then a layer of scum floats to the top."""
aries,2017-05-07,"Someone may show up in your life today with an offer that sounds too good to refuse. Fortunately, it's likely the real deal and could open an unexpected doorway into your future. But a touch of caution is advised because inflationary Jupiter is in the picture, tempting you to turn a positive opportunity into a venture so big that it becomes unrealistic. Aries Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""I am a great believer in luck, and I find the harder I work the more I have of it."""
taurus,2017-05-07,"Although you might try to fit more into your day than is possible, you're eager to do as much as you can. Thankfully, your stamina is high; starting on your chores in the morning won't tire you out since action-hero Mars and confident Jupiter are working on your behalf today. Although sheer determination counts for a lot, you must remember that you're a human with human limitations. Walt Disney said, ""I always like to look on the optimistic side of life but I am realistic enough to know that life is a complex matter."""
gemini,2017-05-07,"You're full of good ideas today, but it's not healthy to believe everything you think. Positive energy flows into your life as long as you're having fun while the Moon dances with buoyant Jupiter in your 5th House of Spontaneity. Just remember that your current creativity is not limited to what you say or write. The lunar connection with physical Mars in your 1st House of Self is a reminder that you must put your best thoughts into action and let the others slip back into inner space. Jim Rohn says, ""If it's important, you'll find a way. If not, you'll find an excuse."""
cancer,2017-05-07,"Pinning down the details on an upcoming adventure may be nearly impossible now. You might be feeling pressure to make a decision about an important project, but it's wiser to let the current events unfold further before committing to anything major. Thankfully, things should fall into place over the next few days whether or not you worry about them today. In the meantime, treat yourself kindly. Author Mandy Hale wrote, ""It's not selfish to love yourself, take care of yourself and to make your happiness a priority. It's necessary."""
leo,2017-05-07,"You have people you want to see and places you want to go today. Luckily, you should be able to accomplish these goals by giving yourself the day off. However, an over-indulgent Moon-Jupiter conjunction in your 3rd House of Distractions could trick you into believing you can fit three days of social activity into one. Do yourself a favor and re-prioritize your schedule before reality does it for you. It's much easier on everyone involved if you act preemptively instead of waiting until it's too late. Albert Einstein quipped, ""Intellectuals solve problems; geniuses prevent them."""
virgo,2017-05-07,"You have an opportunity to stand back from the noise of your everyday life and take stock of your current position. Although there's no need to put your thoughts into immediate action now, your logic is clear and your conclusions are sound. The Moon in your 2nd House of Money connects with visionary Jupiter and assertive Mars, motivating you to set ambitious career goals. Review time is over; Jackie Joyner-Kersee said, ""It's better to look ahead and prepare than to look back and regret."""
libra,2017-05-07,"Your friends see you in the most positive light now. It's as if you can do no wrong while the nurturing Moon hooks up with jovial Jupiter in your accommodating sign. Take advantage of your luck today, for the cosmos is gracing you with a chance to improve your life. But be aware of the shadows that exist even in the illuminating light of positive thinking. You don't need to keep up a false front of perfection. Fake people must maintain an image. Real people just don't care."
scorpio,2017-05-07,"Your sign is the champion of secrets because your emotions are so intense that others shy away from your extreme honesty. Although you keep your passions to a low simmer when required, you might let them all hang out today. An expansive Moon-Jupiter conjunction floods your 12th House of Fantasy, but its smooth connection with spontaneous Mars gives you a natural path to express your feelings. Trust your intuition; don't hold back if your inner voice says it's safe to reveal what's in your heart. Paradoxically, the more you share, the more you gain."
sagittarius,2017-05-07,"You can blame your social indulgences on your friends today, but the truth is you were ready to say yes even before you were invited. Fortunately, you're able to carve out enough spare time now to join others on a group activity that could require a certain level of commitment. Even if you're doing something as simple as going for a walk, you're either all in or not at all. Just remember to honor your other responsibilities and establish practical limits around your adventure. Stay true to your word; integrity matters more than you know."
capricorn,2017-05-07,"Sometimes your reputation as the serious one gets in the way of having fun. Happily, you're ready for some guilt-free downtime today and others may end up following you on a scenic route to Playland. But your organizational tendencies aren't lost; you're the one who can pull all the pieces together and coordinate the frivolities. John Wanamaker wrote, ""People who cannot find time for recreation are obliged sooner or later to find time for illness."""
aquarius,2017-05-07,"The distant horizon seems closer than ever today and you can almost touch it. Your dreams, too, feel within reach, whether or not they are grounded enough to ever come true. This is a magical yet precarious moment because you're able to establish goals that inspire you and those around you. However, you might aim at a destination that is so unrealistic, you can't help but be disappointed down the road. Humanitarian Benjamin Mays wrote, ""The tragedy of life doesn't lie in not reaching your goal. The tragedy lies in having no goals to reach."""
pisces,2017-05-07,"Your subconscious is working overtime today and is the source of rich treasures. It's also a depository of flashing lights and trivial trinkets. Unfortunately, discerning the ideas that are powerful enough to change your life from those that have no redeeming value can be a challenging task now. Rather than trying to force a decision each time you experience a creative rush, just let the images stream at their own rate without your logical interference. Lewis Carroll's Cheshire Cat said, ""Imagination is the only weapon in the war against reality."""
aries,2017-05-08,"Your relationships are plagued with opposing forces today. One side of the equation is symbolized by a gracious host, going to great lengths to ensure everyone's happiness. Meanwhile, a rebellious youth foments revolution from the other side. Unfortunately, relaxation is out of the question while you're caught in the middle. You know something must give to release the tension but you don't know what will happen next. This uncomfortable dance will continue as long as you're attached to one outcome or another. Anything you can't control is teaching you how to let go."
taurus,2017-05-08,"You just want to be left alone today, so you can complete the chores that are your responsibility. Unfortunately, others may have very different ideas about your agenda and think your priorities are skewed. Trouble begins if there is a confrontation and they try to persuade you to alter your path. Although you might stop to defend your objectives, there is a smarter way to handle this conflict now. Don't even engage with anyone who is pulling you off track. Just put your head down and continue your work. Time is non-refundable; use it with earnest intention."
gemini,2017-05-08,"You may be in a playful mood, reluctant to take anything too seriously. But you could run into some heavy judgments today from folks who think you're not carrying your fair share of the work. Apparently, your ability to enjoy life irritates those who are unable to find pleasure in what they do. The truth is you see no reason to punish yourself with a negative outlook. Remind your critics that success guru Dale Carnegie taught, ""People rarely succeed unless they have fun in what they are doing."""
cancer,2017-05-08,"Your objective approach to solving problems is refreshing, prompting your coworkers to bring their challenging situations to you for advice. Luckily, you're an excellent listener and your sensitivity enables people to open up even more. Although you may have a strong and sympathetic shoulder to lean on, you don't have quick answers to everyone's complex questions. Nevertheless, your compassion means more to others than if you actually fixed their problems. Author John Maxwell wrote, ""Nurturing has the ability to transform people's lives."""
leo,2017-05-08,"You are the perfect judge because your current impartiality enables you to see both sides of every coin. On the surface, you're quite clear about your objectivity. However, your unconscious biases may rear their heads even when you think they're safely tucked away. Don't slip into denial about your preferences; instead, acknowledge your prejudices and begin to deconstruct them to cultivate personal growth. Shining your light of awareness onto the forces of darkness makes you a better person today."
virgo,2017-05-08,"Your personal possessions can weigh you down today, especially if you have financial obligations that require your attention. But your current obsession with the material world might not be shared by others. In fact, your friends and associates may be puzzled by your focus on things that don't seem important to them. Nevertheless, everything seems interconnected and managing your assets is simply one area of your life that you can get under control. Author William Feather wrote, ""Wealth flows from energy and ideas."""
libra,2017-05-08,"Keeping your feelings to yourself is challenging today because it's natural to want to share your experiences with your friends and coworkers. Nevertheless, expressing your vulnerability may not be the smartest thing to do, just because others could judge you harshly now for speaking your truth. An argument tends to bring other suppressed information up to the surface without necessarily adding anything to your productivity. You are not required to respond to everything you hear. You cannot control the wind, but you can direct the sail."
scorpio,2017-05-08,"You can see the wisdom of sharing your dual-natured perspective if you want to tell someone about your deepest and darkest feelings. Nevertheless, it could take quite a bit of effort to prove that your disclosure will be worth the risk. Normally, communication is the best way to alleviate pent-up tension, but today it might do the exact opposite. There are topics to steer clear of now unless you want to heighten everyone's fears. Wait until there's a bit of reprieve on your calendar before you stir the pot."
sagittarius,2017-05-08,"You're prepared to respond by encouraging your friends today, instead of sharing your own exciting breakthrough. But there's a price to be paid for shifting the attention from oneself onto those around you. It's wonderful to be altruistic and want to help everyone else, but if you don't fill in your own dance card, you'll never get a chance to voice your desires. The good news is living your dreams inspires others to do the same."
capricorn,2017-05-08,"Your ambitious nature blends well with your even-handed approach to life today. You can walk into a complicated situation, assess the variables at play and quickly create an action plan. You possess a high level of accuracy when it comes to doing something at the right time. There's no formula for this kind of decision-making, but alleviating your mind of the daily noise increases your ability to connect with your inner guides. Don't ever apologize for trusting your intuition; your brain can play tricks, your heart is blind, but your gut is always right."
aquarius,2017-05-08,"You are fueled by your quest for independence, but this unrelenting drive is closely tied to your need for facts. Getting to the bottom of a convoluted story requires a lot of hard work, but finding a nugget of truth can be a catalyst that alters everything. Although your day-to-day activities may not substantially change, your long-range trajectory is up for reconsideration. Thankfully, your integrity shines, empowering you to choose your thoughts and actions based on values rather than personal gain."
pisces,2017-05-08,"You're not convinced the external world is actually what you see. In fact, most spiritual traditions claim reality is hidden by the illusion of the three-dimensional world. Nevertheless, you're dragged into an emotional conflict that seems so real that you forget about the metaphysical truths you know so well. Fortunately, you can extricate yourself from the negativity of feeling trapped by simply viewing your current situation in a wider context. Gymnast Mary Lou Retton said, ""Optimism is a happiness magnet. If you stay positive, good things and good people will be drawn to you."""
aries,2017-05-09,"You're at the top of your professional game but that may not be enough for you now. You are in touch with a deep and powerful force that's propelling you along in your career or bringing you additional recognition within your community. You can sense that you're right on the edge of a major breakthrough, but you can't tell what's on the other side of the wall. Listen to your gut and only make your move when it feels right. Bob Dylan sings, ""And don't speak too soon for the wheel's still in spin, cause the times they are a-changing."""
taurus,2017-05-09,"Your thoughts are running through your brain at the speed of light today, but you appear calm, cool and collected on the outside. Unfortunately, trying to unify these diverging energies could be a hopeless task that leads to frustration. Ironically, the stress dissipates quickly once you realize you don't have to resolve your current dilemma. You can continue to watch the inner show while acting as if nothing is happening at all. Keep going through the motions while simultaneously watching the movie playing on your inner screen. Fantasy and reality feed each other if you let them."
gemini,2017-05-09,"You can fulfill other people's expectations today by participating in animated dialogue that's peppered with witty repartee. But you're only half engaged while your other half is contemplating the mysteries of the cosmos. You're being swept up in a whirlwind of innovative ideas that offer multidimensional perspectives. You know where your heart is, but you're not talking about these inner explorations now because bringing someone along for the ride will distract you from the intensity of the experience. Paul Simon sings, ""Hello darkness my old friend; I've come to talk with you again."""
cancer,2017-05-09,"You surprise everyone with your original ideas today because they are so different from what anyone expects. In fact, you might even wonder about the source of this sudden mental creativity. Oddly enough, your inner directed cyber-acrobatics may require external stimulation or your brain will go quiet. Being around others feeds a very deep feeling that goes beyond language. Don't be afraid to go on a vision quest without the need to fill in the emptiness with words. Author John Grossman wrote, ""Silence is not the absence of something but the presence of everything."""
leo,2017-05-09,"Your penchant for details today is only surpassed by your unwavering determination. Whether at home or on the job, you're not interested in just doing enough to get by. You want to wow your audience with a performance that takes control and leaves them gasping in awe. As hyperbolic as this sounds, you can do it as long as you have clear and honorable intentions that benefit the good of everyone. No beauty shines brighter than that of a kind heart."
virgo,2017-05-09,"You Virgos are the champions of narrowing your focus so you can concentrate on the minutiae; however, you've been given a ""Get Out of Details Free"" card today. Sometimes the little things are best left sorting themselves out on their own. Rather than contracting your field of vision, open your eyes and ears, and stretch your awareness as far as you can. Poet W.B. Yeats wrote, ""The world is full of magic things, patiently waiting for our senses to grow sharper."""
libra,2017-05-09,"The most important experiences in your life now defy communication; there is a subterranean river of energy that runs out of sight and out of mind. Thankfully, you have the ability to float on this imaginary but not unreal stream of consciousness today, even if you can't share your experience with others. Nevertheless, there's still plenty to talk about and you won't be at a loss for words while interacting with those close to you. J.K. Rowling wrote, ""It's important to remember that we all have magic inside us."""
scorpio,2017-05-09,"You're in your own element today because everyone seems to be plugged into a deeper level of emotions. Often, this kind of intensity scares people off, but now they seem to gain a sense of comfort as they connect with you. Naturally, you're no stranger to extreme feelings and your familiarity with these realms is useful for putting your friends at ease. Maya Angelou wrote, ""Try to be a rainbow in someone's cloud."""
sagittarius,2017-05-09,"It feels as if you had a personality makeover, but on the surface nothing has changed. Your heart is happy and it's speaking with a clear voice. Fortunately, you're listening and ready to take immediate action. But prior to initiating any big moves, reconsider your plan one more time and make sure it's as practical as possible. Computer scientist Linus Torvalds said, ""I'm generally a very pragmatic person: that which works, works."""
capricorn,2017-05-09,"Although you're often willing to make a commitment, there's no stopping you today once you do. No one should take it personally if they draw your wrath because you're on a singular mission to accomplish your goals. Unfortunately, you can inadvertently hurt someone as you ride roughshod toward your victory. But there's always the possibility of an instantaneous awakening just in the nick of time. You can emerge as the hero if you acknowledge other people's feelings, too. Mason Cooley wrote, ""Compassion brings us to a stop, and for a moment we rise above ourselves."""
aquarius,2017-05-09,"Your friends and associates may be sorely disappointed if they believe they can change your mind. You already know your limits, what you're willing to share and what you'll keep to yourself. Unfortunately, you might be so good at hiding any emotions that make you feel vulnerable, no one will even realize there's more to the story than what is apparent. Thankfully, you don't need to stick with a plan that's detrimental to your wellbeing. Take a risk and open your heart a little wider, even if it makes you nervous. Great things never come from comfort zones."
pisces,2017-05-09,"You're not one to waste words today, but neither will you remain silent until you clear the air of unexpressed feelings. Perhaps your personal agenda clashes with the will of your coworkers, but you're not willing to bury your heart's desires. Nevertheless, it's crucial to choose your battles wisely. If your differences are about basic core values, it's imperative that you step forward and get the whole issue on the table. George Orwell wrote, ""The further a society drifts from the truth, the more it will hate those that speak it."""
aries,2017-05-10,"Every radical idea that pops into awareness causes your adrenaline to surge, but your emotional life is more complicated than your wild thoughts. The magnetic Scorpio Full Moon floods your 8th House of Intimacy, raising the ante on an interaction with someone special. You could quickly find yourself in over your head if you stir up too much  excitement. Your feelings are highly charged now and you can't help but take a risk with your heart. Nevertheless, as noted by Morris L. Ernst, ""More errors arise from inhibited indecision than from impulsive behavior."""

You may be overloaded by recent commitments as the extreme Scorpio Full Moon illuminates your 11th House of Social Networking. Nevertheless, procrastinating only adds to your anxiety.

Your feelings may even be hurt if others run to someone else for assistance while the Scorpio Full Moon intensifies your 10th House of Status.

The good news is that you know you're safe; there's enough structure in place to guarantee that you will land on your feet. The bad news is that the current confusion makes it difficult to know what to do because you're afraid of people misinterpreting your behavior. Benjamin Franklin wrote, ""Words may show a man's wit, but actions his meanings."""
taurus,2017-05-11,"Your current optimism is more likely based on your inner confidence than on external circumstances. You know your intentions are honorable and believe that reality will support your endeavors now. But you must take a leap of faith because all the pieces are not yet in place. Look within to make sure your plan is aligned with your goals because it's easy to deceive yourself when you want a specific outcome. Zig Ziglar extolled, ""It is your attitude, not your aptitude, that determines your altitude."""
gemini,2017-05-11,"Possessing a solid plan for success is not enough to get you to your destination; you must put your ideas into motion. Fortunately, superhero Mars is energizing your sign now, but you could initiate action only to find yourself heading in the wrong direction.

leo,2017-05-11,"Self-control can be difficult when you're enjoying yourself. But managing your limits makes the difference between failure and success today.

Nevertheless, it's hard to know which is truth and which is deceit when it comes to your own thoughts. Don't believe everything you think."
libra,2017-05-11,"You may need to rework your schedule today because reality doesn't necessarily conform to your agenda. Although your ability to remain flexible can save the day, you probably don't realize how rigid your thinking has grown.

John Maxwell wrote, ""Life is a matter of choices, and every choice you make makes you."""
sagittarius,2017-05-11,"Your struggle today is about gaining a healthy perspective so you can discern what's real.

If self-doubt sends you into a downward spiral, you can overcome your negativity by asking for help. But don't expect anyone to show up ready to work; people are more valuable now as listeners and advisors. Thankfully, expressing your feelings temporarily alleviates your uncertainty. The biggest mistake you could ever make is being too afraid to make one."

Although your current zest for life is inspirational to your friends and associates, you might become more contemplative later this evening. Nevertheless, going overboard with enthusiasm doesn't help your cause, especially if your bravado is covering issues of deeper concern.

Although you don't like to drag out the bad news, the responsibility may fall on you to be the one to issue a reality check today.

Nothing will be gained by trying to control the process; instead, just share what makes you human without expecting anything in return."
sagittarius,2017-05-12,"You know all the intelligent reasons to cooperate with others now. No matter how much data you have at your fingertips, you continue to collect more facts so you don't make faulty assumptions. Nevertheless, it's quite tempting to avert your eyes away from the largest issues that seem to be beyond your control.

Making matters worse, it seems like everyone is encouraging you to increase your burn rate rather than advising you to save your resources for a rainy day.

Rather than highlighting your shortcomings, obstacles in your path are now meant to show you where your game can be improved. There's no time to be wasted wallowing in self-pity or doubt. You have profound work to do and the sooner you start, the more likely you will get a chance to relax later on. Procrastination is not your friend. There's always time for the things you put first."
sagittarius,2017-05-13,"Your unfettered optimism can drive others crazy today because they don't see the world in the same bright light as you do. Most people are more restrained by their common sense, but you think that's an unnecessary limitation. Nevertheless, your Pollyanna approach to life finally catches up with you now, possibly even stopping you in your tracks. Don't put off the inevitable; deal with problems as they surface to keep your progress from being waylaid. Proactive measures prevent drama and regret."

Although you've been preparing for this opportunity for a long time, you're still committed to doing whatever hard work is necessary to reach your goal. Baseball manager Tommy Lasorda said, ""The difference between the impossible and the possible lies in a man's determination."""
libra,2017-05-15,"They say that home is where the heart is and today you carry your heart into every conversation. Nevertheless, you're still likely to hide your feelings because you don't want them to complicate the difficult emotional issues that are already on your plate. Relationships -- even those that are normally quite stable -- seem to be precariously balanced on an edge. It's not wise to stir up anything additional now because of your subjective point of view. Nevertheless, you can't stop change. Author Robert Byrne wrote, ""Everything is in a state of flux, including the status quo."""
scorpio,2017-05-15,"It's probably pointless for anyone to start an argument with you today because you'll win it, even if you're wrong. You have a ruthless sense of determination that won't allow you to back down once engaged in a conflict. However, a minor disagreement over a trivial matter could escalate into full-on warfare that turns everyone into a loser. Listen to what you're being told now; you might actually learn something of value. It takes courage to change your mind, but sometimes it's the most intelligent option if you want to evolve into a better person."
sagittarius,2017-05-15,"Your practical plan is on point today, especially if you're plotting ways to get further ahead in your career. The possibility of success is so close you can taste it now, motivating you to push harder to improve your status at work. But your sense of integrity prevents you from considering easy shortcuts to fame or fortune. You are willing to invest blood, sweat and tears to make your dreams come true. Francis of Assisi wrote, ""Start by doing what's necessary; then do what's possible, and suddenly you are doing the impossible."""
capricorn,2017-05-15,"While you may not realize the impact you have on others, everything you say packs an extra punch today. Your whispers might sound like shouts and your personal opinions could come across like fire-and-brimstone preaching. Fortunately, the Moon's presence in your sign amplifies your sensitivity, making it easier to empathize with others. Consciously tone down your delivery to make your words more palatable. Don't try to drive your point home; just state it gently and let it float out in the atmosphere. A subtle suggestion is the secret to your success."
aquarius,2017-05-15,"You don't want people to know your thoughts today because you're afraid of showing your vulnerability. You worry that others may try to manipulate your behavior if they can play with your emotions. Additionally, you're concerned that once you start talking from your heart, you won't be able to monitor your words. The fact is your concerns are more detrimental to your success than your imagined consequences. Expressing your feelings without editing them in advance places you in a position of power. Do it with passion or not at all."
pisces,2017-05-15,"You get to lean on your social network today as  your comrades happily rush to rally around you. Thankfully, a support team doesn't have to be mobilized now, since that type of intervention isn't necessary. Instead, you are being offered the quiet reassurance that you're not alone. Just as fish swim in schools, you know that all is well when your tribe is moving in harmony with you. Bertrand Russell noted, ""The only thing that will redeem mankind is cooperation."""
aries,2017-05-16,"Your mind is made up and you're not going to let anyone talk you out of your plans. Unfortunately, you could be so stubborn now that you won't change your position even if you discover your conclusions are based upon incorrect data. Nevertheless, the choice is yours; you can overcome your current brush with inflexibility, assimilate the updated information and choose a new strategy. H.G. Wells wrote, ""Adapt or perish is nature's inexorable imperative."""
taurus,2017-05-16,"Considering all your options is a healthy thing to do, but now it's time to stop your mental explorations and pick one course of action. Ironically, choosing a single goal does not seem constraining today; it's actually a relief. You feel freer once you hone in on your mission instead of wondering what to do next. Rather than closing down your imagination, put it to work in service of manifesting your objective. Author Barbara Sher wrote, ""As soon as you begin to pursue a dream, your life wakes up and everything has meaning."""
gemini,2017-05-16,"You may be inclined to slip away from the group today because you prefer to collect your thoughts in solitude. Although you don't want to ignore your social connections, you're reluctant to broadcast your ideas when communicator Mercury steps into your 12th House of Privacy. Retreating from too much conversational noise is revitalizing as long as it's temporary. Withdrawing for a while enables you to return refreshed and ready for another round of interaction. Sharing is caring, but only when it's done on a voluntary basis."
cancer,2017-05-16,"Your goals are inextricably entangled with the goals of others today, making it tricky to be clear about your personal objectives. Things are even more complicated because you could seek words of wisdom from your friends or coworkers, unaware of the biases that are influencing their advice. Nevertheless, an outside opinion can help you gain perspective on your own thoughts as long as you maintain an open mind and apply critical thinking. Author Alan Cohen wrote, ""Personal growth is not a matter of learning new information but of unlearning old limits."""
leo,2017-05-16,"For a Lion who likes being on center stage, it's extremely rewarding when others take note of your observations. Although your words may reach the ears of important people now that messenger Mercury is talking up a storm in your 10th House of Career, someone might not agree with your position on a work-related matter. Your persistence can be a tremendous asset unless you don't know when to back off. Spoken word artist Alysia Harris said, ""The moment you feel like you have to prove your worth is the moment to absolutely and utterly walk away."""
virgo,2017-05-16,"Your curiosity is on fire today, but you remain annoyingly pragmatic. Your peers might wish you could loosen up and take a chance, but intelligent Mercury's shift into sensible Taurus reinforces your need to stick to the facts. Nevertheless, there's a part of you that wants to give your imagination free rein, but you just can't ignore the data knocking on your door. Biographer George Earle Buckle wrote, ""In practical life the wisest and soundest people avoid speculation."""
libra,2017-05-16,"A conversation that begins as a casual encounter can intensify into one that powerfully impacts your life. Interactive Mercury's shift into your 8th House of Deep Sharing opens your heart to a new level of intimacy by revealing your vulnerability to someone's charms. But there's no reason to accelerate your emotional disclosure too quickly. Take your time by laying the necessary groundwork before letting your guard down. Shakespeare wrote, ""Love all, trust a few, do wrong to none."""
scorpio,2017-05-16,"You might feel the need to justify your behavior to others today, but the less you say, the better. The problem is that people don't have the inclination to listen to long and involved stories now, nor do they want to hear about your emotional process. They want a simple explanation without the endless details. Talk in the most practical terms possible. Instead of trying to impress others with your words, let your actions tell the story."
sagittarius,2017-05-16,"Although you try to overlook any resistance you experience at work today, it won't go away on its own. Denial isn't a viable strategy and only leads to frustration. Nevertheless, your success is all but guaranteed if you create a simple program and adhere to your newly established routine until it becomes productive. Unfortunately, starting with unrealistic goals might make it tough to achieve them in reality. Lasting results come over time, not overnight. Henry Ford said, ""If you think you can or you think you can't, you're right."""
capricorn,2017-05-16,"You wish you could pursue your fantasies today, but mundane tasks prevent you from drifting away from the real world. Nevertheless, you're still driven to express your feelings, whether or not they meet with the expectations of others. Figuring out a way to have fun while being responsible is easy now that trickster Mercury and the willful Sun are both visiting your 5th House of Play. You can't wander too far from your obligations but you can enjoy yourself while fulfilling your promises. Balance is your friend."
aquarius,2017-05-16,"Your head may be in the clouds today, but your heart is tightly tethered to more practical concerns. On one hand, you're trying to increase your emotional security so you have a stable starting point for your upcoming explorations. On the other hand, the Moon's return to your sign puts you in touch with your unresolved feelings. Unfortunately, your changing moods don't necessarily support your current logistics. Mindfulness guru Jon Kabat-Zinn teaches, ""You can't stop the waves, but you can learn to surf."""
pisces,2017-05-16,"You are a natural-born dreamer. You're happiest when you step out beyond the boundaries of your ego and experience life as your own personal magical mystery tour. However, you may be swimming for the safety of certainty today when cerebral Mercury shifts into earthy Taurus and your 3rd House of Immediate Environment. Fortunately, your next metaphysical excursion will be even better than your previous one if you have a secure place to land when your imaginary trip is over."
aries,2017-05-17,"You might have sufficient reasons to reject someone's offer now that your mind is on the more practical side of reality. Nevertheless, your insistence on boiling down an entire program to a simple bottom line may cause you to miss the potential in an exciting opportunity. Continue weighing the pros and cons until you know what makes the most sense. But don't let your memories of a previous failure stop you from exploring the less obvious benefits offered by the road less taken. To reach your greatest potential you must overcome your greatest fears."
taurus,2017-05-17,"Maintaining an objective approach to your job enables you to make the best decisions today. Nevertheless, it's still tempting to get lost in an illusion and then act as if there is no difference between reality and fantasy. There is little doubt that your attitude influences the level of your success, but you can't treat all thoughts equally. Rather than striving harder in pursuit of your heart's desires, choose your goals with greater care. Sportscaster Stuart Scott cautioned, ""Don't downgrade your dream just to fit your reality. Upgrade your conviction to match your destiny."""
gemini,2017-05-17,"Yesterday's answers become today's questions. However, your renewed sense of wonder and growing uncertainty is not about self-doubt. You're fascinated with the mysteries of the cosmos and a new wave of curiosity gets the best of you now. Fortunately, there are gems of wisdom waiting to be discovered in the twilight of your consciousness. Surprisingly, your imagination reveals more practical options than logical analysis. Novelist Lloyd Alexander wrote, ""Fantasy is hardly an escape from reality. It's a way of understanding it."""
cancer,2017-05-17,"You may gain inspiration from a close friend or relative today, yet your vision comes with a cost. Seeing new possibilities for your future can be an eye-opening experience, but it also increases your ambiguity. Your excitement mounts when you start thinking about the unrealized potential in your life. Nevertheless, too many choices could be overwhelming, tempting you to seal yourself off in a bubble of safety. Tony Robbins notes, ""It is in your moments of decision that your destiny is shaped."""
leo,2017-05-17,"You think you have a solid handle on the current dynamics at work and that you can see how to best achieve success for you and your team. But believing that your plan is the only way to reach your goal doesn't necessarily reflect the reality of the situation. Your rose-colored glasses alter your perceptions now, prompting you to miss some of the potential traps that are more obvious to others. Talk with your peers and listen to their feedback with impartial ears. Bruce Lee said, ""Adapt what is useful, reject what is useless, and add what is specifically your own."""
virgo,2017-05-17,"You wish you could break out of your rut and do things differently today. Nevertheless, it's wise to have a logical reason for your unorthodox behavior, since rebellion is not the same as innovation. Playing the role of a contrarian won't make you any more successful now, but it might alienate you from your closest allies. Peace activist Mairead Maguire wrote, ""We need radical thinking, creative ideas, and imagination."" The path to meaningful change is often walked alone."
libra,2017-05-17,"Your attraction to people may be more based on your own expectations today than with reality. You're eager to connect with someone who shares your vision of the future, but you might be too quick in assuming you know what's in another person's heart. Nevertheless, exchanging dreams begins the process of getting acquainted on a deeper level. Avoid jumping to conclusions now; let each other's stories unfold naturally. Singer Jim Morrison said, ""A true friend is someone who gives you total freedom to be yourself."""
scorpio,2017-05-17,"Guardian angels are watching your back now, even if you're not convinced of their existence. You can call it luck if that fits in better with your beliefs -- but however you label the divine intervention, it's only the first step. Transforming an obstacle into a blessing requires your passionate involvement today, because it's not something that will just automatically happen. Pay close attention to subtle events; if a door appears in a previously impenetrable wall, it's up to you to open it and walk through. It's as if the Universe is saying, ""Don't tell me what you want; show me what you can do."""
sagittarius,2017-05-17,"It's tempting to put all your eggs in one basket, especially if that basket is just beyond your grasp. This might sound like a self-defeating plan, but it can actually work in your favor today. Instead of trying to finish anything you start, just set the intention for what you hope to accomplish. Surreal Neptune is blurring your goals, making them impossible to reach now. But you have much to gain by shifting into a metaphysical orientation. Let your dreams inspire you by stretching your vision beyond your familiar limits. Dare to step over the edge and fly."
capricorn,2017-05-17,"You can soar as high as any eagle once your work is done. But your wings can't gain altitude as long as you still have responsibilities anchoring you in the real world. Nevertheless, you may be in a position where you could focus on your long-term career goals today, rather than handling crises from one moment to the next. Instead of struggling to climb the mountaintop now, go on a reconnaissance mission to strategize for your next summit. Fellow Capricorn Baltasar Gracian said, ""Readiness is the mother of luck."""
aquarius,2017-05-17,"You're being asked to leave behind the emotional safety of your everyday life and walk into an uncharted realm where everything is new and different. Your imagination has no boundaries. Anything can happen once you give yourself permission to explore your fantasies. But this metaphysical adventure isn't just about fun and games; your mission is dead serious today. You are a scout, searching out possible places to live in your future. Whatever you find now in your dreams has the potential of becoming your home."
pisces,2017-05-17,"Hopefully, your mundane matters are in order and you're ready for a journey to a parallel universe. Fortunately, you don't even need to let anyone know you're leaving today, since you can magically be in two places at once. Maintain the illusion of consistency in the real world when you blast off into the realms of unseen dimensions. Although spiritual pursuits are often physically exhausting, exploring the inner and outer cosmos is a life-altering experience. Rumi wrote, ""The door is open wide; do not go back to sleep."""
aries,2017-05-18,"You can turn on the charm so adeptly today that people don't see what you're actually doing. It appears that you're coloring inside the lines and behaving within social norms, but the truth becomes obvious upon closer examination. Your conservative style is a clever tactic that puts others at ease while you're setting the stage for more revolutionary behavior. Your plans will not only be tolerated now, they will be appreciated as long as you concentrate on the needs of all. Lives change when action meets compassion."
taurus,2017-05-18,"Working as part of a team enables you to be very productive today, but your agenda might be slightly different from the group consensus. Nevertheless, you can blend so seamlessly into the crowd that no one will even notice you're really on your own path. Fortunately, everyone benefits from your ability to play on both sides of the fence now. Although it would be easier to forget about your goal and just work for the larger cause, you can't. Elon Musk said, ""When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor."""
gemini,2017-05-18,"Although a close friend or partner might try to talk you out of your ambitious plans, you're ready to launch into your future by trying something new. You look toward the horizon and see a world full of positive potential while others see detours, walls and abysses. Thankfully, your current ability to balance the pros and cons will play out to your advantage, so don't let anyone turn your confidence into fear. The less you respond to negativity now, the more successful you become."
cancer,2017-05-18,"Someone's reactions to you may be confusing, and you want to get to the bottom of the puzzle today. Thankfully, the emotionally detached Aquarius Moon allows you to dig beneath the surface while maintaining an objective approach. Luna's visit to your 8th House of Deep Sharing motivates you to talk about the secrets you uncover. Normally, you might be reluctant to stir up sensitive issues, but at least for now, you know you're in safe hands. Be fearless enough to start a conversation that matters."
leo,2017-05-18,"Nearly everyone seems to be acting weird today, as if they're not interested in what anyone thinks of their efforts. Actually, a rise in the Eccentricity Factor can be traced to the rebellious Aquarius Moon's visit to your 7th House of Relationships. Luckily, you are quite capable of minimizing your dependence on others now. Instead of taking the easy route and combining your forces with someone else, concentrate on reaching your goals on your own. Author Patricia Sampson wrote, ""Self-reliance is the only road to true freedom, and being one's own person is its ultimate reward."""
virgo,2017-05-18,"Controlling your awareness is difficult today because your key planet Mercury forms a fateful connection with unrelenting Pluto. Sometimes you can filter out negative ideas that stand in the way of your success. But you make choices based upon the involvement of your whole brain, not just the small part that is conscious. The mind is like an iceberg with ninety percent of it remaining hidden. Deepening the connections with your subconscious enables you to make better long-term decisions. You know the truth by the way it feels."
libra,2017-05-18,"You don't want to do everything the same old way today, but you still have a great deal of respect for the tried and true. Asking others for advice could be a mistake if you're looking for reasons to maintain the status quo, since people are more likely to push you outside of your comfort zone now. Nevertheless, your most successful strategy is based on breaking free from a previous limitation without dismantling the entire structure. Ravi Shankar said, ""Perfect balance is like a razor's edge; it can be found only in the Self."""
scorpio,2017-05-18,"Your uncharacteristically dispassionate approach to handling an awkward situation today allows you to get away with holding a radical position. You can fly under the radar, even if you're being a contrarian or a revolutionary. It's not what you say that makes your message more palatable, it's how you say it. Anything you offer to soften the blow of your words helps your cause now. Keep in mind you will catch more flies with honey than with vinegar."
sagittarius,2017-05-18,"You can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel. You're at a turning point where your actions have particularly profound impact. But your winning strategy must incorporate a wilder and crazier approach to life now that radical Uranus is creating chaos in your 5th House of Self-Expression. Don't let others dictate your strategy. If they do, it's up to you to take it back. Instead of playing someone else's game, stay ahead of the curve and play your own."
capricorn,2017-05-18,"You tend to be notoriously methodical, especially when things get a little crazy. In fact, you might compensate by setting goals, making plans and progressing one step at a time. Nevertheless, a magical confluence of energies offers you an opportunity to make a great leap forward today. However, you must be willing to take a chance proportional to the size of the jump ahead. Just remember that indiscriminate gambling is very different than calculating your risk factor. Lucille Ball said, ""I'd rather regret the things I've done than regret the things I haven't done."""
aquarius,2017-05-18,"Your ability to play both ends of the spectrum today helps you find stability in the midst of chaos. Paradoxically, the changeable Moon's visit to your sign presents its own set of challenges, including how to stay in touch with your feelings without letting them overwhelm your day. Thankfully, a harmonizing Saturn-Uranus trine ensures you have a stable place to stand even in the middle of an emotional earthquake. Spiritual teacher Eknath Easwaran wrote, ""We can find our center of gravity within ourselves by simplifying and slowing down our lives."""
pisces,2017-05-18,"You often daydream about sudden windfalls or mysterious inheritances that dramatically improve your finances. Unfortunately, these scenarios are not likely to manifest anytime soon; the most reliable changes will unfold in small increments. Nevertheless, it may be time to advance in your profession and increase your income. Developing a radical strategy works to your advantage now, but only if you're willing to persist in your efforts. Bruce Lee said, ""Long-term consistency trumps short-term intensity."""
aries,2017-05-19,"Your warrior nature is aroused as you posture to go head to head with someone in power. It looks like you're willing to stand up for your friends, but you might have less altruistic intentions today. The key to your success lies in the hands of others who bring opportunities for growth and  possibilities of pleasure. All relationships are grounded in a give and take of energy. Everyone will fare better if you're honest from the start. If you watch out for your allies, they're more likely to watch out for you."
taurus,2017-05-19,"Your workmates can be very convincing today as they persuade you to join their parade. However, an overindulgent Venus-Jupiter opposition makes it difficult to get enthused unless there is immediate gratification attached to your involvement. If others know the way to your heart now, they might earn your support by offering you a monetary bonus or even taking you out for a fine meal. Although it may be a struggle on your part, separate your personal pleasures from your professional priorities. Deepak Chopra said, ""No matter what the situation, remind yourself, 'I have a choice.'"""
gemini,2017-05-19,"You see fame and fortune everywhere you look today. Everything that catches your eye is a teaser for a possible life path that leads to the prosperity you desire. However, all that glitters is not gold. Your failure is imminent if you try to pursue all the opportunities in front of you. Although restraining your confidence might not seem like a sensible strategy, it all but ensures a happy and productive future. If you chase two rabbits, they both will escape. Narrowing your focus ensures your success."
cancer,2017-05-19,"Someone may be creating trouble for you behind the scenes today. Nevertheless, you're eager to ferret out the truth and take your adversary to task. In fact, you could be fearless now because you believe you are on the side of fair and ethical behavior. Unfortunately, it's possible to fail on your mission because you overlooked an obvious red flag. Don't initiate any significant changes until you double-check all your assumptions and conclusions. If your facts are wrong, it's like building your house on shifting sand. If your foundation is strong, your actions will withstand the tests of time."
leo,2017-05-19,"If a little of something feels good, then a lot of it should be amazing -- at least, that's how it seems when sweet Venus sits on one end of a see-saw and indulgent Jupiter is on the other. Although you are caught in the middle of this cosmic game, Jupiter will ultimately dominate the scene, meaning you should err on the side of less. Nevertheless, a lovely day awaits your participation as long as you can let go of any lingering resentment. The secret to having it all is knowing you already do."
virgo,2017-05-19,"Your integrity is anchored in your core beliefs; you know what is most important to you and you're willing to make decisions that are in step with your values. However, getting a solid grip on the laws of the land is only a starting point. Part of why you learn to carefully define the edges of acceptable behavior is so you can choose when it's necessary to break a rule. Albert Einstein said, ""Once we accept our limits, we go beyond them."""
libra,2017-05-19,"Saying no may be the hardest thing you can do today, yet it's necessary to establish firm boundaries. The problem is that several planets are activating buoyant Jupiter in your 1st House of Self, encouraging you to see the bright side of every situation, even if there are demons lurking in the shadows. It's so natural to say yes now that you might find yourself in over your head before you know it. However, you can avoid the traps if you take time to observe the clues and signs all around you. Eckhart Tolle wrote, ""Awareness is the greatest agent for change."""
scorpio,2017-05-19,"You can be rather ornery today, even if you have everyone's best interests at heart. Although you know exactly what needs to be done, it seems as if your way is being blocked by people who shouldn't even be involved. Your key planets, angry Mars and persistent Pluto, are in conflict because they have different ideas as to how you could execute your strategy. You're tempted to set the dilemma aside when you realize there are no easy answers; after all, there are plenty more enjoyable things to do with your time. Maturity comes when you stop making excuses and start making changes."
sagittarius,2017-05-19,"There are worse things than succumbing to self-indulgent behavior today. But the transition from no-nonsense Saturn to anything-goes Jupiter might seem all too abrupt. Although you won't likely understand the mechanisms of this energetic shift, you can feel it coming in your bones. Take your cues from the stars by dancing with the old and the new without favoring either extreme. Thich Nhat Hanh said, ""Sometimes your joy is the source of your smile, but sometimes your smile can be the source of your joy."""
capricorn,2017-05-19,"You must juggle your need to reestablish your center of gravity with your desire to seize the moment while it lasts. The sweetness in the air is palpable and you want to drink from the fountain of pleasure today. There's even a chance that mixing work and play will result in advancing your career. However, there's always the danger of indulging with such reckless abandon that your commitments suffer. Author William Arthur Ward wrote, ""A well-developed sense of humor is the pole that adds balance to your steps as you walk the tightrope of life."""
aquarius,2017-05-19,"It's nearly impossible to focus on the events of the present moment. You're cruising for new people to meet and fun social activities to experience. Unfortunately, your decision-making process is not working at its best today; you might prefer procrastinating instead of analyzing the alternatives and making a choice. The problem is the more you search, the more you find. Dorothy Parker quipped, ""The cure for boredom is curiosity. There is no cure for curiosity."""
pisces,2017-05-19,"Someone or something wonderful may fall into your lap today with very little warning. It's almost as if you're receiving an inheritance or winning the lottery. Unfortunately, you cannot tell in advance exactly how or when this lovely surprise will manifest. However, you can choose to remain open to the opportunities knocking at your door. The trick is not to inflate your expectations so high that reality cannot satisfy you. Wayne Dyer wrote, ""Abundance is not something we acquire; it's something we tune into."""
aries,2017-05-20,"Your itching to make something happen today, but it may take more time to get going than you expect. In fact, you may be trying too hard because you think your opportunity will pass before you get started. However, the opposite is true. Do whatever's good for your soul. Although this might sound backward, you're better off enjoying some long-overdue downtime early in the day and then getting busy once your batteries are recharged. Play first, work later."
taurus,2017-05-20,"You can turn a minor event into a major problem today if you keep thinking about your unrealized goals. Rather than looking ahead toward what you want to accomplish, you continue to review recent missteps and setbacks, possibly blaming yourself for the failure. However, wallowing time is over now that the clever Gemini Sun highlights your 2nd House of Self-Esteem. Pick up the pieces and get back into the game. Henry Ford said, ""Failure is the opportunity to begin again more intelligently."""
gemini,2017-05-20,"It's as if someone turns the lights on today and you can suddenly see everything in your nearby environment. One of the things you might notice with a large number of dissatisfied people is their tendency to procrastinate. But the Sun has returned to your sign and postponing your destiny is out of the question because you can't take your eyes off the prize.  Kirsty Mailer cautions, ""You can't plough a field by turning it over in your mind."" Success is closer than you think if you just put one foot after the other until you arrive at your destination."
cancer,2017-05-20,"You might decide to fly beneath the radar today -- maybe not even leaving the house. Thankfully, you have so much to do around your home that there's no chance of boredom setting in. Nevertheless, a low-key anxiety may prevent you from enjoying this pause in your hectic life. Fortunately, the solution to dissatisfaction is simpler than you think. Dale Carnegie said, ""Happiness doesn't depend on any external conditions; it is governed by our mental attitude."""
leo,2017-05-20,"You're turning the page and starting a new chapter of your life. But jumping ahead in your book to escape from a part of the story you didn't like is just as problematic as rereading the previous section over and over again. Luckily, you are eager to communicate with others while the interactive Gemini Sun illuminates your 11th House of Social Networks. Nevertheless, pay attention to the signals you receive so you don't move too fast or too slow. Seek the Goldilocks point of moderation, where everything is just right."
virgo,2017-05-20,"You like your information tidy -- packaged neatly and carefully labeled so you know which data is most useful. However, the Sun's shift into noisy Gemini is a magnet for another kind of intelligence that's messier and harder to classify. Your personal interactions with others may be plagued by inconsistent communication and false facts. Don't just accept what you hear as truth. Do your own research and draw your own conclusions."
libra,2017-05-20,"Your schedule might fall apart at the seams today, and you're wise to offer no resistance if it does. At first, your hands-off response might seem counterproductive, yet your newly found flexibility empowers you to make decisions that are based upon the merit of each moment. However, keeping a few items on your agenda gives your day the backbone needed to increase your efficiency. Star Trek creator, Gene Rodenberry said, ""We are on a journey to keep an appointment with whatever we are."""
scorpio,2017-05-20,"People might misinterpret your behavior today. It appears as if you're all over the map, spinning your wheels and not accomplishing much at all. To the contrary, you're on a mission to gather information wherever it surfaces. Instead of forming opinions and then seeking data to justify your position, you're doing the opposite. Don't worry about the judgment of others; continue on your quest until you've decided where you want to stand. Zen master Gido Shoseki wrote, ""Truth only reveals itself when one gives up all preconceived ideas."""
sagittarius,2017-05-20,"Pinning others down seems like an impossible task today. In fact, words seem like greased watermelons; each time you grab onto one, it slips from your grasp and leaves you wondering what it meant. Needless to say, you can work yourself into a state of frustration if you think you're going to turn an elusive concept into a substantial cornerstone. Fortunately, you can relieve the stress by thinking poetically rather than in practical terms. Enjoy the dance with images and ideas for what they are and not for what you want. Muhammad Ali said, ""The man who has no imagination has no wings."""
capricorn,2017-05-20,"Letting go of your concrete plans can be a real challenge, but there's much to be gained if you can remain open to the unknown possibilities of the day. When everything is so buttoned down, there's little room for spontaneity -- and that's where creativity enters the picture. Temporarily replace mastery with curiosity, facts with fantasy, and accomplishment with explorations. When you look at the world through the eyes of a child, you will see magic in everything."
aquarius,2017-05-20,"You want to set your responsibilities aside so you can turn your weekend into one of fun and games. But you're not willing to pay the price of letting others down if you don't deliver on your promises. Although you might stress out while making decisions about your activities today, it's really not that complicated. You can handle multiple agenda if you think out your schedule in advance. With a little bit of planning you can meet your obligations while still having time for fun. Postmaster General John Wanamaker says, ""People who cannot find time for recreation are obliged, sooner or later, to find time for illness."""
pisces,2017-05-20,"Your feet barely touch ground today as you soar on the wings of thought and surf on the waves of emotions. There's so much happening now that you don't have time for practical considerations. Thankfully, the cosmos has opened up a portal for you to slip into a parallel universe today. The good news is you won't be missed in the mundane world, especially if your closest friends join you on your great adventure. Although there may be a few moments when you wonder if you did the right thing, you'll return refreshed and ready to reengage with reality as you left it."
aries,2017-05-21,"It may seem as if you're starting your day doing those things you intended to do yesterday but never quite got off the ground. Thankfully, the cosmos is giving you a second chance today, so don't wait for a better moment. Although you can ride on the energy generated when the Moon shifts into enterprising Aries, it's easier to get started than it is to finish whatever you begin. Mahatma Gandhi said, ""Satisfaction lies in the effort, not in the attainment; full effort is full victory."""
taurus,2017-05-21,"You want to come clean today by sharing your feelings with a close friend or romantic interest. However, opening your heart isn't as simple as it is in books or movies. Each time you start to say something, your words precipitate a defensive reaction. Your tendency is to emotionally withdraw, rather than questioning the reasons behind this dynamic now. Unfortunately, this evasive tactic doesn't add much to your game. Step back into the arena and tell others what's on your mind. Bishop Desmond Tutu cautioned, ""Don't raise your voice; improve your argument."""
gemini,2017-05-21,"You have so much spring in every step today that you may be bouncing off the walls. Unfortunately, you are so emotionally reactive now that your unbridled enthusiasm could hinder your productivity. The ardent Aries Moon activates your 11th House of Long-Term Goals, but there's no reason to let your irrepressible energy ruin your plans when you can channel it to your advantage. Hunter S. Thompson wrote, ""Anything that gets your blood racing is probably worth doing."""
cancer,2017-05-21,"You may be feeling the pressure as you try to clarify your next move. Red lights are turning green and you are eager to hit the gas pedal. However, you don't know your current location and your GPS can't get a proper signal. Instead of admitting defeat, start asking questions and see who comes up with the best solutions. Just remember that there is no one correct answer to solving your lack of orientation. Continue to gather data points until you can see the big picture. Once you have your bearings, you'll be free to ride into the future."
leo,2017-05-21,"There's no holding you back today; in fact, you're like a bird that's outgrown its nest, free to soar on the winds of change. You might grow nostalgic now as you take a quick trip down Memory Lane. But don't spend too much time reminiscing about the past. Luckily, you're ready to explore new lands without carrying any emotional baggage. The Moon's shift into journeying Sagittarius encourages you to embark on your next amazing adventure. Fly, baby, fly!"
virgo,2017-05-21,"You are fearless when pursuing an emotional connection today. Although you tend to be rather cautious when delving into the realm of passions, the presence of the brash Aries Moon in your 8th House of Deep Sharing emboldens you to sink into the mysterious shadows. However, you could be so intense in your desire for affection that you scare away the very person you want to attract. Pushing your way into someone's heart will not work. St. Francis de Sales wrote, ""Nothing is so strong as gentleness, nothing so gentle as real strength."""
libra,2017-05-21,"Everyone seems overly demanding today and you don't know whether or not you can provide what they want. Naturally, you enjoy making others happy, but you're not willing to engage with someone who is acting mean-spirited. It really doesn't take much effort to be nice. When people treat you like they don't care, believe them. You will rest easier once you make a clear distinction between dependency and love. Give from the goodness of your heart with no strings attached or don't give at all."
scorpio,2017-05-21,"You might be right on the edge of a serious conflict, yet you can't figure out how you arrived at this uncomfortable spot today. It's as if you walked into a story that was already written, but you're not interested in arguing with a loved one over whose way to do something is better. Nevertheless, it can be very annoying if someone says they have a superior method and they are relentless in their pursuit of your support. Meanwhile, you just want to get on with your routine in a manner that makes sense to you. You are at your most powerful when you don't need the approval of anyone else."
sagittarius,2017-05-21,"You are so friendly today that almost no one can resist your charm. Although you're not seeking the depth and intensity that some might require in a conversation, your lighthearted approach offers a sweet respite to even the most serious person. There's no doubt about who you are while the spontaneous Aries Moon activates your 5th House of Self-Expression. It's refreshing that you have no hidden agenda; what you see is what you get. It's enough to laugh, be happy and create good memories. Serve the world with your joy."
capricorn,2017-05-21,"Your ambitious nature may have already prompted you to make big plans for the day. However, you secretly wish you could scrap them and just follow your whims. Fortunately, with a little shuffling you can walk away from an overly structured agenda and just take each twist and turn as it arrives today. Paradoxically, you'll end up accomplishing more with less on your schedule now. Don't waste time justifying your actions to anyone else. Musician John McLaughlin said, ""Only in spontaneity can we be who we truly are."""
aquarius,2017-05-21,"You want to rattle cages and raise eyebrows today. You're on the hunt for something totally out of the box now that the Moon charges into impulsive Aries and your 3rd House of Distractions. The big question is how can you creatively express the absolute uniqueness of being you? Sufi poet Rumi's response was, ""I want a trouble-maker for a lover, blood spiller, blood drinker, a heart of flame who quarrels with the sky and fights with fate, who burns like fire on the rushing sea."" Naturally, your answer might be different."
pisces,2017-05-21,"A plethora of innovative money-making schemes are popping into your head now. You're riding a creative rush, yet good ideas don't turn into practical plans on their own. Unfortunately, methodical thinking doesn't come easily today; it's more natural to jump from one epiphany to another without following through on anything. Ironically, there's no reason to force a potential opportunity into reality. Instead, enjoy the flow without trying to contain it. Your best concepts will develop into something useful in the days ahead. Inspiration plants seeds that need time to grow."
aries,2017-05-22,"You're not shy about telling someone exactly what you need now, but you might be surprised by the intensity of the response. It's as if you kicked a hornet's nest and woke a sleeping giant. Nevertheless, running isn't an option; you must stand and face the energy you stirred. Thankfully, holding your ground isn't nearly as difficult as you think. Keep in mind that today's struggles develop tomorrow's strength."
taurus,2017-05-22,"An attraction to someone at work might prompt you to fire on all cylinders today. There's a twinkle in your eye and an extra bounce in your step. Unfortunately, the other person may not share your emotional state of mind, which could create an awkward dynamic of imbalanced energy. The good news is you probably won't say anything if you sense an unhappy ending to your potential disclosure. Sometimes it's better to stay silent than to tell others how you feel. Wait until you get a green light before revealing your heart."
gemini,2017-05-22,"You love being a part of a social group, especially when everyone shares common interests. But try as you might, you don't seem to fit in today, triggering insecurities which isolate you even more. It's as if you're standing with one foot in the circle now, waiting for an invitation, and the other aimed away, poised for your escape. Nevertheless, there may be other options between the extremes of all and nothing. Being yourself doesn't mean you have to be alone."
cancer,2017-05-22,"A new opportunity at work might catch your interest now and send you spinning out possibilities in every direction. However, it's too soon to know how it might affect your career trajectory. One thing is for certain: your time is limited and you may need to step back from some commitments at home or with family to devote your energy to this project. Although you don't have to decide today, it's healthy to begin your process by surveying all the alternative paths until you find one that stands out from the rest."
leo,2017-05-22,"Your response to stress at work is to dream about an exotic adventure. However, it may be too early to set dates and make airline reservations. But it's not too soon to narrow down your potential destinations. In fact, during this phase of planning, worrying about mundane logistics like cost or time is just a waste of energy. It doesn't matter whether or not your journey is even feasible. Simply, exploring your fantasies about being free to travel anywhere you want can be enough to vastly improve your attitude."
virgo,2017-05-22,"You're motivated to solidify your professional position but circumstantial factors make settling down a bit more problematic today. Additionally, you're driven by the desire to increase your net worth. However, you cannot do it alone now. Consider who might share similar goals and what skills they would bring to the party. Don't try to persuade anyone to join your cause. If it isn't in their heart, they're not the one for this venture. True collaboration requires mutual commitment."
libra,2017-05-22,"You're eager to please those who treat you with respect. In fact, you like the idea of returning compliments as a way of acknowledging them from others. You excel in making people feel comfortable by responding to their minor needs. Unfortunately, your well-intended behavior may be misunderstood today, especially if someone thinks you're being condescending in your attempts to help. Don't get caught up in the noise in your head, trying to untangle every paranoid suspicion. When in doubt, take the high road and avoid the traffic."
scorpio,2017-05-22,"Your attention is on the details of one particular job today and you're doing your best not to look up. You really don't want to blow your current task, for it's a valuable stepping stone to other opportunities that are still looming in the distance. But you could be so intent on giving a perfect performance that you fill your sails with a bit of extra wind. At first, people notice you cruising along like a pro. However, the waters grow choppy if you're unkind to anyone you might view as competition. Robert Ingersoll wrote, ""We rise by lifting others."""
sagittarius,2017-05-22,"Theoretically, you should be able to fly through the day, unobstructed by the annoyances of everyday life. Unfortunately, one thing after another distracts you from your work. But simply ignoring the interference only makes it stronger. Creatively engaging in the lives of others might slow your progress in the short run, but interactions with your peers ultimately enrich your world. Psychologist Rollo May wrote, ""Communication leads to community, that is, to understanding, intimacy and mutual valuing."""
capricorn,2017-05-22,"You may be considering a career move to increase your autonomy, but striking out on your own isn't such a good idea now. Although minor emotional clashes can trigger your flight mechanism, it's to your advantage to slow down and iron out any differences you have with others. You don't need to be one-hundred percent independent; you only need enough leeway to make crucial decisions on your own. Author Virginia Burden wrote, ""Cooperation is the thorough conviction that nobody can get there unless everybody gets there."""
aquarius,2017-05-22,"You might secretly believe that your calendar is stretchable and that time, too, is like rubber. However, in reality, you can only fit so much into one day, even if you continue to say yes to every intriguing idea that comes your way. Don't push yourself too hard or you could exhaust your resources before you fulfill your very real obligations. Oscar Wilde wrote, ""Life is too important to be taken seriously."""
pisces,2017-05-22,"Waking up to a fresh beginning would be ideal, but nothing is as simple now as it appears. Nevertheless, if you can't start all over again from scratch, at least you can wipe sections of the slate clean. But don't set out on a course of action that takes you down the same path that didn't work last time. If you want different results, you must try something you've never done. Poet Tuli Kupferberg wrote, ""When patterns are broken, new worlds can emerge."""
aries,2017-05-23,"You can break new ground today while setting the stage for future discussions. You're ready to talk about an issue that's been bothering you for a while, but you're unwilling to reveal too much information right away. Ironically, you may be speaking faster than usual as you dance circles around the topic you're trying to avoid. You can shift the dynamics of the conversation by consciously monitoring your delivery and sticking to the point. Be like Albert Einstein who said, ""It's not that I'm so smart; it's just that I stay with problems longer."""
taurus,2017-05-23,"You already answered the wake-up call; now you must act on what you know. It's not always easy to integrate a new piece of information, let alone an entirely different perspective, but talking about your epiphany is a good place to start. Thankfully, it's comforting to share your feelings while the sensitive Moon is collaborating with expressive Mercury in your sign. But this is not a race, so take your time and unfold your story carefully. A trusted confidant will give you better advice if they understand where you're coming from. Solid communication is the key to furthering your evolution."
gemini,2017-05-23,"Speaking a lot of words out loud doesn't mean that you say anything relevant. Writing a long email doesn't automatically ensure your intended message is conveyed. In fact, you could overwhelm others with an overflowing data stream as a way of avoiding what's most important. But don't wait for an ally to point out your evasive tactics. Once you're conscious of your behavior, you can improve your communication by shifting the discussion to a more personal topic. Peel back your layers as if you are an onion, even if you prefer to be left in the ground. Argentinian poet Antonio Porchia wrote, ""The shadows: some hide, others reveal."""
cancer,2017-05-23,"Your coworkers and friends have your back today by creating a solid support system. But in order to activate your connection with others, you must be the one who gets the conversational ball rolling. Assistance will not magically arrive at your door or at your desk unless you ask for help. Unveiling your needs is not a sign of weakness. In fact, psychologist Brene Brown wrote, ""Vulnerability is our most accurate measurement of courage."" No risk, no reward."
leo,2017-05-23,"It might take a jolt of anger to motivate you into action today. Although you're slower to make a scene when the Moon is visiting easygoing Taurus, you have your limits just like any proud Lion. You may choose a strategy of peaceful coexistence until someone pushes you too far. Paying closer attention to your feelings enables you to calmly say what's on your mind instead of waiting until it's too late. Losing your temper is a waste of energy; process your emotions while they are still manageable. Reason wins out in the end."
virgo,2017-05-23,"You are walking a fine line between the practicalities of the present moment and the possibilities of the future. You're tired of being tethered to the mundane, especially when you can't ignore your current responsibilities and there's little time left over for charting your route to freedom. However, you are inspired by imagining the changes you can make now, and where your road ahead might lead. Don't set limits on your unlimited potential. Align your belief system to better suit your goals."
libra,2017-05-23,"People seem shadier today, like they aren't disclosing everything that might concern you. It's not that you are paranoid, but you are curious about what's being conveniently dropped out of view. Unfortunately, asking questions won't help; your prodding will only make someone clam up even more. Your smartest strategy is simple now: live your life from the inside out. Rather than basing your wellbeing on anyone else, seek emotional security within and let others go through their motions. Whatever you need to know will be revealed in due time."
scorpio,2017-05-23,"You run into unexpected resistance today, setting the stage for a battle of opposing wills. You might consider changing your plans, but someone else may be so stubborn that you double down on your original position instead. Unfortunately, a standoff like this has nowhere to go and only makes matters worse for everyone involved, especially if you're unwilling to bend. Either put an end to the conflict by walking away from it or break the ice by offering a negotiating chip. Life is short; choose happiness over being right."
sagittarius,2017-05-23,"A pragmatic outlook on your responsibilities serves you well today. Rather than dreaming about an upcoming adventure or sketching out your long-term goals, keep focusing on your immediate surroundings and your work in progress. You have an opportunity to reestablish control over your life by managing one small task at a time. Fortunately, your current situation is not your final destination; wait for another day to make plans for the future. In the famous words of Ram Dass, ""Be here now."""
capricorn,2017-05-23,"You are most productive when mundane matters flow as you planned. Thankfully, major pieces of the puzzle are falling into place now. You're ready to sit down and create something extraordinary while the Moon is visiting artistic Taurus and your 5th House of Self-Expression. Your current schedule might offer you enough leeway to slip off into a creative zone and you should grab the opportunity before it vanishes. Thoreau wrote, ""The world is but a canvas to the imagination."""
aquarius,2017-05-23,"Your mental tenacity is impressively strong today and there is little that can throw you off course. Nevertheless, a friend or associate who wants to work or play with you could quickly become a real annoyance. You have clear boundaries and don't appreciate it when you must state them again and again, only to have them ignored anyway. Although your personal interactions with someone might require more of your time than you prefer now, don't let it hijack your day. Goethe wrote, ""He who is firm and resolute in will molds the world to himself."""
pisces,2017-05-23,"Although your visions continue to evoke powerful feelings, you can put them into a healthier framework today. It's still advisable to explore the symbols that come from your subconscious, since they expand your understanding of yourself and your world. However, the Moon's shift into earthy Taurus demands that you make things real or set them aside. Turning your idealistic thoughts into pragmatic results requires a high level of commitment, but the cosmos is conspiring with you now to make your dreams come true."
aries,2017-05-24,"You may be marvelous at initiating action, but sometimes you're not the best at finishing what you start. Although the determined Taurus Moon encourages you to complete one task before chasing after a new one, satisfaction is elusive even when you follow through to completion. You're less interested in fulfilling your obligations than you are in giving it your best shot. Thankfully, you can cleverly combine both goals and be smiling by the end of the day."
taurus,2017-05-24,"You want to focus on concrete issues today, but it's easy to forget your original intention once a discussion becomes intense. In fact, you could even be the one who steers the dialogue from a pragmatic debate into the realms of spiritual conjecture. It's fun to explore ideas and philosophies through the give and take of communication, but don't wander so far off track that you lose the message. Take the advice of Bob Marley to heart: ""Keep it simple, keep it honest, keep it real."""
gemini,2017-05-24,"You need a day off, but not only from work. Instead, consider taking a mini staycation by temporarily severing all communication links with everyone beyond your immediate environment. But avoiding social media for a few hours is not enough; you must also turn off your phone, and all other electronic devices, if you truly want to unplug. Disconnecting from the outside world radically changes everything. This is an experiment, so observe your reactions without trying to fix anything. Greek playwright Euripides wrote, ""Silence is true wisdom's best reply."""
cancer,2017-05-24,"Talking about your plans with a close friend enables you to be seen in a deep and profound way. But your current desire to keep communication simple makes it more challenging to convey the subtleties and nuances of your professional yearnings. Nevertheless, you are committed to understanding the big picture and may even consider enrolling in a course to further your studies. Nelson Mandela said, ""Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world."""
leo,2017-05-24,"You naturally like to be seen by others, but you're weary of always having to look your best. You wouldn't mind some time off for good behavior today, but you keep getting dragged back into controversies that affect your friends and coworkers. Strive for clarity above all else because others will come to you for advice now. But don't lead anyone down a garden path if you are unsure of where it ends. Socrates wrote, ""The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing."""
virgo,2017-05-24,"You're uninterested in trivial matters and may steer clear of watercooler topics like sports, weather and celebrities. However, an intellectually stimulating dialogue attracts you like a moth to a flame. You think smart is sexy and can't wait to engage in a lively debate about the practical application of astrology, numerology or tarot. Meanwhile, your head is buried in more tedious subjects in order to keep up with your tasks at work. Practicing the art of balancing the mundane and the magical allows you to enjoy the best of both worlds."
libra,2017-05-24,"A conversation with a friend can take you in a totally unexpected direction today. In fact, you may be touched by the fickle finger of fate when someone says something that acts like a catalyst and opens a new world of possibilities. But simply going along for a ride now is not on your agenda, even if you're being carried to a magical destination. Naturally, you want to have a hand in deciding your future. The manifestation of your dreams starts from within.  Existentialist J.P. Sartre wrote, ""We are our choices."""
scorpio,2017-05-24,"Interpersonal dynamics become more complex today because it's extremely difficult to resolve a difference of spiritual beliefs or personal values. It's much easier to live with variations of favorite foods, colors and music. But this emotional dilemma doesn't necessarily indicate the end of the road; you must continue to hold one another in a place of love and respect. Basketball coach Phil Jackson said, ""Always keep an open mind and a compassionate heart."""
sagittarius,2017-05-24,"You imagine being a muse for someone whose work you admire. You want to be clever and entertaining, bringing new dimensions of fun into another person's world. However, upon deeper analysis, it becomes apparent that you long for an individual to play this very same role in your life. Thankfully, there's no reason to be stuck in a creative rut now. Although it may seem weird at first, you are perfect for the job of being your own in-house motivational coach. Reducing your dependence on others is counterbalanced when you inspire yourself with your own potential."
capricorn,2017-05-24,"A practical approach to love could open a few doors today, reconnecting you to someone who is drifting away. It's tricky when unresolved issues return from the past with such intensity that they seem to be relevant all over again. Separating the painful memory from the present moment is necessary to sustain a relationship. However, you must be brave enough to start conversations that matter. Ignoring the truth for a shot at temporary happiness is not worth the heartache that will inevitably follow. Honesty is an essential ingredient for lasting intimacy."
aquarius,2017-05-24,"You may be harboring unrealistic expectations, even if you're not conscious of your current idealism. It's much easier to form an opinion and then cling to it, no matter what. But keeping your feelings to yourself fosters separation and even alienation. If you want to grow closer to someone now, you must make a commitment to deepen your emotional connection and widen your mental horizon. Jada Pinkett Smith said, ""My belief is that communication is the best way to create strong relationships."""
pisces,2017-05-24,"You are swimming in a sea of infinite relationship possibilities, yet a constrictive energy enables you to narrow your vision and concentrate on a single goal. Nevertheless, there are a few obstacles that must be overcome if you are to successfully choose a direction and stay on that trajectory. Rather than skimming the surface, dive deep. Uncovering intense emotions that might have nothing to do with the present moment is an important step in laying the groundwork for what's ahead. Actress Ruth Gordon said, ""Courage is like a muscle; it is strengthened by use."""
aries,2017-05-25,"There are countless signs that lure you in many directions and, true to your curious nature, you want to pursue all of them. Although the light-footed Gemini New Moon dances in your 3rd House of Distractions, a solemn feeling weighs on your soul today. Instead of shooting off a snappy comeback or changing the subject by telling a joke, you're more likely to confront a complex emotional dilemma. Those close to you might be put off by your directness at first, but they will appreciate your honesty in the long run. Author Peter McWilliams wrote, ""Comfort zones are most often expanded through discomfort."""
taurus,2017-05-25,"You are feeling pressured to reassess your fiscal condition. You may uncover a financial picture that's quite different from the one you expected as the data-rich Gemini New Moon lands in your 2nd House of Resources. You might even panic when you realize the gravity of the situation, but you can quickly rebound if you make the necessary adjustments to your course. Your patience will serve you well since you won't achieve your newly clarified goals overnight. Break down your action plan into simple steps, so you can set yourself back on track with the least amount of collateral damage."
gemini,2017-05-25,"You nostalgically dream of a time when you had more stability in your life than you do these days. Although the flexible Gemini New Moon can be a serious game-changer in your 1st House of Personality, the current uncertainty could be very exhilarating. But your attempts to keep systems functioning as they did in the past is futile; the incomprehensible speed at which your life is changing might leave you a bit awestruck. Thankfully, your willingness to flow with the everchanging circumstances is your greatest talent now. If it looks like you may fall short of your goals, stop and reassess your plans so you can try again. Adaptability is your middle name."
cancer,2017-05-25,"Although you might be so scattered that you're not very productive at work today, there are many kinds of success stories. In fact, your accomplishments aren't visible to others with the Gemini New Moon occurring in your 12th House of Privacy. Luckily, your stream of consciousness reveals a new direction for you to follow. Don't resist any thoughts that enter your mind, even if they seem outrageous in the current context. Happily, there is plenty of time to weed out the irrelevant ideas while nurturing the best ones. Theodore Roosevelt said, ""Nobody cares how much you know, until they know how much you care."""
leo,2017-05-25,"It seems as if everyone wants a piece of you while the friendly Gemini New Moon stirs the energy in your 11th House of Networking. An unexpected string of events draws you out into the community even if you wish you could retreat. Nevertheless, your public life is shifting from being a distraction into the main event. You need to be in the middle of the action because social connections are the missing link that provides timely and much-needed support. Altering your perspective empowers you to see the advantages of allies who believe in you. Be the friend you wish to have."
virgo,2017-05-25,"Your ability to concentrate is being tested as you're tempted to start a new journey by taking several paths at once. Although the breezy Gemini New Moon quickly disperses your stuck energy, its presence in your 10th House of Responsibility makes this an auspicious moment to discuss your next significant project. Nevertheless, you are still constrained by time; trust your intuition and make a choice. Pick just one route with confidence, but stay flexible enough to change directions farther down the road."
libra,2017-05-25,"You can't wait to share your travel plans with others. Although it's fun to fantasize about your next adventure, you must get serious if you truly intend to turn your visions into reality. Rather than spinning wild stories based on your conjectures, start a productive dialogue. The curious Gemini New Moon sets up shop in your 9th House of Distant Horizons, inspiring you to reevaluate your long-term goals. Create a bucket list if you don't already have one. Life is short; do whatever is necessary to make your dreams come true."
scorpio,2017-05-25,"Your nervous system is naturally wired for the most intense exchanges, which is why you're attracted to extreme emotional situations. Your brute honesty is even harder for others to handle now that the interactive Gemini New Moon sends ripples of energy through your 8th House of Intimacy. Although you may be willing to talk about sensitive topics that others try to avoid, there's still plenty of room for compromise. A more laid-back approach allows you to participate in the deep and meaningful discussions that you crave without scaring off your audience."
sagittarius,2017-05-25,"Relationship dynamics are in the midst of powerful changes, prompting you to ask for what you want while the energy is still in flux. The Gemini New Moon falls in your 7th House of Partners today, continuing to agitate your personal interactions. Choosing the right words to accurately convey your message is critically important. Keep your disclosure concise and to the point. However, if you get stuck in your delivery, stop and start again from the beginning. The character, Malcolm Wallace in ""Braveheart"" said, ""Your heart is free; have the courage to follow it."""
capricorn,2017-05-25,"You might correctly assume that changing your attitude is the best way to improve your life, but breaking free from old habits can be a daunting challenge. Your obligations pull you in conflicting directions, making it tricky to hold your course. Fortunately, the versatile Gemini New Moon blasts your 6th House of Self-Improvement with positive vibrations, offering you the chance to initiate action to confirm new patterns. Luckily, the small gains you make now will grow into bigger ones over time."
aquarius,2017-05-25,"Your schedule is stretched to the max but the last thing you want to do is neglect your responsibilities. Nevertheless, the whimsical Gemini New Moon broadcasts its happy-go-lucky energy in your 5th House of Play, fueling a growing urge to kick off your shoes and have fun. You believe that you will be able to accomplish more if you are enjoying yourself rather than suffering in silence. Fortunately, the decision is totally yours; you can put your shoulder to the wheel and make yourself miserable by complaining as you work. Or, you can change the game by simply whistling a happy tune."
pisces,2017-05-25,"There's a valuable lesson to learn if you can demonstrate your vulnerability by explaining your inner process to someone you trust. Thankfully, the loquacious Gemini New Moon energizes your 4th House of Emotional Security, inspiring you to reveal your personal needs. However, there's no reason to water down your message by invoking vague generalities. Being more specific about your feelings leads to the most positive results. Opening your heart encourages others to do the same."
aries,2017-05-26,"You're no stranger to living in the present moment, but you might need to jump through a few hoops to keep up with the changes now. You're eager to enjoy the innocent spontaneity while it lasts, but easy conversations seem to be followed by more complex discussions. Although you may look back on your activities and wish you had done something different, all's well that ends well. Maintaining a positive demeanor is enough to transform a potentially unpleasant interaction into one that is beneficial for all. Winston Churchill said, ""Attitude is a little thing that makes a big difference."""
taurus,2017-05-26,"Your confidence is fueled by a small accomplishment today, encouraging you to parlay a minor achievement into a major victory. However, your greed could create a storyline that leads you into more complicated territory than you expect. Instead of turning a perfectly lovely day into a demonstration of your superiority, graciously accept the accolades for a job well done. Living in gratitude rather than expectation cultivates happiness."
gemini,2017-05-26,"You are on a roll today, enamoring your friends and coworkers with your clever wit and mind-boggling efficiency. They can't understand how you can juggle so many things at once. In fact, they might stare at you as if you were from another planet. Meanwhile, you like confounding others as you dance circles around them, knowing that you look busier than you actually are now. Unfortunately, you could be left exhausted by the end of the day without anything tangible to show for all your shenanigans. Greek storyteller Aesop wrote, ""Appearances are often deceiving."""
cancer,2017-05-26,"Everyone notices the twinkle in your eyes and the smile on your face today, but you're not giving them any facts to validate their assumptions. One reason you're keeping your thoughts to yourself is that you might not be sure why you're feeling so good. Or, perhaps you know exactly the source of your happiness; you just don't trust that it will last. Either way, it's preferable to find someone you can confide in about your inner journey. A joy that's shared is a joy made double."
leo,2017-05-26,"You may be living the good life now, yet trouble still pops up with regular frequency. Thankfully, you don't need to handle a crisis by yourself while the charming Gemini Moon is happily camped out in your 11th House of Social Networks. Although your involvement with a group makes it difficult to set out on your own, everyone is there for you in practice, not just in theory. Allow yourself to feel energetically supported by your interactions with others. Counting your blessings includes counting your friends."
virgo,2017-05-26,"You want to enjoy the fruits of your previous labors and there are ripe experiences all around you that are ready for picking. However, the world seems like a noisy place today and you're not eager to put up with all its distractions. Nevertheless, you might not be able to say no because the potential for pleasure is so enticing. It's one thing to set your values aside for a while so you can explore uncharted ground. But it's an entirely different situation if you're looking for a permanent solution to your current boredom. Make the most of your adventure but pack your common sense just in case."
libra,2017-05-26,"Your brain power is cranked up high and even if you're just sitting in contemplation, you can hear words as they fly toward you from every direction. But you're not one to wait around for something special to happen; if an opportunity doesn't come knocking early in the day, you will go out looking for one later. In the meantime, use your imagination to explore every contingency possible. Capture the power of the moment by weaving your thoughts into stories with outcomes you wish to manifest."
scorpio,2017-05-26,"Finding your center of gravity can be tricky, especially when you're being blown around on the winds of change. Avoid the temptation of becoming singularly fixated on your success now or you might find yourself fighting against one obstacle after another. Letting go of control is never easy for you, but today it's even harder. Ironically, you feel grounded again when you finally give in to your own self-restrictions. George Orwell wrote, ""Happiness can exist only in acceptance."""
sagittarius,2017-05-26,"Someone may get a little too pushy with you today and you don't appreciate it one bit. You admire others when they are direct, stating their needs or declaring their desires. But you reserve the ability to respond as you see fit, and don't like being told in no uncertain terms what you must do. Rather than overreacting with rebellious behavior that demonstrates your policy of non-compliance, consider a more civil approach. Compromise is the art of dividing a cake so that everyone thinks they got the biggest piece."
capricorn,2017-05-26,"There are so many different things to do today, you're not even sure where to jump in. Fortunately, you possess plenty of energy and you can move through several of your projects quickly. It might even seem to others that you're doing everything at once, but this is obviously just an appearance. Don't let up; your satisfaction will be sweet reward for following through on what you start. If you run into resistance later in the day, that's your sign to stop. Readdress any unfinished business after you enjoy a well-deserved rest."
aquarius,2017-05-26,"Your weekend begins early as the planets invite you to cash out of work and plug into fun. A feisty Moon-Mars combo activates your 5th House of Love and Creativity, inspiring you to channel your energy into self-indulgent pleasures rather than tying up loose ends. But if you take off too soon, karma will surface quickly, demanding that you attend to those things you left behind. Magnify your enjoyment by finishing all your chores before you play."
pisces,2017-05-26,"You don't like feeling disconnected from your intuitive powers, but you might need to get used to the lack of psychic clarity today. Fortunately, you can still find plenty of pleasure if you spend time honoring your personal needs. But you naturally have trouble setting limits and the Moon's square to nebulous Neptune makes your logic even fuzzier now. Wait until your instincts tingle with receptivity. Fortunately, your persistence pays off, leading to tangible gains later on."
aries,2017-05-27,"It doesn't matter how angry you are over a misunderstanding; your plan is to keep your feelings to yourself. However innocent the other person appears now, it still seems like there may be some shady intention behind their behavior. Although you want to set the guilty party straight today, you might not want to reveal your insecurity. Your only sensible response is forgiveness or you could overcompensate later in the day by losing your cool at the worst possible moment. Moving to higher ground provides the best view."
taurus,2017-05-27,"Although you're enchanted by a familiar fantasy, you won't likely say anything about it to anyone else. In fact, you appear unusually cautious, flying in stealth mode so others don't notice how distracted you actually are now. Ironically, you might try to cover your tracks by taking the lead in a conversation that has nothing to do with your current obsession. Fortunately, your evasive strategy works perfectly today, since your feelings will settle back down to normal soon enough. No need to stir the pot unless you want to serve soup."
gemini,2017-05-27,"You seem more contemplative today, but your silence won't last forever. It's actually your heightened sensitivity that changes the game for you now. You don't want everyone to know the depth and intensity of your emotional reactions, so you simply speak less for the sake of peace. However, you can only bite your tongue for so long and when you finally open your mouth, an unexpected torrent of words is released. Just make sure your rant portrays your inner world accurately or you might be on cleanup duty later on. Sharing your feelings as they occur prevents unnecessary drama from hijacking your day."
cancer,2017-05-27,"You are an easy target today because you're wearing your changing moods on your sleeve. There's no hiding the fact that your subjectivity can suddenly override your rationality. Objectivity ebbs and flows with your emotional tides, and there's nothing you can do to stop it now, other than choosing denial. Thankfully, those you admire the most will benefit from your unyielding support. You are a champion at nurturing the people, animals and plants that you love. Be proud of your open heart and let your love light shine."
leo,2017-05-27,"Contrary to what many astrologers say, you Lions don't always want to be strutting and roaring under the bright spotlight. Today's reflective Cancer Moon floats through your 12th House of Privacy, luring you off stage and into the shadows. Nevertheless, you still might have something important to say and you plan on delivering your message even if there's no audience. Don't just speak to make yourself feel better; examine your motives before opening your mouth. Author Florence Scovel Shinn wrote, ""Your word is your wand."""
virgo,2017-05-27,"You're exercising extreme caution today and might go the solo route because you hope to avoid an argument that's simmering in the air. However, you also want to be around your tribe of allies so you can bask in the emotional support that seems to be for yours asking. Unfortunately, you cannot pursue social isolation and emotional connection simultaneously. No matter what you choose, keep your expectations to a minimum. Unquestionably, it's better to be happily surprised than sorely disappointed."
libra,2017-05-27,"You might have an attack of Mother Hen Syndrome today; you want to take everyone under your wing and protect them from all the evil influences in the world. Although your intentions are probably nothing but well-meaning, others think you're being overly controlling. You defend your actions and your integrity by claiming you only wish the best for everyone. Everything seems pretty straightforward on the surface, but increases in complexity the more you dig in your heels. Sometimes, relinquishing control is the highest form of love, even if it doesn't seem the kindest."
scorpio,2017-05-27,"You're back in your watery element today, swimming in a familiar place that reminds you of home. But you're concerned that you're missing something important while curious Mercury connects with wounded Chiron and opportunistic Jupiter. You don't want to turn an insignificant fact into the linchpin of your latest conspiracy theory, only to see it go up in smoke. Take the time to feel every emotion, but don't act on every emotion you feel."
sagittarius,2017-05-27,"Leaving the world of action behind isn't the easiest thing for you fiery Archers. You might even decline an invitation to explore shared emotions with someone special or discuss a passion project with a friend. Nevertheless, you have your work cut out for you now, and it involves a bit of unusual research. Mental Mercury complicates matters by making you painfully aware of how your previous plan fell apart. It's not too early to bring in the metaphysical demolition team to tear down the remaining structure before beginning a massive reconstruction project."
capricorn,2017-05-27,"You might pull back from a friend or lover because you're afraid of being a victim of someone's clingy behavior. You seek definition in a personal relationship now, but it's not easy to find it when a significant other shows signs of neediness that defy logic. Unfortunately, your retreat only exacerbates the issue by raising the stakes and eliciting further fear of abandonment. Although actions speak louder than words, initiating a conversation about the energy imbalance is the first step to finding a solution that works for all. Stop moving and start talking."
aquarius,2017-05-27,"You want to be meticulous with your words because avoiding a misunderstanding today prevents headaches down the road. Nevertheless, inspiring others with images from your unrealized fantasies is an effective way to persuade them to work more closely with you. However, finding the right mix of exacting descriptions of reality and poetic representations of possibilities can be very tricky now. Paint your dreams in vivid colors but don't leave out the imperfections."
pisces,2017-05-27,"You wish you could figure out the best way to reliably improve your creativity, but the magic of those special moments eludes description no matter what technique you employ. Nevertheless, a lack of inspiration is not so much of a problem now that the Moon is dancing in your 5th House of Self-Expression. You don't even have to try; it's as if your Muse is following you around, waiting for your simple acknowledgment to start. Paradoxically, spontaneity works wonders, especially when you plan for it."
aries,2017-05-28,"Navigating through emotional territory is like driving on a mountain road without guardrails. Fortunately, you can avoid the problems associated with losing control of a situation by gradually applying the brake before there's an emergency. Unfortunately, you can't rely on others for an early warning because they might be cheering on your reckless behavior today. However, someone will step in and do the dirty work of stopping you in your tracks if you don't take responsibility in time. Zen master Ezra Bayda teaches, ""When you pay attention, everything is your teacher."""
taurus,2017-05-28,"You encounter unexpected resistance today from someone you thought was on your side. You assumed that a close friend would be your biggest supporter and you might feel disappointed when you realize you're on your own. Don't waste valuable time or energy trying to convince anyone to return to your camp. Emotional pleas or angry confrontations will not work out in your favor; instead, plan on flying solo for now. Your actions will reveal your unwavering determination; your integrity is your saving grace."
gemini,2017-05-28,"You may be more worried today than people realize, but that's because you're a bit of a magician when you want to keep others from getting too close. Unfortunately, your cleverness can backfire, preventing your best friend or lover from helping you deal with the very thing that's causing you concern. It takes courage to be honest with others when you're not living up to your own standards. Sam Keen wrote, ""We come to love not by finding a perfect person, but by learning to see an imperfect person perfectly."""
cancer,2017-05-28,"You continue to be an emotional being in a world where it's often prudent to tightly wrap your feelings up in the logic of the day. However, the drive to express your heart's desires in the safety of a stable relationship is fundamental to your wellbeing. Although you might be tempted to withdraw into your shell, growth occurs now from opening up. Self-disclosure is a rough road today because your perspective may conflict with someone else's. Instead of making happiness your current goal, strive for recognition. Amy Bloom wrote, ""Intimacy is being seen and known as the person you truly are."""
leo,2017-05-28,"Everyone might be encouraging you to take your brilliant ideas to a larger audience, but you're not sure this strategy is in your best interest. You like the idea of receiving accolades for your creativity, but you think something magical will be sacrificed in the translation during a rehearsed performance. You're not eager to tighten up your act too much now because it could lose its spark of spontaneity. Additionally, the reality won't likely live up to your grandiose expectations. Nevertheless, like Arjuna in the Bhagavad Gita, you're still ready to do your duty and play your part when you're called to the stage."
virgo,2017-05-28,"You're focused on the distant future today but might not say much about it. The Moon's current visit to your 11th House of Dreams and Wishes inspires you to create compelling sequels to your favorite fantasies. Nevertheless, you can't go overboard now without risking everything. Adopt a sustainable pace that won't provoke much resistance. Unfortunately, if you jump ahead too quickly, you'll be sent back to the beginning of the line to start over again. Slow and steady wins the race."
libra,2017-05-28,"You may be overly concerned about anyone who doesn't want to participate in your community-building project today. Instead of relaxing and going with the flow, you might choose to tighten the reins. For example, filling in the details of someone's schedule leaves little time to pursue more questionable eccentricities. Nevertheless, exerting too much control now is a tactic that will cost you later on when the tables are turned -- and you're the one who is being put back into a box of conventionality. Giving others the respect they deserve is the fastest way to earn it yourself."
scorpio,2017-05-28,"Sometimes you wish money problems would just solve themselves on their own. However, much to your chagrin, they rise and fall like ocean waves. One day your cash flow is not flowing, and on another day, prosperity is abundant in your little kingdom. Nevertheless, you might need to face the fiscal music now and restructure some part of your financial picture. You can resist the changes at first, but they will eventually carry you into the future, bringing greater stability than you expect."
sagittarius,2017-05-28,"You're the serious one in a relationship now, especially if your significant other is not quite ready to settle down. This push-pull dynamic makes it easier for you to move closer while your partner is in retreat. Nevertheless, independent Mars opposes restrictive Saturn, triggering your relationship houses. Stop trying so hard to fix what isn't broken; observe your feelings without attempting to change them. Satisfaction remains elusive for another day or two which gives you enough time to sort out the entanglements of your heart. Novelist Stephen Chbosky wrote, ""We accept the love we think we deserve."""
capricorn,2017-05-28,"Your schedule becomes even more complicated now if you have irrational requirements about certain activities that are non-negotiable. Unfortunately, you might find yourself deep in a power struggle with someone who wants you to alter your calendar so you can join them in an activity. But no one is likely to give in today, turning a minor conflict into a major one. Separating the facts from the emotions reestablishes equilibrium but it requires a commitment from everyone involved. Thankfully, where there's a will there's a way."
aquarius,2017-05-28,"You have all the right words at the tip of your tongue today, but you might hesitate to say them out loud if you think they reveal your vulnerability. You wish you could keep your conversations on a cool intellectual level, but you can't set aside your romantic inclinations now. Nevertheless, you're not necessarily feeling warm and fuzzy; instead, your need for clarity sharpens the edges between you and someone you love. Don't strive for resolution; frustration grows when you push harder. Sometimes the best thing you can do is to just let go."
pisces,2017-05-28,"Balancing family activities with commitments made to your community or church can rekindle an unresolved issue in a personal relationship today. Clear communication is essential, but bringing up the subject doesn't mean you're any closer to agreement. Unfortunately, this may be one of those conflicts that doesn't have a quick solution, so you need to know when to back down. You might not be able to discern the best point to start your retreat, but you'll surely know when it's too late. Avoid falling into a frustrating well from which there's no easy escape. Brigham Young said, ""Honest hearts produce honest actions."""
aries,2017-05-29,"It's nearly impossible to settle your energy today. No matter how busy your schedule is, you're still feeling restless. You want to be anywhere else than where you are and doing something completely different. In fact, you're annoyed that you can't just change everything with a snap of your fingers. Nevertheless, drastic action is ill-advised because you're not ready to make your move yet. Instead, reconsider your goals and set new priorities. Musician Billy Cox said, ""You can't build a long-term future on short-term thinking."""
taurus,2017-05-29,"You might need to grit your teeth and take care of business today, even if that means the possibility of pleasure becomes unlikely. Although you're often driven by very practical aspirations, you may have more esoteric concerns weighing on your soul now. Sometimes, living with integrity is about doing what's right for the greater good rather than only considering yourself. It's not easy to make a decision that leads to more work and less fun, but acting in accordance to your values reaps greater rewards over time."
gemini,2017-05-29,"Your actions are all over the map today. You are here, there and everywhere now that the radiant Sun and impulsive Mars are visiting your restless sign. But someone may play the role of a heavyweight when authoritative Saturn stands in your path. Circumstances hold your feet to the fire, requiring you to fulfill your current obligations instead of stirring up more things to do. Television writer Linda Poindexter observed, ""Life is a juggling act that sometimes requires that you drop everything."""
cancer,2017-05-29,"Responsibilities at work coax you out of hiding today. Although you might prefer to go about your business unseen by everyone else, you could be backed into a situation where you must stand up for what's right. Defending your values is not a personal battle now; you must take action to prevent an authority figure from arbitrarily imposing his or her agenda onto others. Fortunately, you won't need to confront your adversary alone if you explain your perspective to others. A problem shared is a problem halved."
leo,2017-05-29,"You may be fighting an uphill battle today as reality seems to conspire against you. The same activities that were previously enjoyable currently feel like tedious tasks, tempting you to call it quits. Although it's unwise to take a risk now, hard work and self-discipline can turn this situation around quickly. Thankfully, the Moon's shift into your courageous sign boosts your confidence, inspiring you to accomplish superhuman feats. Don't give up; it is said that it's darkest just before the dawn."
virgo,2017-05-29,"You are hopeful about getting ahead at work this week, but domestic responsibilities may distract you from your professional goals. Perhaps you're being asked to work extra hours on an important project but your time is limited because of previous family commitments. Don't try to take on everything yourself; you're not in this boat alone. Discussing your dilemma with your boss won't fix everything immediately, but it will keep the truth out in the open. Roman poet Ovid wrote, ""The burden which is well borne becomes light."""
libra,2017-05-29,"Your options seem to be more limited than you thought. In fact, you might decide to make your next round of plans through a process of elimination. Rather than choosing a path into the future and then making it happen, you could end up taking the only road ahead of you after you filter out those that will not feasibly work. But don't surrender the dreams that inspire you the most now. Even if you can't make them real yet, no one can take the magic of your visions away from you."
scorpio,2017-05-29,"Your relationships -- both business and personal -- can be so complicated now that you're not even sure where you stand on several important issues. You might read a situation one way, only to discover that the opposite is true. It's challenging to run your life efficiently when a lack of simple logistics may be enough to prevent you from reaching your goals. Fortunately, this is not your final exam. Author Jon Sinclair wrote, ""Failure is a bruise, not a tattoo."""
sagittarius,2017-05-29,"Your biggest problems now seem to reside with everyone else. Naturally, unsolicited expertise is highly problematic because you can modify your thinking, but there's no way to unilaterally shift someone else's attitude. Reality is playing a subtle but powerful trick on you, for what you see is not what you get. Although it might seem impossible, the outside is actually within you. Don't be misled by the illusion of reality; the change you want must start with you, even if you're not the one who needs to change."
capricorn,2017-05-29,"When someone or something blocks your progress, you can respond in one of two ways. Although there are many subtle nuances in between, fundamentally, you can either acquiesce or resist. Sometimes this is an existential dilemma but the need for a pragmatic solution now replaces philosophical inquiry. There may be several competing plans that lead you to the same final destination. Pick one and get started; the only time to initiate action is in the present moment."
aquarius,2017-05-29,"You might feel alienated from your peers or your friends, but overcoming this temporary gulf puts control back into your hands. The heartfelt Leo Moon shifts into your 7th House of Relationships, reminding you to step beyond your fears in order to emotionally connect with others. But don't stick to the rulebook today; it's your unorthodox thinking that enables you to express your feelings in the most authentic way. Author Suzy Kassem wrote, ""Be yourself because an original is worth more than a copy."""
pisces,2017-05-29,"You're back to juggling personal and professional obligations today, and picking one arena over the other is quite tempting. However, rather than making any sweeping decisions that could affect your life for years to come, pull back and narrow your field of vision. Luna's emphasis on your 6th House of Self-Improvement requires that you chip away at the big picture by focusing on the little pieces. Small steps over time produce long-lasting results."
aries,2017-05-30,"There is so much happening now that you're unsure of how to react. At least you're not alone as everyone else seems equally distracted by the chaotic pace. Fortunately, people are so overwhelmed that they won't even notice your behavior. You might think you can get away with a little mischief while irrepressible Uranus is zapping impulsive Mars. Nevertheless, just because you can do something doesn't mean it's a wise choice. Instead of acting irresponsibly, show the world the best version of you. The things you do when no one is watching are the things that define you."
taurus,2017-05-30,"Your logic is very sound today, but your actions don't necessarily support your conclusions. There's no question in your mind; you know exactly what's going on but you might remain quiet for the sake of keeping the peace. However, little things continue to bug you throughout the day, driving you to eventually overreact in order to reestablish equilibrium. Rather than taking the course of least resistance, begin choosing your battles right from the start. You don't need to let others push you over the edge if you deal with each little annoyance as it occurs."
gemini,2017-05-30,"You're eager to impress your friends with your solutions to their problems today. Unfortunately, your clever words and sage advice may not be as useful as you think. In fact, you could end up being a primary source of anxiety for the very same people you want to help. Fortunately, you have the power to turn your day around by choosing not to meddle in everyone else's affairs. Once you point your lens toward yourself, it quickly becomes apparent that personal growth begins at home. Author Chetan Bhagat wrote, ""Be so busy improving yourself that you have no time to criticize others."""
cancer,2017-05-30,"A recent decision of yours may be challenged today by people who don't really understand your motivation. They aren't aware that you're not limited by tradition and are willing to step outside of the norm in order to give everyone another option. But you don't expect anyone to just blindly follow you. You simply want your ideas to be heard. In fact, you'll consider your efforts worthwhile once you are given a fair hearing. Tony Robbins claims, ""The only limit to your impact is your imagination and commitment."""
leo,2017-05-30,"Your frustration builds until it reaches a crescendo today. You might express a tirade of anger, even if you can't justify your behavior logically. However, a healthy self-awareness reminds you of the importance of processing your feelings instead of being subject to them. Show your wisdom by letting the situation continue to unfold without your interference. Take a measured approach until you have formed a more complete picture. You're in control when you're fully informed. Making better choices leads to better results."
virgo,2017-05-30,"You are acutely aware of several different paths that could further your career trajectory. However, your natural analytical tools may not be useful if you want to respond to changing dynamics at work. Taking the course of least resistance is a smart move today. The most creative solutions will continue to develop over time, so don't waste energy trying to outsmart the current predicament. Be patient; act on your intuition and you can't lose."
libra,2017-05-30,"You want everyone to get along today, but last-minute changes to your schedule may throw others off track. In turn, a close friend or coworker might do something totally unexpected that catches you by surprise. Thankfully, a setback or a detour can magically morph into an exciting journey of self-discovery. Nevertheless, you could just as easily miss out on an adventure if you resist the changes. You may be pleasantly surprised with the results if you allow your previous plans to fall away. Poet Mark Strand wrote, ""Old ways won't open new doors."""
scorpio,2017-05-30,"Discontent sets in if you continue to scatter your energy today. You long for more intense interactions, but your current environment may be too fast-paced to nurture deep and meaningful communication. However, if you try to force your agenda now, the emotional connections you seek will simply appear in others as psychological resistance. Keep looking for that sweet spot between searching for satisfaction and being content with what you already have. Willie Nelson said, ""When I started counting my blessings, my whole life turned around."""
sagittarius,2017-05-30,"Your excitement is mounting quickly today as you put a few enjoyable activities on the front burner. But you might be slightly dissatisfied no matter what you pursue, since it feels like you should be doing something else. Fortunately, the fiery Leo Moon activates your 9th House of Adventure, increasing your drive to experience another adrenaline rush. Luxuriate in the natural buzz as long as it lasts. The natural rise and fall of energy indicates the chaos will begin to settle back down in a couple of days. Make merry while the merrymaking is good."
capricorn,2017-05-30,"Much to your chagrin, nothing you seem to do today calms the current emotional turbulence at work. You're better off letting go of your security blanket and riding the unpredictable waves now, instead of attempting to maintain control over your feelings. Fortunately, anxiety begins to fade as you shift priorities to concentrate on restoring your balance, rather than juggling all the variables at the same time. Peace begins within."
aquarius,2017-05-30,"Your current relationship strategy may not be obvious to people today, so they can't figure out your true intentions. But you don't see reality through the same lens as everyone else, because you won't allow your plan to get bogged down by romantic attachments or office politics. However, you can be so overzealous in working now that you miss the more important emotional component. There's a good chance you might upset someone while you're busy expressing your individuality. St. Ambrose wrote, ""No one heals themselves by wounding another."""
pisces,2017-05-30,"You're excited to step outside your well-protected bubble today. But what seems like a logical and calculated move to you, seems like a rash impulse to others. Your apparently risky behavior can take people by surprise. However, they may judge you unkindly because of your erratic actions now, possibly accusing you of acting irresponsibly or immaturely. Regardless of anyone's expectations, your moment of truth has arrived. Declare who you are and what you want without shame. You light up the world when you shine."
aries,2017-05-31,"You know what you should do today but putting your thoughts into action is not as easy as you think. Fortunately, recognition at work suggests you are on the right track, but the going is slow. It's not that you're facing resistance; rather you're being required to create the very path you're walking on. You might wish you had picked the road more traveled -- or any road -- but the satisfaction you earn now by clearing a new route is only excelled by the rewards of discovering a new destination. Harvey Firestone quipped, ""The way of the pioneer is always rough."""
taurus,2017-05-31,"You are unstoppable today because you are speaking directly from a place of power that is fueled by your heart. Powerful Pluto is harmonizing with mental Mercury in your practical sign, making it nearly impossible for anyone to dissuade you from your chosen path. Nevertheless, you become your own best critic as the day wears on. Don't ignore your good advice, even if it means changing your plans as the dynamics of the situation shift. Clint Eastwood said, ""You improvise. You adapt. You overcome."""
gemini,2017-05-31,"Much of what you do today can be construed as diversionary tactics to hide something you don't want to talk about. Nevertheless, the truth will likely find its way to the surface, especially if there's someone in your life who is willing to listen without judgment. Surprisingly, you may be relieved by how easily the conversation flows once you begin talking about your previously unresolved issue. Luckily, delving into uncharted territory could take you on a circuitous route to paradise."
cancer,2017-05-31,"Your current confidence opens doors to conversations that have been difficult to unlock until now. You don't even need to think about a strategy; just trust your intuition and speak your truth. It's not necessary to write out a script before you deliver your message. In fact, your spontaneity charges your words with a strength of conviction that others can't ignore. Your creative approach will be heralded by people who applaud your point of view. Ken Blanchard teaches, ""The key to successful leadership today is influence, not authority."""
leo,2017-05-31,"When you talk today, people listen. It's as if you have direct access to a hotline connecting you to the zeitgeist of the moment and all you need to do is repeat what they tell you to say. However, your audience is fickle and will quickly abandon you if you take unfair advantage of your current psychic superpower. Rather than trying to gain personal recognition or political advantage at work, use the cosmic support you're now receiving for the good of all. President John Quincy Adams wrote, ""If your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, you are a leader."""
virgo,2017-05-31,"You might start your day riding a wave of enthusiasm only to realize the enormity of what's ahead. Fortunately, you have the mental fortitude to accomplish more than you think. Although your creative impulses are strong now, they may divert you from the real work at hand. Avoid superficial interactions and dazzling distractions today. But remember, being busy and being productive are not the same thing. There's no time to waste; the sooner you start, the sooner you finish."
libra,2017-05-31,"You are willing to bring up a subject today that might be a conversation stopper on other days. But your jovial approach puts others completely at ease. It's as if you can turn your charm off and on at will, giving you the edge in an important negotiation. Nevertheless, you could be so confident of your message that you forget that communication is a two-way street. Make sure everyone gets a chance to share their opinions without feeling rushed. The Dalai Lama said, ""When you talk, you are only repeating what you already know. But if you listen, you may learn something new."""
scorpio,2017-05-31,"You are driven to break new ground in your personal life today by discussing a sensitive topic that could turn everything topsy-turvy. Digging into a subject that's been previously out of bounds can set the stage for a deeper and more intimate friendship. But if you're talking with an old friend or lover, revealing a vulnerability adds creative juice to the mix. It has been said that good communication is like water to a plant -- it helps relationships blossom and grow."
sagittarius,2017-05-31,"Business issues may be on your mind today, especially if you're worrying about your fiscal condition. Fortunately, the cosmos is conspiring to improve your current situation at work. However, it's up to you to decide what to do with this opportunity. Setting new production goals and reestablishing your priorities increase your cash flow. Turn your crazy money-making idea into a viable action plan. Nevertheless, improving your self-esteem might be the most important factor when looking at net worth. Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""Without a rich heart, wealth is an ugly beggar."""
capricorn,2017-05-31,"Your life has been going through a profound metamorphosis for years. It's as if you are being forced to gradually reinvent yourself right down to the core. Sometimes you feel quite isolated in the intensity of this work, but today you have a rare opportunity to talk about your emotional process with someone you trust. This is not a lighthearted discussion, but neither is it too heavy. Don't miss this chance to reveal your true self. Buddhist Sogyal Rinpoche teaches, ""The most essential thing in life is to establish an unafraid, heartfelt communication with others."""
aquarius,2017-05-31,"Your ongoing spiritual renewal goes through another transformation today, possibly as the result of a conversation or something you read. The right words go directly to the center of your soul and touch you in a way that alters you on a cellular level. Rather than seeking someone to share your experience with now, sit with it on your own. Contemplation creates a fertile mental environment for your epiphany to work its magic. Planting seeds of thought in your subconscious is an invitation for your imagination to continue the process of awakening."
pisces,2017-05-31,You are plugged into your network of friends and associates on a very deep level today. It's almost as if you are not separate from your tribe of co-conspirators. Don't bother trying to accomplish much on your own now when your higher calling is to teach others about collaboration. You realize self-awareness does not occur in a vacuum; you are part of something large and powerful. Expand your knowledge by expanding your community.
aries,2017-06-01,"You're willing to go along with someone else's idea now because you can see the wisdom in adopting a more methodical approach. Without the involvement of others, you might just rush ahead -- thinking you can make decisions on the fly. You are thankful that a coworker actually created a step-by-step plan. Although your creativity lights the spark, sometimes it really does take a village to keep the fire going. Malcolm X said, ""The future belongs to those who prepare for it today."""
taurus,2017-06-01,"You could fall in love with something as ethereal as a rainbow today. Its beauty is not in question, but the practicality of this love is non-existent. It's not wise to make any impulsive commitments now, since you're all too willing to overlook faults you might consider a deal-breaker on another day. Your key planet Venus is receiving strong support from karmic Saturn, empowering your common sense. Keep in mind that long-term satisfaction always wins over transient pleasure."
gemini,2017-06-01,"You might have thought you were close to escape velocity, only to discover reality is going to restrain you for a while longer. Only you know how much work you've already completed, but you're probably closer to your goal than you realize. Like it or not, today is all about hard work. Luckily, you can find mental satisfaction participating in mundane activities now. There's no reason to complicate your efforts by leaving tasks incomplete. Katharine Hepburn quipped, ""It's not what you start in life, it's what you finish."""
cancer,2017-06-01,"You're so hopeful that your hard work and dedication  will be rewarded with a promotion or a raise that you go the extra mile in all that you do today. Although the ambitious Venus-Saturn trine grounds your 6th House of Efficiency and your 10th House of Career, this practical aspect influences more than your current work habits. Whatever you seek in life is worth your time now. But don't get discouraged if success seems far off. When you master patience, you master everything else, too."
leo,2017-06-01,"Your heart is set on taking a long-awaited vacation. You may have chosen an exotic location that now seems out of reach. However, changing your mind is a bad idea; it's not time to admit defeat and give up on your dream. In fact, the cosmos is inviting you to improve your current plans instead of throwing them away. You are one of the lucky people that gets to attend a magical event of your own creation. A work of art was once a work in progress."
virgo,2017-06-01,"You intuitively know just what to do, but you're not adhering to any kind of schedule today. Preparation is currently a state of mind. It's not about winning now; simply remain open and show up. Others are busy figuring out their next steps, leaving you to your own devices. Demonstrate your courage, throw down your crutches, and follow your internal GPS. It's never too late to meet your destiny halfway and then change it."
libra,2017-06-01,"The tables are pleasantly turned today and it seems as if everyone is being extra nice to you. In fact, there's a hint of love in the air and there may be more going on now than what you see. If you're interested in romancing a special person, be certain to ascertain their feelings before you move too fast with your own. Nevertheless, it's really not complicated; just don't waste energy lost in self-analysis when you can share your thoughts with someone else. Rumi wrote, ""Reason is powerless in the expression of Love."""
scorpio,2017-06-01,"You might worry about something you did in the past that possibly alienated someone. Now, you have a rare chance to readdress the issue so you can heal the rift and let it go. But it's not helpful to simply stab in the dark as you tell your personal story, hoping it will straighten out any misunderstandings. Instead, take the most pragmatic path possible; people aren't interested in idealistic thinking unless it produces tangible results. A sensitive soul sees the world through the lens of love."
sagittarius,2017-06-01,"You appear as if you're emotionally reserved today, but you're actually calculating your chances for success. Your mind is focused on one particular person and you quickly brush everyone else off. You can't wait to reveal your heart because you think there is a special connection between the two of you. But deepening an involvement is a tricky process. Sprinting for the finish line prematurely signals your intentions and could even scare the other person away. Swami Vivekananda said, ""Nothing else is necessary but these: love, sincerity and patience."""
capricorn,2017-06-01,"You are among the calmest people in the world, but your appearance doesn't speak your whole truth today. Actually, your desires are powerful and you intuitively know they are still strengthening under the surface. Put your feelings on hold for three or four days until the high-strung energy has rippled on through. Although waiting for a good idea to mature makes sense in theory, it might be impossible in real life. You are free to make your choices but you are not free to choose the consequences."
aquarius,2017-06-01,"Your network of friends and coworkers might demand more from you today, and you don't like the idea of being held in check. Fortunately, you understand that their advice comes from a place of love and that it's probably good for you in the long run. Although you're still tempted to resist, change your attitude from defensive to collaborative since the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Working in harmony with your peers leads to personal success."
pisces,2017-06-01,"You want to get ahead in your profession, regardless of how much actual work is on your plate today. The good news is you can put yourself in line for a raise or a promotion, but the bad news is you can't ask for either just yet. You must dance the dance of self-discipline now, for every one of your actions carries extra weight. Buddhist teacher Sakyong Mipham wrote, ""Like gravity, karma is so basic we don't even notice it."""
aries,2017-06-02,"Everything feels unstable today and you can't decide whether to cling to the past or jump into the future. You are appreciative of those who helped you along the way and brought you to the present moment. But they may be holding you back now and you are confused about where your loyalties lie. Continue to maintain your balance as you weigh your options. Your path will become clear sooner than you think, so be ready for adventure either way. When life hands you lemons, make lemonade."
taurus,2017-06-02,"You might appear cool and collected, but beneath your calm veneer lurks a touch of pandemonium. However, initiating your favorite avoidance sequences won't save the day, since disruptive desires will only continue to build until they are addressed. You like the idea of engaging the uncertainty, but actually destabilizing your life is not fun. Poet Christopher Poindexter wrote, ""The thing about chaos, is that while it disturbs us, it too, forces our hearts to roar in a way we secretly find magnificent."""
gemini,2017-06-02,"Mischief-making is your top priority today, but you can't start the merriment until your chores are completed. Sometimes you can fast-talk your way out of finishing an unpleasant task, but now you won't be free until you answer Saturn's authoritative call. Thankfully, turning your work into a game allows you to please both the cosmic taskmaster and your inner child. Embrace frivolity without abandoning responsibility."
cancer,2017-06-02,"You can think of plenty of reasons why you shouldn't take any chances today. However, upon further analysis your arguments break down one at a time, especially when you consider all the facts. It turns out that remembering a painful experience is warping your current logic. If you start out in a fearful place, you are likely to wind up with a negative outcome. Fortunately, you have an opportunity to overcome a self-imposed limitation by acknowledging when your worries are not based on the current situation. Jim Rohn wrote, ""If you are not willing to risk the unusual, you will have to settle for the ordinary."""
leo,2017-06-02,"It is increasingly difficult to maintain your composure today, but you're willing to give it your best shot. You may be pleased with your current plans for an upcoming adventure because you have turned the impossible into something very realistic. But you're worried that you eliminated the best parts in your quest for practicality. Consider all your options now, even if you thought your decision-making process was over. You can always add some excitement back into your itinerary without jeopardizing the whole program. Oprah Winfrey said, ""The thrill is to keep envisioning what can be."""
virgo,2017-06-02,"You usually excel at discerning your subjective desires from objective reality, but you're likely to flounder today. The analytical Virgo Moon predisposes you to sort facts from fiction, like the maiden separates the useful wheat from the unusable chafe. Unfortunately, you're simultaneously drawn toward the excitement of stretching beyond your normal limits. You can step through all the rational justifications, but ultimately, you're likely to act on your feelings now rather than your thoughts. The cost of not following your heart is spending the rest of your life wishing you had."
libra,2017-06-02,"You don't know how to respond when people don't play by the rules or make up new ones on the fly. You want everyone to be happy, but someone close to you could be driving you crazy now with his or her unconventional antics. You might not even mind their choices; you just don't like the element of surprise. Unfortunately, there's nothing to be done today, since trying to exert influence will backfire on you. Thankfully, you'll have fewer disappointments once you learn to accept rather than expect. Control what you can, not what you can't."
scorpio,2017-06-02,"It doesn't matter how many times you run through the logistics today, you're still left with a pile of questions. Part of you longs for another shot at stabilizing your life by making a safe choice. But another part of you screams no, frightened with the prospects of being stuck in a comfortable yet stifling environment. You are at a fork in the road and the path less traveled is strewn with uncertainty. Nevertheless, in your gut you know what to do. Claim your destiny and don't look back."
sagittarius,2017-06-02,"You know something big is coming up over the horizon and you can feel the excitement in your bones. But you don't want to be distracted from achieving your long-term goals while ambitious Saturn is still visiting your sign. Nevertheless, you're eager to break the bonds of responsibility that prevent you from making your move. It's a dance between impulsive and compulsive behavior now, with you vacillating between these two modalities. Forget about making a final decision today. Simply play the waiting game and keep in rhythm until the music stops."
capricorn,2017-06-02,"Adhering to the rules offers you a sense of safety, allowing you to take risks within the defined limits. However, you are beginning to think that the current circumstances may be so restrictive that you're unable to do your best work. It's unlikely this issue will turn into a major crisis, but it won't disappear until you face it head on. Running away from any problem only increases the distance from the solution. The easiest way to escape from the problem is to solve it."
aquarius,2017-06-02,"You put a fair amount of effort into stabilizing your social network of friends, relatives and coworkers, but the rigidity of your calendar feels stifling now. You love the idea of shaking up your schedule but you don't want to jeopardize your solid connections with your peers. Fulfilling your desires is tantalizing today, but there are consequences to your actions that impact others. A few false starts might be frustrating, especially if you need to backpedal because you hurt someone's feelings with your quest for independence. Thinking with your heart is the key to your happiness."
pisces,2017-06-02,"Accomplishing your career goals is admirable, but it might leave you feeling like there is something more to life. Success in the outer world brings the recognition you seek and the money you need to survive. However, your current restlessness may have you questioning your choices and wondering if you could get by with less. But the goal is not minimalism; it's happiness. Consider what your heart wants instead of accepting the social norms,  and then navigate your way to personal fulfillment."
aries,2017-06-03,"You're fascinated by one thing after another today, enjoying the multitude of experiences that are both real and imagined. Although you might wish for more stability at times, it's the next thrilling possibility that keeps you in motion. Whether or not you can actually reach the stars, you won't allow yourself to be limited by reality. Embrace the magic of the future, however uncertain it may seem. It's better to try and fail than to live a life of regret."
taurus,2017-06-03,"You can't take the easy way out today by begrudgingly accepting your current situation. You long for someone or something you can't have or shouldn't covet. Rather than wasting your most creative ideas because you're lost in fantasies, talk about your desires with a trusted coworker or friend. It's not an all-or-nothing proposition; scaling back your expectations does not indicate impending defeat. In fact, incorporating a more pragmatic view opens the door to unexpected opportunities previously unconsidered. Developing a practical plan brings you the success you seek."
gemini,2017-06-03,"Enjoying the benefits of strong friendships seems like a dream come true today, but following through with your plans isn't as simple as it sounds. Someone close to you may encourage you to run with your vision of the future. However, it's not a smart idea to act on another person's advice now. Letting your own thoughts guide you makes more sense. Nevertheless, remain open to changing your direction mid-stream if it comes from your heart. An unexpected turn of events might be the perfect catalyst as long as you maintain integrity between your inner and outer worlds."
cancer,2017-06-03,"Wearing a smile is your secret weapon today, especially if you are obsessed with your current worries. Nevertheless, displaying your joyful personality does not give you free license to ignore the most pressing issues of the day. Staying consciously aware of a currently irresolvable dilemma is a necessity. You are playing parts in two different scripts now so don't try to fit everything you say and do into one tidy package. The stress will eventually settle down, enabling your temporary happy face to turn into a permanent grin. Sometimes faking it actually leads to making it."
leo,2017-06-03,"You feel released from meeting your responsibilities today, perhaps because you already contributed your best effort. You're eager to zoom off into the future as you anticipate some well-earned indulgent behavior. Unfortunately, you can't chase all your fantasies because there are always other people's feelings to consider. Thankfully, there's no need to take a black or white approach. There are many shades of grays in between that offer you plenty of options. Oprah Winfrey said, ""The more you praise and celebrate your life, the more there is in life to celebrate."""
virgo,2017-06-03,"You can't just ignore your natural inclination towards practical behavior, but you're secretly longing to stir up a little mischief today. Thankfully, there's no reason your chores need to interfere with your playtime. Nevertheless, you could run into a problem if someone throws you a curve ball by inviting you to a special event. Your responsible side leans toward saying no because you don't want to commit so much of your time. Nevertheless, listen to the cosmos if it's instructing you to say yes and take a chance. Adventure starts where plans end."
libra,2017-06-03,"A friend or relative could shock you today by casually telling you what they want without censoring their message. Thankfully, you're likely to enjoy whatever you hear, even if the words are totally unexpected. You may be required to step outside your comfort zone, but you don't need to accept the invitation until you are ready. Take time to consider the pros and cons of each possible experience. Start with a conversation rather than reacting on impulse. A calculated risk is a smart risk."
scorpio,2017-06-03,"Your restlessness grows today and you may become agitated if you must carry out your obligations in the same old familiar way. Unfortunately, you can't escape from your current routine as fast as you wish. Although, talking about your desires makes sense, your words can be like sharp hooks. Your suppressed feelings will find a way out even if you try to keep a lid on them. Your penetrating wit is more biting than you think, especially if you don't give your audience a fair chance to offer their opinion. Nevertheless, don't dilute your best ideas; express your truth with kindness."
sagittarius,2017-06-03,"Your romantic life is on the launch pad and you're eagerly anticipating the wonderful journey ahead. Although your physical safety is not in jeopardy, you might not even care now if it is. You've weighed all the options and your desire to fly into space or fall in love is greater than any perceived risks. Fortunately, your trip will be more than worth it. The current excitement and your subsequent experience offset any lingering fear. Paulo Coelho wrote, ""If you think adventure is dangerous, try routine; it's lethal."""
capricorn,2017-06-03,"Your personal world is anything but boring now. However, your current lack of stability could lead to an abundance of tension. Paradoxically, the regularity of your life does remove some of the pressure by offering the daily consistency you crave. But it's foolhardy to let your career aspirations keep you from handling domestic stress. Confront your own uncertainty by initiating an honest dialogue with someone close to you. Solutions may not happen immediately, yet everyone feels better once the conversation is rolling in the right direction."
aquarius,2017-06-03,"You're on a metaphysical joyride today and your thoughts are soaring to new heights. But experiencing an adrenaline rush is a solo act and it's unnecessary for anyone else to be on board. You are captivated by the most unconventional ideas, and you're highly passionate about everything that's slightly off the beaten path. Don't let your attraction to radical thoughts and unusual behavior sidetrack your productivity now. Being responsible won't stop you from manifesting your dreams. Set the bar high; then exceed it."
pisces,2017-06-03,"Although you don't want to change direction, you need to pursue something that's on the edge of your awareness -- even if you're afraid of a fall. But your rebellious behavior could fill you with surprising pleasure, especially if you choose to demonstrate your originality. In fact, your confidence grows if you can integrate your innovative ideas with your actions. Experiment and express your creativity in radical ways. Fortune favors the bold."
aries,2017-06-04,"There are plenty of responsibilities on your plate, but you are hoping for a chance to catch up on rest and relaxation today. You could be quite cagey when choosing which of your preferences you actually share. Your key planet Mars shifts into nurturing Cancer, sensitizing you to the feelings of others. You may eventually say whatever you want anyway, but people might not understand your message. You can minimize confusion by expressing yourself in the nicest way possible now. A spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down."
taurus,2017-06-04,"A friend might not be totally forthright with you today, but it's not advisable to push too hard when seeking the truth. Underlying tensions are at play now and letting them surface on their own timing works out better than trying to force the issue. Nevertheless, be ready to bring the subject up for discussion if you're presented with an opportunity. Don't clam up before you even start. Being fully present without any attachment to your agenda strengthens the bond between you and someone you admire. Be tenacious about your goals and flexible about your methods."
gemini,2017-06-04,"Although everything may seem quieter today as the flow of events slows down, your brain is as busy as ever. You might feel as if others aren't being fully truthful and you're worried about the drama that could develop over the days ahead. But rather than wasting your finite energy by slipping into an anxious state, concentrate your thoughts on spreading love and kindness in every moment of the day. Marianne Williamson reminds us, ""Love is what we were born with. Fear is what we learned here."""
cancer,2017-06-04,"Your emotional reactions can be so overwhelming that you resist sharing your desires, scared that your intensity will alienate those you love. Unfortunately, your inaction only leads to a different set of problems as warrior Mars enters your sign today, intensifying your feelings. But the truth is there's no need to pretend that all is well. Try letting a trusted friend know what's been troubling you. Nevertheless, be careful not to blame anyone else for your current worries. First Lady Rosalynn Carter said, ""Once you accept the fact that you're not perfect, then you develop some confidence."""
leo,2017-06-04,"You're vested in satisfying your emotional needs today, yet unable to confess what you want. People typically expect you to be honest; their current concerns could mean trouble now, especially if they can sense you're hiding something. Unfortunately, this might lead to an endless cycle of pointed accusations and defensive denials. A solution slips out of sight while a wasted opportunity leaves everyone frustrated. Remember your astrological heritage: you are a proud Lion, so be bold and admit your feelings. Telling the truth isn't easy now, but it clears the air better than any other strategy."
virgo,2017-06-04,"You simply can't figure out how to spend your time today, even if you're energized and in the zone. The bottom line is you don't feel your relationships are in balance now. Although your intentions are good, you can mislead yourself if you don't stop to clarify your goals. Naturally, you want to do the right thing, but all the choices seem overly complicated. Your actions will likely be misinterpreted if you act impulsively now. Thankfully, this is a transient condition, so consider taking a few steps back until your confusion passes. Actor Ranjeet said, ""Sometimes the heart knows things the mind could never explain."""
libra,2017-06-04,"You may be thinking about redirecting your energy to take care of your own needs, instead of looking out for everyone else. Luckily, self-starter Mars enters your 10th House of Social Status today, amplifying your inclination to weigh all your options before choosing which professional path to follow. Your entire life is on the cosmic scales now and everything is up for recalibration. Surprisingly, there is more time than you think, so don't make any rash decisions now. Vincent Van Gogh wrote, ""Great things are not done by impulse, but by a series of small things brought together."""
scorpio,2017-06-04,"Unfortunately, there might not be anywhere safe to unload your deepest concerns today, and sharing them with someone isn't your smartest option. You could be dancing back and forth now that fantasy-prone Neptune is squaring the changeable Gemini Sun. If your long-term goals clash with more immediate demands on your time, you may choose to delay your decision. There are no quick fixes available to you yet; you need to ride this one out. Maya Angelou wrote, ""If you don't like something, change it. If you can't change it, then change your attitude."""
sagittarius,2017-06-04,"Looking off into the distance is often easier for you farsighted Sagittarians than seeing something that's right in front of your nose. However, you might not get very far in your vision-questing while delusional Neptune squares the Sun in your 7th House of Partners. It's inadvisable to head out today without the company of a fellow traveler. Collaborating with a like-minded friend changes the energy now. Deepen your understanding by engaging in meaningful communication. Your presence in the present moment averts a developing power struggle in the future."
capricorn,2017-06-04,"People in your life can be a pain in the neck now, especially if they take a passive-aggressive stand in their dealings with you. Argumentative Mars enters caregiving Cancer, magnifying your emotional sensitivity. You may think that everyone is worrying too much about trivial matters, but you hesitate to speak your truth because you don't want to upset the applecart. Walking on eggshells won't help because you'll break some no matter what you do. Nevertheless, avoiding confrontation as much as possible buys you peace of mind."
aquarius,2017-06-04,"Your recent optimism has faded but don't worry, it will return in full force soon enough. However, you have some serious work to do in the meantime. Reduce the pressure by temporarily setting aside your hopes for the future. Bring your attention back to the present moment and focus on today's activities. Once you organize the details and set your life back in order, you will be free to reconnect with your dreams. Antoine de Saint-Exup'ry wrote, ""A goal without a plan is just a wish."""
pisces,2017-06-04,"Your attempts at being practical today fall short of your expectations. You're easily distracted by fantasies pulling you one way and then another. You might even believe someone is trying to sway your loyalties, even if your heart is telling you something different. Thankfully, you can sense that you're missing important facts now and you're willing to wait until you know more. Do whatever is necessary to satisfy the demands of those around you as long as it doesn't conflict with the messages you're receiving from within. Rumi wrote, ""There is a voice that doesn't use words. Listen."""
aries,2017-06-05,"Instead of listening to what others are saying now, you already have your opinions formed. It's as if you don't want any additional information because you believe your conclusions are based on concrete facts. However, it's not helpful to close yourself off from additional data as the circumstances change. If you're involved in any sort of collaboration, it's wise to adjust to those around you when it makes sense. Poet Ryunosuke Satoro wrote, ""Individually, we are one drop. Together, we are an ocean."""
taurus,2017-06-05,"You might not be able to share your wishes with anyone today, but you're unwilling to let them go. Fortunately, your patience enables you to hold onto your desires because you know the right time to speak will come -- and you will be ready. Don't get distracted by your annoyance with someone standing in your way. Instead, keep your mind's eye singularly focused on your goal. Deepak Chopra wrote, ""You must find the place inside yourself where nothing is impossible."""
gemini,2017-06-05,"Your coworkers might underestimate your ability to follow through on your promises today. Although you excel at multitasking, your concentration is unshakeable now. Once you set your mind to reaching a goal, you're not going to quit just because you run into resistance. Stand tall and show others what you can do. Coach Vince Lombardi said, ""Most people fail, not because of lack of desire, but because of lack of commitment."""
cancer,2017-06-05,"If you would like someone to be more forthcoming with their feelings, there's no reason to wait for the right moment to initiate action. Impetuous Mars in your sign is harmonizing with the magnetic Scorpio Moon in your 5th House of Self-Expression, prompting you to ask for what you want. However, this is not a golden ticket that gains you entry to everyone's heart, so use your cosmic assistance with care. He or she who does not venture has no luck."
leo,2017-06-05,"You may be holding your feelings close to your chest, as if you're unsure how others will react to your growing intensity. However, there are multiple levels of reality at play now. Although talking about your emotions might make people close to you upset at first, the long-term outcome will likely be beneficial to all involved. Don't avoid a conversation just because you're uneasy about ruffling someone's feathers. If you want to change, you must be willing to be uncomfortable."
virgo,2017-06-05,"You don't want anyone interfering with your agenda today, especially if you already packed too much into your day. Changing one little thing could cascade into a significant reshuffling of your entire schedule. Nevertheless, the more you try to maintain control over all the variables, the more likely your house of cards will tumble. Practice being flexible; what falls apart will come back together much quicker than you think. A healthy sense of humor saves the day."
libra,2017-06-05,"You can't tell if you're reading someone's behavior correctly today and you don't want to embarrass yourself by jumping to a wrong conclusion. You prefer to believe that your optimism is based on what you're seeing and hearing, but there's enough ambiguity now to make you question your judgment. To complicate matters, you could overcompensate and assume the worst. Both extremes are probably deviations from reality. Continue to observe those around you while sticking as close to the middle of the road as you can. Clint Eastwood said, ""The less secure a man is, the more likely he is to have extreme prejudice."""
scorpio,2017-06-05,"You are an enigma to others today because you're keeping your intense emotions to yourself. It's easier to manage your unexpressed passions now than having to deal with someone's judgmental reaction. Ironically, your friends might not be as critical as you think, so don't write off their support before you give them a chance. Author Michelle Hodkin wrote, ""If you expect the worst from people, that's exactly what you'll get."""
sagittarius,2017-06-05,"People seem to be dancing in and out of your life now. Normally, you thrive as a social animal, but today you might prefer hiding away from the crowd.

Greek playwright Euripides wrote, ""Friends show their love in times of trouble, not in happiness."""
capricorn,2017-06-05,"Ironically, your playful attitude can help you gain respect at work today. In fact, you're more serious about making a positive impact on others than anyone expects.

Media consultant Phil Cooke said, ""The most creative approach is often the simple approach."""
aquarius,2017-06-05,"Accomplishing your goals is more important than anything else today. Fortunately, you have an intuitive understanding of how your feelings influence other people's reactions to your work. It's as if you can improve your chances of being recognized by altering your attitude rather than how much you do. But don't let your performance slip just because you think you could get by with doing less. Coach Jimmy Johnson said, ""The difference between ordinary and extraordinary is that little extra."""
pisces,2017-06-05,"You have your heart set on a distant goal and no matter what happens today, your concentration doesn't slip. Nevertheless, your current ability to stay focused requires your commitment and discipline. If your attention wanders, just bring it back to your target and recalibrate your trajectory. A true aim, coupled with hard work, all but ensures a successful arrival at your destination in a timely manner. Bruce Springsteen said, ""When it comes to luck, you make your own."""
aries,2017-06-06,"The wilder your ride has been recently, the more you're ready for the energy to settle down. Relationships may no longer be as thrilling as you like now that romantic Venus has left your sign for the bucolic pastures of Taurus. Nevertheless, you are looking forward to building solid foundations. Make the most of the next few weeks by stabilizing your resources and eliminating the unnecessary noise in your life. Zig Ziglar said, ""Worrying doesn't take away tomorrow's troubles; it takes away today's peace."""
taurus,2017-06-06,"You can hear the sweet sounds of pleasure knocking at your door. Fortunately, enriching Venus dances into your sign today, offering you material and emotional abundance over the next few weeks. However, a potential downside to this cosmic good luck is the irrepressible temptation to overindulge in all types of sensory delights. There's nothing wrong with enjoying yourself as long as you remember your limits. Gary Zukav wrote, ""Practice moderation in all things except love."""
gemini,2017-06-06,"Subconscious forces are driving your actions now, complicating relationship dynamics. Exploring your imagination helps you get in touch with repressed issues, inspiring you to engage in enlightening  conversations with those you love.

Doing anything that reconnects your actions with your heart is good for your soul. Rumi wrote, ""As you live deeper in the heart, the mirror gets cleaner and cleaner."""

Your professional life could be taking off, but you might be required to commit more time to your work than you prefer. Nevertheless, you're willing to bite the bullet and do what's expected of you in order to take advantage of the current momentum. Attending to your personal needs prevents jeopardizing your home life. Discuss the spectrum of the possible consequences of your choices with someone you trust before making any final decisions."
virgo,2017-06-06,"Your travel and adventure fantasies seem so real today that you may have to pinch yourself to see if you're still at work. Your restless spirit propels you to initiate new activities to widen your current perspective.

Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote, ""A single dream is more powerful than a thousand realities."""
libra,2017-06-06,"Downsizing might not come easily now, but the advantages are readily apparent. Your key planet Venus sashays through pragmatic Taurus over the next few weeks, prompting you to get back to basics.

Unfortunately, there isn't a simple way out of a complex situation now, even if you receive assistance from the presence of resourceful Venus in your 7th House of Relationships. You might even decide to take on unnecessary emotional entanglements just to stretch the envelope and experience the fullest possible impact from an intimate encounter. Explore the joys without complicating the dynamics."
sagittarius,2017-06-06,"Dreaming about an escape from your obligations is challenging if your actions directly affect others. You may become frustrated in the days ahead as the details of these differences begin to clash. You prefer to explore new places and establish new routines, but current circumstances prevent you from making a sudden move. Self-inflicted criticism serves no purpose now, since there will be more chances to pursue excitement soon enough.

You finally see the light at the end of the tunnel and are eager to enjoy life's little pleasures more now that Venus is camping out in your 5th House of Fun and Games.

Nevertheless, you do have an ambitious agenda, but it doesn't necessarily involve fulfilling your responsibilities. Work less; dream more."
aquarius,2017-06-06,"Staying home to enjoy some peace and quiet might sound like a wonderful idea today, especially if there's a creative project you want to take to the next level. Unfortunately, manifesting the alone time you need may be nearly impossible now because so many demands for your participation deplete your energy.

Samuel Johnson wrote, ""Great works are performed not by strength but by perseverance."""
pisces,2017-06-06,"There's no need to spin long-winded yarns or share complicated fantasies now. The simplest pleasures are readily available, especially if you can talk about what you want with those closest to you.

You might be pleasantly surprised with how quickly your wishes are fulfilled. William Shakespeare wrote, ""Joy delights in joy."""
aries,2017-06-07,"You are raring to go the distance, even if you are burning the candle at both ends now. Pushing yourself to extremes is nothing new for you adrenaline-happy Aries, and cerebral Mercury's shift into your 3rd House of Communication only fans your intellectual fires.

You will have more to show for your efforts if you reassess your commitments and finish one task before beginning another. Author Jim George wrote, ""It's not how you start that's important; it's how you finish."""
taurus,2017-06-07,"You are an expert at patiently waiting for the right moment to initiate action. Although it's not necessarily convenient today, you're compelled to express your position in an unresolved disagreement. Nevertheless, it's still challenging to begin a conversation about a sensitive topic. The truth is your friends will quickly lose interest if your delivery wanders aimlessly. Keep your message short and sweet. Let everyone know you're not seeking an immediate answer; you just need your perspective to be heard and appreciated.  Author Jeff Hood wrote, ""Distance doesn't separate people; silence does."""
gemini,2017-06-07,"There may be so many options in front of you today that you don't want to pick just one. Nevertheless, you're driven to make a choice and begin a new project while insistent Mercury is visiting your sign. Reassess your work habits to uncover the ones that have served their purpose, and then imagine how their replacements will improve your efficiency. Concentrating on your immediate needs instead of making long-term plans can profoundly impact your trajectory. Don't let your fears and expectations of the future steal the thunder of the present moment."
cancer,2017-06-07,"Your thoughts are running around in a multitude of directions today and you could exhaust yourself chasing each and every one of them. However, messenger Mercury's move into your 12th House of Privacy obscures your true motives. You are quite self-contained and even people close to you won't likely realize the intensity of your unsettled emotions. There's nothing wrong with keeping your visions to yourself as long as you remember to stay conscious of them. Scott Ringenbach wrote, ""Imagination is the reality of the dreamer."""
leo,2017-06-07,"A close friend or relative could burden you with unspoken demands today and you don't know how to respond. You may think you're clever enough to tap dance around the uncertainty, but you quickly conclude that logic won't help you regain control of the situation. You might try to second-guess the motives of others, but this analytical strategy only leads to frustration. Practicing emotional detachment alleviates the current pressure. Rather than attempting the impossible task of pleasing everyone, initiate an honest dialogue if you want to know the truth. Transparency is a show of strength."
virgo,2017-06-07,"You're not sure how to best establish new objectives at work today because you are being inspired to head in multiple directions at once. Furthermore, discerning the useful information from everything you learn is challenging while your key planet Mercury travels through noisy Gemini and your 10th House of Career. Assessing all your options is a daunting task if you think you must make a long-term decision right away. Luckily, you have plenty of time to figure out your next move. A Polish proverb cautions, ""When a man is in a hurry, the devil is happy."""
libra,2017-06-07,"There is an extra bounce to your step now, as a wave of levity washes over your body.

Naturally, digging into the mysteries is a significant theme for you passionate Scorpios. Fortunately, exploring the shadows from a more lighthearted and logical point of view now produces positive results."
sagittarius,2017-06-07,"Almost any little encounter has the potential of pulling you off course today. Interactive Mercury is dancing through your 7th House of Others, shifting the emphasis to how you respond in a relationship, rather than what you initiate on your own. Taking the lead is not advised now unless you're looking to make your life more complicated. Luckily, you can have more fun if you're willing to step out of the spotlight for a while and play a supporting role instead. The brightest stars are those who shine for the benefit of others."
capricorn,2017-06-07,"You don't want to be so serious today, even if there are heavy responsibilities weighing on your shoulders. Whimsical Mercury is soaring through flighty Gemini, scattering your thoughts to the wind as quickly as you refocus on practical matters.

pisces,2017-06-07,"You might dream about staying home today, even if you know you're needed at work. Your associates could quickly assume that your current desire for escape is a sign that something is out of balance, but they are likely barking up the wrong tree. Making time to manage personal matters allows you to attune to analytical Mercury as it moves through your 4th House of Roots. Don't worry about what others think; your inner security counts more than anything else now. Safety first when it comes to your heart."

However, something is shifting now and you want to react to an entirely new situation based on the old dynamics. One of the hardest things to do is to wait for all the circumstances to line up in your favor, inviting you to start the show.

Nelson Mandela said, ""May your choices reflect your hopes, not your fears."""
taurus,2017-06-08,"Setting your priorities can be tricky business today because you're unwilling to make plans until you get a nagging feeling off your chest.

If you have something controversial to say, choose your words carefully so you don't stir up unnecessary conflict. Theodore Roosevelt said, ""Speak softly and carry a big stick; you will go far."""
gemini,2017-06-08,"You can make your message sound as casual as possible, but others are still going to listen between the words in an attempt to uncover your true intentions. Nevertheless, you don't want to err on the side of endless rambling because you will surely lose your audience before you finish making your point. Consciously conserving your energy in all conversations ensures you will be ready for the spotlight in a day or two. Talk less; say more."
cancer,2017-06-08,"You can feel your own resistance build as you think about putting a temporary halt to the never-ending bickering. Although it might seem as if confronting someone's overactive persuasion techniques isn't worth the effort, fighting for respect is a noble cause. Don't give up your power in unnecessary ways. However, consider all your options before declaring war on an adversary. Your best verbal sparring is done now if you pick your battles with care."

Although you have so much work on your plate, you're tempted to walk away from it all to join the party. You're unwilling to cut back on your indulgences unless you have no other choice. Fortunately, you always have other alternatives. Postponing your commitments isn't a problem today as long as you give advance notice. Katharine Hepburn said, ""If you obey all the rules, you miss all the fun."""
virgo,2017-06-08,"You aren't pleased when your energy is so scattered because you have little to show for all your work.

Actor Dave Willis wrote, ""Secrecy is the enemy of intimacy. Every healthy relationship is built on a foundation of honesty and trust."""
libra,2017-06-08,"You're promoting a specific agenda at work today and you're not interested in running your plan by anyone else. Although it's reassuring to gain the approval of others, you just want the satisfaction of knowing that you made your choices on your own now. Potent Pluto's connection to strategic Mercury in your 9th House of Distant Horizons nudges you along on your personal evolution. Nevertheless, the most sensible path could be revealed if you are receptive to constructive advice. An open mind is a powerful mind."
scorpio,2017-06-08,"You may be at the center of a minor storm today as the emotional weather intensifies, triggering an early warning system between you and a close friend. Ironically, you're convinced that the most positive response is the only one you can make without raining on someone's parade. Without constant monitoring of your behavior, you believe you'll set a sequence of events into motion that ends with conflict. Luckily, you possess the power to steer the ship of free will away from the trajectory of fate. Keep calm and carry on."
sagittarius,2017-06-08,"Your feelings are all over the map now and you're unable to stuff them back into an appropriate box. The moody Moon is visiting your optimistic sign, but it appears that unavoidable trouble is on the path directly ahead of you.

You won't change someone's mind with logic today; you must appeal to their heart through the emotions of desire. Martin Luther King Jr. said, ""Love is the only force capable of turning an enemy into a friend."""
capricorn,2017-06-08,"An overly talkative coworker can turn out to be the fly in your ointment today. Chatty Mercury in your 6th House of Employment is driven by paranoid Pluto to explore every alternative, including a few conspiracy theories along the way. However, all the chatter simply might be a ploy to cover up an emotional dynamic that needs resolution. Instead of being distracted by all the gossip now, sink beneath the words and into the deeper realm of feelings. Stephen Covey said, ""The biggest communication problem is that we don't listen to understand. We listen to reply."""
aquarius,2017-06-08,"You're beginning to see that your plans for the future still need some serious tweaking. And even if they are in good shape, there are plenty of details to be ironed out along the way. You might want all the loose ends tied up, but you will only grow frustrated if you think you can outsmart the cosmos today. Don't be afraid of visualizing the future, but avoid obsessing over one final outcome. The more possibilities you entertain now, the more alive you will feel over the days ahead. Don't set limits on your unlimited potential."
pisces,2017-06-08,"You would like to project your umbrella of compassion and protection over everyone at work today.

The Sagittarius Full Moon magnifies your 9th House of Big Ideas, but current circumstances make it tricky to hold onto your ideals.

The Sagittarius Full Moon falls in your 8th House of Intimacy, inspiring you to seek out sensual delights without worrying about how others perceive you.

gemini,2017-06-09,"You're fascinated by a plethora of interests and you love to jump from one clever thought to another. But the expansive Sagittarius Full Moon illuminates your 7th House of Relationships, amplifying the emotions of those people closest to you. But you still might resist the flow of feelings or even question your desirability when it comes to intimacy. Stop looking for more data and start acting on what you already know to be true. Having a soft heart in a cruel world is courage, not weakness."
cancer,2017-06-09,"You often leave your strongest desires unspoken without even telling your secrets to those you love and trust. Unfortunately, this cautious strategy reduces the likelihood of being fully satisfied in a relationship. Much to your chagrin, your belief that people should just intuitively know what you need isn't based on reality.

The Sagittarius Full Moon energizes your 3rd House of Communication, empowering you to express what you want from others.

Approaching the future with confidence helps you overcome minor obstacles along the way. Never stop pursuing what makes you feel most alive."
gemini,2017-06-10,"You might not fit the light and breezy archetype of Gemini today. You may still engage in a bit of casual banter and flirtation, but you quickly grow bored of it. You want to put some meat on the bones of your conversations and could introduce sensitive subjects to the discussion just to stir the pot. However, the energy quickly escalates if an argument ensures. Thankfully, a conflict won't likely last if common ground can be found.

The calculating Capricorn Moon in your 5th House of Spontaneity doesn't want you to leave any variables to chance. You believe you can control all the possible ways in which your day might fall apart. However, micromanaging your life never works the way you think it will.

Although you're often the one who champions spontaneity, now you prefer to put everything in order before you start a new project. However, keeping your actions consistent with your intentions can be an uphill battle today, especially if someone shows up with an intriguing opportunity. Your head says no but your words say yes. Think twice; regret less."
taurus,2017-06-11,"Keeping your mind focused on the present moment is challenging because there are so many possibilities luring you into the future. Unfortunately, you might not be able to draw a line between concrete plans and sweet fantasies while your key planet Venus secretly cavorts with dreamy Neptune. What seems like an intriguing thought at first could turn into an obsession. Pay attention to your emotions, but what you feel is less important than the intensity of your desires. The stronger the passion, the smarter it is to back away from it for a while. Distance cultivates a healthy perspective."
gemini,2017-06-11,"You may be resisting the demands being placed on you by others today, even if you agree with what they want. You hope to slide by without being on anyone's radar screen simply because you don't like your every move being watched. You prefer being free enough to make choices in the moment based upon your current likes and dislikes. Although your ideal day sounds like an unrealistic pipe dream, you just might be able to pull it off now. Fly low in stealth mode and continue to live your life as you see it in your dreams."
cancer,2017-06-11,"Some people have very specific ideas about what you should be doing with your time. But you don't need to explain everything you do today. You may even choose to keep your most important plans private. Ironically, if someone witnesses your actions now, they might misinterpret your intentions. Don't apologize for who you are. Rather than modifying your behavior to accommodate others, allow your heart to take the lead. However, remain mindful not to confuse the voice of ego with that of intuition."
leo,2017-06-11,"Your larger-than-life approach could be difficult for others to support. It seems as if people want to temper your extreme ideas because they're worried about you taking things too far. On the other hand, you have no interest in turning down the amplitude on your exuberance. Unfortunately, you can inadvertently anger people with your unwillingness to negotiate. Be open to changing your methods without altering your goal. Journalist Jane Wells said, ""Learn the wisdom of compromise, for it is better to bend a little than to break."""
virgo,2017-06-11,"You've got a game plan today and aren't shy about telling everyone about it. However, you might change your mind several times during the day, confusing those around you. The more questions they ask to gain clarity, the more nebulous your answers become. Don't continue the dance if it feels as if an interaction is escalating into a standoff. Sometimes, knowing when to walk away from a conversation is an invaluable skill. Dr. Abdul Kalam wrote, ""If you want to shine like a sun, first burn like a sun."""
libra,2017-06-11,"You might want to be left to your own devices more than anything else today. Although you Libras are known as people who like people, sometimes you still need to recharge in silence. Nevertheless, you could be swept up by someone's invitation, only to regret saying yes. It's perfectly acceptable to accompany a friend or relative as long as you're not playing the role of a martyr. Co-dependency leads to resentment if you feel as if your needs are not being met. Time alone is time well spent."
scorpio,2017-06-11,"You are rather optimistic about reaching your goals today; you can imagine your plan unfolding exactly according to your vision. However, when reality deviates from your fantasy, you may be unwilling to compromise. Your obstinacy sets the stage for an emotional drama with someone close to you, whether or not he or she has anything to do with your current frustration. Feeling so strongly is both a blessing and a curse that is all too familiar. Fortunately, you can turn a challenging moment into a memorable one if you remember to put the current events into a larger perspective."
sagittarius,2017-06-11,"You are a sight to behold when your thoughts carry you into lofty philosophical realms. It's easy to justify nearly anything you want now because there are no logical arguments to counter your bombastic style. However, you could become a victim of your own circumstances as your flamboyance backfires on you. It's hard for others to fathom how quickly you can become so self-critical. Wide swings of emotion are likely today, yet you can ameliorate the intensity by striving for moderation on both ends of the spectrum. Balance is your friend."
capricorn,2017-06-11,"You're like a laser beam with an unwavering singular focus. You might start out as if it was any other day, but you grow more and more obsessive about reaching your goals as the evening approaches. Your singlemindedness can be a gift unless you take yourself too seriously. Your current practice is to keep your sites aimed at your destination while also being open to altering your course as circumstances change. Be committed and flexible at the same time."
aquarius,2017-06-11,"You're keeping your feelings wrapped up and out of sight today. Perhaps you're worried that others might take advantage of your weakness if they know your secrets. But vulnerability is a mixed bag. Revealing the hidden soft white underbelly of your inner world is always a gamble, but one that can be well worth it if you pick the right audience. It requires courage to let people see the true you. Deepak Chopra wrote, ""The less you open your heart to others, the more your heart suffers."""
pisces,2017-06-11,"There's nothing iffy about your future now. You close your eyes and see it stretch out in your mind -- as real as anything in the three-dimensional world. Don't be afraid to dream big, for today's visions are the scaffolding that you will be building your life on. Hold onto your fantasies until they manifest. Nevertheless, you must realize that turning thoughts into reality isn't just a mental exercise. Hard work and tireless commitment are necessary ingredients for success."
aries,2017-06-12,"You are a model employee or student today, with your heart set on performing to the best of your abilities. You don't even mind taking orders from a teacher or your boss because you can see what's in it for you. Unfortunately, the energy shifts midday and you're tempted to defy authority by defining your own priorities -- which may not be in line with your current assignment. Your act of rebellion could turn a few heads now, but that won't likely dissuade you from dancing to the beat of your own drummer."
taurus,2017-06-12,"Your coworkers would be wise to employ your help now, because you are working with the perfect balance between being extremely practical and highly visionary. You see a myriad of possibilities as you look to the future, yet you possess an uncanny sense of what's actually viable. Nevertheless, you're not infallible. You could get carried away with your current knack for turning your thoughts into reality. Don't assume you are like King Midas today, and everything you touch will turn to gold. C.S. Lewis wrote, ""Humility is not thinking less of yourself but thinking of yourself less."""
gemini,2017-06-12,"You're unwilling to alter your ideas in order to be accepted by someone else today. You're less interested in peer approval than in making a lasting impact on your surroundings. Your current persistence may come as a surprise to those who have written you off as inconsistent or shallow. Nevertheless, you will stand up to your coworkers, friends or the entire world if necessary, just so you can demonstrate your integrity. Your commitment to your cause is admirable, but you could be so stubborn that you become less effective. Author James Freeman Clarke wrote, ""Strong convictions precede great actions."""
cancer,2017-06-12,"People may be expecting more from you today than you can deliver. It's an honor to be held in such high esteem but you don't like the performance pressure others place on you. You might even be pushed to a breaking point when you realize you're likely to let more than one person down. However, it's not in your best interest to just give up now and walk away from the stress. Author Tobias Wolff wrote, ""We are made to persist; that's how we find out who we are."""
leo,2017-06-12,"You're a regular workhorse today; the more that's piled on your shoulders, the harder you push yourself. You're eager to expend more energy because the acknowledgement from your peers fills you with pride. Thankfully, appreciation is forthcoming, but you must prove yourself worthy of the applause. However, don't let your desire for recognition drive you to the point of exhaustion. Setting ambitious priorities is wise as long as you set healthy boundaries, too."
virgo,2017-06-12,"You're determined to mix work with play today and might go to extremes in the process. People may be shocked by your unpredictability, especially if it comes at a time when everyone else's priorities center around their responsibilities. Naturally, you aren't trying to be irreverent or counterproductive, but your inner child is seeking an outlet for expression. Remember, your behavior is under your control, but the consequences of your actions are not."
libra,2017-06-12,"You don't understand how people can be so inconsiderate, especially if they let you down without even telling you why. Unfortunately, you can't control the actions of anyone else, but your feelings may be hurt because you take their irresponsibility as a personal rejection. However, there's likely more to the story than meets the eye. Instead of criticizing someone's behavior today, wait and see how the plot unfolds. Leave room for the element of surprise and give others the benefit of the doubt."
scorpio,2017-06-12,"Although everything seems to be relatively stable this morning, an unforeseen sequence of events could send you scrambling. Fortunately, you can adapt to the unexpected twists and turns if you maintain a positive attitude. In fact, you might even benefit from the changes as you're released from a project that prevented you from pursuing more creative interests. But don't settle back into the rut you are freed from. If reality gives you the option, spread your wings and soar with the eagles."
sagittarius,2017-06-12,"You could be so stuck in your ways today that you miss an unexpected chance to accomplish your goals. It's just that your plans are already in place -- and they're likely very good ones. In fact, the opportunity that arrives out of left field now isn't even on your radar. Wayne Dyer said, ""Believing is seeing."" Nevertheless, too firm of a belief also creates a blind spot. Being childlike and remaining open to surprises can make the difference between failure and success."
capricorn,2017-06-12,"You continue to cherish your goals as if they are badges of honor. Nevertheless, you may be overwhelmed by restlessness today, motivating you to bust loose from the chains of responsibility. Timing is everything when it comes to your personal evolution. Fortunately, your actions plant seeds in fertile soil now; nurture them by feeding your unrealized dreams behavior consistent with your soul's purpose. Author Danielle LaPorte wrote, ""The universe cannot resist authenticity."""
aquarius,2017-06-12,"You're tired of waiting for others to respond to your inspirational messages or to act on their own convictions. Obviously, you want your peers to join your cause, but you secretly hope they would do anything other than what's expected of them. Fortunately, your wish may come true sooner than you think. The Moon's shift into your revolutionary sign might be enough to light a fire under some people who prefer to go on sleeping. Nevertheless, now it's time to wake up. Edith Wharton wrote, ""There are two ways of spreading light: to be the candle or the mirror that reflects it."""
pisces,2017-06-12,"The time for making plans is over; you are being called to put your strategy into action. However, you are likely working under deep cover or at least out of sight today, since recognition is not your top concern. In fact, you prefer that others step forward and receive the attention now, because you believe you can better influence the flow of events if everyone is busy looking elsewhere. Novelist Harry Harrison wrote, ""Let people very obviously see what you want them to see, then they'll never notice what is hidden."""
aries,2017-06-13,"Everything seems to be happening at the same time now, preventing you from following up with critical fact-finding. However, you could end up creating more problems if you don't verify what you learn. Fortunately, you have an amazing ability to compress time and accomplish a huge amount of work when your back is up against the wall. Nevertheless, you might discover that you spread yourself too thin today, making it difficult to deliver on all your promises. Remember, the power of concentration can be your saving grace, even if you're in over your head."
taurus,2017-06-13,"You might be in a very strange state of mind, questioning your ability to make a good decision. Luckily, your self-esteem receives a propitious blessing from Jupiter today, but it's not a free pass to success. You still need to put in a concerted effort to reap the rewards of your work. Although you may be unusually restless now, it's inadvisable to alter the basic routine of your life just yet. Hold onto the status quo rather than falling into a trap of thinking the grass will be greener on the other side of the fence. Increase your chances to find happiness by listening to the people you respect."
gemini,2017-06-13,"It may feel as if you can do no wrong today, but unseen danger could be lurking behind an intriguing opportunity. Ironically, you might be so optimistic that your confidence tricks you into taking on more challenges than necessary. Remember that you have limits just like everyone else and overstepping them can lead to trouble. Set personal boundaries and let others know what they are right away. Although changing circumstances could throw a curve ball to slow you down, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure."
cancer,2017-06-13,"You don't want to work hard today, but you might not have the freedom to choose. Thankfully, each of your actions produces near-immediate positive effects. However, short-term success is no reason to think you're finished, so conserve some energy for the days ahead. Don't attempt to complete everything all at once. Spread the most demanding chores over the next few days for the best results. Ambiguity reigns where logic does not."
leo,2017-06-13,"Although you normally prefer a more independent approach, you are in perfect step with your coworkers today. Thankfully, you stand to gain a lot from your interactions with others if you take the time to ask the right questions and remain open to the advice you receive. Harness the power of your associates by thinking on a grand scale as you strive to reach your goals. It may not take an entire village to assure your individual success, but it's much easier collaborating now than flying solo."
virgo,2017-06-13,"You're not thrilled about having to deal with so much extraneous information today. In your perfect world, you can envision a life with less data and more facts. Unfortunately, you may feel as if you're being overwhelmed with noisy static that is difficult to analyze. Nevertheless, don't stress about the wrong things. Be open to whatever you hear, but wait a few days before you try to put it all into proper perspective. James Russell Lowell wrote, ""A weed is no more than a flower in disguise."""
libra,2017-06-13,"It's as if you are riding on a freight train of words today, without knowing where it might stop. Interpersonal communication takes up much of your time, yet it's about to become even more important. You could receive some sort of good news, but it's tricky to discern it from all the other incoming emails, telephone calls and conversations. Pay careful attention to every little detail so you don't let a golden opportunity slip through your fingers. Your next adventure is waiting for you to say yes."
scorpio,2017-06-13,"You continue to ride an emotional roller coaster, taking your feelings to new lows and thrilling heights. Although today will likely be on the upswing, too much optimism could make you uneasy because you're not willing to blindly trust your positive feelings. If you're worried that something else is coming around the next corner, you're probably correct. Practice patience; your life is in flux now and the alternating currents of yin and yang have not yet played through. The struggle is part of the story."
sagittarius,2017-06-13,"An uplifting comment from a friend or coworker encourages you to develop a passionate idea into a real plan. In fact, someone might deliver the confidence boost you need today as Mercury the Messenger trines your key planet Jupiter. It's self-empowering when your behavior inspires others to accomplish greatness. Proudly dream your dream out loud, for anything you believe can become part of your future. Albert Einstein said, ""Creativity is contagious; pass it on."""
capricorn,2017-06-13,"Stretching beyond your normal limits is an opportunity to learn things about yourself and your work in new ways. You are eager to experience the rush of adrenaline that comes from expanding your horizons by doing things differently. Just keep a bit of your infamous Capricorn caution in reserve so you don't go too far, too fast. Trust your current optimism while remembering inflated thinking will fall from its apparent grace in the days ahead. Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""All of life is an experiment. The more experiments you make the better."""
aquarius,2017-06-13,"Brilliant ideas come to you as lightning bolts of energy today. It's as if the ceiling of your mind has been removed and your thoughts are free to mingle with the stars. However, there's a price to pay if you don't know when to stop dreaming. The source of your trouble now is your over-extension. Larger-than-life aspirations give you a feeling of power for a short time, but might not pay off in the long run. Write down your best thoughts and then wait until tomorrow to pick the most sensible ones for further exploration."
pisces,2017-06-13,"You accept the notion that establishing stability in your life is prudent, but new temptations make it tricky to stay on task. Your hopes are stirred by possibilities in front of you, but your thinking might not be clear enough today to foresee the hazards ahead. Although the opportunities may be real, proceed with caution. Your success is more likely now if you let the current circumstances continue to develop on their own, instead of attempting to push things ahead too soon. Carl Lewis said, ""Life is about timing."""
aries,2017-06-14,"Convincing yourself that you're heading in the right direction is easy, but you can't get others to buy your story so quickly now. Nevertheless, sharing your plans with friends and associates is your smartest move because they will spot any faulty reasoning or missing detail. Keep in mind that your cleverness might backfire in an instant if you are overly confident in your delivery. It's better to confront the shortcomings of your strategy sooner than later or you could waste precious time. Starting an honest dialogue leads to a successful outcome."
taurus,2017-06-14,"You are typically straightforward, yet your current tendency is to embellish the facts. The truth is you aren't intentionally trying to mislead anyone now; it's just that you could easily get mixed up between what you want and what is real. There's nothing wrong with chasing your dreams or taking a quick trip to Fantasyland as long as you inform everyone of your plans. After all, your imagination is a rich garden where your most creative ideas can take root."
gemini,2017-06-14,"Your charming wit impresses people so much they rally to your support, only to realize your plans aren't nearly as practical as they thought. Mischievous Mercury aligns with dreamy Neptune, enhancing the colors of your fantasies while blurring your connections to the real world. Rather than needing to retell your story later on, just stick with the facts right from the beginning. Save your tall tales and word games for another day. Being honest keeps your integrity intact."
cancer,2017-06-14,"Untangling a problem today won't lead to satisfaction if your solution is anything less than enchanting. This is what Keats meant when he wrote, ""Beauty is truth; truth beauty."" Nevertheless, you could easily mislead yourself into believing you know where you want to go when you're actually heading somewhere else. Don't wait; it's time to put on the most practical pair of glasses you can find. The most reliable answers are revealed now once you see the world exactly as it is."
leo,2017-06-14,"You won't likely realize how aggressive your actions are today as you strive to get what you want. Although you mean well, your friends could misinterpret your pushy behavior, setting the stage for an unnecessary confrontation. But an argument is a total waste of energy because you're probably closer to agreement now than you realize. Consciously toning down your approach makes everyone happier, in spite of the confusion. For the fastest resolution, listen more than you talk."
virgo,2017-06-14,"Your resources are overextended now because a recent burst of enthusiasm inspired you to agree to participate in one-too-many projects. Don't wait until mental exhaustion sets in before making a change. Instead, exercise sensible restraint; it's more important to follow through on what's already been started, even if you're tempted to head out on a search for the next big thing. Part of your natural charm is your dependability, so fulfill your commitments before you do anything else."
libra,2017-06-14,"You're deeply engaged in a weird dance between the old and the new. Your close friends and associates  urge you to leave an annoying habit behind, but you may not be ready to move beyond your attachment to the past. Paradoxically, the more you logically analyze your current affairs, the more confusing they become. Stop thinking long enough to act on your feelings instead of what someone else is telling you. Forget about finding the right answer. Author Bryant McGill wrote, ""Dare to believe that good things are possible when you follow your heart."""
scorpio,2017-06-14,"Although there are special people in your life that you lean on when you need them, it's disconcerting if they're not readily available today. You could feel as if you have been abandoned now, but that's not what is happening at all. Your friends probably don't even realize the intensity of your current process. Luckily, you can turn this moment into an opportunity to explore your dreams without any interference from others. Sometimes those who fly solo have the strongest wings."
sagittarius,2017-06-14,"You won't likely find happiness by tenaciously clinging to your preferred outcome today. You could come frustratingly close to reestablishing your lost sense of emotional security, but it quickly slips out of your grasp as you approach the magic moment of fulfillment. It's a waste of energy to build your hopes up only to have them dashed; instead, keep bringing your concentration back to the present. Allow cosmic opposites to exist simultaneously without trying to take a position now. Let the uncertainty hang in the balance until your clarity returns."
capricorn,2017-06-14,"You are distracted by watching your fantasies unfold on the cerebral silver screen inside of your head now. Although every individual scene represents a distinct possible turn of events, you would prefer to deal with the hard facts and not these dreamy illusions. But you can't put a stop to your thoughts by official decree. Rather than trying to force change, acknowledge that today's mental excursions are an effective way to explore the potential of the present moment. John Muir wrote, ""The power of imagination makes us infinite."""
aquarius,2017-06-14,"You may be experimenting with a more poetic style of expression that requires you to set aside your logical perspective on life. There's less need to worry about your productivity today, since your real work is about reconnecting with your soul. Although you might not be able to explain your current spiritual yearnings to anyone else now, rest assured that the right words will come later. But the magic won't happen on its own; you must take the time to cultivate your dreams and exercise your creativity. Lewis Carroll wrote, ""Imagination is the only weapon in the war against reality."""
pisces,2017-06-14,"You are blessed with the ability to commune with your spiritual nature, even if you're too busy to pursue more social interests. Satisfaction has nothing to do with how long you can escape from your hectic schedule now; it's more to do with how you use whatever time you have available. Simply setting aside a few minutes for meditation or relaxation could be sufficient to get you back in a more peaceful groove. Reestablishing your center empowers you to reach for the stars."
aries,2017-06-15,"Someone may present you with ideas today that contradict your own position. The willful Sun opposes stern Saturn in your 9th House of Philosophy, encouraging you to rationalize your actions with authoritarian ideas. But rather than wasting time trying to justify old patterns, you're better off exploring new metaphysical territory now. Minimize any negative consequences of your current inclination to over-intellectualize. Expanding into the realms of imagination is fine as long as you bring your theories back into the real world and focus on practical solutions."
taurus,2017-06-15,"It feels as if time is running painfully slow today, and everything seems to take longer in reality than on paper. You could adopt a negative attitude this morning on a moment's notice, especially if you must overcome an obstacle that catches you off guard. Nothing will be gained by complaining about your bad luck or by attempting to shift the blame to anyone else. Henna Sohail wrote, ""The moment you learn the lesson, the test will be over."""
gemini,2017-06-15,"Your attempts to restore an energetic balance in a relationship may be blocked today, especially if you think you can take the easy way out. It's a sign of maturity to actually consider what people say before rejecting their perspective out of hand just because it's inconvenient. Accept whatever situations arise, rather than demonstrating how stubborn you can become when there's a good reason. Thankfully, responding to the changing circumstances without resistance could turn a challenging moment into a pleasure-packed day. Ernst Hemingway wrote, ""Courage is grace under pressure."""
cancer,2017-06-15,"Serving others today can bring you more contentment than you expect, even if your own needs remain unfulfilled. However, there's a fly in the ointment when someone's selfish behavior upsets you now, prompting you to resist doing anything nice. Nevertheless, forgiving petty annoyances is still your best strategy because you won't be happy with yourself unless you take the high road. Giving another person the benefit of the doubt enables them to return the favor when you need it most."
leo,2017-06-15,"Controlling your cravings for pleasure is an uphill battle, especially if you believe you deserve some time off now to replenish your energy. There is nothing wrong with pursuing happiness as long as you don't overdo it. The smartest approach is to set aside a specific time to nurture your soul as well as your physical senses. Reassessing your goals is the first step toward balancing your responsibilities with your desire to indulge in life's delights."
virgo,2017-06-15,"Maintaining an even keel on the home front can be a struggle today, especially if someone is tempting you with a fun-filled distraction. You see everything through a very expansive filter now, but don't let an impulsive moment inspire you to jump too quickly just because an offer sounds right up your alley. These are serious times and you could court unnecessary problems if you don't keep your priorities in balance."
libra,2017-06-15,"You might wake up with lofty intentions today, aiming to be methodical about accomplishing your goals. But as the day wears on, you could become increasingly lackadaisical and fall further behind until you just give up. Don't be too self-judgmental if you find yourself on the wrong end of the stick now; give yourself the gift of reprieve. Scheduling additional time off can be accomplished without comparing your actual production to your high ideals. Focus on your potential, not your limits."
scorpio,2017-06-15,"It's certainly not helpful if you can't make up your mind about spending money today. Be responsible and stick to your budget or you could find yourself in a difficult cash position sooner than you might expect. However, conserving resources is probably the single smartest thing you can do now, since it's very easy to talk yourself into buying something you don't really need. If you are indecisive about a purchase, delay it for a few days until you know what you really want. Comedian Craig Bruce quipped, ""You usually have to wait for that which is worth waiting for."""
sagittarius,2017-06-15,"Interactions with others seem strained today for no apparent reason. It's as if people are on your case while the free-wheeling Gemini Sun opposes conservative Saturn. You might think the smartest solution is to simply withdraw from social activities for a while. Nevertheless, keep in mind that retreat doesn't need to be an all-or-nothing option. Don't pretend that everything is okay if it's not; evasive tactics will be more apparent now than you realize. Be truthful when discussing subjects of significance but don't say more than is necessary. Words are free. It's how you use them that may cost you."
capricorn,2017-06-15,"Although a spiritual discipline can offer much-needed peace of mind today, you must follow through with your practice if it's to create a long-lasting impact. You possess a strong need for self-expression now, yet rationalizing what you do might be difficult. However, there is no law that says you must follow a tradition or explain why you're not doing so. Rather than trying to please anyone else, choose your path to enlightenment and stick to it."
aquarius,2017-06-15,"Determine what you need to do today by first deciding where you want to end up. Unfortunately, fascinating distractions could lure you off course if you're not paying attention. In any event, it's crucial to achieve a modicum of balance between your immediate craving for variety in your daily life and your non-negotiable long-term goals. Just be certain your dreams are really yours, rather than the wishes of a parent, spouse or boss. The only person who can live your life with authenticity is you."
pisces,2017-06-15,"Your current commitment to social responsibility is strong, yet you may be searching for an escape clause in an agreement you no longer wish to keep. It's not that you're so bent on defaulting on your commitments now; however, if there was an honorable way out, you might take it. You're better off meeting your previous obligations without trying to renegotiate the deal. Your heart knows that a promise made is a promise kept."
aries,2017-06-16,"Trusting your intuition is a mixed bag today since you could easily misinterpret messages from your unconscious. Unfortunately, what you see might not be what you get because your personal desires can actually alter your perceptions. If you must make a decision now, go back to the facts so you don't base a choice on an incorrect assumption. If you have any doubts at all, ask a trustworthy friend for another point of view. If there's no one around to ask, remember the Maltese proverb, ""Time gives good advice."""
taurus,2017-06-16,"You might assume the best when someone at work brings you up to date on a particular issue. Normally, having a positive attitude is admirable because it creates a path for growth and accomplishment. However, the dynamics are tricky today since your optimism could lead you into a situation where you're over your head. There's no value in being a pessimist, so be a realist instead. Psychologist William James wrote, ""The greatest weapon against stress is our ability to choose one thought over another."""
gemini,2017-06-16,"Solving problems at work demands more creativity than muscle today. In fact, you can put your fantasies to practical use as long as you don't lose your perspective on what's real. The sands are shifting beneath your feet, so it's hard to know when you're standing on solid ground. The challenges are substantial now, but so are the potential rewards. If you proceed cautiously and remain flexible, you can maintain your center of gravity. Author Gordon B. Hinckley wrote, ""You can't build a great building on a weak foundation."""
cancer,2017-06-16,"If someone approaches you today, asking you to make plans for climbing Mount Everest or flying to the Moon, you might accept the challenge without batting an eye. There may be little differentiation between reality and fantasy now as dreamy Neptune casts its spell in your 9th House of Adventure. As the Beatles sang, ""The Magical Mystery Tour is waiting to take you away."" Nevertheless, it's worth the effort to discern fact from fiction. You still can pursue a pipe dream, but at least you won't be disappointed when your vision doesn't materialize. The juice is in the journey."
leo,2017-06-16,"Your hypersensitivity might catch you off guard today, especially if a person close to you shares a tale of woe. Normally, you can listen with an open heart while maintaining a clear distinction between feelings that belong to you and those that are someone else's. However, the Pisces Moon is like a psychic sponge in your 8th House of Deep Sharing, dissolving boundaries and activating your intuition. Your current vulnerability isn't necessarily convenient now, but it has the potential of magically increasing intimacy in an evolving relationship. Thich Nhat Hanh said, ""Compassion is a verb."""
virgo,2017-06-16,"Getting a straight answer from people seems nearly impossible today and the harder you try, the more perplexed you become. A powerful lunar conjunction with hazy Neptune in your 7th House of Others clouds interactions with those closest to you. You might attempt to compensate by relying on your imagination to fill in the missing data, but that only complicates the dynamics even further. Author Aldous Huxley wrote, ""Facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored."""
libra,2017-06-16,"The simplest instructions at work seem outrageously complex today. It's as if you speak a different language than your coworkers and your boss. Unfortunately, you have your heart set on fulfilling your obligations, even if you're not quite sure what they are now. Although giving up before you reach your goal is normally frowned upon, it's better to fall short of other people's expectations than to spend all day clearing the wrong path. Rather than trying to make blind progress, tie up as many loose ends as you can without venturing too far from the present moment."
scorpio,2017-06-16,"You're eager to leave the contracted world of narrow thinking behind you now. In fact, you are wise to clear as much time from your schedule as you can today in order to pursue creative activities. Your dreams are flooding into awareness as an imaginative Moon-Neptune alignment energizes your 5th House of Self-Expression. Unfortunately, you still might have lingering responsibilities that prevent you from following your dreams. Drawing a line between your inescapable obligations and the places you want to escape to helps you balance these two widely divergent worlds."
sagittarius,2017-06-16,"You may be inspired by the amazing people in your life, but lost when it comes to doing something practical with your dreams. Your tendency is to just keep moving forward, even if you're unsure of your destination. However, instead of venturing far off the beaten path, you might prefer to go home today. You need to reconnect with your inner purpose now, rather than performing for an audience. Instead of chasing recognition for your accomplishments, let contemplation feed your spirit."
capricorn,2017-06-16,"You're not sure why you can't put all the pieces of your day in order, but your schedule is like a Rubik's cube today. Just when you have one part of it perfect, the other parts fall into disarray. Unfortunately, you're not one to take no for an answer, especially when it comes to making plans. Nevertheless, nebulous Neptune's heightened activity in your 3rd House of Immediate Environment pulls a diaphanous shroud over your activities. Rather than adding to your frustration, take a few steps back and let your calendar evolve organically. Arthur Frank Burns wrote, ""Spontaneity has its time and its place."""
aquarius,2017-06-16,"You might suffer from a crisis of confidence today. Your self-esteem is defined by your fears now, instead of your accomplishments. But you don't have the luxury of spending a day lost in concerns about things that won't ever materialize. Rather than letting your vulnerabilities derail your progress, channel your anxiety into your work. Stress can act as an effective catalyst for change. Be a warrior, not a worrier."
pisces,2017-06-16,"You are in your element today, happy as a fish swimming in the waters of your vast imagination. Although people might not be able to see the real you, you can project nearly any version of yourself that you choose now. Your magic enables you to play the role of a shapeshifter while illusory Neptune is stationary in your 1st House of Personality. However, the more conscious you are of your metaphysical mojo, the greater control you possess over how you are perceived by everyone. Let your light shine so brightly that others can see their way out of the dark."
aries,2017-06-17,"You receive a little cosmic boost today, encouraging you to initiate action on a project that you've been thinking about for a while. Nevertheless, you still might spend part of the day purposefully procrastinating or putting the finishing touches on your strategy. Ultimately, you will accomplish more if you just jump in now, even if you're not completely ready. Although you may not have time to make a plan, the impulsive Moon's return to your sign triggers your response to a situation anyhow. When opportunity knocks, answer the door."
taurus,2017-06-17,"Ironically, your emotions heat up today yet others think you're cooling off. They may assume that everything is copacetic now, but you're withdrawing because you don't want to be bothered to explain your reactions. Nevertheless, you must find a healthy way to express your feelings even if you wish you could be invisible. You might not arrive at a viable solution immediately, but you're not in a hurry. You would rather get it right than get it done."
gemini,2017-06-17,"You don't want to be responsible for the wellbeing of others today, but somehow you are designated to save the day. Although you might try to pass the job on to another person, it keeps following you wherever you go. Complicating matters, someone could be making unnecessary demands on your time, prompting you to put up an energetic barrier. Nevertheless, an old Spanish proverb reminds you to be bold and build bridges, instead of walls."
cancer,2017-06-17,"Although you're not overtly aggressive, your tenacity makes up for any perceived shortcomings today. Anyone who thinks your gentle nature means you're a pushover is guilty of an error in judgment that could create serious conflict later on. You might be planning a power play that doesn't require you to come out swinging. Somehow, you can conquer new territory through defensive maneuvers as long as you wait for your opponents to make their first moves and reveal their weaknesses. Author Josh Shipp said, ""Perseverance is stubbornness with a purpose."""
leo,2017-06-17,"You experience two separate days rolled into one. At first, you can't decide if you want to play it safe today by maintaining the status quo or if you should cash in your chips and hop a plane to an exotic location. However, you quickly grow bored when imagining staying put and doing nothing. A tropical island may be a stretch, but there are many ways to stir up a bit of fun without trotting around the globe. Actress Jaime Lyn Beatty said, ""Jobs fill your pocket; adventures fill your soul."""
virgo,2017-06-17,"You're ready to step out of character today and take a gamble in order to deepen a relationship. Although the outcome is uncertain, you won't be stopped by rational thought. When you perform a risk-versus-reward analysis now, the risk side of the equation will be the winner, regardless of the facts. But as long as you're going to take a chance, be certain to enjoy yourself every step of the way. The journey, not the destination, is the experience to be savored."
libra,2017-06-17,"You are traveling through familiar territory in the Land of Relationships today. On one hand, you might have high hopes about someone you admire, but they might not know anything about your feelings. On the other hand, they could be overly assertive as they act out the urgency of the enterprising Aries Moon. In both cases, your response is the same: walk the road of truth and be willing to meet others halfway. Mother Teresa said, ""Honesty and transparency make you vulnerable. Be honest and transparent anyway."""
scorpio,2017-06-17,"You are working an ambitious agenda today and you don't like it one bit if someone tries to throw you off course. Ironically, your major distractions won't likely be tied to other people; there are plenty of worthwhile activities to pursue, even if you weren't invited to go on a magical dream date. Actually, you are your own party now, so you don't need the noise of everyone else. Novelist Hermann Hesse wrote, ""Solitude is independence."""
sagittarius,2017-06-17,"After a contemplative period this morning, you're raring to get started on a wildly busy afternoon. However, your quiet time is not without stress because you can't decide whether you want to involve others in your activities today or not. Nevertheless, there's a radical shift of energy midday, drawing you out of your shell and turning you back into the life of the party that everyone loves. Enjoy the ride but don't exhaust yourself in the process."
capricorn,2017-06-17,"Although you're eager to grab a little time for yourself today, this break won't likely last for long. Even if you get to stay at home, you'll soon be caught up in a project that requires your full involvement. However, you might not demonstrate the persistence you're known for as you hop from one task to another. You can't slow down by simply deciding that's what you're going to do. Instead, visualize the satisfaction you derive from a job well done and play that fantasy every time your mind wanders. Take pride in your success."
aquarius,2017-06-17,"You have one good idea after another today, but you might not be able to keep up with them. Naturally, this could be a perfect scenario if only you could capture one or two of your inspirations and turn a thought into reality. But your mental flow seems to be out of your hands, making this an excellent time to employ meditation or yoga to realign the body, mind and spirit. Your imagination is the birthplace of invention."
pisces,2017-06-17,"You're less talk and more action today when it comes to taking care of things around the home. Nevertheless, you still need a plan, so you might start off by making a list of what you want to accomplish now. However, you're not interested in losing yourself into the jungle of analysis. Just look for the shortest distance between two points and head that way when the energy feels right. Bruce Lee said, ""If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you'll never get it done."""
aries,2017-06-18,"You'll try nearly anything today if you think it will lead to a memorable experience. Unfortunately, much of what you do will not turn out as expected and you might be sent back to the drawing board. In fact, you may feel as if you're destined to repeat this cycle, each time believing that your impulsive behavior will lead to a more stabilizing outcome. Hopefully, you can learn the lesson the cosmos is offering now. Reconsider your actions before you set out, not after you arrive at the wrong destination. Paulo Coelho wrote, ""A mistake repeated more than once is a decision."""
taurus,2017-06-18,"You don't like being pressured to respond before you are ready. Unfortunately, everyone seems to be waiting for you to speak, yet you can't put your clever ideas into words. It's as if your anxiety scares the thoughts away before you can verbalize them. Fortunately, the solution to this dilemma is not complicated. Imagine that time is rubber and you can stretch it to your advantage. Your stress fades as you take a few relaxing breaths, enabling you to share your opinions. Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius wrote, ""You have power over your mind, not outside events. Realize this and you will find strength."""
gemini,2017-06-18,"There's no need to fly a kite in the whimsical winds of change today, for you are the kite being bounced around by the breezes. You love the feeling of freedom that flying brings, yet there are moments when you wish you could be back on good old terra firma. Thankfully, you might just get what you want, especially if you are smart enough to let the currents take you where they will. Soar in the airy realms of thought while it lasts and then return to the practical world where you must tie up loose ends before the day is done."
cancer,2017-06-18,"Your patience is wearing thin today and you're tempted to take drastic action so everyone knows exactly where you stand. But caution wins out over urgency and you probably will bide your time until external circumstances are right rather than giving in to an uncontrollable emotional outburst. The truth is, acting strategically doesn't mean you're avoiding the issue. To the contrary, you have an unexpected opportunity to develop the details of your plan. Author Croft M. Pentz wrote, ""The secret of patience is to do something else in the meantime."""
leo,2017-06-18,"You're running hot and cold today, but paradoxically at the very same time. You want to cut loose and do your own thing, even if it means leaving the safety of the pack. But you stand to benefit from strong supervision now; you might even be required to set aside your pet projects and concentrate on someone else's priorities rather than yours. At first, you may resent anyone trying to limit your freedom of expression. Eventually, you'll be thanking them for your current success."
virgo,2017-06-18,"You are a veritable star today, shining brightly within your chosen career. But being a resounding success in other people's eyes is not as important to you as living in integrity. Nevertheless, it's easy to get swept up in all the social noise and forget your real purpose now. However, you possess the tools to narrow your focus and reset your priorities. You are a light of inspiration by which others may calibrate their moral compasses. Take your bearings, set your course and see who follows."
libra,2017-06-18,"Turning down an invitation from a friend is challenging today, even if your schedule doesn't really permit you to say yes. Nevertheless, you may live under an illusion that you can continue to compress and stretch the hours of the day at your own discretion. Unfortunately, you might hit a wall sooner than you expect and your overpacked agenda will implode. Save yourself a headache by preemptively limiting your commitments so karma doesn't have to do it for you. Promise less, deliver more."
scorpio,2017-06-18,"Your unconventional approach to routine can turn your day upside down. You want to shake up your world by doing things in a different order just to avoid the boredom of everything being the same. But sometimes change isn't constructive, especially in the middle of a process that actually works. Don't let your current rebellious streak wreak havoc. Roman poet Horace wrote, ""Rule your mind or it will rule you."""
sagittarius,2017-06-18,"Your joie de vivre knows no bounds today, or so it seems. You look off toward the distant horizon with an irrepressible exuberance, even if you lack a solid plan. The truth is you might not even have a specific goal in mind now, other than to live your life as large as possible. Unfortunately, your uncontainable optimism isn't enough to carry you past the real-world obstacles you encounter. Don't assume you can glibly jump over every hurdle without a struggle. Sometimes the most important life lessons are the ones you learn the hard way."
capricorn,2017-06-18,"You're not nearly as cautious as you appear today, but your methodical approach to accomplishing work enables you to get away with more than people realize. In a way, you're a revolutionary dressed in a conservative suit of clothes, but you must be careful not to give yourself away. Misleading others is not your intention; it's just that you need to be accepted into the social circles that can make a difference if you want your career to be successful. Aesop had you in mind when he wrote, ""Beware of a wolf in sheep's clothing."" You can be a potent agent of change but it's your choice how you wield your power."
aquarius,2017-06-18,"Words flow easily today, but you're merely describing the amazing images that keep popping into awareness. Your innovative thinking is the real gift now, especially if you can utilize your creativity to express your breakthroughs. Others may be dazzled by your intelligence, but at some point your brain will need to rest. Instead of birthing one brilliant concept after another, step back and choose one original idea to focus on. E.E. Cummings wrote, ""I'd rather learn from one bird how to sing than teach ten thousand stars how not to dance."""
pisces,2017-06-18,"Although you live so comfortably in the realms of your imagination, you must stop your mental meanderings today and take care of business in the real world. You might be envisioning the week ahead or happily retreating into your fantasy life. Either way, you need to set aside your compelling dreams for a while, if you want to maintain your position. Author Robert Kiyosaki wrote, ""You and only you are responsible for your life choices and decisions."""
aries,2017-06-19,"You may resist common sense today as you continue to pack more and more into your day. But your busyness is not about being ambitious; rather, you don't want to miss out on anything that might happen, even at the cost of exhausting your resources. Hopefully, your moment of realization arrives early enough for you to relax before the day is done. Recuse yourself from the rat race to recharge your emotional and physical batteries. Author Doe Zantamata wrote, ""Taking time to do nothing often brings everything into perspective."""
taurus,2017-06-19,"You're tempted to take the easy way out at work today, but it's a mistake to believe you can escape the natural laws of cause and effect. Nevertheless, you could have an epiphany as you discover a new way to perform a particular aspect of your job. There are sensible reasons to follow established routines, but sometimes they can be improved. Don't be afraid to try something new now as long as you're not attempting to ignore your commitments. The satisfaction of finishing a task is only second to the delight you experience when you increase the efficiency of your work."
gemini,2017-06-19,"Managing the ebbs and flows in relationship dynamics can be complicated today. When your heart is happy, you're likely to increase your ante because you're confident your luck will endure. But the tide will quickly turn if you overplay your hand, leaving you short-changed by the end of the day. However, you can work the energy in your favor now if you understand that nothing is permanent. Buddhist teacher Sharon Salzberg said, ""Life is like an ever-shifting kaleidoscope -- a slight change, and all patterns alter."""
cancer,2017-06-19,"You could shock your friends and associates with your unexpected behavior at work today. Just when you think everything is under control, your frustration gets the best of you and you break from the script. You worry others when you're no longer a character in someone else's plot. But you make people nervous because you're closer to the truth now. Don't take anything for granted, including your role in this delicate moment. You may be most effective by leading others to the edge of the cliff, but not jumping yourself. There's still work for you to complete exactly where you are."
leo,2017-06-19,"You possess the uncanny ability to pull rabbits out of hats today, but your magic isn't limited to stage tricks. You seem to be able to conjure up the right energy to help others break out of old patterns and discard routines that are no longer of use. However, you need to remember that you have limitations of time and resources. Act with self-restraint or, much to your chagrin, your best-laid plans will fall apart before your eyes. St. Jerome wrote, ""The scars of others should teach us caution."""
virgo,2017-06-19,"Your actions are inconsistent today but you continue to rationalize everything you do by connecting them to a higher purpose. However, even with your eyes on the heavens, you may be distracted by more immediate temptations of the flesh along the way. Unfortunately, sensual pleasures only lead to temporary physical satisfaction, leaving your soul still longing for something else. It might be that spiritual pursuit is the missing cornerstone to your current foundation of life. Rumi wrote, ""The inspiration you seek is already within you. Be silent and listen."""
libra,2017-06-19,"Trusting folks is difficult today because everyone seems to be flaking out on their commitments. You would rather someone just said no, instead of agreeing to do something and then disappearing with no explanation. Of course, this unreliable behavior makes it tricky for you to live up to your word as well; don't commit to more than you can honestly deliver without the help of others. People with good intentions make promises, but people with good character keep them."
scorpio,2017-06-19,"If you haven't already broken rank, you have one more chance to demonstrate your innovative side by heading out on your own. However, the window of opportunity begins to close later in the day, and you may be stuck with little change until another chance rolls around. Unfortunately, your judgment is not as precise as usual and you could, with great confidence, make a poor decision now. Rely on others for their good advice, but consider the consequences of their words before blindly acting on them. Your future depends on what you do today."
sagittarius,2017-06-19,"You can surprise others with your brilliance today because your unorthodox thinking is well grounded in pragmatism. This special trick of yours comes in handy because people are caught off guard by how effectively you balance a healthy respect for the rules and a total disregard for them at the same time. But you can get carried away with your own creative prowess now and push the envelope too far. Remember, your current strength is tied to your willingness to express your radical ideas in a very traditional manner."
capricorn,2017-06-19,"You like to indulge in the sweeter things in life as much as anyone else, but you are often more rigorous in your ability to exercise self-control. Nevertheless, you're being tested now as reality dangles enticing temptations in front of you. Don't play the role of a martyr by stoically denying your needs. Acknowledge your human nature and nurture your desires without surrendering your life to them. Cicero wrote, ""Never go to excess, but let moderation be your guide."""
aquarius,2017-06-19,"You're still riding a creative wave but it takes a more practical turn today, enabling you to craft your ideas into something tangible. But you're not motivated by the expectations of others now; you're driven by your own need to imprint your unique individuality onto the world. You're not in it for the money and you don't really care what people think. Needless to say, this rebellious attitude gives you a great deal of latitude in your freedom of expression. Don't be afraid of being different; be afraid of being the same as everyone else."
pisces,2017-06-19,"You may have important obligations to manage today, but you secretly wish you could slip off into your fantasy world. It's not that you're looking to avoid work, but you have important questions about the mysteries of the universe and you want answers now. Unfortunately, you might need to temporarily tuck your dreams back into the deep darkness of night while you concentrate on meeting more earthly responsibilities. Nevertheless, as John Lennon quipped, ""The more real you get, the more unreal the world gets."""
aries,2017-06-20,"You might feel as if the wind has left your sails today and it's challenging to go anywhere at all. Ironically, your thoughts are running wild without concern about your current lack of motivation. You can visualize solutions to nearly any problem, but won't ever know if a strategy is effective unless you try it in the real world. Even if you're not planning to initiate action yet, write down your ideas so you can act on them in the near future when you are ready. Mentalist Tony Corinda wrote, ""Good timing is invisible. Bad timing sticks out a mile."""
taurus,2017-06-20,"It doesn't really matter that everything isn't going your way today because your positive attitude enables you to take life's hiccups in stride. The Moon's current visit to your mellow sign allows you to look on the bright side of things when others might already be frustrated or angry. Nevertheless, you have your point of no return and it's best for everyone if you don't get pushed past it. Thankfully, you have the gift of perspective now, inspiring you to focus on your blessings rather than your burdens. Author Richard Carlson wrote, ""Don't sweat the small stuff -- and it's all small stuff."""
gemini,2017-06-20,"Pursuing a passion project today sounds like a lot more fun than performing your regular job duties. Your imagination has been set on fire and you want to share your colorful visions and creative ideas with others. Or, perhaps, you prefer to tap into this cosmic magic by getting lost absorbing someone else's artful creation. Fortunately, you are clever enough to fulfill your obligations while also traveling to fascinating places in your mind. However, falling short of your duties will surely result in instant karma zapping you by day's end. Success rewards the persistent."
cancer,2017-06-20,"Your brain is tired of the endless stream of words and you wish you could find the switch to turn them off. The placid Taurus Moon entices you to slow the pace of your life and make time to smell the flowers. However, there's a perfect opportunity to check tasks off your to-do list, making it a serious mistake to escape just yet. Additionally, take good care of your body since suffering from exhaustion is a very real possibility if you ignore your physical needs. But don't get lazy if there are chores to be done; a month from now you may wish you had started today."
leo,2017-06-20,"Success comes easily today; you don't have to work as hard in order to achieve a touch of fame and fortune. However, you're less intrigued by distinguishing yourself among your peers now than you are by learning more about your inner workings. Interacting with others contributes to everyone's wellbeing, so take every chance you get to start up a conversation with someone you don't know. Politician Norm Rice said, ""Dare to reach out your hand into the darkness, to pull another hand into the light."""
virgo,2017-06-20,"Your current idealism is not based upon rocket science or molecular biology; it's as simple and straightforward as you can imagine. You know what you like and what you don't. You're aware of what's working in your life now and you will do whatever is necessary to hold onto that aspect of your world. You may wish to make changes to improve certain situations but you're focused on preventing change where it's not needed. If it ain't broke, don't fix it."
libra,2017-06-20,"You could turn the most mundane event into a romantic fantasy today because you see things through the filter of your dreams. Your mind is working overtime to imagine lovely possibilities that might have nothing to do with the real world as surreal Neptune supports sensual Venus. Fortunately, you can tell the difference between fact and fancy, even if you're disappointed with reality compared to what you see in your mind's eye. Spanish novelist Miguel de Unamuno wrote, ""Love is the child of illusion and the parent of disillusion."""
scorpio,2017-06-20,"Your muse has stopped by for a visit today to encourage your artistic creativity in images or in words. You can spin a tale of love found or love lost -- complete with magic and intrigue -- that is fascinating to nearly everyone. However, the story will not write itself; it takes real work to actually sit down and put your thoughts in the proper order. Fortunately, you can also communicate your ideas verbally, but you still must take the initiative. Don't let self-doubt stand in your way any longer. Author Joseph Chilton Pearce wrote, ""To live a creative life, we must lose our fear of being wrong."""
sagittarius,2017-06-20,"One of your greatest strengths is your unwavering ability to project hope into the future. It's not just that you see brighter days in front of you; you're willing to jump in and do whatever it takes to make your dreams come true. Luckily, the cosmos is offering you a rare planetary combination of unfettered imagination and common sense. If you can envision it today, you can make it real. George Bernard Shaw wrote, ""Life isn't about finding yourself. Life is about creating yourself."""
capricorn,2017-06-20,"You excel at knowing when to seize an opportunity because you are always calculating the odds of success. Luckily, the chances of reaching your goal are excellent today as long as you honor your priorities. Although you will do better at nearly anything if you speak from your heart, don't overcomplicate interpersonal dynamics with emotional drama. The simpler your approach, the more direct your path will be to the top of the mountain. Theodore Roosevelt said, ""Believe you can and you're halfway there."""
aquarius,2017-06-20,"You wish you could relax in a familiar safe space today, but your dreams are calling and you're driven to answer. Some might say your goals are unrealistic but you have little doubt that you can reach them if you are persistent. Nevertheless, creating your future requires you to build a solid foundation first. Starting small is a smart strategy that enables you to learn from your experiences and gain confidence as you accomplish each step along the way. Hip-hop artist Mos Def wrote, ""All the things that are worth doing take time."""
pisces,2017-06-20,"You seem to live in a world that is fed by your dreams and everything currently appears more real than ever. Every single thought that bubbles into awareness creates a new reality for you to explore. Even a tiny ripple of an emotion can cascade into a fresh adventure in your life now, so it's crucial to steer your thinking in positive directions. But don't waste a moment today for it's a whole new chapter tomorrow. Mahatma Gandhi wrote, ""The future depends on what you do in the present."""
aries,2017-06-21,"Keeping up with all your commitments keeps you on your toes now. Your to-do list continues to grow longer, especially if procrastination is part of your routine. Instead of waiting for your schedule to collapse, save the day by acting with restraint. You must heed the message from the cosmos and begin to slow down the entire chain of events unfolding around you. Trying to fix everything simultaneously might just make it worse today. A conservative approach to change works best if real progress is your goal."
taurus,2017-06-21,"Profound emotional interactions muddy the waters between you and your friends, diverting your attention from center stage. Meanwhile, a minor disturbance may pull you away from your regular routine as a trivial disagreement morphs into a more serious conflict. You can quickly gloss over any rough spots by choosing the simplest words to express your feelings. Just don't go to extremes while sharing your emotions today. Taking care of the basics makes sense, but you must also honor the wishes of your heart."
gemini,2017-06-21,"People want to know your position on a developing situation at work, but you prefer to keep your thoughts out of the public eye today. You might not be secure enough with your stance to defend it against every argument. But your reticence to reveal your opinions could also be linked to a free-floating, existential sadness as the Sun leaves your sign for the watery realms of Cancer. Allow the Command Center to move from your head to your heart, even if it increases your vulnerability. You don't need to possess all the answers now. A quiet mind is able to hear intuition over fear."
cancer,2017-06-21,"You may be reconnecting with your personal power today, but you're still experiencing pangs of self-doubt. You realize how much work is in front of you and are thankful that the radiant Sun is back in your sign, strengthening your vitality and shining a spotlight on your accomplishments. Fortunately, you're fired up for whatever challenges you must face now. Acknowledge your current position; whatever is holding you back is fuel for your new growth. Change your assumptions and step into a more meaningful future."
leo,2017-06-21,"You are fascinated by your own melodrama as the Sun disappears into your 12th House of Secrets. Recollections of the past give rise to familiar feelings that flood your imagination. Having plenty of options gives you the opportunity to eliminate a habit that's no longer working for you. Granted, you might still be all over the emotional map today, but seeing future possibilities from multiple perspectives inspires you to elevate your awareness to a higher level. Mystic Sadhguru said, ""Inward is not a direction. Inward is a dimension."""
virgo,2017-06-21,"Knowing which way to go is more difficult today, because your vision of the future shifts like the winds before a storm. Nevertheless, you're so perceptive now that you can tease out the most significant thoughts from the noise in the background. Hold your valuable ideas tightly, for they will guide you over the next month while the Sun illuminates your 11th House of Hopes. Don't let anyone talk you out of your dreams, for they are the primary way to nurture your soul now. Michelangelo wrote, ""Faith in oneself is the best and safest course."""
libra,2017-06-21,"You are excited to participate in activities with people who may further your goals today. Naturally, doing what is most valuable for everyone is your first preference, but it's not so easy when you're being pulled in competing directions. You fully understand the sacrifices you are making now, but still might resent someone for taking you down this path. No one will be satisfied with the outcome if you aren't happy with your choices, so reconsider your plans before initiating action. Rushing leads to regret; slow down and get it right."
scorpio,2017-06-21,"Emotionally connecting with your friends enables you to stay in touch with your own feelings, too. But don't expect any lingering confusion about your relationships to disappear overnight. In fact, your uncertainty about the future may actually deepen now. Nevertheless, it's easier to manage your emotions over the next month if you don't bury them with nervous chatter or constant activity. Take time for contemplation; calming your mind creates space for new insights to bubble into awareness and inspire your dreams."
sagittarius,2017-06-21,"Intimate relationships are a top priority that demand your full attention now. However, the interpersonal emphasis is changing from casual encounters to more profound connections while planets continue to cluster in your 8th House of Deep Sharing. Nevertheless, you might be resistant to the discomfort of vulnerability accompanying this dance. Go beyond words and sink into the hidden mysteries. You long for the safety of logic, but previously buried treasure will only be revealed if you're willing to wander off the rational map and into the irrational realms of your heart."
capricorn,2017-06-21,"You prefer concentrating on how to get ahead in the world because you want concrete results now. However, there is also a bright light shining on your personal relationships while the Sun visits your 7th House of Companions. Honor your current feelings without worrying if you must temporarily set aside your career ambitions. Putting additional time toward nurturing a vital partnership might bring emotional rewards far richer than professional recognition. Motivational speaker Denis Waitley said, ""Personal satisfaction is the most important ingredient of success."""
aquarius,2017-06-21,"It may appear that the fun and games are over now, but there's plenty more to follow. However, you must complete unfinished chores first, with playtime bumped down toward the bottom on your list of priorities. Enjoying yourself while still behaving in a responsible manner is tricky stuff, giving your sense of humor a chance to ride to the rescue. Thankfully, you will relax even more once you feel the satisfaction from a job well done. Charlie Chaplin said, ""A day without laughter is a day wasted."""
pisces,2017-06-21,"Although your feelings are running deep, you grow more lighthearted today. You Fish swim with blissful enjoyment while the Sun travels through your 5th House of Love and Play. You might appear more spontaneous and relaxed to your peers now, even though you're quite serious about what you want. Trust your instincts and follow the currents wherever they take you. Carl Sagan wrote, ""Imagination will often carry us to worlds that never were. But without it we go nowhere."""
aries,2017-06-22,"You're making plans to do a million things today, but chances are that none of them will come to fruition. It's like you're starring in an episode of ""The Twilight Zone"" now, where your thoughts can't break through an invisible wall that separates your inner world from your outer. Nevertheless, your imagination is real and things that take place in dreams and fantasies eventually influence your life. Let your mantra be: ""Hold the vision; trust the process."""
taurus,2017-06-22,"People close to you aren't telling you everything today. You're not sure what's being kept secret, but you can feel it in your bones. Unfortunately, there's nothing to do about this predicament, and asking questions just makes others retreat even further. However, don't doubt the validity of your intuition now. Just accept your assumptions to be true and give your friends enough room to be comfortable. They will talk when the timing is right. Respecting everyone's boundaries cultivates trust."
gemini,2017-06-22,"You might feel as if your mental wiring is carrying too much data over the same old circuits. You may even worry that your nerves will fray today, leaving messages undelivered. Fortunately, you can strengthen your internal communication system with the simple act of daily meditation. Just sitting in contemplation for fifteen minutes a day changes the chemistry of your body. Author Elizabeth Lesser wrote, ""One does not practice meditation to become a great meditator. We meditate to wake up and live, to become skilled at the art of living."""
cancer,2017-06-22,"You don't want anyone to know how buzzed you are today, but the coffee has kicked in and you're flying through the intellectual stratosphere. Nevertheless, you wish you could concentrate on your work, but your thoughts are bouncing around from one end to another. Instead of trying to fit your whole being into a confined space, break out of the cage. Connect with your inner eagle and rise above the storm. Once you are soaring, you can see your entire life from a wider perspective. Follow your inner compass and you'll easily find a place to rest when your spiritual work is done."
leo,2017-06-22,"Talking with your friends fills your head with all kinds of exciting ideas, but it's tough to integrate these conversations into your life. You might be left with two divergent worlds -- your everyday work-related responsibilities and your creative space with its interesting books, clever people and unexplored territories. Embracing this duality doesn't mean that you must choose one over the other. In a world of quantum possibilities, when you come to a fork in the road, don't take the road less traveled. Take both."
virgo,2017-06-22,"People turn to you for your strong analytical skills and common sense. You are bumping up against a looming moment that represents a deadline, a time when you must make a decision about continuing a project or bringing it to an end. But you are far from knowing how to handle a significant transition yet. Thankfully, you can ponder philosophical issues with others while still refraining from taking a side in the ongoing argument. Jim Rohn wrote, ""Happiness is not something you postpone for the future; it's something you design for the present."""
libra,2017-06-22,"Everyone seems to be looking for something you already possess. Your confidence is refreshing, but it's not about simply declaring everything is possible. Your words must be directly connected with your heart if they are to produce a powerful impact. Don't try to agree with people without bringing your own feelings into the mix. Even at work, you'll be less effective if you detach from your emotional foundation. Leonardo da Vinci wrote, ""Tears come from the heart and not from the brain."" Although crying on the job isn't advisable, showing your passion is."
scorpio,2017-06-22,"You're driven to wrap words around things you already know. The talkative Gemini Moon is hanging out in your 8th House of Deep Sharing, motivating you to use language now instead of actions. However, people might not understand your message even if you carefully choose your words today. Remember, saying the same thing over and over doesn't help anyone to understand your point. Instead of involving others in your work, focus on demonstrating your competence. Alex Trebek said, ""It's very important in life to know when to shut up. You should not be afraid of silence."""
sagittarius,2017-06-22,"The sweetness of relationships helps to reduce the pressure in your life now, especially if you feel like you're floating directionless out in the ether. But everyone seems overly chatty and you might prefer a bit of silence today, rather than a discussion that doesn't lead anywhere useful. Nevertheless, you can skillfully redirect a conversation to move it into more relevant areas of inquiry. Don't just walk away from an interaction because you're bored; you may be pleasantly surprised with what you learn if you stick around and listen."
capricorn,2017-06-22,"Your attention to details can make or break your day. However, every time you narrow your focus to tie up another tiny loose end, you lose your concentration and must start all over again. Nevertheless, don't give up. Repeating this process a few times alters your perspective; what you see now is quite different from where you began. Don't assume you already know all the answers because reality is transforming right in front of your eyes. When you change, the objects around you change, too. Author Harville Hendrix wrote, ""Nature doesn't care that you are comfortable, only that you evolve."""
aquarius,2017-06-22,"You have a magical way with words today and can use them to paint a picture, tell a story or persuade someone to support your position. Sharing your thoughts in a presentation creates an intense immediacy, but putting your ideas in writing gives them more weight. Avoid being so philosophical that your message loses its connection with the real world. Express your truth without holding back and others will respect you for your authenticity."
pisces,2017-06-22,"You have a very personal tale to tell today and it's not for just anyone's ears. Sharing your feelings can deepen a relationship now, so be sure you want to go in that direction before you begin the conversation. Luckily, your admiration will shine through your words, even if that's not your intention. You may be seeking advice on how best to handle a family matter or a romantic problem. But don't ramble on or you could lose your audience before you receive valuable feedback. Ultimately, you will know the truth by the way it feels."
aries,2017-06-23,"Communicating your needs is essential in a relationship, but your tendency to be overly blunt can create an awkward dynamic. You are eager to make something special happen now, yet the cautious Cancer New Moon in your 4th House of Security leaves you uncertain on how to move the energy forward. Don't overpower your desires with intentions. Listen to your intuition if it tells you to wait. Nothing positive is gained by pushing your agenda too soon."
taurus,2017-06-23,"You have little desire to do more than is necessary today, so you might spend much of your time sticking close to familiar routines. You can turn a busy calendar into a quiet day, yet you still have something to say now that the reflective Cancer New Moon occupies your 3rd House of Communication. Speaking your mind is certainly warranted, but listening to the feedback helps you improve your message. Everyone feels included when there is an equal give and take in their interactions with you. The most successful conversation is a two-way street."
gemini,2017-06-23,"You could use a healthy dose of peace and quiet now. Although there may be social activities on your calendar, you are also advised to carve out some time to be alone. However, this isn't about being isolated or lonely. Instead, it is about listening to your own inner voice, which can all too often get drowned out by the everyday noise of life. Thankfully, the contemplative Cancer New Moon sinks into your 2nd House of Self-Worth, redirecting your efforts to build your self-esteem. A day spent in meditation leaves you feeling rejuvenated and ready to mingle with others once again."
cancer,2017-06-23,"As soon as you're finished working today, get outside and catch some critical solar rays. Perhaps you could make time for some summer reading or light gardening. And even if you're not inclined to worship the Sun directly, at least make sure you utilize the New Moon in your sign to revitalize your soul. There's no need to worry about accomplishing your goals now. Just enjoy the experience of swimming around in the sea of your colorful inner world. John Keats wrote, ""The poetry of the earth is never dead."""
leo,2017-06-23,"You have intense desires that are seething just beneath the surface. Often you Lions are quite direct in your delivery, but a more secretive mood comes over you while the timid Cancer New Moon lingers in your 12th House of Spiritual Mystery. You don't need to act on every emotion, but neither do you have to deny your feelings, even if they further complicate your life. It's wiser to preemptively deal with a troublesome issue than it is to stay quiet. Jack Welch said, ""Control your own destiny or someone else will."""
virgo,2017-06-23,"Hanging out with your friends sounds like a lovely idea now that the Cancer New Moon falls in your 11th House of Companions. However, something may hold you back at the last minute. Maybe you're busier than you expected, leaving you too tired to play. Remember not to spread yourself too thin since you are prone to be more sensitive if you're lacking in sleep. If you end up partaking in social frivolities, at least make it a low-key event. Save your energy for when you need it. Starve your distractions; feed your focus."
libra,2017-06-23,"Your ideal scenario today consists of you luxuriating in the privacy of your home without the need to go anywhere at all. But unfortunately, reality doesn't let you off the hook so easily while the Cancer New Moon rattles your 10th House of Status. Ironically, you could be called upon to take responsibility for someone else and you must have the presence of mind to rise to the occasion. Nevertheless, you also possess invisible boundaries and still feel protected within your own shell, without the need to draw others into your world. Tom Hanks said, ""A hero is somebody who voluntarily walks into the unknown."""
scorpio,2017-06-23,"Your ever-changing moods carry you into unfamiliar waters today as the Cancer New Moon stirs your 9th House of Adventure. There is a haunting familiarity to the landscape, whether or not you are eager to start the next chapter of your story. You can't tell if you have been here before or if it is only a place that you visited in your dreams. Pay careful attention to all the details, for signs appear everywhere pointing to your future. Mary Oliver wrote, ""Keep some room in your heart for the unimaginable."""
sagittarius,2017-06-23,"Your nerves are likely on edge today, especially if you're lured into an emotional drama beyond your comfort zone. Short of booking a last-minute ticket on an airplane, there isn't much that you can do to avoid the intensity of the Cancer New Moon landing in your 8th House of Intimacy. Forget about trying to escape; it's out of the question. Sink into your feelings, armed with the knowledge that they will lighten again soon. John C. Maxwell wrote, ""Change is inevitable. Growth is optional."""
capricorn,2017-06-23,"You ambitious Mountain Goats strive for stability, even while you are relentlessly climbing higher and higher. However, you don't feel as sure-footed as you appear. Reach out to others for support while the Cancer New Moon floods your 7th House of Partnerships. Emotional waters are swirling around your feet, making the rocks rather slippery. Swim through the mixed feelings, but don't try to cling to any of them along the way. Follow your heart to successfully navigate any storm."
aquarius,2017-06-23,"You can sense a cosmic shift that takes you from the highest thoughts into the deepest pool of feelings. Try as you might to separate out the intricate strands of emotions, they seem to be interwoven now that the Cancer New Moon settles into your 6th House of Details. You may feel as if this emotional fabric is so heavy that it's an unfair burden. However, you're still advised to proudly wear it as if it were your own. Paradoxically, graciously accepting your obligations magically lightens your load."
pisces,2017-06-23,"You might wish you could start anew with respect to love, but you don't need to walk away from a healthy relationship to do so. The nurturing Cancer New Moon softens your 5th House of Self-Expression, consciously infusing your passions into a partnership and adding magic to your romantic game. However, if you're single, you may be hesitant to get involved with anyone for fear of getting hurt. Creig Crippen wrote, ""You will see in the world what you carry in your heart."""
aries,2017-06-24,"Your heart is running the show today, taking you on a journey to an unfamiliar destination. Although you're a willing accomplice, you're not happy about giving up control of your agenda. In the final analysis, this sacrifice seems trivial, especially if you can establish a meaningful connection with someone special. Emotional satisfaction is within reach if you have the courage to stay on course no matter what surfaces in the process. Benjamin Disraeli said, ""Man is only truly great when he acts from the passions."""
taurus,2017-06-24,"Aligning your intentions with a higher purpose sets the stage for emotional fulfillment. Spending time with someone you love isn't enough to bring satisfaction when your head and your heart are in conflict. Nevertheless, you crave harmony in your relationships. If your current situation falls short of your desires, don't let self-doubt limit the possibilities of what's to come. The planets are standing by ready to offer their assistance, but you need to make the first move. Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""Once you make a decision, the universe conspires to make it happen."""
gemini,2017-06-24,"You might be worried about what you will uncover when you start asking questions today. Although you may consider remaining quiet for the sake of peace, there's too much at stake. Ultimately, you need to know the truth, even if sinking into your feelings brings up uncomfortable memories. There's no quick route in or out; this emotional journey will take time. Fortunately, there are treasures awaiting your discovery, buried in the recesses of your subconscious. Don Miguel Ruiz wrote, ""With awareness, reality shifts."""
cancer,2017-06-24,"A close friend or lover may initiate an unpleasant conversation today. Fortunately, you can manage the intensity of another person's fears now, because you recently fought a battle with your own demons and won. Although you don't have solutions to someone else's dilemma, you are fully capable of holding space for their process without overreacting. This profound emotional work is not to be taken lightly. However, your efforts are appreciated and your continuing support is nurturing for all involved. Gloria Steinem said, ""Empathy is the most radical of human emotions."""
leo,2017-06-24,"You are stepping into transformational territory as you sort through your assorted emotions and try to learn the lessons being offered now. Your persistence uncovers new truths that alter your view of life and what you hope to achieve. The path you chose is not an easy one, but exploring behind the facade of surface appearances can change your perspective in ways you can't yet imagine. Difficult roads often lead to beautiful destinations."
virgo,2017-06-24,"You don't need any batteries today because your feelings are an endless source of power. Although you may experience a troublesome situation in love, you're able to maintain a healthy perspective and take everything in stride. But there's no room for denial now, so use your sharp logic to see beyond the camouflage and cut through the distractions. Oprah Winfrey said, ""The greatest discovery of all time is that a person can change his future by merely changing his attitude."""
libra,2017-06-24,"You're drawn into a complicated melodrama that raises a familiar issue. It's difficult to maintain emotional distance when feelings intensify today. You can become consumed by a friend's crisis because you're willing to offer a sympathetic ear and a strong shoulder. The current circumstances might remind you of another power struggle when you were not in control, but don't let these memories shut you down prematurely. You have a significant role to play in someone's life now; be there for the people who matter."
scorpio,2017-06-24,"Your power comes from your wizardly ability to undergo a surprising metamorphosis without missing a step today. You are the legendary phoenix that arises from the ashes as mysterious Pluto harmonizes with vulnerable Venus. Others might be afraid of such dynamic change, but you instinctively know that it's futile to resist these evolutionary waves. Being flexible enough now to go with the cosmic flow is a sign of strength. Thomas Monson wrote, ""Decisions determine destiny."""
sagittarius,2017-06-24,"Your values may be brought into question today by someone who claims to have all the answers. But digging into the situation might reveal two very different views of reality. Although explaining your beliefs could be helpful, you must be careful to distinguish them from the hard facts. Adopting  an objective approach enables you to avoid a needless argument and move on to something more constructive. Wayne Dyer said, ""Conflict cannot survive without your participation."""
capricorn,2017-06-24,"You are the champion of gentle persuasion today, but your sweet and sensitive nature doesn't mean you're a total pushover. No one can coerce you into relinquishing authority now, especially if you are operating from your heart. What others might perceive as stubbornness, you experience as conviction. But defending your position is a waste of time when you could be leading by example, instead. Socrates wrote, ""The secret of change is to focus all of your energy not on fighting the old, but on building the new."""
aquarius,2017-06-24,"A secret has a life of its own today, and may even be more important than what you share. Naturally, you're not required to tell everyone all your private thoughts; there are some things that are better left unspoken. Whatever you choose to say now, do it with consciousness. Deliberate communication is the cornerstone to a successful relationship as long as your intentions are aligned with your heart. Oddly enough, talking to each other instead of about each other makes most of your problems disappear."
pisces,2017-06-24,"Your perceptions are eerily accurate today and your feelings are powerfully intense. You want to share your perspective with your friends, but might not know how to approach a subject that others want to avoid. Unfortunately, the longer you wait, the more resentful you may become and your dissatisfaction could drown out your intended message. Open the conversational door gently now; an aggressive approach will scare others off before they hear what you have to say. Poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge wrote, ""What comes from the heart goes to the heart."""
aries,2017-06-25,"A relationship offers an escape route from recent emotional stress. Although the discomfort may dissipate now, the underlying issue is not necessarily resolved. Taking the easy way out sounds better than it is in reality, partly because it's only a temporary fix. Your key planet Mars forms a square to expansive Jupiter, blowing everything out of proportion. However, you must face your denial if you don't want to grapple with the same problem again and again. When in doubt, take a deep breath and return to the facts. President James Garfield said, ""The truth will set you free, but first it will make you miserable."""
taurus,2017-06-25,"You may wish you could don Harry Potter's invisibility cloak today, for you don't want to expend so much energy explaining your decisions to everyone. It's even more draining if people are still encouraging you to take a different course than the one you're on. A puzzling conflict between your inner and outer worlds could entice you to say yes to others, while emotionally withdrawing and quietly doing your own thing. Your retreat is just a temporary tactic to maneuver in the direction you want to go. Claim your power and don't look back."
gemini,2017-06-25,"You are as surprised as anyone about your current optimism. You might even assume the recent emotional drama is over. But rather than leaving the unresolved past behind, take advantage of your newfound confidence to push through your resistance and deal with your relationship problems directly. Although you often choose to circumvent the complex mysteries of feelings, your enthusiasm empowers you to explore the unknown today. Rumi wrote, ""Both light and shadow are the dance of love."""
cancer,2017-06-25,"Your fears have receded into invisible crevasses of your subconscious, motivating you to untangle complex emotional issues that resurrect memories from the past.

leo,2017-06-25,"Your thoughts are coming fast and furious now, and each new idea sounds better than the last one. Your mind is brewing wonderful projects and plans while energetic Mars squares opportunistic Jupiter in your 3rd House of Distractions. Although you're eager to move ahead with every possibility, your judgment isn't as clear as you believe. All signs are pointing yes, but saying no is the most immediate way to break the cycle of overdoing. Roman philosopher Seneca wrote, ""It is quality rather than quantity that matters."""
virgo,2017-06-25,"Life's little surprises appear in your path to remind you that you're not in charge of your calendar today. Your friends and family expect you to participate in their group activities, even if you don't have the time to spare. You have work to do now, but there's no hiding from the onslaught of interruptions. Nevertheless, resist all urges to sever your connections, personal or technological. In the barrage of data coming through your social network, there are truthful nuggets of meaning shining through the noise. Captain Jack Sparrow said, ""Not all treasure is silver and gold."""
libra,2017-06-25,"It feels like everyone knows your business, even if you say nothing at all.

Benjamin Franklin wrote, ""Words may show a man's wit, but actions his meaning."""
scorpio,2017-06-25,"You're receiving emergency messages on all channels today, warning you to swing into action before it's too late. Although this heightened sense of urgency propels you into motion, it's not the healthiest way to get motivated. In fact, you might end up exhausted, overextending your energy because you attempted the impossible. Nevertheless, you're in the middle of a significant period of growth now, making it tough to maintain balance in your life. Author David Allen wrote, ""You can do anything, but not everything."""
sagittarius,2017-06-25,"You look to the horizon today and see infinite possibilities waiting to be pursued. Your high ideals blend with unrestrained visions, inspiring you to reach for the impossible dream. However, you may be setting yourself up for discouragement once you realize your aspirations are unattainable. Nevertheless, you don't need to give up on your quest for adventure and fun if you relegate these hopes to the fantasy realms. John Lennon said, ""Time you enjoy wasting, was not wasted."""
capricorn,2017-06-25,"Your recent resistance starts to subside today, and your confidence is returning stronger than ever. The power of positive thinking can work wonders now, if you don't let blind optimism run away with all your best ideas. But attempting to turn every brilliant thought into something tangible will ultimately do more harm than good. When the cosmos is seen through such a hopeful lens, it helps to perform a serious reality check. Fortunately, you can rely on your friends to offer the reasonable perspective you so desperately need. An objective eye sees everything."
aquarius,2017-06-25,"Your diligence is finally being acknowledged and you're receiving the recognition you deserve today. But don't become cavalier while basking in the light of your newfound fame, even if others are applauding your contributions to a larger personal, social or political cause. It's not healthy to dwell on past accomplishments for too long. Begin a new project that doesn't scatter your energy, but defines your purpose. Always find time for the things that make you feel happy to be alive."
pisces,2017-06-25,"Your bubble won't likely pop today, but it can't grow any larger without endangering everyone inside it. The smartest way through your current dilemma of overextension is to deflate the tension before it reaches an explosive point. Acknowledge your role in creating the imbalance and accept your part in the resolution. Avoiding your responsibility by blaming others is beneath your dignity. Instead, show everyone what you're made of and be the leader that you would follow."
aries,2017-06-26,"You're a subdued version of your warrior self, empathizing with people instead of battling with them. Your key planet Mars is attuned to mystical Neptune, blessing you with the ability of manifesting your dreams. However, this magic only works as long as you stay true to your heart's desires. Your emotional openness deepens a love connection, but it can all vanish in a moment if you don't speak your truth and walk your talk. Share what's on your mind, but do it in the sweetest way possible. A Turkish proverb claims, ""Kind words will unlock an iron door."""
taurus,2017-06-26,"You're tired of fast-talking people who try to mislead you with their silver tongues and easy promises. You're simply not in the mood for anyone's games today. You might even show your anger if you believe others are trying to avoid their responsibilities. You're no fun at all if you find out someone is deceiving you in any way now. It's best to delay an important decision for a few days until the fog clears. See reality as it is, not as you wish it to be."
gemini,2017-06-26,"The hectic pace picks right back up today, but something isn't quite right in your world. Your intuition might be telling you that someone isn't playing fairly now, and you're concerned that this unpleasant situation could grow more complicated over the days ahead. However, you can waste valuable energy if you allow yourself to slip into a fearful state. Instead, sow seeds of compassion and trust. Marianne Williamson teaches, ""Love is what we were born with. Fear is what we learned here."""
cancer,2017-06-26,"Your emotional reactions continue to be strong, but something in your heart shifts now. You might be afraid of sharing your desires because you're concerned about being judged.

Bryant McGill wrote, ""There is no love without forgiveness, and there is no forgiveness without love."""
leo,2017-06-26,"You may be so attached to your desires now that you can't even acknowledge them. People expect you to be transparent and there might be trouble if they think you're hiding something. Unfortunately, their suspicions could lead to accusations and denials today, wasting time and leaving everyone frustrated. Be courageous and proudly admit your feelings. Although you're unsure of your actions at first, revealing whatever you were avoiding clears the air better than any other strategy."
virgo,2017-06-26,"You're not sure about your next move because the line between the real and the imaginary is hard to find today. However, you prefer to keep your facts and figures straight so you don't jump to any incorrect conclusions. Unfortunately, even the simplest ideas are entangled with subjective likes and dislikes, making everything quite complicated now. The complexity of this moment will soon pass. In the meantime, pursue creative and artistic endeavors, saving the important decisions until your clarity returns. Channel your confusion into your art."
libra,2017-06-26,"Your most compelling fantasies seem very realistic today, tempting you to stretch the envelope by acting out an impossible dream sequence. Ironically, you might be happily surprised to discover that it works. However, you are stepping into an unsustainable world where the tiniest seed of doubt could collapse your entire creation.

Time has a wonderful way of showing us what really matters."

You have choices to make now, yet you might be attracted to a totally new perspective on life, thinking it can offer you safe harbor.

Don't jump at the first shortcut; instead, hang out with your confusion for a while before making your final decision. Author Brandon A. Trean wrote, ""It is how we embrace the uncertainty in our lives that leads to the great transformations of our souls."""
sagittarius,2017-06-26,"You want to be able to trust your instincts, but everything is moving so fast now that you can't get a solid read on the dynamics of the moment. Still, you're drawn toward the magic in the unseen realms. Someone might surprise you today as he or she gracefully dances around your probing questions. The more you investigate, the less you know. Wait a few days until the mystery plays through. Fortunately, your patience is rewarded when you're left with newfound clarity and purpose."
capricorn,2017-06-26,"A friend or coworker can be a major thorn in your side today, yet it's unclear why you are the target of their ill will. It may be obvious to you that some people are obsessing about the wrong things now, but you don't want to say anything because the issue is so sensitive. Walking on eggshells to evade a direct confrontation is a defensible strategy for a while, but it doesn't work in the long run. Virginia Woolf wrote, ""You cannot find peace by avoiding life."""
aquarius,2017-06-26,"People around you seem to have more energy than you now. You're not sure if your current assessment of someone is based on the fact or upon your desires. However, you might be able to use another person's inspiration to jumpstart your creativity into motion. Your flexibility alleviates the pressure of growing tensions in a relationship today. But don't diffuse the uncomfortable energy too quickly. Holding onto your position and sinking deeper into your emotions eventually leads you to clarity. Max Ehrmann wrote, ""In the noisy confusion of life, keep peace with your soul."""
pisces,2017-06-26,"No matter how hard you try, it seems like you should be more practical today. However, your current frustration stems from your inability to manage your emotions. It's like invisible forces are influencing you to take action, but your spirit just isn't connected with your behavior. You willingly listen to the advice of your closest friends, but their words don't alter your feelings. Do whatever is required to meet the expectations of your associates now, but don't ignore the messages coming from your subconscious. Follow your heart; it knows the way."
aries,2017-06-27,"You seem to be ready to jump into a project on a moment's notice, but your appearance is misleading today. You won't likely commit to any significant project now unless there's already a solid plan in place. In the meantime, you're running through all the possibilities in your mind so you can arrive at your own strategy. Don't get trapped by the false illusion of logic now since your best ideas will arrive through your imagination. Deepak Chopra advises, ""Always go with your passions. Never ask yourself if it's realistic or not."""
taurus,2017-06-27,"Exercising a bit of self-restraint can save the day because trying to squeeze in too many activities on your calendar now might create unnecessary struggles. It's tempting to say yes to every opportunity knocking on your door, but you must limit your commitments if you want to succeed at any of them. Establishing realistic goals offers you an excellent chance to concentrate specifically on finishing whatever you start. Your attitude is an integral part of the equation for success, but it's only part of a greater whole. Obviously, hard work and consistent effort make all the difference in the world."
gemini,2017-06-27,"Your tendency to rationalize your behavior is so deeply ingrained in you that you could inadvertently become captive to your own cleverness. Your key planet Mercury has your back, attempting to patch up the rough spots in your day. But avoidance is also an option and you might assume the easy way out is less demanding today. Nevertheless, don't even think about circumventing a pressing issue now; intentional denial only makes everything more complicated. Swallow your pride and make the first move."
cancer,2017-06-27,"Complex emotions can bottle up inside you until you find a way to express them. Thankfully, this challenge won't slow you down now that loquacious Mercury is active in your sign. Although you're not one to share your feelings unless you're with someone you explicitly trust, you might experience a sense of urgency to speak your mind. Don't fall victim to an impulsive reaction; a cautious and methodical telling of your story is ultimately more productive than an unpremeditated outburst. Author Jean Houston said, ""No matter the situation, never let your emotions overpower your intelligence."""
leo,2017-06-27,"Your long-kept secret could slip out into the open today. Although you might be worried about the consequences of your unintentional disclosure, everything seems to settle down pretty quickly with little or no damage done. However, your faux pas could lead to an unexpected benefit when a discussion about a sensitive subject ensues. With a little encouragement, an open dialogue moves beyond bare facts and into more spiritual considerations. Author Linda Lambert wrote, ""One good conversation can shift the direction of change forever."""
virgo,2017-06-27,"It feels as if you are preparing for something special today but you don't yet know what it is. Although your curiosity builds throughout the day, you're not motivated to aggressively pursue the missing pieces of a puzzle in order to climb the ladder of success. In fact, you're oddly satisfied with your current position, even if it's in an disorganized state of disarray. Chris Brogan wrote, ""The goal isn't more money. The goal is living life on your terms."""
libra,2017-06-27,"Moving up the chain of command may be your top priority now, but your actions won't necessarily reveal your intentions. Instead of being flagrant in your pursuit of advancement, you proceed slowly today, flying beneath the radar. But no one should underestimate your skill at taking advantage of a situation. Perform your job duties as professionally as possible while waiting for your golden opportunity. The secret of success is to be ready to take a calculated risk at the right time -- and not a moment before."
scorpio,2017-06-27,"Your intuition is an unlimited source of your creativity today, but you must quiet your mind in order to tap into the power of your subconscious. Although your muses are standing by eager to help, they won't step out of the shadows without a proper invitation. Asking the spirits to support your work empowers them to engage, but don't expect too much right away. The process may progress slowly at first as you develop your ability to receive the subtle signals from the other side. Poet W.B. Yeats wrote, ""The world is full of magic things, patiently waiting for our senses to grow sharper."""
sagittarius,2017-06-27,"Rather than seeing things as they are today, you see them as they exist in your fantasies -- as unrealized possibilities. But you must use your imagination with care or you won't be able to distinguish the ideal from the real. At the wrong end of the spectrum, you could be delusional like Don Quixote who took up his sword and did battle with windmills. But at the other end, you have a chance to be a real-life wizard who makes dreams come true. Paulo Coelho wrote, ""There is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve: the fear of failure."""
capricorn,2017-06-27,"You're not willing to let go of your idea of success, even if people criticize you for being so unrealistic. You see the naysayers as narrow-minded and don't want their negative outlook influencing your life. Don't worry about creating a detailed action plan yet since the logistics will fall into place just in time. For now, just allow your mind the luxury of freely floating through your visions of a perfect future. Mystic poet William Blake wrote, ""What is now proved was once only imagined."""
aquarius,2017-06-27,"The devil may actually be in the details today, but that won't stop you from delving into the depths and emerging from your Hero's Journey with the light of wisdom. However, spiritual mastery will not occur easily; you must personally meet and overcome your demons before you're allowed to wear your badge of honor. J.R.R. Tolkien wrote, ""Some believe it is only great power that can hold evil in check, but that is not what I've found. It is the small everyday deeds of ordinary folk that keep the darkness at bay."""
pisces,2017-06-27,"You are in your element today, joyfully engaging the beauty of your imagination and the creative power of your mind. You're not as intrigued by the explanation of things now; instead you want to participate directly in the world in order to accumulate experiences. Your psychic sensitivity works in your favor since you're able to see a situation from multiple points of view. Sadhguru teaches, ""You can either live logically or magically; it's your choice."""
aries,2017-06-28,"Someone close to you may say something that hurts your feelings today. Normally, you would share your reaction, talk about it if necessary, and then move on. However, contentious Mercury's current hookup with cranky Mars occurs in self-protective Cancer, making it nearly impossible to clear the air. Unfortunately, your unspoken emotions create a blockage in the normal flow of energy, creating distance in an already strained relationship. Push past your fear and express your truth. Vulnerability is your strength."
taurus,2017-06-28,"An uncomfortable gulf may separate you from someone you love today. However, you can't tell if the distance is shared or only imaginary. Whether or not your feelings of alienation are mutual, your belief is enough to manifest negative symptoms. Thankfully, it doesn't require too much effort to discern the truth of the matter by asking for a reality check. Either way, once your fears are on the table, you can calmly discuss them and figure out what to do next. Sigmund Freud wrote, ""Unexpressed emotions will never die. They are buried alive and will come forth later in uglier ways."""
gemini,2017-06-28,"Your words are supercharged with emotion today. You can whisper your truth and others still might think you are shouting now that aggressive Mars aligns with argumentative Mercury. You have nothing to prove, so don't try to convince anyone of your superiority. Instead of inadvertently pushing people away with your overpowering approach, address your concerns in a caring manner. There's no reason to stake your claim when it's wiser to reveal your vulnerability. Speak softly and carry no sticks."
cancer,2017-06-28,"You can be so angry with someone you love today that you can't even say a word. Your thoughts are running all around and there's no place to jump in and start talking. If asked how you are doing, you might reply that you are well, without giving a hint of your internal turmoil. Ironically, this difference between your inner and outer world may be quite familiar. The longer left untended, the greater the problem. Start untangling your feelings now by asking someone you respect to listen without interfering in your process. You don't need to be right; you only need to be heard."
leo,2017-06-28,"Your emotions are so well hidden today that no one -- including you -- can find a way through your hermetically sealed defenses. At first, you might not even realize how detached you are from your own feelings. However, you can sense uneasy disconnections from others without understanding why they are occurring now. Although your first reaction is to blame someone else for closing down, you would be wiser to look within for the source of the problem. Rick Warren wrote, ""We crave intimacy but fear vulnerability. You can't have one without the other."""
virgo,2017-06-28,"You bring an entire range of analytical tools to the table today as you attempt to understand the shortcomings of a personal relationship. You are highly motivated to figure out where things went awry, but you may be focusing on the wrong issue. Instead of quantifying what isn't working, it's more productive to explore how unrealistic expectations set the stage for failure. Don't hold back now while looking for answers; just be certain that you're asking the right questions."
libra,2017-06-28,"Career issues continue to take up bandwidth in your mind, inspiring you to initiate a conversation about your future prospects at your present job. You might think that your boss or some other authority figure is giving you the runaround today, but they won't likely have the information you seek. Although you want to gather all the relevant facts so you can make the best decisions, only time will tell you what to do. J.P. Morgan said, ""The first step toward getting somewhere is to decide that you are not going to stay where you are."""
scorpio,2017-06-28,"You can see right through someone's grand plan today, even if they think it's solid as granite. Your warning flags fly even higher when idealistic visions, instead of facts, are called upon to justify a decision. You might not be able to logically explain what's wrong with this picture, but your instincts are nearly infallible now. Albert Einstein said, ""The intuitive mind is a sacred gift and the rational mind is a faithful servant. We have created a society that honors the servant and has forgotten the gift."""
sagittarius,2017-06-28,"You're intrigued by the secrets of the ancient teachings and are more than casually curious about how they can enrich your life now. Normally, you're inspired by adventurous exploration, high ideals and philosophical truths. However, you're ready to retire your role as an action-hero so you can begin your new life as a master of unseen dimensions. Oddly enough, there's nothing strange about this new wave of metaphysical interest. It's simply your time to brilliantly integrate the magic of the soul with the mundane world."
capricorn,2017-06-28,"You have little patience for someone's loss of temper today. Thankfully, you're quite capable of handling an emotionally charged verbal attack, even if you find it to be a total waste of energy. Rather than responding to the accusations, you are likely to retreat so you can get on with your work. You have too much on your plate already, and aren't interested in engaging in a power struggle that leads nowhere productive. Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""What I must do is all that concerns me, not what the people think."""
aquarius,2017-06-28,"Cleaning up your own life is a full-time job, so don't bother trying to fix anyone else's now. Although you're tempted to dispense advice, recognizing other people's problems doesn't give you license to interfere in their lives. In fact, focusing on external issues rather than internal ones is a not-so-clever way to avoid your own work. Do not mock a pain that you haven't endured. Science fiction author Robert J. Sawyer wrote, ""Learning to ignore things is one of the great paths to inner peace."""
pisces,2017-06-28,"Your compassionate approach to someone's problem makes you a real friend today. Rather than judging others for their shortcomings, you're willing to accept them for who they are and appreciate the gifts they bring into your life. But you're not a pushover just because of your unflagging support for those you love. You actually ""do unto others as you would have them do unto you."" However, living by the Golden Rule is no simple task; it demands a strength of character which sets a high bar for others to reach."
aries,2017-06-29,"A family squabble lurking in the background may suddenly shift into the foreground today. Although you attempt to remain neutral, it feels like an invisible force is pushing you to add your two cents. However, your involvement can produce unforeseen consequences that might make things worse. Your desire to clear your conscience is not a good enough reason to jump into the drama. Before opening your mouth, reassess the current circumstances and decide whether your disclosure will improve the situation. Sometimes silence says more than words and produces less collateral damage."
taurus,2017-06-29,"Obsessing about a recent encounter with a close friend or relative stirs up unresolved feelings today. However, your concerns might not be motivated by the conversation in question. You may be agitated because you're overly sensitive now to everything in your immediate environment. Although acknowledging your compassion for others is healthy, it's crucial to remember you're not responsible for someone else's emotions. Don't intrude into anyone's personal life unless you are specifically invited. Author Jonathan Lockwood Huie wrote, ""Unsolicited advice is always meddling."""
gemini,2017-06-29,"Thinking on your feet enables you to emerge victorious in an argument today, but only if you're realistic about the message you're trying to convey. Your key planet Mercury engages in a mental war of survival with relentless Pluto now, luring you in over your head. Fortunately, you are clever enough to outwit even the toughest opponent. However, there's no place for blind optimism. Pay careful attention to everything that is said before making your case as succinctly as you can. Speak less; say more."
cancer,2017-06-29,"You don't appreciate it when people take advantage of your loving nature. Unfortunately, someone might be pressuring you to support their cause as domineering Pluto opposes Mercury in your reclusive sign. However, the more you are pushed, the more you resist any effort to manipulate your behavior. Your first inclination is to walk away from conflict, but it's smarter to get everything out into the open today. Break through your resistance because nothing will be said if you wait for others to stand up for you. You are the only person who can change your life."
leo,2017-06-29,"You may resent anyone who stands between you and the possibility of pleasure today. Nevertheless, you still want to be fair-minded and balance your desires with what someone else wants, even if you've already run out of patience. Ironically, keeping your negative feelings out of the conversation only strengthens them. Instead, state your complaints openly so your anger can be seen for what it is. Psychologist Carl Jung wrote, ""Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate."""
virgo,2017-06-29,"Your current need to express your feelings may be temporarily subsumed by the group process today. Passionate Pluto opposes messenger Mercury in your 11th House of Social Networks, connecting you with your peers on a heart-to-heart basis. It's wise to go out on a limb now, share your perspective and assume responsibility for your own emotions. No one can find fault with you for speaking your truth as long as you don't blame anyone else. Zig Ziglar said, ""Life is an echo; what you send out comes back."""
libra,2017-06-29,"You are a champion of keeping your feelings to yourself in order to maintain the peace in your social group. However, someone may go out of the way to push your buttons today, as if they were trying to provoke you to lose your temper. Naturally, it would be wiser to follow a cool rational path now, but you are triggered to set the record straight by your overriding need for fair play. Nevertheless, a touch of diplomacy allows you to be honest without blasting all your opinions out into the open all at once. In a world where you can be anything, be kind."
scorpio,2017-06-29,"Your tone seems more confrontational to others today than you actually intend. Your key planet Pluto is engaged in a passionate tug-of-war with mischievous Mercury, triggering critical words that casually pass through your lips without even a conscious thought. The unforeseen consequences of your radical honesty could generate a dark cloud of complex feelings. Fortunately, stress can be minimized if you simply stop and consider other people's reactions before you speak. Put yourself in someone else's shoes before you step on their feet."
sagittarius,2017-06-29,"You might feel like you're playing a game of Beat the Clock and you're worried that you could lose your chance to share your point of view if you don't start the conversation immediately. Although you're anxious to get your message across, you don't want anyone to see how worried you are now. Nevertheless, you must show your cards if you're going to play your hand. Drop the false pretenses and express your concerns. Psychologist Brene Brown wrote, ""Vulnerability sounds like truth and feels like courage. Truth and courage aren't always comfortable, but they are never weakness."""
capricorn,2017-06-29,"Stressing about someone close to you could get in the way of your productivity today. Whether or not a relationship with a friend or partner has a viable future, pretending that everything is copacetic is not a smart strategy now. Withdrawing from social interactions while you're considering all your options is as sound a plan as any. Although letting go might be painful, hanging on to the past is even worse. Fortunately, you can always reconnect with those you love once you feel more like yourself. Change is inevitable, but growth is a conscious choice."
aquarius,2017-06-29,"If you think you're on the receiving end of a short stick now, it's wise to reevaluate your position, state your needs and remain open to negotiation. Unfortunately, your ability to remain cool in the heat of engagement seems to have abandoned you, challenging you to detach from the current web of entangled passions. Sometimes it's enough to remember that you are a human being with feelings just like everyone else. Expressing what's in your heart doesn't always lead to happiness, but it does inspire personal evolution if you're willing to hang with the process of emotional metamorphosis."
pisces,2017-06-29,"Although you may go about your business quietly today, your frustration could increase until it reaches a breaking point. Your primary complaint stems from your belief that people aren't being honest in their dealings with you. You want to hear the truth rather than wasting energy attempting to find the missing pieces of the puzzle. Unfortunately, the more questions you ask, the more others withdraw. Observe your own feelings without pushing for resolution. Osho taught, ""Don't seek, don't search, don't ask, don't knock, don't demand -- relax."""
aries,2017-06-30,"You're not sure whether to laugh or cry. On one hand, you feel a great sense of relief when the Moon slips into gracious Libra. You thoroughly enjoy the opportunity to collaborate with others, even allowing them to take the reins of leadership for a while. On the other hand, everyone seems unable to make even the simplest choices. Your nerves wear thin as you wait for someone else to decide something that you could have done immediately. Saint Francis de Sales wrote, ""Have patience with all things, but first of all with yourself."""
taurus,2017-06-30,"Your balanced approach at work enables you to objectively assess all the tasks on your plate today, and then judiciously prioritize them. You avoid playing favorites; each job is judged on the same criteria. However, it turns out that your agenda may be more stable than your immediate environment. You might be required to revisit your decision-making process several times throughout the day as circumstances evolve. The flexible shall inherit the Earth."
gemini,2017-06-30,"You are downloading radical concepts from the far reaches of the cosmos today. Your ideas are so strange that they might as well be coming from alien spaceships. Regardless of their origin, your plans attract widespread support now, partly because people admire your originality. Nevertheless, at some point the energy shifts and you will be judged solely on your performance. All the clever thoughts in the world are not a substitute for a program that actually works."
cancer,2017-06-30,"Balancing your social inclinations with your need to be alone requires a tricky set of moves today. Normally, you can't have it both ways but playing two sides of a coin seems like the sensible thing to do now. Nevertheless, the complexity of finding a stable place you can call home is a daunting prospect. Once your foundation is in place, it's just a matter of determinedly working toward your goals, no matter the obstacles you encounter along the way. Gordon Hinckley wrote, ""Without hard work nothing grows but weeds."""
leo,2017-06-30,"You don't want to waste any energy today, but you may end up losing efficiency anyhow. Your desire to please everyone ultimately leads you to pleasing no one at all. Ironically, setting new priorities based on fulfilling your own needs leaves more people satisfied than you might expect. Fortunately, there is no reason to explain your decision-making process since you can proudly let your day-to-day productivity be its own justification. The distance between your dreams and reality is called action."
virgo,2017-06-30,"You might seem a bit ungrounded today, but some of your cosmic drifting is by choice. You can see the benefits of exploring the distant reaches of your inner cosmos now as you continue to learn about the power of the mind. But your metaphysical interests are not about walking around with your head in the clouds. Instead you are like Prometheus, reaching into the divine proportion and stealing lightning from the gods. You have a purpose and a plan. People should either help you along or step out of your way."
libra,2017-06-30,"It's hard to know exactly when or where your fair-minded thinking turns into ambivalence. You Libras are infamous for avoiding decisions, but you're not necessarily searching for greener pastures. In fact, you will attempt to take the more conservative path now, because there's safety in returning to old familiar stomping grounds. People rely on your objectivity; you are not only a mouthpiece for many, you are a treasure."
scorpio,2017-06-30,"You're not sure which side of the veil is more real today. Unfortunately, there is no easy way to explore the wide spectrum of personal experiences and political shenanigans that clutter the airwaves now. Fantasies continue to run on their own batteries which don't appear to lose power, while the demands of your earthly responsibilities prevent you from wandering too far off course. Watch the distant horizons for signs. Keep an open mind as you consider all the ways you can move into the future. Endless possibilities exist just beyond your belief system."
sagittarius,2017-06-30,"You could blow people's minds when you tell them about your pet project today. However, they may stare at you in amazement while you share your plans. It's nearly impossible for you to discern if others are in shock or if they believe you're delusional. But it's not your job to be a tour guide, revisiting recently traveled ground. Regardless of your politics, you are energetically progressive now, looking forward to the future rather than gazing in the rearview mirror at the past. Focus on what you can change rather than on what is broken."
capricorn,2017-06-30,"Relationships continue to play a key role in your life, but you might feel a bit discouraged today if everything isn't matching your high expectations. Although you've spent many hours lost in conversation with your friend or partner, you're still untangling the messiest parts of your romantic entanglements. At some point, you need to call it quits. Neither one of you are at fault; it's just that the answers are not going to materialize overnight. Paradoxically, resolution occurs when you stop thinking there's a problem. Sleep on it and see how you both feel in the morning."
aquarius,2017-06-30,"Talking about everything you're going to do at work actually gets in the way of you doing it. Nevertheless, you have high hopes and plan to accomplish a lot today. But everything takes longer than you expect, leaving you short on time. Working harder now won't earn you the results you seek. Step back from your commitments, reevaluate your recent plans, and reassess the steps you must take to reach your goals. A fresh perspective might be all that is needed to rattle your cage and free up your calendar. Words are meaningless without intent and determination."
pisces,2017-06-30,"You are being tested today to see how well you can straddle two worlds. On one hand, your imagination calls, asking you to leave your mundane responsibilities behind and step into a magical world where time and space lose meaning. You are like a willing Alice, eyes wide open in Wonderland. But on the other hand, your three-dimensional obligations peck at you like a hungry bird, trying to persuade you to reenter the black and white mundane realm of car maintenance, rent checks and grocery shopping. Nevertheless, walking with one foot here and one foot there is a metaphysical trick you mastered long ago."
aries,2017-07-01,"You may be annoyed with someone close to you who won't say exactly what's on his or her mind. You know there's more to the story and would prefer unspoken grievances to be out in the open. Nevertheless, the more you push, the more others retreat. Change your strategy completely by shifting your focus to something else. When people realize that you have backed off, they might surprise you with what you wanted all along. William Shakespeare wrote, ""Expectation is the root of all heartache."""
taurus,2017-07-01,"You're willing to cooperate with others today, but only to a certain point. Although you carefully state your preferences and draw your boundaries,  people still might want to push you further than you're willing to go. Unfortunately, your frustration can get in the way of a pleasant day, especially if you give in to someone else's wishes just to maintain the peace. It may be better in the long run to spend some time alone so you don't negotiate away your self-esteem. Remember, even the nicest people have their limits."
gemini,2017-07-01,"It's tempting to feel one thing yet say something else today, especially if you're attempting to sidestep an unnecessary disagreement. Nevertheless, some differences are best resolved by talking about them before they grow into an irresolvable situation. Your feelings will not dissipate by pretending that everything is okay; in fact, a tiny molehill can quickly morph into a substantial mountain now if you slip into denial. When you keep it real with others, you have no choice but to keep it real with yourself."
cancer,2017-07-01,"It seems as if people disagree with you today no matter what you say, leaving you to consider a strategy based on non-communication. You're not in the mood to share your feelings with anyone because you don't want to waste time and energy defending your motives. However, keeping your plans to yourself enables everyone else to make assumptions without basing them on reality. Reveal personal information on a need-to-know basis. Although words have consequences, so does silence."
leo,2017-07-01,"Your ambivalence about today's activities might be enough to drive everyone around you bonkers. Even if no one agrees with you, they just want you to commit to one plan or another. However, you might not have a preference because you can see the pros and cons to each option. Succumbing to emotional pressure might create more tension than you can stand. Don't make a decision until you feel it in your heart. Novelist Emily Giffin wrote, ""You can only control your own actions, not other people's reactions."""
virgo,2017-07-01,"You might spend an inordinate amount of time lost in your thoughts today as you try to determine your best move. Unfortunately, you may lose your opportunity to influence the dynamics of a current relationship if you wait too long to speak your truth. Logical thinking is usually one of your greatest strengths, but it could be a real obstacle to your happiness now. Set your rationalizations aside and just act from your gut. Author Charles Kingsley wrote, ""Feelings are like chemicals, the more you analyze them, the worse they smell."""
libra,2017-07-01,"Sometimes an argument escalates when someone tries to force a resolution to a complex issue. Like the mythical many-headed Hydra, each answer creates two new problems. You might be caught in the middle of a powerful difference of opinion today, and you can't untangle yourself from the melodrama. But your current determination to find the right solution to a serious conflict might only lead to resentment. Turning the other cheek is preferable to fighting for a lost cause. Letting go creates the space for something better."
scorpio,2017-07-01,"You could take a strong position on a heartfelt matter today, prompting everyone to agree or disagree with you. Ironically, you're much more flexible in your thinking now than you sound. Your false bravado may be part of a clever strategy to hide your lack of clarity. Unfortunately, your attempts at misdirection might backfire when you can't muster up the passion to defend your opinions. It's never wise to trifle with someone's feelings just because you're unsure of yours. Believe it or not, vulnerability is your friend."
sagittarius,2017-07-01,"You see several different paths that could lead you into very different futures now, and you're unsure which version you like the best. Of course, people who are close to you have their own ideas and they're not hesitant to share them with you. But you might not like what you hear today, motivating you to dream about your future as you envision it, even if you feel unsupported by your friends and family. Goethe wrote, ""Courage is the commitment to begin without any guarantee of success."""
capricorn,2017-07-01,"You don't understand why people look to you for answers and then reject the truth you offer. It's as if someone is trying to set you up today, but you can see through their games. However, you're treading on dangerous ground now, because it's nearly impossible to tell what's originating from others and what's actually coming from within. Your inner and outer worlds may be mirroring one another, confusing your perspective of reality. Keep your options open as long as you can without taking responsibility for anyone else's unresolved dilemmas. Make no promises until your clarity returns."
aquarius,2017-07-01,"Although you may be entertaining a variety of possible adventures ahead, your current obligations prevent you from hitting the road today.  In fact, there could be unspoken assumptions about your involvement in caring for someone in need. It's probably too soon to bring this delicate discussion out into the open, but it's prudent to prepare your talking points while there's still time. Actor Sean Hampton said, ""Victory is the child of preparation and determination."""
pisces,2017-07-01,"You possess the ability to sink far deeper into emotional depths than others today and you're not afraid to wear a badge of honor upon your return. You want everyone to be aware of your courage while you make the most of your willingness to face your fears and limitations. However, your little journey into the underworld might not progress according to your expectations, prompting you to worry about the wisdom of your choices. Nevertheless, once started, you cannot retrace your steps. Remember, if nothing ever changed, there would be no butterflies."
aries,2017-07-02,"You may feel as if you have no choice but to stand up to anyone who tries to limit your freedom. Needless to say, you're not happy because the situation seems hopeless today. Ironically, you might not realize the strength of your position and you could inadvertently ride roughshod over someone's feelings. Remember, you will gain more ground now if you don't push back so vehemently. Use soft words and hard arguments."
taurus,2017-07-02,"Your intention to fulfill your promises is like an unbreakable oath, motivating you to follow through with every commitment you make. Unfortunately, unexpected events require you to change your schedule at the last minute. Complicating matters further, others seem to treat their words with less integrity than you. You may be tempted to add to the melodrama today by expressing your anger with those who fall short of their obligations. Act with compassion and lead by example now; complete as much of your work as possible and save your judgments for another day."
gemini,2017-07-02,"Your logic might not guide you in the right direction today unless you also take your heart into consideration, too. However, your feelings and your thoughts aren’t likely to support one another now. Although you may try to fit your desires into socially acceptable terms, you could also grow frustrated if you bury your passion. Reassess all the ramifications of your actions prior to following an impulsive idea. Fools rush in where angels fear to tread."
cancer,2017-07-02,"You could lose your temper if someone says they will do something today, and then turns around and does the complete opposite. Your tendency is to hide your disappointment because you don't trust how people will respond to your strong feelings. Unfortunately, withholding your emotions still sends mixed messages that further complicate your existence. Recognize the impermanence of a temporary situation. As Beatles George Harrison wrote, ""All things must pass. All things must fade away."""
leo,2017-07-02,"You quickly grow bored of an emotional drama that's back in your life, but something is different because the crisis has passed its peak now. Fortunately, you're feeling strong enough to handle nearly anything that might come up today. However, you need to be fully engaged to combat any perceived threat or it could reappear again with greater intensity. Responding to events with an open heart, rather than with contracted animosity, helps everything return to normal as quickly as possible. Thich Nhat Hanh said, ""Life is available only in the present moment."""
virgo,2017-07-02,"You normally take the calculated path, but you may be surprised by how fast you react to a complex situation today. You prefer to gather more facts before swinging into action. But there isn't sufficient time to adhere to such a sensible approach now, so you must process all the variables and move on to what's next. He who hesitates is lost; any form of delay worsens your chances of reaching your goals. Spontaneity is your friend."
libra,2017-07-02,"A family feud lingers on your mind today, possibly preventing you from doing what you want. Or, just when you think you have a handle on the situation, someone enters the scene and turns everything inside out all over again. Although losing your temper is understandable now, it won't settle the atmospheric tension. Fortunately, taking tiny steps toward common ground helps to untangle everyone's feelings. Small progress is still progress."
scorpio,2017-07-02,"You wish you could sneak in a bit of alone time, but an emotional retreat may not fit on your calendar today. Nevertheless, you're determined to stay on course by pushing forward on your goals. Although you might believe that it's more important than ever to stick to your plan, you also know that flexibility is your secret weapon. Winning an argument carries a cost that's too dear; creating a strategy based on mutual compromise cultivates peace and harmony."
sagittarius,2017-07-02,"You want something so badly today that you'll do nearly anything to get it. Unfortunately, you might expect a friend or partner to ride to your rescue with sufficient funds to save you from your current predicament. However, the outcome is very different when no one comes to your aid. Don't waste your energy on anger; try a completely different plan of action, instead. Let go of what you can't control; make room for happiness by disconnecting from the objects you crave the most."
capricorn,2017-07-02,"You are absolutely committed to reach your goals today, but you must pay attention to the feelings of others, too. However, powerful emotions cause damage when they are dredged to the surface. Unfortunately, your relentless drive for success may inadvertently create more problems than solutions now. Happily, you can scale back your activities without jeopardizing the big picture. Actor Scott Caan said, ""Good things happen when you get your priorities straight."""
aquarius,2017-07-02,"Crossing items off your to-do list occupies most of your time today. Fortunately, you currently experience a strange sense of satisfaction by finishing one chore after another. Oddly enough, you may be ambivalent about your plans. Your commitment-phobic behavior might make others think you don't care, but that's far from your thoughts now. The truth is that you're so motivated by your quest for excellence that you want to give one hundred percent. There's no hurry to make your move as long as you stay true to yourself."
pisces,2017-07-02,"You have one-too-many tasks to complete and, thankfully, you like the thought of being busy today. However, your best-case scenario does not include working tediously all day, prompting you to plan a secret escape. Unfortunately, you could find yourself embroiled in an argument with someone if you think you're being coerced into an activity you want to skip. There's no point in acquiescing and playing the part of a martyr. Stand up and take full responsibility for your priorities. If you don't put your needs first, who will?"
aries,2017-07-03,"It may appear as if your plans are falling apart, but nothing is quite as it seems today. Although your first impulse might be to jump in and try to sew up every little thread that starts to unravel, you'll only work yourself into a state of frustration. Instead, acknowledge that you can't just wave your magic wand now and make everything okay. Choosing your battles carefully means that some conflicts must be left behind. If you fight them all, you'll be too tired to win the war."
taurus,2017-07-03,"You're able to hold your course in the face of unrelenting pressure to change your destination. But fending off people who might slow you down is not the real problem. Unfortunately, an inkling of self-doubt could grow into your nemesis as the day wears on. However, shifting your reaction from cerebral to emotional changes everything in a moment. Giving up control of some activities empowers you to gain control elsewhere. ""Less is more"" is not just a cliché to make you feel better; it's the truth."
gemini,2017-07-03,"You might aim all your pent-up aggression at one person today, but chances are it will be for naught. Instead of finding a scapegoat on which to pin blame, accept your role in the interpersonal dynamics that continue to stir up discomfort. However, you will benefit the most, not by speaking truth to power, but by following through when it comes to your integrity. Letting your emotions get the best of you can bring out the worst in you. Respect is a two-way street."
cancer,2017-07-03,"Although sharing your fantasies takes courage, it also requires a methodical approach today. Your feelings are running deeper now, so just blurting your truth at the first opportunity might seem out of context to others. Don't just jump directly to the punchline; tell your story from the beginning so everyone can follow along. Often, the fastest route isn't the best one when it comes to delivering your message. Consider your audience before opening your mouth."
leo,2017-07-03,"Holding onto your feelings won't further your cause today, even if it seems safer to keep them out of sight. You might be less vulnerable when you're emotionally isolated, but there's too severe of a cost. Don't worry about micromanaging; if a conversation veers off course, let it. Paradoxically, the less control you maintain, the better the outcome -- even if there are a few twists and turns along the way. The best rewards come when you're not expecting any at all."
virgo,2017-07-03,"You are receiving messages from the cosmos that remind you to stay focused while letting the distractions grab someone else. People might even overtly try to get you to join the party while you reassess the advantages of resisting any social activities. Although others probably mean well, you simply have too much on your plate today to seek additional forms of self-expression. Do what you Virgos do best: set priorities and pursue them with unwavering determination."
libra,2017-07-03,"You desperately want everything to make sense today, but it doesn't. Just as all the separate pieces of information start to fall into place, you suddenly realize that your basic assumption is wrong. Truth slips out of your hands before you can firmly grasp it. It's as if reality is playing games with you by eluding your logic and testing your resolve. Paradoxically, it's easier to make a decision when you don't try to rationalize your choice. Trust your gut now; it knows what your head hasn't figured out yet."
scorpio,2017-07-03,"Appearances, including yours, aren't always something you can control. Much to your chagrin, everyone seems to know all about the very same things you wish to keep secret today. The Moon is visiting your passionate sign, reflecting your feelings through your attitude, regardless of what you say or do. Stop resisting the obvious and open your heart. Buddha said, ""Three things cannot be long hidden: the Sun, the Moon, and the Truth."""
sagittarius,2017-07-03,"Of course, you know the difference between vivid fantasies and mundane realities. However, a deeper and more existential sense of self-doubt may be lurking beneath the surface now. Your uncertainty is not apparent to others but could stand between you and a magical moment. Unfortunately, your lack of confidence makes it tough to get over this little bump in the road. Just take a few steps back to regroup and try again. No matter what, do something today that will inch you closer to a better tomorrow."
capricorn,2017-07-03,"You can tell that something is off today, as if you're not living up to someone's expectations. Unfortunately, you don't know what others want from you today, and when asked they have nothing relevant to say. This weird energy makes it nearly impossible to go off on your own while your coworkers languish in denial. Share your concerns with your peers since you're all in this together. Although it takes a village, there are no observers; everyone is a participant."
aquarius,2017-07-03,"Although there are discussions yet to happen at work, everything seems to be rapidly moving along on the right trajectory now. You don't need to tell anyone about your long-range plans yet; they are your business and no one else's concern. In the meantime, step up to the plate and fiercely wield your power. It's not your problem if your behavior makes someone uncomfortable today. Continue striving for excellence; success is yours for the taking."
pisces,2017-07-03,"People might assume you are more easygoing than you actually feel today. The Moon in fellow water sign Scorpio emphasizes the intensity of your emotions, but her Grand Trine softens your presentation. Nevertheless, you're not one to back down from any sort of idle threat. But rather than waiting to go on the defense, be clear about your boundaries right from the start. The more clarity there is about your preferences now, the better it is for everyone involved."
aries,2017-07-04,"Giving someone the silent treatment won't solve any long-term disagreements, but it may lessen the pressure for a while. Your feelings are stewing beneath the surface and it's finally time to reveal your truth. You might have a lot to say, especially if your caution was running the show until now. Nevertheless, you're motivated to leave your past behind and throw your fortune to the wind. Stick to your message instead of adding complexity to the current situation. Sharing your perspective enables everyone to move forward without negative karma. Honesty is the best policy."
taurus,2017-07-04,"You wish everyone would bury their differences and simply support your plans for the day. However, compromising is a challenge when there is an air of stubbornness setting the tone. Oddly enough, your self-image may be distorted enough that your irritating behavior outshines your gracious actions. Nevertheless, you still have an opportunity to exert a positive influence on your friends and family. Taking the high road requires courage but the potential rewards make it worthwhile."
gemini,2017-07-04,"You might worry about being stuck with people who don't understand your need for excitement. In fact, you're already analyzing multiple escape routes to use if necessary. But you're unlikely to initiate direct confrontation, unless you can do it in the spirit of playful banter. Unfortunately, unspoken issues may overpower your lighthearted intentions now, so explore strategies that exercise your self-restraint. Luckily, your positivity becomes more contagious if you listen as well as talk. A heartfelt discussion clears the air by giving everyone the chance to speak their truth."
cancer,2017-07-04,"A fresh wave of optimism fuels your self-confidence and subdues your insecurities. But proceeding with caution is wise while the presence of three planets in hypersensitive Cancer triggers emotional turmoil, especially if you end up revealing more than you intended. It doesn't hurt to think twice before sharing your story. However, your discretion could easily turn to resentment if you remain quiet. Don't settle on an extreme reaction when a middle path exists comfortably between total transparency and paranoid secrecy. All your relationships will benefit from a healthy sense of fair play."
leo,2017-07-04,"Your intellectual curiosity may be too obsessive for your own good today. You could annoy people by interrupting them before they complete a thought. They might assume you're just hungry for attention and aren't willing to share the spotlight. Nevertheless, your behavior is actually a matter of expediency now. Happily, giving others an opportunity to shine ultimately improves your chances of getting the answers you want. Marcel Proust wrote, ""The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new lands but seeing with new eyes."""
virgo,2017-07-04,"Your goals are so altruistic now that you begin to wonder if you're actually fooling yourself. Striving to positively impact the world is admirable, but growing resentful because your personal life is neglected is not a path to happiness. Don't wait to initiate action until your good intentions turn sour. Balancing your spiritual pursuits with more practical needs sounds like a smart idea, but it may be an elusive goal. When service to others is moderated by a touch of common sense, there's no limit to what you can accomplish."
libra,2017-07-04,"Everyone seems to be getting along today, but you feel left out of the fun. It's annoying to watch people playing around and you might grow cranky when you assume they are letting you down now. However, you won't likely get what you want by blowing your top. An alternative strategy is to work off your pent-up tension by buzzing around like a bee in a garden. Thankfully, putting integrity back in your relationships only requires a decision on your part to change your attitude. There's no reason to be a victim of your worries if you choose love over fear."
scorpio,2017-07-04,"You're looking ahead toward the next chapter of your life and reviewing all your options before making any final decisions. However, you still have a few reservations about how you can pull off such an ambitious undertaking. You want to enlist your friends as trustworthy advisors but you're not ready to share your plans yet. Fortunately, you can play both ends of the spectrum today by having faith in the process while also redefining your goals. Honor your intuition, even if it tells you to wait. In the meantime, clearly inform the universe of your intentions and believe in the power of manifestation."
sagittarius,2017-07-04,"Your mind is running so fast today that you can't even keep up with your own grandiose visions about an upcoming adventure. You might not finish your current thought before you're skipping off to the next one. People may criticize your sloppy thinking now, but responding in anger would be a big mistake. Rather than defending your ideas, use the feedback to help you sharpen your plans. Rolling with the incoming waves is almost always a smarter move than fighting against them."
capricorn,2017-07-04,"You possess important information that you want to share, but the positive effects of what you say might be lost if you don't know when to stop. You could be irritated with someone today, but you don't want to hurt his or her feelings just for the sake of revenge. Be as fair as possible and speak directly from your heart; your head will only lead you into more complicated entanglements. A compassionate approach certainly increases your chances for finding a peaceful resolution. Mark Twain wrote, ""Kindness is a language that the deaf can hear and the blind can see."""
aquarius,2017-07-04,"You might find yourself caught up trying to balance your inner needs with the outer circumstances today. People may encourage you to take a risk only because they believe in you. But don't act impulsively since expressing your unrestrained emotions while you're in a panic only creates chaos. Instead of reacting in the moment now, place additional time between external stimuli and your responses. A quick dash to the finish line sounds impressive, but you're more likely to be a winner if you set a sustainable pace."
pisces,2017-07-04,"A sudden switch of plans could turn your world upside down today. If you're uncertain of your future, acknowledge your role -- instead of denying it -- in the present circumstances. Keep in mind that nothing happens to you; reality is co-created with your assistance. Although you might feel overwhelmed now, don't retreat too quickly. Keep the faith; you possess the ability to shift nearly any odds in your favor. Eckhart Tolle wrote, ""Awareness is the greatest agent for change."""
aries,2017-07-05,"You're riding an intense wave of certainty that encourages you to expend excessive amounts of energy achieving your relationship goals. Unfortunately, you may bury negative feelings today, and slip into denial in order to avoid questioning your actions. Don't worry about what might happen if others aren't happy with your intentions. There's little to be gained by attaching rational thoughts to irrational desires. In fact, there's no reason to further complicate the dynamics with unnecessary expectations. When it comes to matters of the heart, don't second-guess your internal wisdom."
taurus,2017-07-05,"You're more comfortable today when interacting with others. Fortunately, previous resistance to group activities settles into the background, enabling you to be totally committed to a team effort. However, your participation with coworkers need not prevent you from tackling your own creative project now. The simple act of undertaking something for your personal enjoyment could unlock other more practical possibilities to pursue. Author Robert Holder writes, ""Your relationship with yourself sets the tone for every other relationship you have."""
gemini,2017-07-05,"You're more concerned with reaching your long-term goals now than completing a job that's currently on your plate. You grow more excited as you stand at the edge of your future and ponder the infinite possibilities. Although you must connect what's unfolding in the present moment with your larger purpose in life, there comes a time when action replaces thoughts. You have ruminated on everything long enough. Taking a risk is not as risky as you think now; make your dreams come true before they start to fade away."
cancer,2017-07-05,"You can tell there are big changes coming, even if everything seems copasetic today. It feels like a big storm is brewing and you're not buying into the sunny weather forecast. Nevertheless, it's crucial to stay calm as pockets of political and emotional turbulence approach. Fortunately, addressing your fears helps to alleviate your concerned anticipation. Engaging in a heart-to-heart conversation with a trusted friend softens your worries now and offers the support you need. Think globally; act locally."
leo,2017-07-05,"You feel as if the sky is the limit but you might be worried that your chance to make something happen will quickly vanish into thin air. Although inaction works against you now, there's probably more time than you think, since logical Mercury camps out in your sign for the next three weeks. There's no need to panic today, but the days will continue to race by faster than you expect. Finalize your plans as soon as possible and put them into motion. British novelist Margaret Drabble wrote, ""When nothing is sure, everything is possible."""
virgo,2017-07-05,"Making a plan is complicated when your immediate responsibilities conflict with your personal aspirations. You have plenty of work to do now, and concentrating on your current tasks should free you up to respond to a whole new set of circumstances. Create clarity in your immediate environment before trying to influence your entire life. Limiting your focus enables you to stick to your agenda today. Nevertheless, allow time to consider what's most important to your heart. Once your priorities are in order, the details will easily fall into place."
libra,2017-07-05,"An approaching deadline might have you fretting today, whether it's your own wish to finish a project or a target imposed by external circumstances. Whatever the cause, you must concentrate your efforts to stay on track by applying your talents to the tasks right in front of you. There's no payoff to worrying about the distant future now; concentrating on the present moment gives you a better return on your investment. Martin Luther wrote, ""How soon 'not now' becomes 'never'."""
scorpio,2017-07-05,"You want your actions to reflect your hopes and wishes, yet you're not interested in idle fantasy. But you're unwilling to let go of things that matter to your soul in order to make it through another day in the mundane world. Fortunately, you know that your dreams are constantly co-creating your future and you don't want to waste your time on unrealistic desires that will never be fulfilled. However, putting too much belief into your assumptions is counterproductive because the limitations you face are ultimately the ones you place on yourself."
sagittarius,2017-07-05,"Keeping your feet on the ground can be a bit of a struggle today as your thoughts and feelings lure you into uncharted realms of possibility. Nevertheless, you must balance your personal agenda with the expectations of those around you. Although you want to make your life more meaningful, you can't just ignore the commitments you already made. Still, there's no reason to be satisfied with the status quo. Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf wrote, ""The size of your dreams must always exceed your current capacity to achieve them. If your dreams don't scare you, they aren't big enough."""
capricorn,2017-07-05,"Your brain is abuzz with far-fetched ideas today, making it difficult to focus on the work at hand. But don't just shut off the distractions to prevent the boat from rocking. In fact, you could learn something very important about yourself if you stay open to your dreams, as long as you don't confuse them with reality. Even if you're lured off course, it's more magical when you take the scenic tour now rather than following the regular path. Charles de Gaulle said, ""Greatness is a road leading toward the unknown."""
aquarius,2017-07-05,"Although you’re not one to engage in social games just to gain favors, you might be willing to make compromises now to earn the support of others. In fact, someone may play a significant role in your progress today, even if you’re working on a project by yourself. Changing your attitude changes the outcome; rather than expressing your annoyance when people stick their noses in your business, show your gratitude. Mark Twain quipped, “An open mind leaves a chance for someone to drop a worthwhile thought in it.”"
pisces,2017-07-05,"People might think that you’re going too far, but you’re convinced that your actions are justifiable. Your coworkers’ concerns might reveal more about their insecurities than anything to do with your behavior. Nevertheless, you’re strongly influenced by your key planets Jupiter and Neptune, both encouraging you to place more stock in your dreams than in the real world. Avoid responding to others defensively; instead, use their feedback as a catalyst to improve your overall performance. Taking your game to the next level is the most convincing way to show your commitment to excellence."
aries,2017-07-06,"Like the mythical Icarus, you could fly too close to the Sun only to have your wings melt, plunging you into the sea. But knowing your fate might not be enough to prevent it from happening as the aristocratic Sagittarius Moon tricks you into believing you’re above the rules. Nevertheless, you must answer to the laws of karma during Luna’s conjunction with authoritative Saturn. Respecting sensible limits now is your fastest way to achieve success."
taurus,2017-07-06,"You typically don’t like being pressured to step beyond your comfort zone until you are good and ready. Unfortunately, you could become irritated today when someone pressures you to join in a complicated venture that requires you to alter your plans for the days ahead. Don’t just acquiesce in order to avoid a confrontation. In fact, establishing clear boundaries now prevents disappointment down the road. Abraham Lincoln wrote, “Let no feeling of discouragement prey upon you and in the end, you are sure to succeed.”"
gemini,2017-07-06,"It seems like a thrill a minute when others enter your sphere of acquaintances to introduce you to another fascinating opportunity. However, the possibilities could be overwhelming because new offers are put on the table before you can evaluate the previous one. Naturally, you like the thought of doing something different, but you might need to narrow the field of options before making a decision about your future. Eliminate the extraneous, establish the facts and execute the best course of action. Zig Ziglar said, “Don’t count the things you do; do the things that count.”"
cancer,2017-07-06,"You might harbor regrets about something you recently did, especially if you didn’t heed the common-sense advice you received. It’s possible that you had an excellent idea and simply took it too far. Fortunately, there’s still time to compensate for overplaying your hand, but you need to act quickly. There’s no shame in retreating in order to consolidate your position today. However, if you continue to ignore an imbalance of your making, you will suffer the consequences soon enough. People who create their own drama are subject to their own karma."
leo,2017-07-06,"You’re standing on your soapbox today, shouting about a topic of extreme importance to anyone who will listen. The problem is the information you’re sharing may not be as accurate as you think. Unfortunately, it’s nearly impossible to see how you are distorting the facts to favor your previously drawn conclusions. You can consciously open your mind and let the truth in or you can wait for the wake-up call from reality. Remember, action always beats intention."
virgo,2017-07-06,"It’s as if the communication door is closing and you’re worried that you missed your chance to let others know what’s been bothering you. Although you may believe you still have time, you must initiate a conversation immediately. Nevertheless, participating in an open discussion about a sensitive subject feels like an uphill battle today and you grow weary just thinking about it. Don’t take the easy way out now because it will only get even harder later. Nothing is worse than missing an opportunity that could change your life for the better. Ruth Gordon said, “Courage is like a muscle; it is strengthened by use.”"
libra,2017-07-06,"You might have a plan to take control of an awkward situation at work today, but you don’t want others to know you’re manipulating the situation. Your easygoing approach encourages people to lower their defenses. Your strategy is to sell your idea in such a low-key manner that your coworkers step into executive roles without knowing that you’re pulling the strings. Of course, sharing the helm while steering the ship is a clever idea, but you don’t need to resort to trickery to motivate your peers. Author Ken Blanchard wrote, “The key to successful leadership is influence, not authority.”"
scorpio,2017-07-06,"Your vision of the future is much more detailed than anyone realizes, but you’re probably not ready to reveal it to the world yet. Unfortunately, you might appear like you don’t know what you’re talking about today unless you’re prepared to drill down and discuss specifics. Thankfully, your self-restraint is legendary, but only when you are confident that your agenda is the right one. However, you could hold your tongue too long and miss your chance for recognition. Shakespeare wrote, “Better three hours too soon than a minute too late.”"
sagittarius,2017-07-06,"Your exuberance is powerful enough that your friends and associates watch you in awe, unsure of how to keep up with you. However, they might also wonder how to slow you down so you don’t overshoot your target or burn out before you reach your goal today. Fortunately, you can monitor your own behavior more effectively than anyone else. Taking time to consider all the consequences of your actions enables you to modify your runaway optimism before it becomes a liability. Master self-control and then you can master anything."
capricorn,2017-07-06,"You’re a champion of working within the constraints of a particular situation. Nevertheless, you may be suffering from the fallout of pushing back against an unfair rule or an unsympathetic authority figure. However, acting in a self-righteous manner will only make matters worse. Cooling your jets for a while is your best strategy now. You can pick up your cause more successfully once the interpersonal dynamics settle back down. Saint Augustine wrote, “Patience is the companion of wisdom.”"
aquarius,2017-07-06,"You may look to your network of friends and coworkers as your main source of inspiration today. In fact, you could be so moved by someone’s words or actions that you pick up on their enthusiasm and take it to the next level. However, you might add so much to a promising idea that it loses focus. Resist the urge to go off by yourself; instead, stay in contact with those who first planted the seed in your mind. Keep them as close advisors, for they won’t let you wander too far off course. Bill Gates said, “We all need people who will give us feedback. That’s how we improve.”"
pisces,2017-07-06,"Your pragmatic approach to managing a project at work might surprise others today, since you’re often the one with the most colorful visions. Actually, your current sense of practicality allows you to turn a recent dream into a concrete action plan. Your reasoning is sound enough that your coworkers are willing to set aside their agendas in order to be a part of yours. But don’t push your luck and set your goals too high just because you receive encouragement. Investor Ziad K. Abdelnour wrote, “Life is like a camera; focus on what’s important.”"
aries,2017-07-07,"You wake up breathing easier today as if a heavy weight has been lifted from your shoulders. Although your confidence feels wonderful, it could be a trap if you think you can escape from your previous commitments. It’s tempting to put a positive spin on everything you say, but you might not believe it in your heart. Don’t stretch the truth to make reality appear better than it actually is now. Working with the facts keeps your energy grounded. Psychologist David Myers wrote, “Like pride, blind optimism may go before a fall.”"
taurus,2017-07-07,"You honestly believe that talking about a lingering problem is the best way to solve it. In most cases, this logic is impeccable, but it doesn’t serve you well today. In fact, bringing up a sensitive subject for discussion now can magnify the fundamental differences of values. Nevertheless, traversing rough emotional territory is still worth temporary discomfort if you’re willing to embark on a journey of self-examination. Franz Kafka wrote, “From a certain point onward there is no longer any turning back. That is the point that must be reached.”"
gemini,2017-07-07,"You can talk up a proverbial storm today but somehow stay dry, even in the midst of all the rain. Your ability to remain emotionally unattached to your own words encourages you to say even more. Although you may control your actions, you can’t control the reactions of others. Unfortunately, you might end up involved in a melodrama of your own making if you don’t censor your delivery. Monitoring your message doesn’t take too much effort and could save you from a headache later in the day. The smarter you get, the less you speak."
cancer,2017-07-07,"Pursuing a relationship for business or pleasure may be so effortless today that you don't realize the intensity of your charm. But your inflated expectations could lead to disappointment later in the day when reality sets back in. Fortunately, you can minimize the let down by remaining cautious from the beginning. However, there’s no reason to entertain negativity, either. Focus on the present moment without turning any mole hills into mountains. Jack Welch said, “Face reality as it is, not as it was or as you wish it to be.”"
leo,2017-07-07,"People assume you’re laying your cards face up on the table, but they cannot see the aces you have up your sleeve. Your communication is so straightforward today that no one takes the time to look beneath the surface. Meanwhile, your motives may not be so easy to read. Ironically, you will progress faster toward your goals if you take the extra step of displaying your hidden agenda from the start. An old proverb teaches, “A half-truth is a whole lie.”"
virgo,2017-07-07,"You may play your feelings fast and loose early in the day as you ride a thrilling wave of emotional expression. However, your uncharacteristic effusiveness could quickly turn to embarrassment if someone responds to your vulnerability in kind. Ironically, you want the recognition, but not if it makes you feel awkward. You might wish you said less today, but you can’t take back your words. Stop making excuses for your heartfelt disclosure. Push through your discomfort until you get to the other side. Judge Judy Sheindlin said, “The time to change was yesterday; the time to wake up is now.”"
libra,2017-07-07,"You are quite vocal about your feelings today because you think you have an excellent chance of getting what you want. Although others respond positively to your requests, they may stop short of delivering the satisfaction you seek. But don’t waste time blaming anyone else for your frustration; simply change your mind, instead. Artist Francesca Reigler said, “Happiness is an attitude. We either make ourselves miserable, or happy and strong. The amount of work is the same.”"
scorpio,2017-07-07,"Although you might whitewash an intense emotion before sharing it with others today, you will soon realize that it’s better to express the truth as you feel it right from the start. Normally, you’re not one to take the easy way out of a conversation; you prefer to go for the jugular and dig into the unexposed core of the matter. Nevertheless, life isn’t as black and white as you prefer. Just show up and be true to yourself without any other agenda for now. Author David Weinberger wrote, “Transparency is the new objectivity.”"
sagittarius,2017-07-07,"You often can use the twinkle in your eye in order to win the hearts and minds of friends and coworkers. It feels as if you're sitting pretty today, especially if a powerful person steps forward to support your plan. Your perspective is not the same as everyone else’s; you’re unwilling to take the course of least resistance. You’re opting for the right path, not the easy one. Intention plus hard work equals success."
capricorn,2017-07-07,"Don’t let anyone talk you out of your dreams today, however unrealistic they may sound to everyone else. Whether or not you reach your ideal goal is not as significant as you think now, as long as you give it your best. Although you might not realize it at first, the simple act of striving for the impossible initiates a life-changing journey. Destinations are overrated; Mychal Wynn wrote, “The greatest quest in life is to reach one’s potential.”"
aquarius,2017-07-07,"You’re eager to collaborate with others as long as you are working on a project that holds your interest. But as soon as your enthusiasm starts to wane, your tendency is to withdraw from social interactions. It’s awkward to be with people when you don’t share the same goals. Fortunately, it’s unnecessary to create any ill will if you part ways. Be honest and tell coworkers that you’re being called to dance to a different drummer. Those who understand your motives will support your adventure. Author Arnold H. Glason wrote, “A true friend never gets in your way unless you happen to be going down.”"
pisces,2017-07-07,"There’s nothing wishy-washy about your communication style today. Your intentions are clear and your words are direct. However, your actions may not be as transparent as you think. You might see an interpersonal conflict brewing on the horizon and retreating energetically is one way to sidestep the storm. Unfortunately, a strategy based on avoidance won’t help in the long run. The sooner you confront the differences, the stronger your position will be. Never let fear decide your fate."
aries,2017-07-08,"You have devised a plan for your long-term success in the world, but you can see potential problems in turning your ideas into reality. Nevertheless, you’re in it for the long haul and won’t negotiate away those objectives that are most important to you. However, you might keep your thoughts to yourself in order to avoid confrontation before it’s necessary. Although it’s not the most practical tactic, you may choose to overcompensate by taking bold action later in the day. Inspirational writer Melanie Koulouris advises, “Be humble in your confidence yet courageous in your character.”"
taurus,2017-07-08,"You intrinsically understand that the most ambitious undertakings require the most concrete preparation. The calculating Capricorn Moon illuminates your 9th House of Big Ideas, reminding you that strategic action works better than succumbing to momentary enthusiasm. Don’t let your friends and family talk you out of your goals today, however unrealistic your ideas may seem. On the other hand, there’s no reason to rush ahead just to prove you can make your dreams come true. Slow down to get ahead."
gemini,2017-07-08,"You might be secretly concerned about revealing too much in a conversation with a friend or lover. It’s not that you’re hiding anything; you’re only worried about progressing too fast. The last thing you want to do is scare away the very person with whom you’re cultivating a relationship. Fortunately, you can’t go wrong if you follow your well-conceived plan. Don’t accelerate your delivery just because everything appears to be flowing so well. A French proverb notes, “Little by little, the bird makes its nest.”"
cancer,2017-07-08,"You’re ready to lighten the mood but it seems as if everyone else is being overly serious today. Although there appears to be an attitude difference between you and those close to you, this might be a reflection of your inner dynamics. Take a few moments to check on your unexpressed feelings, especially if you’re angry about an issue you don’t wish to discuss. Author Steven Pressfield wrote, “Most of us have two lives. The life we live, and the unlived life within us. Between the two stands resistance.”"
leo,2017-07-08,"You want to present a particular persona today, but you may need to monitor your feelings very closely so you can keep them in check. You’re quite aware of your unfulfilled needs and believe that expressing them all might be counterproductive. The truth is you have a better chance of partial satisfaction if you don’t ask for too much now. Sometimes, the key to happiness is to be content with what you have. Expect nothing and appreciate everything."
virgo,2017-07-08,"You may be slightly obsessed with creating the right venue for fun and games today. However, sometimes memorable experiences just occur on their own with an unplanned magic that makes them special. Nevertheless, you don’t want to leave anything to chance now, motivating you to imagine the ideal event, contact your potential playmates and make it happen according to your vision. The right mix of preparation and spontaneity makes for  a picture perfect day."
libra,2017-07-08,"You’re not interested in taking charge of a project today, but neither do you want to recede into invisibility. Someone might accuse you of being wishy-washy, but this is not the case now. You long to be a part of a team effort and to be recognized for your contribution to the cause. You’re even willing to climb up onto a soapbox to motivate others to participate. However, you draw the line at assuming full responsibility for everyone involved. The best part about being with a group is that you don’t have to do everything alone."
scorpio,2017-07-08,"Your friends know how serious you can be when you singularly focus on a particular goal. However, they may be surprised by your willingness to adapt to other people’s plans today, even when yours are so well-defined. Fortunately, you’re secure enough in your own thoughts that you don’t need to stick to your agenda now. In fact, you might reason that it will be easier to actualize your aspirations over the next few days. Author David Allen wrote, “Patience is the calm acceptance that things can happen in a different order than the one you had in mind.”"
sagittarius,2017-07-08,"You don’t want to waste your energy today because you believe you can increase your income if you play your cards right. You view the world through a pragmatic lens now, with little interest in those things that don’t contribute to your immediate well-being. Although improving your finances is likely part of the current picture, anything that elevates your self-esteem is also worth considering. Motivational speaker Brian Tracy claims, “Excellence is not a destination; it is a continuous journey that never ends.”"
capricorn,2017-07-08,"You’re in your natural element today while you map out your plans for professional and personal success. Although your thinking is likely to be aimed at the larger issues, you could get hung up in relationship logistics, especially if your goals seem to differ from those of your partner. However, it’s a tactical mistake to be sidetracked by the apparent divergent paths. Temporarily set aside topics of disagreement while you focus on those things you have in common. Napoleon Hill wrote, “It is literally true that you can succeed best and quickest by helping others to succeed.”"
aquarius,2017-07-08,"You are often the first one to join a collective effort and the first one to leave. You intuitively understand the power of the group dynamic and are willing to jump in to amplify your personal capabilities. However, you prefer to keep some things in reserve because you don’t want to lose control over their development, even if it means progressing at a slower rate. Fortunately, you can have your cake today and eat it too. Play a supportive role as a vital team member, but hold onto your passion projects. Warren Buffet said, “You can’t let people set your agenda in life.”"
pisces,2017-07-08,"You have a set notion of what you expect from others now, including your limits of what you’re willing to give in return. However, you might not be inclined to communicate your expectations, which can create disappointment later on. You need to climb out on a limb and take a risk by revealing your desires. If you can state your preferences without being overly attached to them, you may be happily surprised with the outcome. Buddhism teaches, “Things are as they are; we suffer because we imagined different.”"
aries,2017-07-09,"You may have agreed to one-too-many projects and you must show up and deliver the goods now, whether or not you feel like it. Although you might be planning to stay at home today, the Capricorn Full Moon's presence in your 10th House of Career indicates that work is still your top priority. Fortunately, a methodical approach accelerates your current progress toward reaching your goals. Zig Ziglar said, “There is no elevator to success. You have to take the stairs.”"
taurus,2017-07-09,"You are relentless in your efforts to make your travel dreams come true, even if your fantasies currently seem to be in jeopardy. But instead of just putting in additional hours doing research, you must think smarter if you want results. The Capricorn Full Moon soars through your 9th House of Distant Horizons, motivating you to take a chance. Keep in mind that the breakthrough you seek will only occur if you agree to step outside your safety zone and attempt something new. T.S. Eliot wrote, “Only those who will risk going too far can possibly find out how far one can go.”"
gemini,2017-07-09,"Avoid the temptation of revealing too much too fast today, since keeping some ideas under wraps prior to negotiating might give you a secret advantage. Your interpersonal interactions are complicated by the strategic Capricorn Full Moon lighting up your 8th House of Transformation. However, you must trust your emotions now without knowing where they will lead. Shared intimacy is a reward you need to work for on a continuing basis. Lao Tzu wrote, “Be still like a mountain and flow like a great river.”"
cancer,2017-07-09,"A friendship or partnership might run into obstacles that require you to reexamine your emotions. You must communicate your feelings as honestly as possible while the dutiful Capricorn Full Moon shines in your 7th House of Relationships, stirring up trouble or excitement. If there is someone special in your world, how you handle resolving a touchy conflict now establishes the foundation for what comes next. Either way, responding directly from your heart can improve the overall quality of your everyday life. Brene Brown wrote, “What makes you vulnerable makes you beautiful.”"
leo,2017-07-09,"You are disciplined enough to maintain consistency in your daily routine, but even the most practiced behaviors are challenging if your heart isn't completely connected to your actions. You can’t keep up false pretenses once your performance starts to impact your day in a negative way. Nevertheless, the practical Capricorn Full Moon casts its light in your 6th House of Habits, urging you not to make any drastic changes to your regular schedule. Hold tenaciously to your predetermined course of action; take faith in knowing that you’ll gain traction again soon enough. Good things come to those who wait."
virgo,2017-07-09,"It’s rather tricky to locate the right words in the heat of the moment. The Capricorn Full Moon energizes your 5th House of Self-Expression, emboldening you to act on your feelings instead of analyzing them. However, it’s impossible to respond spontaneously when you struggle to say what’s on your mind. Simply let it pass; it’s more productive to talk about your emotional process once the intensity settles back down. In the meantime, explore creative outlets to inspire your heart. Coco Chanel said, “Beauty begins the moment you decide to be yourself.”"
libra,2017-07-09,"You might be at a point in your life where you could benefit from setting some time aside to reevaluate your career. However, don’t fall into the trap of focusing only on what earns you money or power. The goal-oriented Capricorn Full Moon recharges your 4th House of Foundations, reminding you not to overlook your emotional needs. Your home and family are integral parts of the equation. Activist A.J. Muste wrote, “There is no way to peace; peace is the way.”"
scorpio,2017-07-09,"The intensity of life has been slowly building for a while, offering you time to prepare for the current hectic pace of events. The Capricorn Full Moon overwhelms your 3rd House of Communication, inundating you with so much data that it might be challenging to integrate all of it. Don’t attempt to accomplish more than is possible; you only have so many hours in the day. Surprisingly, there will be more to show for your efforts if you set your goals a little lower. Be gentle with yourself if it takes an extra day or two to finish everything on your plate. Adele Leon said, ""A work of art was once a work in progress."""
sagittarius,2017-07-09,"You wish you could respond to your current frustrations by leaving everything behind and making a mad dash forward. However, you have one foot stuck in your past while the other itches to leap into your future. Meanwhile, the restrictive Capricorn Full Moon emphasizes your 2nd House of Personal Values, binding you to traditional beliefs that may need updating now. Your tendency to reach for the sky encourages you to overextend your expectations while making changes. Concentrate on reaching a conservative goal, rather than falling short of an idealistic one. Your best teacher is your last mistake."
capricorn,2017-07-09,"Someone may play the authority card while asking for your support today. Although you don’t like being put in such an awkward position, you’re sympathetic to other people’s pain while the reflective Capricorn Full Moon illuminates your 1st House of Self. But you could overreact by holding someone else's negativity at bay in order to protect your own priorities. Unfortunately, your self-defensive reaction alienates you from your feelings. Your life is only as full as your heart."
aquarius,2017-07-09,"You could place so much significance on making a decision that you forget about following through with consistent hard work. Although you receive cosmic assistance from the responsible Capricorn Full Moon spotlighting your 12th House of Destiny, the consequences of your current choices aren’t yet apparent. Don't be too quick to share your plans with your allies; rather than putting energy into endless conversations, let people discover your new direction from your actions. Dr. Sukhraj S. Dhillon wrote, “Ultimately, your words don’t make you a better person; your behavior does.”"
pisces,2017-07-09,"You might believe that you’re not in control of your own destiny, but this is just a temporary illusion. You may think people are trying to trick you into setting aside your own agenda to follow theirs while the pragmatic Capricorn Full Moon magnifies the needs of your 11th House of Teamwork. You could feel isolated if your ideas differ from everyone else's. Nevertheless, it’s still necessary to honor your intuition. There’s no reason to succumb to peer pressure for the sake of a connection to others. John F. Kennedy said, “Conformity is the jailer of freedom and the enemy of growth.”"
aries,2017-07-10,"Of course, it's admirable if you are consciously evolving into a better person, but proving your superiority at work is not the best way to exhibit your growth. There’s no need to instigate conflict just to demonstrate that you will come out on top. Rather than being unnecessarily combative at home or on the job now, go out of your way to be helpful to all those who could benefit from your assistance. Cooperate with others; compete with yourself."
taurus,2017-07-10,"You’re certain that your ambitious new plan is good for the wellbeing of everyone involved. Unfortunately, you still may need to fend off criticism from someone who thinks you’re only in it for yourself. Luckily, you possess the necessary skills to guarantee your success. But reaching your goals is not very satisfying unless you do so in a kind and supportive manner. Your current adversary might not even be a real nemesis unless you turn him or her into one by escalating a disagreement. Jim Wallis wrote, “We can find common ground only by moving to higher ground.”"
gemini,2017-07-10,"Relationships are front and center today, but you’re only interested if there’s an equal give and take. Although you might prefer keeping the conversation on the lighter side, denial will only exacerbate the problem. Dive into a lively discussion, but only after ground rules have been established that prevent power politics from controlling the mood. Plunging into the unknown may not be your first choice now, but engaging in an open dialogue could bring wisdom, along with a deeper sense of intimacy."
cancer,2017-07-10,"An unavoidable disagreement over an intense emotional issue could provoke random feelings of helplessness now. Thankfully, transformation is your superpower today, enabling you to skillfully turn negative emotions into fuel for positive change. Looking within your heart can lead you to your own tender spot, but your self-awareness won't matter until you are vulnerable with your partner. Buddha taught, “When words are both true and kind they could change the world.”"
leo,2017-07-10,"Your passions are so aroused today that you can lose your temper if an emotionally charged discussion does not go your way. Although you don’t intend to turn your disappointment into a major issue, there may be negative fallout from your reaction anyway. However, suppressing your feelings isn’t a viable strategy now. If you think it's more prudent to remain quiet, the unexpressed words could act like a lightning rod that attracts exactly what you were attempting to avoid. Sophocles wrote, “Hide nothing, for time, which sees all and hears all, exposes all.”"
virgo,2017-07-10,"You might think you shouldn’t tell someone how you feel today, especially if you believe your disclosure will be a catalyst that triggers unpleasant memories. Unfortunately, you may not be able to settle down until you share what's on your mind with a trusted friend. On other days, you could apply your rational thinking to help you decide what to do. However, you can’t use logic to solve an illogical problem. Of course, caution is advised, but the possibility of uncovering metaphysical treasures makes the risk more than worth it now. Fear is temporary; regret is forever."
libra,2017-07-10,"Everyone expects you to deliver on your recent promises and you can't afford to drop the ball before fulfilling your commitments. No doubt, there is plenty of hard work in front of you, and you are uncharacteristically compulsive about handling your responsibilities today. Nevertheless, don't allow anything to pull you so far off course that you lose track of what you initially set out to do. Getting started while the cosmic forces are with you empowers you to accomplish superhero acts."
scorpio,2017-07-10,"People make more and more demands on your time now, leading you to believe you’ve lost control of your priorities. Perhaps your schedule has grown so complicated that you don’t know how you can regain normalcy. Nevertheless, you refuse to give up; you know a solution is near and a great adventure ahead will once again inspire your heart and soul. Thomas Edison said, “Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work.”"
sagittarius,2017-07-10,"It’s time to face your insecurities so you can clean up a messy situation that threatens a significant relationship. The problem is you have already taken the bait and are hooked on untangling the complicated issues. Naturally, you prefer to leave the whole matter behind, but you must resolve personal business before moving on to anything else. Professional surfer Bethany Hamilton wrote, “Courage doesn’t mean you don’t get afraid. Courage means you don’t let fear stop you.”"
capricorn,2017-07-10,"You are known for your amazing ability to continue plodding through your work until it’s finished. However, you can go over the top in your drive for completion; almost nothing will deter you from reaching your destination. Your current tenacity graces you with a one-track mind today, as if you are supercharged with an extra dose of practical determination. No matter how hard you must fight to stay on your chosen path, set your goals high and then go after them. Maeve Greyson wrote, “No one has the power to shatter your dreams unless you give it to them.”"
aquarius,2017-07-10,"It’s absolutely imperative that you are one hundred percent honest with yourself today or you may run into trouble. Don’t be afraid to reevaluate your assumptions and reconsider what’s most important if unfolding events challenge old values that have outserved their useful purpose. However, it makes no sense to set the cart before the horse; create a new set of priorities based on your current thinking before you make a detailed list of things to do. John F. Kennedy said, “The one unchangeable certainty is that nothing is unchangeable or certain.”"
pisces,2017-07-10,"You are more confrontational in social settings today because you may be insecure about your role within the group. You might feel marginalized, even if you’re an integral part of the process. However, your inclination is to withdraw if something rattles your stability. Unfortunately, you can't escape from your responsibilities without making a scene. In the long run, a strategy based on peaceful coexistence is smarter than one that’s fueled by outright conflict. An African proverb teaches, “If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.”"
aries,2017-07-11,"Sometimes your enthusiasm is so effusive that you lose your ability to make sensible decisions about your future. You friends and coworkers aren’t much help either; they only encourage you further today, without bringing any real expertise to the current circumstances. Nevertheless, the uncertainty you harbor about your role in the community is clearing now, and you will soon be thankful for the opportunity to reconsider your old priorities. Bashar claims, “If you can’t change your mind, then you’re not using it.”"
taurus,2017-07-11,"You’re determined to stick to your plans today because you know they will enable you to reach your goals. However, it’s a mistake to go through the motions by demonstrating your commitment to someone else’s project if it detracts from your own work. Forget about how others may react and just quietly go about your business. Author Mandy Hale wrote, “Sometimes you have to move on without certain people. If they’re meant to be in your life, they’ll catch up.”"
gemini,2017-07-11,"You’re not very chatty today, but that doesn’t prevent you from answering questions as they arise. You’re eager to tell your side of the story as long as you don’t need to initiate the conversation yourself. But others may not ask you anything if they think you’re unwilling to share your position. Fortunately, breaking the ice by talking in generalities allows you to converse without sending emotionally charged messages that could put someone off. Author Michael J. Schmoker wrote, “In a healthy system, there is no blame.”"
cancer,2017-07-11,"You hope that the current noise at work will give you a chance to go unnoticed for stretches of time today. You like the idea of slipping beneath the radar now, as if you’re on a stealth mission. Nevertheless, you’re not as invisible as you think because your behavior influences others. There are many ways to impact your future and leading by example is one of the smartest strategies in your playbook these days. Picasso said, “Action is the foundational key to all success.”"
leo,2017-07-11,"It’s all about relationships today, but you might grow frustrated when you realize you’re not going to get what you want. Thankfully, the situational dynamics change drastically throughout the day, turning failure into success, possibly even more than once. But don’t feed extra energy into an already sensitive stew of feelings. If someone seems aloof now, accept the deeply rooted individualism that creates the illusion of separation. Rumi wrote, “Love is the bridge between you and everything.”"
virgo,2017-07-11,"You’re feeling an uneasiness today that’s difficult to put your finger on. One thing is for certain: the more you seek answers, the harder it is to find them. Although the truth is elusive now, your gentle persistence is likely to be rewarded. Your thoughts are swift and accurate while your emotions flow deeper. Lao Tzu wrote, “Nothing is softer or more flexible than water, yet nothing can resist it.”"
libra,2017-07-11,"Somehow, you’re able to stretch the rules today and avoid criticism for your rebellious behavior. Luckily, you can capitalize on your current creativity, enabling you to pursue more risky forms of self-expression without actually increasing your chances of running into any lasting trouble. Make swift use of your diplomatic skills if confronted by authority. Albert Camus wrote, “Charm is a way of getting the answer ‘yes’ without asking a clear question.”"
scorpio,2017-07-11,"You're unwilling to step down from your position as resident investigator today. It’s not like you actually go out of your way to stir up emotional unrest; rather, you cannot let peace and quiet prevent you from uncovering the truth. Fortunately, your inquisitive nature is widely admired and most people accept enduring a few uncomfortable minutes while you gather more facts. Nobel laureate Albert Szent-Gyorgyi wrote, “Research consists in seeing what everyone else has seen, but thinking what no one else has thought.”"
sagittarius,2017-07-11,"You can’t wait to shake up your schedule today in order to stay on the track of unique self-expression. You will even sacrifice the certainty of your day to introduce some passion into it. But you can take things too far in search of your next adrenaline rush. Consider the pros and cons of each change you make before you discover that you’ve pulled the rug out from under your own feet. Franklin D. Roosevelt said, “Happiness lies in the joy of achievement and the thrill of creative effort.”"
capricorn,2017-07-11,"You’re excited about taking the scenic route to your destination today, especially if you think it will increase your chances of success. It’s just that the tried-and-true path has grown less and less reliable as the days roll by, motivating you to try new options. Additionally, you crave experiences on a completely different spectrum from those in the past. You don’t mind if your travel time is greater as long as your odds are better. Playwright Eugene O’Neill wrote, “Curiosity killed the cat, but satisfaction brought it back.”"
aquarius,2017-07-11,"Normally, it takes a lot to get you to change your position once you make up your mind. However, the Moon’s current visit to unconventional Aquarius brings inconsistency into your world. You might not like the surprises you encounter now if you must go back to the beginning and recalculate your options. Nevertheless, you’re a willing, if slightly reluctant, participant in the game of evolution. Activist Maggie Kuhn wrote, “Speak your truth, even if your voice shakes.”"
pisces,2017-07-11,"You might not be waving any flags to attract the attention of others, but your work will garner plenty of recognition soon enough. However, managing your public persona requires concentrated effort now, and you would rather be putting that time toward your creative expression. There is very little that must be said directly to your coworkers today, especially if you have been honest with them all along. Create a life that feels good on the inside, not one that just looks good on the outside."
aries,2017-07-12,"You wish you could maintain an objective approach to life, but your feelings are strong enough today that you must take them into consideration. Unfortunately, you’re being pulled in multiple directions and you don’t have enough clarity now to choose one way over the other. Normally, you rely on a trusted friend or colleague for advice, but the Moon’s visit to your 12th House of Privacy encourages you to hide your dilemma. However, this can be a breakthrough moment if you choose to take a risk. Fear looks; faith jumps."
taurus,2017-07-12,"You’re less interested in achieving an individual goal now than stabilizing the relationships that bring you joy. Rather than evaluating your next move based upon climbing the ladder of success, you’re more concerned with maintaining your position in your network of friends. However, there may be confusing emotional undertows that are bending alliances one way or another. Nevertheless, don’t let your insecurities trigger an impulsive response. Architect Frank Lloyd Wright wrote, “There is nothing more uncommon than common sense.”"
gemini,2017-07-12,"It’s time to turn your dreams into an executable plan, but first you must separate the impractical fantasies from the attainable goals. Although it may be difficult at first to transform an idea into concrete steps that lead to your desired destination, the more exacting you can be now, the easier it will be to measure your success along the way. Don’t worry about finishing what you start today; making steady progress is your only reliable course of action. Henry Ford said, “When everything seems to be going against you, remember an airplane takes off against the wind, not with it.”"
cancer,2017-07-12,"Although you prefer the familiarity of your daily routine, you might feel a sudden urge to break free from your safe and secure world. However, it’s not likely that you’ll quit your job and head overseas today, even if you’re struck with a seemingly incurable case of wanderlust. Follow your instincts to widen your horizons by learning about a subject that’s outside your regular sphere of reference. Attorney Gerry Spence wrote, “I would rather have a mind opened by wonder than one closed by belief.”"
leo,2017-07-12,"Sinking into your emotions offers you the best chance to deepen a current relationship. Although you’re typically attracted to someone’s appearance, you want to slip right past the veneer and delve into the heart of the matter now. There’s an urgency to your interpersonal interactions and you can’t waste time skimming along the surface. Don’t analyze whether or not you should push through your fears and into more soulful realms. Carl von Clausewitz wrote, “It is better to act quickly and err than to hesitate until the time of action is past.”"
virgo,2017-07-12,"You want more details from others than they can deliver today. However, their inability to satisfy your need for specificity only drives you to ask for more. This vicious circle may be annoying at best and upsetting at worst. Fortunately, you have the power to alter the destiny of the day by breaking the chain of cause and effect before things grow out of hand. Take a few steps back and stop pushing for more information when there isn’t any. For now, work with what you have. Giving others a little breathing room lessens the pressure and creates an opening for real communication to happen naturally."
libra,2017-07-12,"You’re singularly focused on your job today, but oddly enough you don’t have any specific goals in mind. Instead of establishing priorities and developing an agenda, you simply observe situations as they unfold and jump in to help wherever you can. Although your lack of ambition might be considered a shortcoming by some, it gives you enviable freedom of movement now. Science writer Isaac Asimov claimed, “To succeed, planning alone is insufficient. One must improvise as well.”"
scorpio,2017-07-12,"You might not want people to notice how driven you are today, yet you still hope to be appreciated for the innovation you bring to a project. But you don’t enjoy wasting your time on management issues; you’re flush with artistic ideas and you can’t wait to bring them into fruition. Let others step up to make certain the details are all in order. Everyone has a part to play in the overall success of your group now, but your job is to create a masterpiece. Henry Van Dyke wrote, “Genius is talent set on fire by courage.”"
sagittarius,2017-07-12,"Reining in your reactions is tricky today, especially if someone challenges your ability to keep up with them. You could be drawn into an argument without warning, but it's nearly impossible to justify your position with enough facts. Skipping the small history or science lesson is a sensible move now, because you won’t change anyone’s mind based upon your logical arguments. The most important persuasion tool you possess in your entire arsenal is your integrity."
capricorn,2017-07-12,"It’s a rare day when you lose your balance, and when you do today, others quickly appear out of nowhere to offer a helping hand. Your first reaction is to decline their assistance because you certainly don’t want to admit your weakness. Nevertheless, you will regain your self-confidence and your footing by revealing your truest self to your allies. The Dalia Lama said, “My faith helps me overcome such negative emotions and find my equilibrium.”"
aquarius,2017-07-12,"Trust your instincts today when it comes to making decisions about money. The Moon’s visit to your 2nd House of Income doesn’t automatically bestow you with wealth and riches. However, Luna  strengthens the intuitive process you employ -- consciously or not -– when your positive attitude actually attracts opportunities to increase your self-worth. Preacher Robert Schuller said, “Our greatest lack is not money for any undertaking, but rather ideas. If the ideas are good, cash will somehow flow to where it is needed.”"
pisces,2017-07-12,"You’re eager to come out of the closet today, stand on stage and reveal a secret to all who will listen. However, the inconsistent Pisces Moon shifts into your 1st House of Self, adding confusion to your current thinking process. But don’t question your decision to speak authentically, even if it complicates your life for a while. Reach beyond any self-doubt and into the spiritual realms for the faith you need to follow through on your convictions. The truth may hurt for a little while, but a lie hurts forever."
aries,2017-07-13,"Making wise decisions is impossible today because the facts won’t stand still. It’s like the truth is a moving target and every time you aim your intentions at a goal, it’s in a different place just a few minutes later. However, you are closer to your dreams than you realize; it’s the act of trying to lock them into place that causes them to slip away. Instead of pushing for progress now, just be grateful for each moment as it occurs."
taurus,2017-07-13,"Your best friends take on new roles today as they become spiritual advisers. Whether or not you’ve ever seen them in this capacity, you’re looking for something more than mundane assistance. Fortunately, those who know you best can touch your soul and inspire you to widen your horizons. But you might need to leave your bull-headed common sense behind while you explore the far reaches of your imagination. Don’t let small minds convince you that your dreams are too big."
gemini,2017-07-13,"Reality appears to be shapeshifting today in order to conform to your dreams. Unfortunately, the facts are not what they seem to be, since they are also dependent on your perspective. Your lack of objectivity makes it easy to jump to incorrect conclusions in the pursuit of opening your heart and awakening your mind. Don’t try to make the irrational rational. Ritu Ghatourey wrote, “Satisfaction is not always the fulfillment of what you want; it is the realization of how blessed you are for what you have.”"
cancer,2017-07-13,"Your bold aspirations of possible adventures aren’t usually part of the Crab’s character. However, you’re inspired to reach beyond the edges of your emotional safety and stretch your mind in the process. But don’t stop to consider if your plans are realistic or even possible; leave the concrete thinking for another day. Just explore every notion that pops into your head as if it were a path to your future without fretting over the logistics. Mason Cooley wrote, “Fantasy mirrors desire. Imagination reshapes it.”"
leo,2017-07-13,"You might be surprised by the subjects you bring up today in the course of normal conversation. It’s as if you have a magnetic attractor that pulls in the most sensitive and sensational topics. You don’t even need to go looking for controversy; it arrives without any effort. There’s no reason to back away from discussing a delicate issue as long as you understand the impact it could have on others. Author Richard Carlson wrote, “Choose being kind over being right and you’ll be right every time.”"
virgo,2017-07-13,"It seems as if you’re surrounded by dreamers today and you are spiritually refreshed by what they share with you. Oftentimes, vague visions and ethereal thoughts make you nervous because you feel the need to turn them into something more practical. However, you’re ready to go for a ride now, eager to see where people’s thoughts carry you. Avoid making any concrete plans yet; stay in the realms of unrealized potential, instead. Inspiration coach Gail Lynne Goodwin wrote, “Perfect moments are often killed in the quest for perfection.”"
libra,2017-07-13,"You could think you’re going one way at work only to find yourself heading in the exact opposite direction. But don’t be shocked at the wide divergence of destinations because they may end up being quite similar. The truth is that the road ahead is more obscured than you realize, as if a heavy fog has descended over your future. But there is beauty in the subdued light and magic in the unknown if you have the courage to pursue it. Once you become fearless, life becomes limitless."
scorpio,2017-07-13,"Set aside a block of time today for unfettered daydreaming. Don’t try to channel your thoughts down a particular path. A guided meditation is counterproductive now, for it limits your exploration rather than encouraging it. Tear down the walls or simply wander beyond them. Something important awaits your discovery if you venture off the beaten track. Don’t worry about what to do with your current finds for they will catalyze a wave of productive creativity on their own. French film director Robert Bresson wrote, “Make visible what, without you, might perhaps never have been seen.”"
sagittarius,2017-07-13,"You may decline an invitation to do something wild and wonky today, but turning your thoughts inward can be a significant decision. It’s as if the winds of fate filled your sails and blew you directly to a secret island that’s not on any maps. Nevertheless, it feels like a spiritual home and sets a series of events into motion that deepens your soul. Although a profound experience changes you for the better, the real magic starts when you share your story with others. Serena van der Woodsen said, “People don’t tell you who you are; you tell them.”"
capricorn,2017-07-13,"A missed appointment may be momentarily frustrating, but it can open up a bit of unexpected free time on your calendar. This serendipitous mix-up could actually be the fates knocking at your door, bringing you exactly the opportunity you needed. A cosmic gift is being delivered today, but it’s up to you to do something wonderful with it. Seize the moment as it arrives because some chances don’t come around twice."
aquarius,2017-07-13,"You find yourself cast in an entirely new light when something surprising occurs today. Perhaps you were feeling as if your energy was blocked, or maybe you believed you weren’t up for a task that was assigned to you. However, you can’t ignore the positive feedback you’re receiving from the cosmos now. You realize that you were the only one standing in your way. You are not what happens to you. You are what you choose to become."
pisces,2017-07-13,"People often don’t see you as you view yourself. It’s as if you are looking through a filter that softens your edges so much that you seem confused or out of touch. However, your experience is quite different now as you gain power from a profound encounter with a close friend or associate. You know exactly what you want today; unfortunately, something is lost between your thoughts and what others hear. Cicero said, “Silence is one of the great arts of conversation.”"
aries,2017-07-14,"Taking other people’s schedules into consideration prior to making plans for the day is a wise strategy. Fortunately, you can feel the support of your allies now, encouraging you to promise greater participation on your part. But your follow-through might not live up to your good intentions if you get sidetracked by an unplanned setback. Rather than making excuses for falling short of your commitments, stay focused on the work at hand. You might surprise everyone, including yourself, with how much you accomplish by the end of the day."
taurus,2017-07-14,"Someone’s actions grate on your nerves today, but you might hold your tongue for the sake of harmony. You want your friends to know your thoughts, but aren't interested in engaging in a conflict defending your position. Secretly, you wish you felt safe enough to share everything, but recent experiences suggest it’s wiser to put on a happy face and just forge ahead on your own. The Dalai Lama said, ""Do not let the behavior of others destroy your inner peace."""
gemini,2017-07-14,"You want to come up with an amazing rationale that informs everyone of your most admirable intentions. Unfortunately, your words don’t hit the nail quite on the head, leaving others to wonder about your goals and question your motives. It’s tempting to try one more time by slowing down your delivery and explaining everything in greater detail. However, the more you talk, the greater the confusion you sow. Greek playwright Sophocles said, “Much wisdom often goes with fewer words.”"
cancer,2017-07-14,"It might seem like someone is shutting you down today before you get to speak your piece. Or, perhaps, your progress on a project encounters resistance, making you so frustrated you’re considering resignation. Fortunately, your deep reserve of tenacity will pull you through this momentary obstruction. You’re not in this for the quick buck; your long-term goals are your priority now and your patience will be tested. Ben Franklin wrote, “Energy and persistence conquer all things.”"
leo,2017-07-14,"Your flamboyance is being fed by people who are persuading you to gamble with your heart or your money today. You’re feeling lucky and could be convinced to take a bigger risk than is necessary. Obviously, it’s easy for others to goad you into saying yes if they are a step removed from the consequences. A temporary retreat is prudent while you fine tune your plan and prepare for the next push forward. Don’t try to rush things that need time to grow."
virgo,2017-07-14,"Your inability to explain your serious demeanor can lead to a major crisis of self-doubt today. However, questioning everything you do and say might foster character development, but it doesn’t change the interpersonal dynamics. Frustration abounds if you let your thoughts run rampant. Nevertheless, don’t back down; even giving an inch is too much at this time. Psychologist Joyce Brothers wrote, “A strong, positive self-image is the best possible preparation for success.”"
libra,2017-07-14,"It might appear as if your goals are self-serving but you actually are in it for the good of all. In fact, you can’t even remove yourself from the equation that connects you with everyone else, even if they resist your ideas. But don’t take no for an answer; continue to adjust your stance based upon the changing circumstances. Your current success is determined by your level of discipline and perseverance. Hope is not a strategy, persistence is."
scorpio,2017-07-14,"You’re uncertain of the best way to express what’s in your heart today. However, finding a creative outlet is necessary for you to experience satisfaction in life now. Whatever methods you use to share your feelings, meticulously tailor your message for your audience. You may aspire to stir souls with your passion, but communication is a two-way street. Ask questions; there’s so much to learn from listening to someone else's perspective, especially when you realize every person you encounter is a teacher."
sagittarius,2017-07-14,"Good news reinforces your positive outlook on the world today. Everything may not be perfect, but there are enough pieces in place for you to believe things are going your way. Nevertheless, you could encounter a weird form of resistance now as someone quietly undermines your accomplishments and seems to work against your progress. Although this negative wave is subtle, you don’t want to ignore it or it will result in an uncomfortable interpersonal dynamic. Norman Vincent Peale wrote, “Change your thoughts and you change your world.”"
capricorn,2017-07-14,"Your sites are set and you are determined to reach your goal, no matter what. Thankfully, your current efforts are blessed and you’ll likely accomplish nearly everything you wish. Nevertheless, there are a few traps hidden along your path now, and it’s possible that they were put there by someone you know. Unfortunately, you won’t uncover the whole story yet. Instead of obsessing about something you can’t control today, just refocus and demonstrate the power of intention with your unwavering commitment to success."
aquarius,2017-07-14,"Finding your rhythm may be tricky today, especially if you are trying to dance to music that can’t be heard. It’s like your radio is stuck on one station, playing your favorite song over and over. Nevertheless, the signal is faint now and try as you might, you can’t make it any clearer. Overcome your nervous stress by improvising to fill in the missing notes. Herman Melville wrote, “It is better to fail in originality than to succeed in imitation.”"
pisces,2017-07-14,"You’re passionate when sharing your knowledge about healthy living with your friends at work. Although you know all your facts and figures, there still may be a logistical problem in the delivery of your data today. Your current tendency is to dismiss the details, but someone wants every last question answered. Don’t stress trying to supply the required information now. Just tell your story in a simple and truthful manner; your sincerity will do the rest."
aries,2017-07-15,"You might believe you possess superhero powers, enabling you to succeed at almost anything you wish. Thankfully, you can turn a disagreement into a lovefest of mutual admiration by focusing on the positive potential rather than falling into the competitive trap. The answers are not floating around on the surface now; you must go deep to open your mind wide enough to let a new vision in. Be unwavering in your determination and keep your eyes on your goal. Showing others what you can do leads to personal satisfaction."
taurus,2017-07-15,"You’re excited because there are so many different things to do today that sound like fun. However, you also like the idea of staying home and relaxing. You might feel as if you’re caught in the middle, unable to decide whether to head out in search of a new experience or hide out away from the maddening crowds. Fortunately, you don’t have to choose one or the other; you can do a little of each if you manage your time wisely."
gemini,2017-07-15,"Surrounding yourself with friends and family is a perfect way to pass the time today. You’re looking forward to resuming interesting conversations with people you admire while sharing some fine food and drink. There’s nothing wrong with a little self-indulgence now as long as you don’t overdo it. Although you can’t tell anyone else what to do, you can respect your personal limits. Publilius Syrus penned, “From the errors of others, a wise man corrects his own.”"
cancer,2017-07-15,"You may try to deflect some of your current feelings because you don’t want to put yourself in an emotionally vulnerable position. Although your preferences are very strong today, going along with someone else’s plan could be logistically less complicated. Nevertheless, it’s a smart idea to let others know what you want without expecting them to take responsibility for your needs. Transparency is the fastest route to intimacy."
leo,2017-07-15,"You can’t contain yourself today because every thought that crosses your brain leads you on an exciting journey of unlimited possibilities. Paradoxically, you might be quite satisfied without attempting to turn any single idea into reality. Your greatest adventure is the one that takes place between your two ears. Of course, real-world experiences can be magical, but aren’t necessary now for you to have a pleasurable time. Imagination is the playground of the mind."
virgo,2017-07-15,"Friends and family seem to look to you for guidance, expecting you to play the role of social director today. However, you are not inclined to take control, especially if you don’t have a specific agenda in mind. In fact, you might choose a different sort of indulgence and head off on a little shopping spree. Rather than seeking joy in the company of others, you could find a sliver of happiness by acquiring something beautiful that will serve a lasting purpose in your life. Karl Marx wrote, “Nothing can have value without being an object of utility.”"
libra,2017-07-15,"People may seem overly assertive today, prompting you to question everyone’s motives. However, their behavior might turn passive-aggressive, denying that they expect anything from you. Although you can see through their claims of innocence, you really don’t want to confront anyone further and end up in a protracted confrontation. Take a few steps back now and reestablish your emotional boundaries. Author Mandy Hale wrote, “Pick your battles. You don’t have to show up to every argument you’re invited to.”"
scorpio,2017-07-15,"You are bored by the thought of running errands today in the same old way you do all the time. You wish you could turn your tedious routine upside down simply to alleviate the monotony. Unfortunately, you might make more work for yourself than necessary by taking your need for freedom of expression too far. In the long run, it’s smarter to aim for efficiency rather than inventiveness. Fulfilling your obligations as quickly as you can leaves you plenty of time for more creative pursuits later on."
sagittarius,2017-07-15,"Your imagination is on fire today, yet you’re not content to just sit back and dream. You’re eager for some action but might not have anything solid on your schedule yet. Thankfully, you’re open to anyone's invitation if it sounds like a fun distraction. Just be careful about taking your search for adventure to extremes; agreeing to join someone on a nature walk is substantially different than embarking on a survival expedition. Everything will make sense in your world if you maintain a balanced perspective."
capricorn,2017-07-15,"You might be willing to step into uncharted emotional territory today, as long as you’re the one calling the shots. You can see the positive potential of exploring your feelings with a trusted friend or lover now. However, you quickly grow anxious if someone else is in control and you’re ready to change the subject. Fortunately, people will be more understanding than you think if you simply explain your fears prior to initiating a serious conversation. Honesty saves everyone’s time."
aquarius,2017-07-15,"Relationship issues can be complicated by your conflicting desires today. Your apparent confidence and direct communication style signal your willingness to open your heart during an intimate chat. However, you are more self-protective than you seem, leading others to move the conversation along faster than you prefer. Thankfully, once you realize that you’re sending mixed messages, you can do something about it. Don’t hang a sign on your door that says, “Come In” when you really mean “Enter at Your Own Risk.”"
pisces,2017-07-15,"Participating in a group activity could be very stimulating, but you might prefer to enjoy some quiet time alone today. You love hanging out with your friends, but you have mixed emotions that need to be sorted out before you lose yourself in the noise of a social event. Ironically, you could overcompensate by displaying an air of bravado now because you feel guilty about your choice to exclude others. Poet Rupi Kaur wrote, “You must want to spend the rest of your life with yourself first.”"
aries,2017-07-16,"Your current restlessness triggers impulsive behavior, but doing nothing is smarter now than doing the wrong thing. You can convince yourself that your ability to put a sensible deal together that will work out well for everyone involved, but your intentions are not necessarily supported by your choices. Lay low until the emotional storms blow over. Once the sky is clear, you’ll know exactly what to do. Rune Lazuli wrote, “Inside the chaos, build a temple of love.”"
taurus,2017-07-16,"You have a few tricks up your sleeves today and it’s wise to keep an ace in the hole for when you need it. You are currently thinking about big picture, but concentrating your focus leads to more concrete accomplishments. Nevertheless, narrowing your vision too much might be just as counterproductive as overextending your reach. Don’t wait until it’s too late to act preemptively, because your chances of winning the hand are best if you play your cards in the present moment."
gemini,2017-07-16,"You’re thrilled by all the social activity today, but it may become so demanding that you’re tempted to do a major disappearing act. Unfortunately, in the absence of others, you still can’t hide from yourself. You might judge yourself harshly because of your shortcomings in the real world. Nevertheless, making friends with all sides of your personality can heal your relationship karma on many levels. As novelist Tom Robbins wrote, “Funny how we think of romance as always involving two, when the romance of solitude can be ever so much more delicious and intense.”"
cancer,2017-07-16,"You don’t want to perform in public today, but circumstances might require you to be in the spotlight anyhow. Fortunately, you possess enough confidence to do what is expected of you, regardless of your personal preferences. Once you overcome your initial resistance, you could even enjoy being the center of attention for a while. Don’t overreact to any specific event; instead, observe your changing feelings as if they were the color palette on your next painting."
leo,2017-07-16,"Your words seem to be clear and to the point, but it’s possible that there’s a whole subtext that you’re avoiding today. Although others might have no idea that your message is only part of the story, they’ll eventually realize something is amiss because your actions don’t quite match with what they hear now. Thankfully, there’s no reason to fret about saying something that could be upsetting to someone you like. John Lennon said, “Being honest may not get you a lot of friends, but it’ll always get you the right ones.”"
virgo,2017-07-16,"You may spend a lot of time today reflecting on your changing values. You’re secretly concerned that your core beliefs don’t fit in with those of the rest of your friends and family. But keeping your desires to yourself doesn’t fix the underlying issue; it only buries the tension deeper, making it more difficult to uncover later on. The road could get rough for a bit if you choose to confront others with your differences now. Author Erica Jong wrote, “The trouble is, if you don’t risk anything, you risk more.”"
libra,2017-07-16,"Your attempts to keep relationship dynamics from melting down may seem more futile as the day unfolds. At first, you’re able to adapt to each emotional challenge as it demands your attention. But something happens after a few go-arounds; your patience wears thin and you can’t continue smiling your way through this charade. Television character Carrie Bradshaw said, “Don’t forget to fall in love with yourself first.” There is no going back once you decide to speak your truth."
scorpio,2017-07-16,"Your emotions are so volatile today that they could frighten you into temporary silence. Needless to say, you’ll find your voice again sooner than you expect. But in the meantime, you must find a way to process your stress without going all the way back to square one every time someone says something that sets you off again. There’s no reason to get upset with people or situations that you can’t control. Both are powerless without your reaction. Channel your passion into a worthy cause."
sagittarius,2017-07-16,"There’s no holding you back today, even if you know you’re stepping over the line. You are enthusiastic about showing up in fine form and are not concerned about offending people with the truth as you see it. However, your cavalier attitude may lead to a situation where you’ll be apologizing later on. Remember, you can still be honest without being hurtful. Taking full responsibility for your own emotions frees you from projecting your disappointments onto anyone else."
capricorn,2017-07-16,"You might not be able to run away from love today, but you’re not sure you’re ready to share your heart with someone new. Feelings grow complicated if you think another person is pushing too hard or progressing too fast. Communication can be strained if you put up arbitrary boundaries to protect your heart. But there’s a fine line between maintaining emotional security and living in unnecessary isolation. Sometimes we create our own heartbreaks by building walls where there could be bridges."
aquarius,2017-07-16,"You can’t prevent your schedule from falling apart today because random changes demand radical solutions. Trying to hold on rigidly to a now unmanageable agenda only makes matters worse. Follow the course of least resistance and let your entire calendar fall like a house of cards. Once the stress of keeping up appearances is gone, you’re free to recreate your day to your liking. Sometimes it takes an unexpected breakdown to experience an undeniable breakthrough."
pisces,2017-07-16,"There can be a wide gulf between what you intend to say today and the words that actually slip out of your mouth. It’s as if there is an impenetrable wall that makes your final message invisible to you until after you speak your piece. You might even be surprised when you compare what others tell you they heard with what you believe you said. Remember, good communication fosters healthy relationships."
aries,2017-07-17,"You are extra careful in everything you do today, trying to keep your hot temper under control while preparing for sudden breakage. Paradoxically, you may try to anticipate the unexpected, but it’s tricky to know exactly when and where the volatility might suddenly be released. No matter how anxious you feel now, there are no logical reasons to change everything all at once. Continue to cautiously move ahead with your agenda; putting any proactive strategy in place is better than doing nothing at all."
taurus,2017-07-17,"Your true colors shine when you stubbornly honor your own natural rhythms. Unfortunately, as you finally begin to roll out your plan, everything you do seems out of place, getting you off to a slow start. However, the heavens are rattling your cage today, checking to see how aware you are of any improvements that are overdue. Listen to constructive criticism with an open mind, but don’t let others bring you down. Take personal responsibility to break free of habits that no longer serve a purpose. Make space for positive change."
gemini,2017-07-17,"It appears as if you’re digging around in the secret fantasy world of wizards and witches, but you’re actually in a rut and just crave a bit of excitement. However, you can see through surface appearances now, while something continues to percolate deep within your own subconscious. Or, perhaps, someone is playing some sort of cloak-and-dagger game with you. In both cases, the buried tension is ready to erupt and the quicker you acknowledge the problem, the easier you can deal with the potential mess. Ultimately, this is an opportunity to be more independent, so strike while the iron is hot."
cancer,2017-07-17,"Obviously, it’s always wise to listen to your feelings, but today there’s an additional level of concern. You’re operating under the influence of impulsive Mars and crazy Uranus, making your actions impossible for anyone to predict. It may sound like fun to agitate a strange situation that isn't even yours -- until you are entangled and can’t break loose. It might even feel like someone has thrown a monkey wrench into the works. Regroup and shift gears as necessary to respond to the changing conditions. Flexibility allows you to reach your goals in record time."
leo,2017-07-17,"Although your life could be coasting along smoothly these days, unexpected challenges test your resolve today. It’s crucial to remain open to the feedback that you receive from the current circumstances. Be ready to quickly change direction if your plans begin to unravel. Nevertheless, it could be too soon to head off toward your new destination. Even if you think the time is right, don't hit your gas pedal until you look back one more time to appreciate where you have been. Bob Marley sang, ""In this bright future you can't forget your past."""
virgo,2017-07-17,"A rare bout with restlessness pushes you right to the edge of change, without going over. Climbing out on a limb captures your imagination now, regardless of how much you usually like to stick to solid ground. However, you still must make adjustments today, especially wherever you feel stifled or held back. But you may have to step outside of the logical realms, for it's possible to be analytically correct while still missing what's really important. Don't settle on the status quo if you can visualize something more closely aligned with your dreams."
libra,2017-07-17,"Just as you think every pitch is falling right into the zone, someone from work might throw you a curve ball. You may be angered by their actions today, but you still need to deal with the consequences the best you can. Nevertheless, avoid getting hooked into complex situations that go beyond your immediate concerns. There’s no reason to take responsibility for anyone else’s behavior. Calmly handle anything that’s within your control in the present moment; you can confidently move on once you reestablish your balance. Maya Angelou wrote, “Nothing can dim the light that shines from within.”"
scorpio,2017-07-17,"Predicting how the events of the day will play out is impossible today, even if your agenda is set in stone. No matter what, keep your attention focused on the road ahead at all times. Don't get lazy and allow yourself to be distracted by the lightning show on the horizon now, especially if it's not your storm to chase. On the other hand, being flexible is wise when change is in the atmosphere. Trust your instincts to tell you when to stay and when to go. Never apologize for listening to your intuition."
sagittarius,2017-07-17,"An intriguing situation may be developing now and you haven’t a clue where the current circumstances will take you. But oddly enough, you are more grounded than many of your friends and associates these days. Nevertheless, there's a nervous feeling taking root in a dark corner of your mind. Explore your unexpressed emotions and push some of them out into the light. Breathe deeply to reconnect with your center. Your pent-up energy can actually propel you toward your goals once you channel it correctly."
capricorn,2017-07-17,"You might feel as if you’re at the end of your rope today, and you’re unwilling to put up with someone’s broken promises or erratic actions any longer. Honestly, once you awaken to the truth, your entire perspective transforms and you cannot pretend everything is okay. However, you realize that you’re not going to change anyone’s behavior but your own. Modify your priorities as you go along; if you take care of your needs now, you will have plenty of energy left to give to those who deserve it down the line."
aquarius,2017-07-17,"Activities at work demand your total mental bandwidth now, yet they also bring you increased pleasure. Warrior Mars provokes your high-strung planet Uranus today, possibly turning your life inside out. Thankfully, your non-conformist ways are more rigid than most people realize. Nevertheless, a sudden change to your daily schedule is a major distraction while your need for freedom conflicts with your emotional security. Basketball coach Steve Kerr said, “The future is coming so fast, we can’t possibly predict it; we can only learn to respond quickly.”"
pisces,2017-07-17,"Letting go of an attachment that you still hold close creates a surprising rush of adrenaline, even if it hurts a bit in the process. Nevertheless, you may be quick to logically defend your plan against an unexpected attack today. This noisy confrontation is exacerbated because you think symbolically, yet must communicate verbally. Intellectual analysis won't get you through this dilemma now. Aim with your heart, instead."
aries,2017-07-18,"Everything appears to be coming up roses now, but there still may be lingering background stress in your life that won’t suddenly disappear. Although your calendar is cluttered with commitments, you still can find time to enjoy being with your friends without necessarily going into denial about everything else. You are a natural when it comes to making the most of the present moment. Apply your energy to lay the groundwork for what's on the horizon instead of just frittering away your day. Dr. Seuss wrote, “Only you can control your future.”"
taurus,2017-07-18,"These are the good old days but they won’t last forever. Nevertheless, everything seems to be in place, ensuring a memorable moment while beautiful Venus receives a cosmic blessing from lucky Jupiter today. Engage each moment as it arrives, for pleasure is as transitory as the hour. Nothing -- even the best experiences -- is immune from the passage of time. However, there is no reason to be afraid of what is around the bend. Focus your energy on practical ways to make your life more bountiful now. Happiness is yours for the asking, so soak in the good vibrations while they last."
gemini,2017-07-18,"You are a more-than-willing participant in mischief as an unusual set of circumstances attracts you to an emotional situation. On some other day, you might lightheartedly sidestep an intense interaction, but you’re eager to express your feelings today. Whatever you experience while connecting with others now supplies you with sweet memories that will stick with you for a long time into the future. Oscar Wilde wrote, ""To live is the rarest thing in the world. Most people just exist."""
cancer,2017-07-18,"Although you may experience a surge of unexpressed feelings rising to the surface today, it isn’t strong enough to pull you away from the sweetness of your life. However, negative emotions can still detract from an otherwise positive experience. Remain open to the love that is all around you now, even if you are wary of it morphing into something different from what you ultimately desire. Sri Chinmoy teaches, “Peace begins when expectation ends.”"
leo,2017-07-18,"The boundary between friends and lovers is thin while romantic good news is buzzing in the air today. Nevertheless, you must be open to receiving the message or it could quickly pass by without even being noticed. A close friendship may deepen, but the rewards are less emotional than practical. Your cosmic good luck might even bring you an unexpected cash windfall. But even the loveliest benefits won’t last forever. Everything feels wonderful now, but pleasure is fleeting -- so don't try to hold onto the moment too tightly. A Christian proverb warns, ""You only lose what you cling to."""
virgo,2017-07-18,"Your inconvenient feelings prompt you to share your ideas today, but you may choose to withhold the specifics of your plans. You probably should go ahead and express the details anyhow. Although careless emotional disclosure isn't your normal style, you feel safe enough now to take more of a chance with your heart. However, the problem is that once you begin to talk, it might be difficult to know when to stop unless you pay close attention to your audience. Start by stirring up whatever seems most stuck and let your words catalyze the process."
libra,2017-07-18,"It just doesn't seem to matter what actually happens today, since you're certain it will all turn out okay in the end.

Uncomfortable things must be said, but it should all work out for the best if you express them with love. Don't push your agenda overtly now; when the time is right, prosperity will be within your reach."
sagittarius,2017-07-18,"You may receive an optimistic boost of inspiration today, but it’s followed by constructive criticism about a recent project. Although you might be confused by the mixed messages at first, it’s hard to stay in a negative place for long. Additionally, others are more likely to notice the immediate results of your attitude shift, perhaps prompting an invitation to join them in more pleasurable pursuits outside of work. Enjoy the heightened notoriety and kick up your heels while you can. Don’t just look at the stars, be one."
capricorn,2017-07-18,"Your quiet self-satisfaction temporarily releases you from any stressful situations you recently encountered. Your coworkers and superiors see a more graceful and charming version of you today. You praise the aspirations of your peers and your unwavering optimism is reflected back at you.

Continue to explore your alternatives, leaving no stone unturned. The more you know, the more your confidence grows."
gemini,2017-07-19,"You might think you already have the answers to all of your questions, but today you realize the folly of your faulty assumption. In fact, your newfound awareness may be prompted by a close friend or partner who asks a seemingly innocent question. Nevertheless, it’s serious enough that it could ultimately alter your perspective. Don’t waste time blaming others for your lack of success. Set ambitious new goals and start showing the world what you can do."
cancer,2017-07-19,"You are enthusiastic about your long-term goals now, even if you have little time to think about them. It’s not that you’re a glutton for punishment, but you are in a production-minded phase and want something substantial to show for your efforts. However, you’re probably not quite ready to announce your plans for what’s next. Put the finishing touches on your professional agenda so you can take your work to the next level over the next few weeks. Basketball legend Michael Jordan said, “Limits, like fears, are often just an illusion.”"
leo,2017-07-19,"Your friends can’t get a word in edgewise today because you have so much you want to share with them. The chatty Gemini Moon takes up residence in your 11th House of Social Activities, increasing your time spent in the conversational spotlight while also attracting people with unconventional ideas. But you won’t likely say anything too controversial until your research is done because you’re unwilling to spread false facts. Albert Einstein said, “Whoever is careless with the truth in small matters cannot be trusted with important matters.”"
virgo,2017-07-19,"Your world has suddenly grown extra noisy, triggering you to think about how you can restore peace to your surroundings. But you’re not easily sidetracked by someone’s clever words or possible quick fixes today. You’re committed to finding a long-lasting answer that deals with the problem on a very fundamental level. Thankfully, your analytical powers are quite strong now; stick with your commitment to improve your environment. Remember what ecologist Barry Commoner wrote, “The first law of ecology is that everything is related to everything else.”"

In fact, your approach to deep and meaningful conversation often thrives on bringing up topics that are sensitive or controversial. Nevertheless, you have good reason for broaching subjects that a casual acquaintance might avoid, since you hope to shine the light of consciousness into the shadows. You’re serious about open communication and don’t want to take anyone’s honesty for granted. Fleshing out differences of opinion requires courage and respect. William Blake wrote, “Opposition is true friendship.”"
sagittarius,2017-07-19,"Everyone seems to be talking out of both sides of their mouths, making it currently impossible to trust what you hear. The trickster Gemini Moon is stirring up trouble in your 7th House of Others, creating the illusion of lots of words that are disconnected from one another. Meanwhile, you’re less interested in clever gossip now that you are hoping to take one heartfelt discussion to a transformational place. No one can deny your intense perspective if they converse with you today. Author Warren Bennis wrote, “There is a profound difference between information and meaning.”"
capricorn,2017-07-19,"Although there are plenty of tasks on your plate today, you are focused and eager to accomplish as much as you can.

Unfortunately, confronting the situation without creating additional turmoil is challenging.

There is a growing likelihood of conflict brewing between your needs and the expectations of others. You’re in control; there’s no reason to let your desire to be authentic interfere with your productivity. It's up to you to figure out a way to do your job without sacrificing your independence.

You have the power to let go of control, shake up the status quo and clear the way for something amazing to enter your life. But don't be too attached to a single outcome. Paradoxically, your natural grace and flexibility cultivate greater stability."
scorpio,2017-07-20,"Your emotional drive is strong, but you still might be able to find happiness if you’re willing to gamble with your heart. The key to making today count is your unconventional approach when it comes to expressing your feelings. Nearly everyone enjoys your unedited frankness and consistent originality. Even someone who normally opposes your efforts can be won over now that your brilliant style is undeniable. Nevertheless, you must support your performance with information of substance. Indian Prime Minister Nehru said, “Facts are facts and will not disappear on account of your likes.”"
sagittarius,2017-07-20,"Your aspirations could easily overtake reality if you let them. Your secret ambitions isolate you from others today, making it critical to untangle your inner world enough to express your thoughts clearly.

Showing your cards dissipates the resistance as quickly as it arrived. Hidden truths are unspoken lies."
capricorn,2017-07-20,"Ironically, your coworkers may distract you from your professional responsibilities today. Although you could easily choose to procrastinate, it’s not helpful in the long run to blow off your obligations.

aquarius,2017-07-20,"You typically keep your emotions out of the workplace, but speaking from your heart now can lead to potentially great rewards. Don't be the one who continually creates obstacles by imagining all the worst-case scenarios; instead, jump in with a can-do attitude. Stay focused on your ultimate destination at all times.

pisces,2017-07-20,"You may daydream of a hundred ways to leave your humdrum existence behind today. Your imaginative wanderings point you in the right direction and urge you to break out of your current cycle of boredom. But don't force any issues now, since you could alienate others with your passionate persuasion.

aries,2017-07-21,"You can improve the dynamics of a stressful relationship today by consciously going out of your way to reflect on what you hear.

Acknowledging that you’re an imperfect human allows others to do the same without embarrassment. Buddha taught, “To understand everything is to forgive everything.”"
cancer,2017-07-21,"Sometimes you want to take emotionally wounded people under your wings and protect them from the cruelty of the world. However, the Moon’s return to your sensitive sign may be problematic if you want to play the role of a nurturing mother hen to everyone. You can set yourself up for a fall if you forget the importance of creating healthy boundaries. It’s one thing to care for the wellbeing of others; it’s something entirely different when you sacrifice your needs to make someone else happy. Kindness is admirable, martyrdom is not."
leo,2017-07-21,"You might feel like one part of your life is coming to an end, but the truth is that a fresh cycle is about to be launched.

You might feel as if you’re not fully understood by others or that you’re on the periphery of a group rather than being an integral part of it. However, your feelings of isolation probably originate within you and not from anyone else. Consider those fears or insecurities you haven’t shared with your peers and what would happen if you take a chance and reveal another layer of your being. Shakespeare wrote, “No legacy is so rich as honesty.”"
libra,2017-07-21,"You want to be the hero who saves the day but, oddly enough, you don’t want the spotlight shining on you. You enjoy working your magic as part of a larger group today, preferring back stage to center stage. Nevertheless, you’ll likely receive accolades for your contribution in the days ahead. There’s no reason to maneuver toward recognition, but don’t avoid it when it comes to you. Confucius said, “Respect yourself and others will respect you.”"
scorpio,2017-07-21,"Your passions are often so profound that they make even you slightly uncomfortable. Your emotions are powerful today but, fortunately, they are singing in harmony with your current relationships. You are solidly standing at the center of your own heart and exude a clarity that puts people at ease, whether or not they’re usually willing to relinquish control to their feelings. Your steadiness is a lesson for everyone now, even if it requires a leap of faith on your part."
sagittarius,2017-07-21,"You are in a familiar place and see a boundless horizon that’s calling for your participation. You’re eager to turn the blank slate of tomorrow into a big adventure, but you’re not quite ready to leave your current situation in hopes of creating a new one. Instead of blindly running forward, stand with one foot in the past and one in the future. Contemplating your present position enables you to clearly see what needs to be completed before you’re free to begin your next journey.

Mythologist Joseph Campbell wrote, “The cave you fear to enter holds the treasures you seek.”"
aquarius,2017-07-21,"You have a job to do today and fully intend to finish it before the weekend. However, you’re aware of the shrinking time constraints and may be worried that you will fall short of your goal. Fortunately, you have the willpower to eliminate activities that don’t directly contribute to the task at hand. You might even unintentionally brush others off  while you concentrate on your work. You are a force to be reckoned with when you’re on a mission. Dr. Hans Selye wrote, “Adopting the right attitude can convert a negative stress into a positive one.”"
pisces,2017-07-21,"Your heightened sensitivity enables you to tune into the unfulfilled needs of your friends and associates. Although your ability to empathize is truly a precious gift, it can be exhausting to manage at times. You’re like a psychic sponge now, and it’s challenging to separate your stuff from the external noise. You could be so sidetracked with everyone else’s stories that you lose touch with your own. Author Nancy Levin wrote, “Each time you set a healthy boundary, you say yes to more freedom.”"
aries,2017-07-22,"You’re on the edge of a resurgence of energy that will fuel your confidence and bring more joy into your life. Of course, a shift in your attitude won’t occur overnight, but you will likely feel more positive day by day as the radiant Sun and courageous Mars collaborate in your 5th House of Spontaneity.

Zig Ziglar taught, “You can’t climb uphill by thinking downhill thoughts.”"
gemini,2017-07-22,"Although you might try to overcompensate today by displaying only your very best side, this deceptive strategy won’t work. Your positive attitude could sound disingenuous if you seem blindly optimistic about your future plans. There is no value in hiding the truth now, even if you think it is more than people can handle. You are in charge of your thoughts, so don’t dwell endlessly on those things that bend you out of shape. Stick to the facts and let others be responsible for their reactions. Sincerity is your friend."
cancer,2017-07-22,"You may be relieved once the bright Sun leaves your sign today, allowing you to work your magic quietly behind the scenes. Nevertheless, you don’t want too much isolation now that the Sun is shining in expressive Leo. Although you wish you had one singular goal so you could simply get on with your business, you’re actually being pulled in two totally different directions.

leo,2017-07-22,"You’re often resistant to change, especially if you let your notorious pride block your progress. However, you’re already walking in uncharted territory now, and your anticipation continues to build because you can’t wait to see where this current road leads.

virgo,2017-07-22,"You’re disappointed to discover that someone is withholding information from you. Thankfully, you can skillfully manage the problem now that the illuminating Sun, assertive Mars and communicator Mercury are camped out in your 12th House of Secrets. An awkward situation can quickly morph into a positive one if you display confidence rather than doubt.

Fortunately, the brilliant Sun strides into your 11th House of Community to join forces with action-hero Mars, inspiring you to act boldly in social situations.

President Dwight Eisenhower said, “In preparing for battle I have always found that plans are useless, but planning is indispensable.”"
scorpio,2017-07-22,"You must navigate through a tricky moment if someone believes you will automatically drop your personal priorities when asked. You prefer offering your help on your own accord and you don’t appreciate the pressure resulting from the expectations of others. People will manage without you immediately rushing to the rescue today. Carefully considering all your options before responding may signal that you don’t want anyone to take advantage of your generosity. But you can’t assume your message will be heard unless you are explicit. Cat Stevens sang, “Say what you think; think what you mean.”"

Your intentions may have been very sincere in the moment, but situations change as the months roll by. It feels as if your time is running short now and you don’t know how you’re going to fulfill your obligations. Keep in mind that even the tiniest molehills seem like mountains today.

capricorn,2017-07-22,"Having faith in yourself is crucial for success, but too much confidence can inflate your ego.

Fortunately, the demonstrative Leo New Moon activates your 3rd House of Communication, amplifying your gift of gab. You are optimistic that you can get your message across efficiently, but your lack of follow-through may confuse others.

The Leo New Moon points to your 8th House of Shared Resources, indicating that working with someone else is a strategic move. However, the current situation becomes tricky if another person needlessly flaunts their power. Don't waste time fighting an obvious display of emotional insecurity. Instead, concentrate on negotiating solid agreements with your partners to ensure mutual success down the road."
aquarius,2017-07-23,"A friend or relative may be acting exceptionally nice, but you can’t help but wonder if there is more going on than meets your eye. You might be feeling extra pressure to perform in a certain way while the melodramatic Leo New Moon agitates your 7th House of Companions. However, it’s highly unlikely people are scheming against you today. It's more likely that you’re afraid to fully trust the positive vibes floating in the atmosphere. Fortunately, there's no rush; respond only when your heart is ready."
pisces,2017-07-23,"You might feel as if you’re talking to a wall today, especially if others seem disinterested in your story. Keep in mind the dramatic Leo New Moon occupies your 6th House of Details, making it nearly impossible to envision the entire picture. Unconsciously pushing ahead with your plans by turning them into a performance can raise the ire of your peers. Taking smaller steps allows you to make steady progress without hogging the spotlight. Ultimately, a new strategy based on toning down your vision and focusing on one project at a time is the most reliable path to your success."

Cerebral Mercury harmonizes with radical Uranus in your impulsive sign, encouraging you to break the rules in order to free yourself from unwanted restrictions.

Author Peter Zarlenga wrote, “No authority is higher than reality.”"
taurus,2017-07-24,"You may grow agitated when you discover that people are making excuses for you today. At first, you’re sure you heard something wrong; after all, you haven’t done anything that warrants your friends covering for you now. Nevertheless, you might need to apply some self-restraint because you believe that your thoughts create reality. But it’s important to remember the saying, “If you build it, they will come.” Take a risk; move out of your head and into the real world."
gemini,2017-07-24,"You might feel as if you’re a flower that is beginning to close. You have already enjoyed your glorious days in the Sun; now it’s time to turn inward and catch up on your sleep. Unfortunately, there is no rest for the wicked and you could be busier than ever with people to see and places to go. The upside to your fast-paced life is that you thrive on variety. The downside is you can exhaust yourself before you know it. Nevertheless, you need a vacation and it’s not going to happen unless you start working on it now. When all else fails, take a nap."
cancer,2017-07-24,"You are receiving mixed messages while conflicting planetary patterns battle for your attention. Independent Uranus tells you there's no reason to act hesitantly as long as you’re being truthful. However, nothing is as simple as it appears because the present dynamic also includes strict Saturn who commands you to keep a stiff upper lip and push on through your resistance. It may seem impossible at first, but you must find a way to be both spontaneous and patient at the same time. Kurt Cobain said, “Wanting to be someone else is a waste of who you are.”"
leo,2017-07-24,"You can’t stop the flow of outrageous thoughts today, but you can exercise your intelligence before acting on every single idea. However, you’re not ready to listen to any advice that tells you no. But sooner or later you’ll come back to that same nugget of wisdom and realize that self-moderation is a major component to happiness. Author Rusty Eric wrote, “As long as greed is stronger than compassion, there will always be suffering.”"
virgo,2017-07-24,"You’re eager to bust out of your self-imposed isolation and rejoin your friends today, but a severe work schedule might be enough to keep you inside and out of trouble. Still, you’re searching for ways to express your frustration; nevertheless, don’t be foolish and send an email before you reread it. If you’re looking to uncover the real you, be prepared to do it once and for all. Psychologist Sidney Jourard wrote, “Perhaps the most important reason for self-disclosure is that without it we cannot truly love.”"
libra,2017-07-24,"You have your heart set on a big-ticket item today, but you may need to process your disappointment if you face financial constraints. Perhaps you decide it is prudent to forgo a fancy shopping excursion or delay your acquisition of a fine piece of art. Stop the purchase of anything you don’t actually need now; Turn your attention away from the material world and toward life-altering experiences. Fortunately, your friends are there to help you through this rocky transition with plenty of fun suggestions. Collect memories, not objects."
scorpio,2017-07-24,"You’re looking for your place in the world and could pull some very impressive work out of your past in order to prove your qualifications for your next adventure. If you’re applying for a new job or enrolling in school, allow plenty of time to get your application materials in order. Whatever you envision for your upcoming endeavor, you’re tempted to lean on your unique form of brilliance now, rather than a more methodical approach. However, a healthy dose of practicality serves you well. Benjamin Disraeli wrote, “Diligence is the mother of good fortune.”"
sagittarius,2017-07-24,"You might believe you’re invincible today as you naively proceed along your path to success. Your goals are set high and your current strength is your unwavering self-confidence. Unfortunately, you can’t hold this level of enthusiasm forever. Your positive attitude develops a few weak spots that reveal your vulnerabilities. Nevertheless, you may need to step into a discussion on your own behalf. Instead of using your authority to shut down a conversation, open it up by asking meaningful questions. Queen Rania of Jordan said, “We are stronger when we listen, and smarter when we share.”"
capricorn,2017-07-24,"You are an expert at setting aside short-term desires in order to reach long-term goals. Lovely Venus enters into a tug-of-war with your key planet Saturn today, initiating an internal conflict between expressing love and fulfilling your job obligations. You might want to allocate some time for self-reflection now. The first step to obtaining what you want is having the courage to get rid of those things that you don’t want. Memories take you back; dreams take you forward."
aquarius,2017-07-24,"A one-on-one relationship may thrive now, but connections with your larger group of friends might be more tenuous. Although your social network is often on your mind, you may run into a wall when you try to smooth out the wrinkles. It’s as if you’re being excluded today, yet no one will address your awkward position in this newly created hierarchy. Author Ellen Wittlinger wrote, “When there’s an elephant in the room, you can’t pretend it isn’t there and just discuss the ants.” Never forget, you are your most passionate advocate."

In fact, you’re maintaining a rather positive outlook today, even in the face of serious opposition. Don’t waste your energy trying to win a popularity contest. And let no one discourage you from your worthy cause. Self-motivation is key; you don’t need a fan club to achieve your goals. Dance with a light heart and sing a song of freedom."
aries,2017-07-25,"There is a lot to do today and you are eager to demonstrate your competence. You want everyone to see how successful you can be when you put your heart and soul into your work. But you’re not planning on going quietly off into the shadows; you still seek the spotlight where you can put on your dog-and-pony show. Accomplishing your professional objectives is an admirable goal, but don’t forget to honor your personal needs, too. Fred Rogers said, “The real drama of life is never center stage. It’s always in the wings.”"
taurus,2017-07-25,"It’s as if a cloud of uncertainty is lifting and you finally see clearly into the distance.

Arthur Ashe wrote, “Success is a journey, not a destination. The doing is often more important than the outcome.”"
gemini,2017-07-25,"You like it when there are lots of alternatives in your life, but you might need to make a decision today that eliminates several possibilities in one fell swoop. The pragmatic Virgo Moon enters your 4th House of Security, pitting the excitement of multiple roads with the fear of taking the wrong one. Rather than seeing your current choice as a final judgment, view it as another point on your journey of discovery. Poet Emily Dickinson wrote, “Dwell in possibility.”"
cancer,2017-07-25,"Your words seem to have more importance than your actions, possibly because your message is so on point today. You cleverly make your case with great efficiency and eloquence. Naturally, you must follow through with behavior that supports your position, but it’s the actual verbal or written delivery of your thoughts that creates the greatest influence on your future now. Self-improvement guru Paul J. Meyer wrote, “Communication -- the human connection -- is the key to personal and career success.”"
leo,2017-07-25,"Your finances are on your mind today, but not only for paying bills or creating a budget.

President Barack Obama said, “Money is not the only answer, but it makes a difference.”"
virgo,2017-07-25,"The cosmos gives you a taste of your favorite flavors today as you trade a dreamy fantasy for the real thing. The Moon’s return to your discerning sign, followed by logical Mercury, pulls you out of the clouds of illusion and sets you on solid ground. But you could be so intrigued by one unusual element that you ignore everything else. You’re sure that your new obsession is a path to happiness; nevertheless, you could narrow your perceptions so much that you miss the forest for the trees. Thoreau wrote, “It’s not what you look at that matters, it’s what you see.”"
libra,2017-07-25,"You may begin a process of detaching from the busyness of social activities as yesterday’s fun becomes today’s distraction. An associate might criticize your behavior if he or she feels abandoned by your disappearing act. But you are not trying to escape; in fact, you’re doing whatever you can to increase your productivity over the days ahead. Don’t waste energy attempting to justify your temporary self-imposed isolation. Benjamin Franklin wrote, “Well done is better than well said.”"
scorpio,2017-07-25,"You’re less interested in getting ahead now than you are in furthering the objectives of your entire workgroup. Ultimately, you’re primarily concerned with your career trajectory, but a quick assessment of the situation enables you to see the value of being a team player today.

However, the detail-oriented Virgo Moon is traveling through your 10th House of Public Responsibility now, urging you to limit your discussions to concrete career objectives. Find that sweet spot where fantasy and reality merge. Author Paulo Coelho wrote, “It’s the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting.”"
capricorn,2017-07-25,"Paradoxically, you can bring the power of logical analysis to the irrational realms of fantasy today. Balancing your nebulous dreams with exacting goals is tricky work, yet you seem to walk the fine line between fact and fancy with great finesse now. Your down-to-earth manner enables you to leave a trail of accomplishments in your wake. Nevertheless, you don’t need to justify your present actions by pointing to your past achievements. Poet Leo Christopher wrote, “You’ll just keep crashing if you never take your eyes off the rearview mirror.”"
aquarius,2017-07-25,"People may go out of their way to communicate their feelings to you today. Although you hear the words that are spoken, your intuition is telling you something significant is being left unsaid. Normally, you have a high tolerance level for uncertainty and are willing to wait for the missing information to surface. However, the Moon’s visit to your 8th House of Deep Sharing leaves you unsatisfied until the whole picture is in sight. Put on your detective badge and start asking questions. You’ll get to the bottom of the mystery faster than you think if you are willing to keep an open mind."
pisces,2017-07-25,"It’s a familiar frustration when someone close to you wants more details about your feelings than you can provide. It’s not that you’re unwilling to share; it’s just that your emotions extend out past the limits of language. Your efforts to put the complexity of your soul into a paragraph fall disappointingly short. Science fiction author Frank Herbert wrote, “Words are such gross machinery, so primitive and ambiguous.” Express your heart through art."
aries,2017-07-26,"Your confidence is soaring and your energy level is off the charts. You may be feeling invincible now that your key planet Mars aligns with the expressive Leo Sun. You might even assume you can do whatever needs to be done faster than anyone else. Although you are outwardly optimistic, the bad news is that you belatedly realize there’s something you forgot. Keep revisiting recent events to uncover the missing clue. Don’t even think about giving up today when you’re so close to the truth."
taurus,2017-07-26,"One of your ongoing concerns is how to keep motivated as you drive toward your goals without pushing against others too forcefully. If you’re overly aggressive, you may face negative consequences as someone backs away, leaving you on your own. However, your emotional intensity is hot right now -- maybe even too hot to handle. Use your moral compass to stay on course. You don’t have to put out your internal fire; you just need to find a constructive outlet for your irrepressible energy. Ben Franklin wrote, “If passion drives you, let reason hold the reins.”"
gemini,2017-07-26,"A unique situation is unfolding which may take you down various paths now, depending on your current relationship status. If you are blessed to have a supportive partner, you can work together to make something special happen. But unexpressed discord could suddenly erupt, possibly forcing an overdue confrontation. Naturally, some conflicts are resolved immediately, while others take longer to fix. Nevertheless, some subjects act like lightning rods, attracting an argument. Practicing compromise is a delicate procedure, but it is exactly what the doctor ordered to restore harmony."
cancer,2017-07-26,"Take full responsibility for your body today, but don’t just run to the internet to search for the latest-breaking news story about another amazing elixir. Seriously reassess what you can do to improve your physical endurance and cultivate healing. Forget about discovering a magical fix; healthy changes to your diet and lifestyle will positively impact your well-being. Set yourself up for maximum success by starting with small but significant steps, building from this foundation as you begin to see tangible results. Desiderius Erasmus wrote, ""Prevention is better than cure."""
leo,2017-07-26,"You may attempt to impose your will on those around you today, simply due to your exuberance. Your inner resolve is unwavering and your outer strength is fierce while warrior Mars connects with the brilliant Sun. Unfortunately, petty ego disputes can lead to unnecessary conflict now, which would be a total waste of this planetary boost. Use this powerful cosmic momentum to push toward greater accomplishments, instead. Make art, not war."
virgo,2017-07-26,"Unexpressed emotions are rattled now, and confronting them may raise old unresolved feelings of anger. Your down-to-earth orientation inspires you to possess a pragmatic attitude toward life. Nevertheless, it’s easy to mix up childhood memories with current circumstances, making it more difficult to manage the situation. Thankfully, exploring the differences between then and now can free you from repeating old patterns once again."
libra,2017-07-26,"Although you’re likely to share your thoughts on a regular basis, you can usually say what you want from an objective perspective. However, it may be more challenging to separate your feelings and opinions from your identity today. Unfortunately, you might grow aggressive in your own defense if you are overly attached to your position. Moderate your emotions by acknowledging that everyone has valid ideas to bring to the table. Philanthropist Bernard Baruch wrote, “Most of the successful people I’ve known are the ones who do more listening than talking.”"
scorpio,2017-07-26,"Your current position on a work-related issue is likely to be controversial and you’re not afraid to share your thoughts with everyone you encounter. However, you may be so concise in your communication that others think your delivery is too smooth. They might not trust your message if it sounds perfectly rehearsed. There’s no reason to worry; the reactions of others are out of your control. Just concentrate on telling the most convincing story possible and then let everyone make up their own mind."
sagittarius,2017-07-26,"A tiny spark can start a fire in your belly that grows hotter throughout the day. The hyperactive Sun-Mars conjunction highlights your 9th House of Big Ideas, motivating you to pursue your adventurous dreams. However, you may grow restless if you’re unable to break free from previous commitments. It’s absolutely critical to find healthy ways to burn off your excess energy today or you may get drawn into a needless fight. Exploring all your options now increases your chances for success."
capricorn,2017-07-26,"You may feel irritable today and yet you can’t put your finger on the source of your malaise. There are hidden issues stewing in the minds of your friends now, and it’s to your advantage to persuade them to reveal their secrets. However, others might misread your intentions if you’re asking too many pointed questions. Ultimately, it’s your insecurity that could exacerbate the problem; setting your ego aside and expressing your willingness to listen makes all the difference in the world. Author Cheryl Richardson wrote, “People start to heal the moment they feel heard.”"
aquarius,2017-07-26,"A surge of powerful energy is coming your way today. But the real question is whether or not you can acknowledge the incoming intensity and put it to proper use. If you’re unable to ride the creative waves, you may take your frustration out on a friend by overstating your anger. Nevertheless, you shock others with amazing ideas if you find a way to integrate your emotions. Open your heart to the potential while your originality runs strong. Draw your inspiration from the deepest wells in the most unexpected places."
pisces,2017-07-26,"Your ambitions are calling today, and you’re eager to show your coworkers what you can accomplish. Nevertheless, your enthusiastic behavior may pose some danger if you inadvertently create conflict in your quest to achieve your objectives. Thankfully, your happiness doesn’t need to come at the expense of anyone else. Even if your ego is telling you otherwise now, there is plenty of room for multiple winners. The more the merrier when it comes to success."
aries,2017-07-27,"Although the good news keeps getting better, you’re holding a healthy dose of self-doubt in reserve today. It’s as if you’re afraid to acknowledge something is going right because it might suddenly disappear in a puff of smoke. Nevertheless, so much now depends on how you respond to current opportunities. Realistically examine the pros and cons of the present circumstances but don’t question your ability to make the most of the moment. After all, living spontaneously is what you spunky Aries do best."
taurus,2017-07-27,"You might believe that your newfound superpowers enable you to accomplish anything you set your mind to now. However, reality is the great scorekeeper and will likely reveal a more complex path to success. Don’t allow discouragement to steal your thunder at the first sign of a setback. Establishing attainable goals is as important as working toward achieving them. Richard Branson said, “If somebody offers you an amazing opportunity but you are not sure you can do it, say yes -- then learn how to do it later.”"
gemini,2017-07-27,"You’re all about the presentation today because you want your peers to admire you. However, you could end up putting so much energy into creating a memorable show that you appear stiff. Don’t set superiority as your goal; instead, aim for spontaneity. Naturally, you must be prepared and know your material. However, others will want to work and play with you now because of who you are. Beauty is the opposite of perfection -- it’s about confidence, charisma and character."
cancer,2017-07-27,"You feel quite magnanimous toward your friends and family, often going out of your way to shower them with praise or gifts. However, you could be generous to a fault today, giving so much that you leave little left over for your own needs. Self-improvement can be just as important now as doing good deeds. Ultimately, finding the balance between caring for yourself and loving others is a never-ending dance. Colonel William Prescott wrote, “Self-interest, be it enlightened, works indirectly for the public good.”"
leo,2017-07-27,"There’s no need to look far for love and affection today, because those closest to you bring the greatest joy into your life.

Anyone who keeps learning stays young.”"
virgo,2017-07-27,"A trivial event might trigger a deeper exploration now as you reexamine what you value most. Someone may challenge one of your core beliefs, prompting you to defend your honor. However, rationalizing your choices won’t restore harmony to your world; in fact, your words could foster a needless conflict today. Instead of engaging in a verbal sparring match, let your actions speak for you. Bertrand Russell wrote, “It’s coexistence or no existence.”"
libra,2017-07-27,"People are drawn to you today because they think you have all the answers, or at least, a viable plan. However, you may not see yourself in the same light as others do. From your perspective, you are looking at a goal in the distance and you’re trying to figure out how to reach it, just like everyone else. Mother Teresa advised, “If you have not the experience, ask. There is no shame in asking, but do not pretend you know when you don’t.”"
scorpio,2017-07-27,"You can’t put your finger on the source of your optimism today, but it seems that you have hidden helpers in the midst. It’s as if there are angels watching over you and intervening on your behalf. It doesn’t matter where the cosmic assistance is coming from; you’re poised to gain rewards from your current pursuit of success. However, satisfaction is not linked to a promotion at work; it’s connected with being in touch with your heart. Magic is everywhere for those who believe."
sagittarius,2017-07-27,"Your lack of perspective tempts you to spend more time dreaming about distant horizons and strategizing about long-term goals than meeting your current obligations. Although your coworkers might feel abandoned, your friends are very supportive of your big-picture thinking now. However, finding a balance between the present and the future enables you to remain productive while also imagining a more perfect life. Helen Keller wrote, “The only thing worse than being blind is having sight but no vision.”"
capricorn,2017-07-27,"You may consider initiating a power play today if you think you’re ready to assume control of a project at work. This won’t come as a surprise to your peers because your recent efforts have set you up for this ambitious move. The good news is you can consolidate your influence by organizing your resources. However, your prosperity is linked more with how you apply your skills to the current circumstances. Author Michael Martin Hammer wrote, “A successful career will no longer be about promotion. It will be about mastery.”"
aquarius,2017-07-27,"You are in such a dynamic growth phase that it’s challenging to keep up with all that you’re learning about yourself and your world. New opportunities for study, travel or creative projects inspire you to imagine options that would have been out of the question until now. If others are encouraging you to choose a different direction in life, take their advice very seriously. You are on the precipice of a whole new adventure. Let the universe know you’re open to the possibilities. Professor Andrew Murphy said, “You are confined only by the walls you build yourself.”"
pisces,2017-07-27,"Although you might be blessed with an unexpected cash windfall in the form of a gift or an inheritance today, it’s more likely the benefits will be of the metaphysical sort. Your life is in the process of taking off to unimaginable heights, but you won’t do as well operating on your own. Exploring a new partnership at work is a propitious undertaking because you stand to gain a lot from others now. Sometimes the things with the greatest value are not things. Author Elbert Hubbard wrote, “Work to become, not to acquire.”"
aries,2017-07-28,"Encouragement from allies continues to strengthen your resolve, but even the tiniest cracks in your confidence prompt you to wonder if you’re still on the right track. You set your professional goals high and you’re determined to climb the ladder of success right to the top. Ambition is healthy as long as you don’t ride roughshod over your supporters on your way up. Winners are ordinary people with extraordinary hearts."
taurus,2017-07-28,"It might seem as if you have everything under control today, but a slight misjudgment can unravel your plans quickly. Although your analysis led you to an obvious conclusion, a twist of fate makes you wish you didn’t climb so far out on a limb. Unfortunately, there is no easy formula for untangling this logistical mess and finding your way back to safety. Take each step one at a time, without assuming you know what comes next. Motivational speaker Garrison Wynn said, “Action and adaptability create opportunity.”"
gemini,2017-07-28,"You could easily take your current creative energy too far today, threatening the safety net that’s already in place at work. Naturally, you want to express your passion while also demonstrating your productivity, but it’s challenging to balance your artistic inclination with the practical considerations of the day. Take a moment to reevaluate your skills and be certain you know what’s expected of you before you do something you might soon regret. People with good intentions make promises; people with good character keep them."
cancer,2017-07-28,"Keeping your desires under wraps seems like a smart strategy today. You don’t want to create any weird interpersonal dynamics and you’re afraid that talking about your feelings will complicate matters at work. It appears as if sharing your attractions and repulsions is not the problem; it’s how others respond that makes things messy. However, as Noam Chomsky wrote, “You are responsible for the predictable consequences of your actions.”"
leo,2017-07-28,"Believe it or not, you can’t continue to pack more and more activities into your day without hitting a wall. Intellectually, you realize there are complex logistics in the mix that also influence your decision-making process. Nevertheless, you might play a game with reality today as you push the limits in order to establish a new boundary. Mountaineer Jim Whittaker said, “You learn the most when you’re out on the edge.”"
virgo,2017-07-28,"Exercising a bit of caution makes a lot of sense today when it comes to sharing your opinions. Although your comments may be welcome by most people, you could provoke the ire of an opponent if your criticism is based on unfulfilled needs. You might not even realize how much your frustrations are communicated alongside everything you say and do. Zig Ziglar wrote, “You cannot tailor-make the situations in life, but you can tailor-make the attitudes to fit those situations.”"
libra,2017-07-28,"Agreeing with you is easy because you act as if your beliefs are ultimately no different than anyone else’s. Nevertheless, you can ruffle someone’s feathers today if you think he or she is spouting nonsense. You possess plenty of good will and smooth charm, but you’re unwilling to let someone grab the controls and throw your day into turmoil. Winston Churchill said, “Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak; courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen.”"
scorpio,2017-07-28,"At first, you seem to be very optimistic today, encouraging others to take risks and live out their dreams. But in return, you also expect your friends to demonstrate their loyalty by fully supporting your ideas. However, your upbeat perspective can change as quickly as the people around you shift their positions. Nevertheless, if someone doesn’t seem so enamored with your plans, don’t press the issue. Instead of wasting your time by creating a showdown now, just get on with your work. Your success will be the sweetest revenge."
sagittarius,2017-07-28,"Your future is looking brighter than ever but you’re not sure where to channel all of your current enthusiasm. On one hand, you’re ready to take on the world; whatever reality throws at you today becomes grist for your mill. On the other hand, you wish you could entirely avoid the noise of crowds now. Honestly, you could benefit from a temporary break in the action. A little peace and quiet gives you the chance to manifest your dreams."
capricorn,2017-07-28,"Your attention span is limited today, tempting you to grow bored of recent developments at work. However, it’s not wise to walk away from an opportunity before you even explore what it offers. Just be sure to question everything today; if you start off with bad data, you’ll likely compound the problem and end up with faulty conclusions. Check your assumptions and doublecheck your sources for the best results."
aquarius,2017-07-28,"You’re eager to take an idea and run with it as far as you can go. But it’s perfectly normal if you start to doubt your actions somewhere along the way. Remember to maintain a balanced approach when uncovering the truth or you could lead yourself astray. You recognize there’s a fine line between unbiased information and subjective opinions, enticing you to dance on the edge where reality is uncertain enough that you can make it whatever you choose. Albert Einstein quipped, “If the facts don’t fit the theory, change the facts.”"
pisces,2017-07-28,"You might not share the same perspective as your friends today, but you don’t need to make a big deal over your differences. In fact, there’s something important for you to learn by seeing an issue from another point of view. Forget about trying to prove who is right; instead, assume there is truth in both positions. Tom Robbins wrote, “Our similarities bring us to a common ground; our differences allow us to be fascinated by each other.” Diversity is the spice of life."
aries,2017-07-29,"You don’t want to stick to the agenda today, especially if you think someone made it arbitrarily. It’s as if you need to shake up the energy just to show others that you’re in control of your own life. Unfortunately, there are smarter ways to achieve your autonomy than behaving like a toddler in a rebellious manner. Instead of refusing to acknowledge another person’s authority, do something constructive by exercising your own. You must give respect if you want to receive it."
taurus,2017-07-29,"Your determination can lead to a standoff with someone who is as stubborn as you. Ironically, you seem less interested in making your point now than in sustaining the deadlock for as long as possible. It’s as if you derive pleasure from managing not to flinch before your opponent. Nevertheless, it makes sense to consider your motives and adjust your behavior accordingly. Creating an undesired stalemate serves no one at all. President Jimmy Carter said, “Unless both sides win, no agreement can be permanent.”"
gemini,2017-07-29,"You’re happily anticipating a thoroughly enjoyable day but someone may be standing in your way, preventing you from pursuing fun. Normally, you would discuss the problem with the other person and come to a solution that works for both of you. However, you might grow weary of social niceties today and just want to get on with making new memories. Unfortunately, your abrupt behavior could escalate a routine delay into a major crisis. Zhu Feng wrote, “Cooperation means win-win; confrontation means lose-lose.”"
cancer,2017-07-29,"There’s a special satisfaction you derive from taking care of your personal possessions. Whether you are refinishing a cherished piece of furniture, sorting through family heirlooms, or just tinkering about your home, you love surrounding yourself with your favorite things. However, what begins as a casual activity could transform into a major project today. Remember, you define what is important to you by where you spend your time. Energy flows where attention goes."
leo,2017-07-29,"Yesterday’s exuberance morphs into today’s frustration. You’re ready for a busy day, but one thing after another delays you from getting to the beach, the gym or the mall. Dealing with the practical side of life takes precedence over chasing fun in the Sun or other enjoyable excursions. Nevertheless, you might reach a breaking point where you suddenly run away from your responsibilities and grab a fleeting moment of pleasure while you can. Do it now. Sometimes later becomes never."
virgo,2017-07-29,"A plethora of domestic chores may keep you from attending a social event today. But the truth is you might be feeling like you need some time to yourself, anyway. You like the idea of being alone now, and claiming that your household responsibilities are piling up is as good an excuse as any. However, you don’t have to make up reasons for your current craving for solitude. Banksy wrote, “If you get tired, learn to rest not to quit.”"
libra,2017-07-29,"You’re attempting to maintain your calm and cool demeanor now, but it’s tough when your relationships with your friends are under stress. You’ve recently tried multiple strategies to improve conditions, but your social life is like a bee in a bouquet of flowers: you like their smell but you don’t want to be stung. There is nothing to be gained by making a speech and adhering to it today. Instead, trust your instincts and react honestly in the moment. Make yourself your main priority if you want others to do the same."
scorpio,2017-07-29,"Your true nature is hermetically sealed once you decide to keep your feelings quiet. However, there’s a price to be paid for cutting yourself off from those who love you. You might regret hiding your emotions and attempt to make moves to rectify the situation now. However, don’t lead with anger or resentment today; just open your heart and see what happens. You may be pleasantly surprised with how quickly people warm back up to you as the ice melts away. Taking full responsibility for your mistakes is a wonderful place to start."
sagittarius,2017-07-29,"Your close friends know you well enough to see through your happy-go-lucky exterior. However, there are times when covering your serious thoughts with a smile is not only a waste of energy, it can do harm. If you have an ax to grind today, go ahead and do it. If you are struggling with a weighty issue now, share your burden with a trustworthy companion. It’s only when you are completely vulnerable that you can be completely strong."
capricorn,2017-07-29,"You enjoy your current role as a gracious host, but it grows old if you don’t feel appreciated. It’s even worse if you’re stuck in the position because it’s your responsibility to make sure everyone else is happy now. But taking care of people’s needs is disingenuous if you don’t really want the job. Either submit to your social obligation by fully embracing it today, or stop going through the motions to placate others. Don’t try to be perfect; just be honest."
aquarius,2017-07-29,"You woke up with a special agenda today and are eager to get started. However, your friends and family might make demands on your time that detract from your original intentions. Avoid the temptation to just slip away and do your own thing now without addressing the awkward relationship dynamics. You don’t have to turn the situation into a major drama. Simply inform people of your plans and let the chips fall as they may. Those who love you know you need your space."
pisces,2017-07-29,"Previously made commitments may cycle back to haunt you today, especially if you don’t feel like participating in a scheduled event. Unfortunately, you could leave someone in a difficult position if you pull out at the last minute. Obviously, the sooner you address the issue with those involved, the better it will be for all. Nevertheless, mentally reframing the entire activity might enable you to follow through with your promise while maintaining your self-respect. Winston Churchill said, “Attitude is a little thing that makes a big difference.”"
aries,2017-07-30,"Your senses are alive with anticipation as you imagine sweet pleasures, whether or not you can actually pursue them in the real world. You’ll take nearly any chance you can get to break away from your regular routine today, even if your actions are ill-advised. Hopefully, you understand that wishing with all your might doesn’t mean your dreams will come true. Oddly enough, sometimes the fantasy is better than the reality. Actor Ryan Reynolds said, “When you have expectations, you are setting yourself up for disappointment.”"
taurus,2017-07-30,"Someone may be tugging on your heart strings or your purse strings today, and you’re not sure whether you like it or not. Naturally, you’re flattered when a person is attracted to you, but it’s challenging to read other people’s motives. You are intrigued by a possible connection with an individual you admire, but your intuition is waving red flags now. The mature response is to avoid unnecessary trouble at all costs. However, your heart has its own agenda and will not be denied. Never make permanent decisions on temporary feelings."
gemini,2017-07-30,"You prefer to keep your current interactions on a casual basis, but someone’s presence could set off a warning bell today. An inner voice advises you to run while you still have a chance, but you want to pursue a conversation with this person of interest. There’s no reason to close your heart out of fear, unless you create a whole palette of unrealistic expectations that can only lead to disillusionment. Charles Dickens wrote, “A loving heart is the truest wisdom.”"
cancer,2017-07-30,"Your desires are sending signals in several directions, attracting people and circumstances outside of your normal lifestyle. However, you’re uncomfortable sharing your personal business too quickly because you’re naturally overprotective when disclosure triggers your emotions. Nevertheless, don’t allow your feelings to go dormant now; keep your passions alive by feeding your dreams with your awareness. Poet Mark Strand wrote, “Old ways won’t open new doors.”"
leo,2017-07-30,"Although you might face unforeseen setbacks now, you’re not one to prematurely throw in the towel. In fact, the gulf between your home world and your dream world continues to grow, adding to your current emotional sensitivity. You know that the road ahead is not an easy one, and you secretly hope you’re not setting yourself up for a fall. The good news is your resiliency is strong, empowering you to bounce back up on your feet again. Henry Ford said, “Failure is the opportunity to begin again more intelligently.”"
virgo,2017-07-30,"You strive to remain positive-minded in spite of the less-than-awesome news you receive today. However, it gets tougher by the minute to keep your shock and discouragement beneath the radar. Of course, you can easily divide your tasks so you catch up on business, leaving personal matters for later in the week. But putting your feelings out in the open is more difficult, if not a more rewarding approach to relationships. Honesty is the highest form of intimacy."
libra,2017-07-30,"Ironically, you may be drawn to the very same people that were too unconventional for your tastes only a few weeks ago. However, your personal aesthetics have not changed as much as you think; it’s just that your spectrum is widening and you’re more comfortable with stepping beyond your old limits. Nevertheless, your exhilaration is short-lived. Once the newness wears off, you might be left with a familiar feeling of disappointment. Don’t judge a book by its cover when the content is what counts."
scorpio,2017-07-30,"Someone might get the wrong idea from you today. Although the Moon’s presence in your sign provokes frequent mood swings, this doesn’t mean your emotions are any shallower now. In fact, your intensity could come as a surprise to an admirer who was expecting fun and games, without the gravity of a heart-centered attachment. But you wouldn’t be authentic if you took the easy way out. Vincent van Gogh wrote, “I would rather die of passion than of boredom.”"
sagittarius,2017-07-30,"Romance is in the air, but an opportunity to pursue an unusual relationship could disappear before you know it. Your infatuation may extend into online interactions, yet it’s challenging to distinguish social media connections from real life ones. Nevertheless, don’t be dissuaded now because someone seems so different from you. You might be delighted by how much you can have in common with another openminded person if you give each other a chance. A friendship is a lovely place to start."
capricorn,2017-07-30,"You could be stuck in a drama that pits your regular need for stability with your transient desire for a memorable thrill. Normally, these two points are mutually exclusive and wouldn’t exist in the same story line. But now you must create a plot that engages both traditional methods and futuristic individuality. Taking the high road gives you a bird’s eye view to keep everything in balance. Paulo Coelho wrote, “When we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better, too.”"
aquarius,2017-07-30,"You possess a rare ability to maintain an intense connection with a friend or lover while also fostering emotional detachment. In fact, you might choose to keep a long-lasting relationship free of drama by relying on fair-minded thinking rather than subjective emotions. But don’t assume for a moment that this kind of connection is qualitatively any less significant than a traditional one. There are many approaches to swimming with others in the spiritual waters of the soul."
pisces,2017-07-30,"You wish you could stick with your tried-and-true formula today, but many of your interpersonal interactions quickly sour when you add your opinions to the mix. Although emotions are a key ingredient in an intimate relationship, they also introduce ambiguity into the equation. Building protective walls is not a viable strategy now; it may keep some pain at bay, but boundaries also stifle love and affection. Bob Marley said, “Being vulnerable is the only way to allow your heart to feel true pleasure.”"
aries,2017-07-31,"You want to seize the day because the courting process can be like going to war. You Rams love the chase and strive to win affection, especially now that your key planet Mars is strategizing with the Sun in your 5th House of Romance. But the magic of love won’t unfold amidst noise, so practice being quiet to better hear your feelings. Ease off on the throttle just a bit so that everyone has room to express their desires, too. Being subtle is not your regular style, but it’s the fastest way to make sparks fly now."
taurus,2017-07-31,"It’s imperative to own up to any fears you harbor about getting what you really want in a relationship. Unfortunately, your worries can become deterrents to the very happiness you seek. Your key planet Venus swims into sentimental Cancer today, softening your feelings and heightening your receptivity to love. Luckily, your slow-and-steady-wins-the-race methodology works wonders now. Some people succeed because they are destined, but the Bull succeeds because it is determined."
gemini,2017-07-31,"If you are suffering from social overload, your schedule should begin to settle down now. Enriching Venus enters your 2nd House of Personal Possessions, prompting you to set new priorities and focus your intentions on what you expect to receive in a relationship. However, don’t be overly concerned if your emotional needs aren’t being fulfilled yet. Concentrate on your long-term goals instead of seeking immediate gratification. Neal Maxwell wrote, “Never give up what you want most for what you want today.”"
cancer,2017-07-31,"The cosmos is providing you with a heightened sense of belonging now, adding another layer of depth to a current relationship or introducing a new love interest into your life. A romance that slowly simmers while vulnerable Venus is camped out in your sign emphasizes tender caring rather than a sudden head-over-heels infatuation. There may not be any showy fireworks today, but your feelings can run very deep, nonetheless. Author H. Jackson Brown, Jr. wrote, “Sometimes the heart sees what is invisible to the eye.”"
leo,2017-07-31,Your beautiful dreams and subconscious fears might unintentionally be expressed in your relationships now. You are being encouraged to examine your own personal myths and mysteries about love and romance while romantic Venus is wandering through your 12th House of Spiritual Destiny. Face your recent disappointments and then dig into your rich fantasy life; own what you like and what you don’t. Self-acceptance is your not-so-secret key to happiness.
virgo,2017-07-31,"It doesn’t matter whether you’re more distracted by your nocturnal fantasies or your daydreams at work. The content isn’t all that important as long as you dream. Venus in sensitive Cancer moves through your 11th House of Hopes and Wishes, highlighting your long-term relationship goals and putting you in touch with your future. Don’t judge yourself; it’s absolutely fine if you currently lack the intimacy you seek. Love works in mysterious ways and her magic can’t be rushed."
libra,2017-07-31,"You are attempting to create a harmonious atmosphere, but balancing everything is tricky today, because you’re also concerned with protecting your own feelings. Your planetary ruler Venus needs to find an emotionally safe haven while she visits vulnerable Cancer. However, situations might intensify if you are drawn into a drama of your own making. Your best defense is to not hold onto more than you need. You do not have to be rich to be generous."
scorpio,2017-07-31,"Although you have a clear vision of what you want, you might be quieter than usual when it comes to sharing your heart. You are in your element now that the Moon is floating in your sign and sensual Venus is splashing around in watery Cancer. The next few weeks may offer a tender romantic experience that mellows your intensity without requiring you to suppress your desires. Gradually shift your attention away from the outer world and create a safe bubble where your feelings can contribute to building a nurturing relationship. Rumi wrote, “Reason is powerless in the expression of love.”"
sagittarius,2017-07-31,"You often prefer to jump into a situation without necessarily becoming overly attached. However, this separation from your feelings isn’t possible now, so you need to take a risk and allow yourself to become emotionally vulnerable. You may have trouble relating to the caretaking aspect of Venus in Cancer, making your relationships difficult to manage for the next few weeks. Fortunately, if you can break the ice by opening your heart, others are able to do so in return."
capricorn,2017-07-31,"You typically find security by establishing lasting structures in all aspects of your life. Of course, you take love quite seriously and strive for it to be real. However, your well-defined boundaries blur while desirable Venus dances through your 7th House of Relationships. Your anxiety may rise if you try to stop nature from following her own course. The whole situation is quite upsetting now, especially if you’re not fully comfortable with the more vulnerable side of love. It's safer in the deep end than you think. Give yourself permission to enjoy the pleasures without worrying about the cost."
aquarius,2017-07-31,"You are typically attracted to relationships that offer you a high degree of autonomy. But sweet Venus begins her journey through nurturing Cancer today, tempting you to cling to the object of your love -- and this needy behavior may make you irritable. Explore your vulnerability and the emotional intimacy that it makes possible. You might be thrilled to find that being so close to someone special could be exhilarating rather than smothering. Bengali poet Rabindranath Tagore wrote, “Love does not claim possession, but gives freedom.”"
pisces,2017-07-31,"There’s no reason to shout your romantic desires from the top of a mountain. In fact, you might be so private about your emotional needs now that you don’t reveal them to anyone. Fortunately, you’re comforted by the presence of caring Venus in your 5th House of Fun and Games. Be open to receiving some sweet relief to a lingering relationship dynamic that was recently a source of stress. Thankfully, the cosmos is inviting you to lighten up and be more playful now that love is just around the corner."
aries,2017-08-01,"Your visions of the future have been rather tame recently, confining your imagination to the most realistic alternatives. However, the Moon’s shift into your 9th House of Big Ideas takes the lid off the container and encourages you to mentally meander without restraint. In fact, you can explore possibilities that stretch your boundaries if you honor the difference between fantasy and reality. Exercising your creativity through your dreams now gives you a chance to step outside of your worldly obligations. No matter what anyone says, you don’t have to color within the lines."
taurus,2017-08-01,"Although you don’t usually like adding complexity to a situation, you might go out of your way to stir up someone’s emotions today. Your idealistic outlook gives others the benefit of the doubt, but you want to be certain about something before you move on. Asking questions is the best way to assuage your concerns now, but it could raise additional issues that are even more daunting than your initial worry. Nevertheless, you won’t be satisfied until you know the whole truth. Adventurer Thor Heyerdahl wrote, “Progress is man’s ability to complicate simplicity.”"
gemini,2017-08-01,"Everyone seems to be overly optimistic today, which could lead you to wonder if you’re the Negative Nellie of the group. You’re worried that something obvious is slipping through the cracks, and will rear its ugly head at the most inopportune time. Accordingly, you want to be certain that there is good reason to join in the celebration now, which would be more fun than being the harbinger of bad news. Whatever happens, it’s better in the long run to fully participate in your life instead of just watching it go by. Terence McKenna said, “Levity is the opposite of gravity.”"
cancer,2017-08-01,"You might not have a lot to say today; you’re too busy taking care of business to waste time in social niceties. The Moon’s shift into your 6th House of Daily Routine demands that you are serious when it comes to meeting your responsibilities. Of course, it’s crucial to get your chores finished in a timely manner. However, it’s healthy to leave some room for more enjoyable activities as long as you don’t let them hijack your day. All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy."
leo,2017-08-01,"You can make nearly anything look good today. The Leo Sun illuminates the best parts of your personality while the inspirational Sagittarius Moon reflects your need for fun. You are eager to follow your heart wherever it leads. Nevertheless, it’s still crucial to know how far you can go in your pursuit of pleasure. If you overplay your hand, your charm could disappear faster than an ice cube during a heat wave. Even the nicest people have their limits."
virgo,2017-08-01,"You want to believe that everything is achievable now, but your logical mind won’t allow you to take this leap of faith. Nevertheless, you’re not willing to give into reason today, especially if your intuition is painting a rosy picture. In reality, the truth is somewhere between the basic facts and the grandest dreams. If you prematurely restrain your potential, you’ll never know what might have been possible. Educator Ken Robinson said, “Imagination is the source of every form of human achievement.”"
libra,2017-08-01,"You may spin a wild yarn today without even realizing you deviated from the truth. Normally, you have a knack for establishing objectivity into an emotionally charged situation, but you appear to have lost your bearings now. Fortunately, no harm will come from your current dance with fantasy as long as you don’t try to pass it off as fact. Others will likely see through your current tendency to exaggerate, so it's wise if you catch yourself first. Staying busy helps to keep you out of trouble. Poet Bill Copeland wrote, “The man who rows the boat seldom has time to rock it.”"
scorpio,2017-08-01,"Cultivating a healthy self-image is important and positively impacts all areas of your life. However, the confident Sagittarius Moon’s visit to your 2nd House of Self-Worth encourages you to see only the bright side of things. Don’t wait until the shadows descend upon you, forcing you to look at less optimistic scenarios. Assessing your current position is most effective if you listen to the good news and the bad news. Walter Cronkite said, “In seeking truth you have to get both sides of a story.”"
sagittarius,2017-08-01,"Your emotions are more accessible to others today, even if you think you’re keeping them well hidden. The evocative Moon’s return to your sign brings your changing moods to the surface. Ironically, trying to bury them now only boosts their power. It’s a much smarter strategy to share your feelings in the moment, without placing undue weight on them one way or the other. Wayne Dyer wrote, “Peace is the result of retraining your mind to process life as it is, rather than as you think it should be.”"
capricorn,2017-08-01,"You want everyone to take you seriously, especially on days like today when your dreams demand your consideration. Thankfully, the Moon’s current visit to your 12th House of Invisibility enables you to magically make your fantasies vanish from view.

Don’t override your inner voice; it’s who you really are."
aquarius,2017-08-01,"People expect a lot from you today and, for the most part, you enjoy fulfilling their needs. Although you sometimes prefer to emotionally distance yourself from others, you are an integral part of the community now. Not only are you a wonderful collaborator when you choose to be, you might even become the heart and the soul of the group. Author John C. Maxwell wrote, “Good leadership isn’t about advancing yourself. It’s about advancing your team.”"
pisces,2017-08-01,"Your larger-than-life behavior is meant to demonstrate your desire for public acceptance today. You want to succeed professionally but also need others to acknowledge your work along the way. Unfortunately, you might run into negative comments instead of support as the Moon in your 10th House of Status squares chatty Mercury. There’s no logical reason to dismiss the feedback you receive; in fact, integrating the advice rather than rejecting it enables you to improve your game and gain more respect. Dr. Chia Thye Poh wrote, “Positive criticism is a good friend. Insincere flattery is a fake friend.”"
aries,2017-08-02,"There appears to be a clear path from your current location to your ultimate destination. You see no reason to dilly-dally and are eager to head out without a backward glance. However, you could inadvertently walk right into a trap unless you cool your jets and review your plan one more time. The possibility of freedom can act like an intoxicant today, tricking you to jump before you fasten your parachute. Action without thought is impulsiveness; thought without action is procrastination. Stay on the road between these two extremes."
taurus,2017-08-02,"It’s a special gift when you can sink deeply into your feelings without experiencing the anxiety that usually accompanies uncertainty. Thankfully, your current self-confidence gives you the support you need in order to address a subject of concern that’s bothering you.

Author Erol Ozan wrote, “Some beautiful paths can’t be discovered without getting lost.”"
gemini,2017-08-02,"You can’t help but sport a smile today because so many signs are pointing toward your success. At least that’s what you might think if you believe everything you are told. Although you don’t want to accept the truth before you verify it, your research won’t likely turn up any surprises. You may ultimately choose to forge ahead with your plans, but remain flexible enough to modify them if you must. George Bernard Shaw wrote, “Those who cannot change their minds cannot change anything.”"
cancer,2017-08-02,"You might surprise your coworkers with your uncharacteristically freewheeling style today. It may appear as if you’ve thrown caution out the window, but you’re actually more careful than anyone realizes. Although your current positivity does not invite reckless behavior, it does encourage you to make the most of a situation while it lasts. Theologian Paul Tillich wrote, “He who risks and fails can be forgiven. He who never risks and never fails is a failure in his whole being.”"
leo,2017-08-02,"It feels as if you can’t miss in whatever endeavor you pursue now; all you need to do is state your intention and wait for it to manifest. However, nothing could be further from the truth. Setting your goals is actually the easy part today, and without relentless follow-through your thoughts will be for naught. General Colin Powell wrote, “A dream doesn’t become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination and hard work.”"
virgo,2017-08-02,"You’re caught between two extremes today, trying to avoid making unilateral choices. On one hand, you have your finger on the truth and you want to shout it from the mountaintops. On the other hand, you’re not eager to leave home, no less make a public spectacle of yourself. However, this internal struggle is unnecessary, no matter how critical it seems in the moment. Professor Harvey Mindess wrote, “Pointing out the comic elements of a situation can bring a sense of proportion.”"
libra,2017-08-02,"Maintaining your forward progress is nearly impossible now, especially if you are easily distracted by other people's dramas. Although you wish you could pursue every conversation to its natural conclusion, your packed calendar doesn’t leave much room for spontaneity. Your day would be boring if you simply ignored others, but there’s a price to pay for all of your social activity. You could run into a wall unless you preemptively cut back the number of your appointments. Artist Bruno Munari wrote, “To complicate is easy. To simplify is difficult.”"
scorpio,2017-08-02,"Your long-term prospects are promising as you assess your present position and your planned trajectory. Although you may have particular concerns, your current actions seem to support your professional ambitions. However, you might question your role on a team that works independently of your agenda. If you find that your goals are too different from your coworkers, you need to reinvent your job and change your duties to match your heart. There’s no time to waste because your future begins in this precious moment."
sagittarius,2017-08-02,"The open road stretches out before you; you have your map, a full tank of gas and enough time on your hands to create a bit of mischief. Although you don’t have a specific goal in mind, you’re not sure you need one now. After all, it’s all about the journey and not the destination. Nevertheless, you can only drive around in circles for so long until boredom strikes, inspiring you to break out of the rut and move on to the next phase of your travels. Do something today that your future self will thank you for."
capricorn,2017-08-02,"You’re quite content being alone now, especially if it means you can work at your own pace free from distractions. Nevertheless, you may get hooked into a conversation that turns weird today, causing you to retreat even further. Be as kind as possible when reasserting your need for space. Empowerment coach Crystal Andrus writes, “Do not justify, apologize for, or rationalize the healthy boundary you are setting. Do not argue. Just set the boundary calmly, firmly, clearly, and respectfully.”"
aquarius,2017-08-02,"Staying in the here and now is tricky business because your mind keeps bounding off into the future. A wide variety of choices stretch out before you today, and you're acutely aware that your current decisions will determine where you go. Nevertheless, pulling your thoughts back into the present is so confining that you slip off to escape into parallel worlds and unrealistic fantasies. However, the intersection of fact and fancy is where creation occurs. Author Michael Beckwith wrote, “Don’t look for your dreams to come true, look to become true to your dreams.”"
pisces,2017-08-02,"You are driven to succeed at work now and won’t allow mundane obstacles to slow you down. Creating a path to the top of your profession is one way of distinguishing yourself from the crowd. However, you are not interested in pie-in-the-sky dreaming today; you want a concrete action plan, a comprehensive timeline, and solid commitments from your coworkers, too. All the planning in the world will be for naught unless you do something with it. Helen Keller wrote, “Life is either a daring adventure or nothing.”"
aries,2017-08-03,"It seems as if you’ve been putting your ducks in a row forever and now you’re ready to make your move. In fact, you might believe that you’ll lose your chance if you don’t do something drastic today. You are partly right; it is time to initiate action, but you must persist with determination rather than enthusiasm. Your level of excitement can go from zero to ten in a flash, but it can crash just as quickly. Ultimately, it’s your long-term commitment to reaching your goal that makes the difference between failure and success. Who you are will show in what you do."
taurus,2017-08-03,"You might believe reality is conspiring to hold you in place, but it’s actually nudging you closer to your point of no return. Examine those areas of your life that seem stagnant now and consider what you could do to break through the restrictive dynamics. Although there may be obstacles in your path, their purpose is to push you closer to the edge of frustration until you realize that change must come from within. Stop trying to alter reality. Dr. Joyce Brothers wrote, “Success is a state of mind. If you want success, start thinking of yourself as a success.”"
gemini,2017-08-03,"Your attitude about a significant relationship may be in flux now. In fact, your vacillations can be exhausting; one minute you’re unhappy about the lack of potential and the next minute everything seems wonderful. Don’t trust your optimism or your pessimism today because these wide mood swings are only reflecting the extreme possibilities. President Dwight Eisenhower said, “The middle of the road is all of the usable surface. The extremes, right and left, are in the gutters.”"
cancer,2017-08-03,"You might think your agenda is bulletproof, but it is not. In fact, shifting circumstances at work may shoot holes through your plans today, forcing you to reassess your assumptions. But all is not lost; thankfully, the cosmos is offering you a chance to proceed with greater certainty than ever before. Just don’t let self-doubt tempt you to quit before you reach your goal. The biggest mistake you could ever make now is being too afraid to make one."
leo,2017-08-03,"Sometimes creativity is the result of an exciting storm of mental activity, yet other times it’s more methodical and exacting. Your current inspiration comes from a blend of both, but you must be willing to freely move back and forth between these two modalities if you want to produce a masterpiece. Any preconceived notions about the expression of your vision now will ultimately be restrictive. Adventure starts where plans end."
virgo,2017-08-03,"You may step outside your normal comfort zone today, but chances are you won’t wander too far. Like Hansel and Gretel, you carefully mark your progress so you can find your way home. Nevertheless, answers to your questions are not found in the same old places where you typically look. Be cautious as you explore new territory, yet remain open to what you might discover. Oliver Wendell Holmes said, “A mind that is stretched by a new experience can never go back to its old dimensions.”"
libra,2017-08-03,"If someone at work is hot under the collar today, your friendly attitude is your ultimate weapon. It’s as if you can step into the middle of an emotional firestorm now, say a few choice words, and the extreme weather begins to settle down. Although you’re not a miracle worker, your ability to remain neutral in the midst of strong opinions acts as a salve to those who are upset. Winston Churchill said, “Diplomacy is the art of telling plain truths without giving offense.”"
scorpio,2017-08-03,"A coworker may walk away with all the recognition today. You honestly don’t mind the spotlight beaming brightly on someone else as long as your contribution is acknowledged, too. Unfortunately, you might be left standing in the dark now, but hopefully, you understand that this isn’t a popularity contest.

Resiliency is your friend; the brightest stars are the ones that shine for the benefit of others."
sagittarius,2017-08-03,"You might head out in one direction today only to find yourself going the opposite way a little while later. Although you have no clue how you could get so lost, you’re adaptable enough to respond right away and reset your bearings. Unfortunately, this exact scenario may repeat again, leaving you a bit frustrated and confused. Nevertheless, your reaction is critical to your success. It’s unnecessary to look back and question your past judgments; simply fix your eyes on your goal and continue moving toward it with more determination than ever."
capricorn,2017-08-03,"Taking a risk at work, however calculated, sets you on edge because you don’t like the sense of instability. Thankfully, your recent actions are making an impact and you can probably tell, one way or the other, if things are working out according to your plan. Of course, you want to achieve your goals, but it’s a relief to receive feedback now if you need another chance. Don’t wave the white flag today. Pain is temporary; quitting lasts forever."
aquarius,2017-08-03,"Making decisions requires little effort on your part today. It’s as if you’ve been temporarily freed from the consequences of anyone else’s judgment. It’s not that you don’t care what others think about your choices; it’s just that you know what’s in your heart now, and are willing to act on your conviction no matter what kind of criticism you receive. Nevertheless, keep in mind that you aren’t operating within a vacuum and people’s reactions can eventually bother you if you forget to maintain healthy boundaries. Negativity may knock at your door, but that doesn’t mean you must let it in."
pisces,2017-08-03,"Although everything seems very predictable at work, you might not trust your own feelings now. There’s a part of you that won’t buy in to the comfort of certainty because it’s too limiting. Your mindset is not based on whether or not you like your job; it’s more existential than pragmatic today. However, the solution to your current dilemma is probably simpler than you realize. As Captain Jack Sparrow noted, “The problem is not the problem. The problem is your attitude about the problem.”"
aries,2017-08-04,"Just when you think your mind has fully grasped the current situation, the plot shifts in ways you don’t expect. Perhaps someone’s honest disclosure seems to be a positive step today, only to watch the conversation fall over an emotional cliff. You might try to change the direction of your discussion, but there’s no stopping it once it ventures into such sensitive territory. Set aside your previous agenda and enter the unknown willingly. There is a nugget of gold awaiting your discovery if you have the courage to maintain an open mind throughout the process."
taurus,2017-08-04,"Someone may be trying to change your mind when it comes to your long-term plans. You’re willing to discuss your preferences and negotiate the details as they concern the other person. But you’re likely to grow infuriated now if you think anyone is manipulating the situation for their own means. You deserve to be heard if you believe you’re being wronged. However, you can grow so attached to your story that everything else is bent out of shape. Nevertheless, don’t be afraid to fight back if a coworker tries to ignore or minimize your concerns. Politician Frank A. Clark said, “If you find a path with no obstacles, it probably doesn’t lead anywhere.”"
gemini,2017-08-04,"Navigating through emotionally agitated waters is particularly challenging today. You can’t decide whether this is an amazing opportunity to experience a deeper level of intimacy or an unnecessary excursion into the fundamental differences that plague a relationship. The reality is that all interactions grow more complicated when unconscious drives and fears are brought to the surface. However, this is also the best time to break through old patterns that prevent you from fully shining your love light. Psychologist Rollo May wrote, “Intimacy requires courage because risk is inescapable.”"
cancer,2017-08-04,"Oftentimes, you know what you want but are hesitant to reveal your preferences for fear of rejection. Unfortunately, a coworker or partner may step in today, filling the gap by telling you what he or she expects. Although you might be shocked by someone’s directness now, you could also feel angry because their approach leaves you with little choice but agreement. Instead of seething quietly while going along with the plan, stop this power play before things get out of control. Stand up for your rights; saying yes to happiness means learning to say no to people who stress you out."
leo,2017-08-04,"You are sitting pretty in the driver’s seat today, thinking nothing you encounter at work can change the dynamics. Unfortunately, you might need to reconsider your assumptions as obstacles appear in the road. At first, you grin and grit your teeth; you’re not afraid of handling difficult situations as they arise. However, there comes a time to retreat if you're making little or no progress. But there is no shame in backing up, improving your plan and trying again. Oscar Wilde wrote, “Experience is the hardest kind of teacher. It gives you the test first and the lesson afterward.”"
virgo,2017-08-04,"You will do whatever it takes to express yourself today. You want to present your latest idea, reveal your feelings or make an artistic statement, even if others might be surprised or offended by your message. Your goal is not to make waves; you simply need to be seen and heard now. However, you can modify your behavior but people’s reactions are out of your control. Go ahead with your plans as long as you’re willing to deal with the consequences of your actions. There’s no need to trade in your authenticity for approval."
libra,2017-08-04,"The finger of fate is reaching out to touch you, altering your relationships in ways not yet apparent. Although optimism is fueling your fantasies, reality is demanding your full attention today. You prefer to follow your heart’s commands, but previous commitments won’t be satisfied unless you maintain a pragmatic approach to life now. Thankfully, your superpower is your ability to balance two extreme approaches, so meet your obligations and continue to explore your desires. Thoreau wrote, “Go confidently in the direction of your dreams! Live the life you’ve imagined.”"
scorpio,2017-08-04,"You thrive on the intensity of today’s cosmic connections because you can maintain a positive outlook while digging into the darkness of the unknown. Naturally, you respect the power of the subconscious, but you also know that the best magic occurs in the least explored recesses of your mind. It may be wonderful if you find a companion to share this little excursion now, but it could turn messy if they can’t handle the energy. Remember, it’s better to be alone than to be with someone who makes you feel alone. If in doubt, make this quest a solo flight."
sagittarius,2017-08-04,"Your friends and coworkers are like a breath of fresh air today, filling the sails of your dreams with the winds of support. You feel lifted by their presence in your life. However, a deep dark secret may be quietly gnawing at the back of your mind, preventing you from luxuriating in the good will all around you now. Although it’s tempting to ignore the unpleasant thoughts, denial only gives them more power over your day. Instead of judging yourself, engage your fears and embrace them. Accepting your past allows you to move freely into your future."
capricorn,2017-08-04,"You are a powerhouse of ambition and your current intensity could frighten others today. Although no one wants to stand in your way, someone may take on the role of your nemesis. Be measured in your response, for the more you try to overcome the resistance you face, the stronger it grows. Your simple act of listening to the needs of others minimizes the stress. In fact, your obsessive belief that nothing can impede your progress is what actually produces the current obstacles. Don’t be upset when it rains if you create your own storm."
aquarius,2017-08-04,"You don’t want to let anyone see your dark side today, so you consciously project a cheerful image in all that you do. Unfortunately, your actions do not fully camouflage what’s lurking in your heart. Much to your chagrin, others can clearly see through your charade now.

aries,2017-08-05,"There is a complex mixture of powerful and subtle cosmic forces at play. However clear your intentions may be, it’s all too easy to misread the signs and head off in the wrong direction. But making a mistake is not inevitable if you remember that your perceptions are unreliable today. Nevertheless, your efforts to untangle the separate threads of confusion help you navigate through these tricky waters. Avoid jumping to conclusions now, even if the facts seem obvious. Rethinking a major decision before taking action  is your best defense."
taurus,2017-08-05,"You take pride in your ability to cut through the excess noise in life and determine where you stand, so you can figure out what to do next. Unfortunately, your current position may not be as certain as you wish while fuzzy Neptune is busy confusing reality. Rather than performing mundane chores or developing concrete plans, give yourself the gift of dreams today. Although you are a down-to-earth Taurus, you still need time to let your mind wander. Novelist Joe Meno wrote, “Imagination is a place where all the important answers live.”"
gemini,2017-08-05,"Although you might be inclined to follow a whim and do something just for fun, you still want to be productive today. For example, flying a kite could be a lovely diversion, but you prefer to participate in an organized competition so your playtime can be justified. Nevertheless, you’ll feel better in the long run if you compartmentalize your ambition and channel it into your job-related responsibilities next week. Work hard; play harder."
cancer,2017-08-05,"It’s never any fun to feel as if you’re being pushed into a corner, but today you’re unwilling to let things go that far. You can't help but see right through someone’s charm if they are operating with self-serving motives. Fortunately, you can nip the bud of control before it even flowers. A proactive strategy is better than waiting until a crisis develops. Just make sure that you’re not a victim of your own imagination now. Don’t end up fighting windmills like Don Quixote. Plato advised, “Take charge of your thoughts. You can do what you will with them.”"
leo,2017-08-05,"You are standing at a fork in the road and don’t know how to proceed. You can feel the gravity tugging in two different directions today as your responsible side pulls one way and your playful side pulls the other. Unfortunately, you won’t be satisfied with either path because you don’t want to eliminate anything from your day. Sometimes the only winning strategy is to change the rules of the game. Creating a third route that honors your outer adult and your inner child breaks you free from the either/or dilemma. Author Napoleon Hill wrote, “The only limits in your life are the ones you create with your mind.”"
virgo,2017-08-05,"You can’t tell whether people seem more confused than usual now or if it’s just your foggy imagination. Your first inclination is to help others find their way since you believe your perspective is accurate. However, once an honest conversation begins, everyone seems to make more sense somehow; today’s lesson is that reality is more complex than you think. All the facts in the world won’t tell the whole story. A. Artemis wrote, “The intuitive mind is where genius resides.”"
libra,2017-08-05,"Finalizing your schedule for the weekend is daunting because there are so many variables in the mix. Although decision-making can be a sore spot for you ambivalent Libras, making up your mind is not the problem now. The fact is you could easily let your preferences be known if you felt like it. If anything, you wish everyone would leave you to your own devices today so you can float along without an agenda. C.S. Lewis wrote, “Free will, though it makes evil possible, is also the only thing that makes possible any love or goodness or joy worth having.”"
scorpio,2017-08-05,"You are motivated to achieve something special today, and you’re not afraid to share your goals with others when there is a reason. But recent events continue to raise flags, urging you to reassess your priorities. Instead of stubbornly resisting change, open your mind to all the possibilities that you previously set aside. Don’t modify your plans yet; instead, use this time to explore your fantasies without acting on them. Good things come to those who wait."
sagittarius,2017-08-05,"Your long-term goals are in the midst of a transformation and you’re unsure yet what it all means. Although you’ve had to defend your choices in the past, you’re not as likely to fight for your self-determination now -- if only because your new direction is still ambiguous. Your perspective on the future is changing and it’s healthy to let the process continue without forcing a conclusion. In fact, stepping outside the norms might be the necessary catalyst that frees you from old restrictive habits. Albert Einstein said, “The mind that opens to a new idea never returns to its original size.”"
capricorn,2017-08-05,"You are a conundrum to others today because you appear to be grounded, yet upon closer examination you’re not. You might try to keep your feet firmly planted on stable ground, but your thoughts are emotionally charged now and can pull you off center. Fortunately, you are on the precipice of manifesting an unfulfilled dream and surrendering to your imagination is key to your success. Floating into the unstructured realms of fantasy is most productive if it’s a temporary detour. Once the magic of creativity reinfuses your soul, come back to Earth and make it real. Speak as if it already exists. Act as if it’s already yours."

You can’t trust their judgment because it seems as if they are placing you up on a pedestal now. You don’t want to be revered but you appreciate recognition from like-minded people. Anthony J. D’Angelo wrote, “Without a sense of caring, there can be no sense of community.”"
taurus,2017-08-06,"Although you wish you could forget about work for a while, it’s challenging to set aside your professional worries, especially if others depend on you.

Novelist Nora Roberts wrote, “Love and magic have a great deal in common. They enrich the soul, delight the heart, and they both take practice.”"
leo,2017-08-06,"Reading other people’s intentions is trickier than you realize now, especially if their words are saying yes while their actions are saying no. You truly don’t want to overstep anyone’s boundaries, but simply asking questions isn’t a reliable course of action to get to the truth. You need to dig under the surface and create a space where everyone feels safe enough to express their feelings. The Dalai Lama said, “One of the secrets of inner peace is the practice of compassion.”"
virgo,2017-08-06,"It’s as if the universe is handing you a new lease on your life. Whatever has carried you to the present moment can now be filed under previous business.

But this isn’t about finishing incomplete chores or taking a long nap. Instead, you seek mental stimulation from exploring a new hobby or pursuing an intriguing subject of interest. You will feel young at heart as long as you continue to be guided by a child-like curiosity. Dr. Jane Goodall wrote, “The greatest danger to our future is apathy.”"
sagittarius,2017-08-06,"You intend to shake up your schedule today because you’re tired of doing things the same old way. However, you may want to think your exciting plan through one more time because events won’t likely unfold according to your expectations. Your need to create new routines is admirable, but it’s not worth it if your life is complicated beyond recognition. Nevertheless, stagnation isn’t an option. Physicist Andre Geim wrote, “Progress has always been driven by a sense of adventure and unconventional thinking.”"
capricorn,2017-08-06,"Balancing your need for relationship stability and your desire for individual freedom is a complicated dance today. It’s not that you have a secret agenda that requires being alone; it’s just that you don’t want to be constrained by other people’s expectations.

The Aquarius Full Moon Eclipse rattles your 10th House of Career while it opposes warrior Mars in your 4th House of Family, setting your nerves on edge.

Nevertheless, there is a magical piece of the puzzle missing, indicating that you need to step outside of the normal spectrum of experience in order to find your answer. Fortunately, you are confident enough in your skills and secure enough in your personality to explore entirely new avenues now. Avoid placing all your hopes in any one basket. Reality will surprise you with her answer."
aquarius,2017-08-08,"You are unable to hide your feelings or keep a secret today. The Moon finishes up her monthly visit to your sign where she reminds you to maintain a positive outlook. However, Luna’s shift into imaginative Pisces is an invitation to dream about material pleasures. Although you might wish to leave your emotions out of the picture while you seek clarity on a lingering issue, your feelings are not going to dry up overnight. Allow your subjectivity to ebb and flow like the tide. Poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow wrote, “The best thing one can do when it’s raining is to let it rain.”"
pisces,2017-08-08,"Your need for spiritual connection is palatable today. Don’t ignore this cosmic nudge to pursue yoga, meditation or religious studies, especially if you have no consistent practice in place. However, if you’re already traveling down the road of self-discovery, try picking up your speed. Time is of the essence now when it comes to creating meaningful ritual. Rumi wrote, “You are not a drop in the ocean; you are the entire ocean in a drop.”"
aries,2017-08-09,"You may be at a loss for words today, but that won’t likely stop you from talking. You might be better off remaining silent as you contemplate the impenetrable gulf that is separating you from others. Your courage inspires you to reach across the emptiness through dialogue now, but you only add to the frustration when you realize that people are misinterpreting your message. Don’t try so hard to bridge the gap. Havelock Ellis wrote, “All the art of living lies in a fine mingling of letting go and holding on.”"
taurus,2017-08-09,"You are inspired by your belief that your desires will be satisfied today. Your optimism brings a smile to your face, but conversations consistently tilt away from the material world now. You might think you’re in a strange power struggle with the universe itself. Thankfully, a disquieting interaction turns mellow once you disengage, making you realize that the confrontation stemmed from your unspoken expectations. The secret to having it all is knowing you already do."
gemini,2017-08-09,"While everyone else is overly concerned with the weirdness du jour, you’re quietly going about your business. In fact, you are functioning as if you’re in your own element. You don’t mind it when unpredictable events add a touch of chaos to your day. You can react so quickly because you adapt to the changing circumstances while others stand around without knowing what to do. Sigmund Freud wrote, “Neurosis is the inability to tolerate uncertainty.” Everything is fine as long as you’re willing to live with ambiguity."
cancer,2017-08-09,"Your long-term plans may require revision because your initial assumptions now seem to be wrong. Thankfully, your imagination is running at warp speed, sparking your brain with amazing ideas. Unfortunately, it’s not easy to get a thought to hang around long enough to grow into a real plan. Nevertheless, you’re up for the challenge, even if the odds seem stacked against you. Islamic scholar Hamza Yusuf wrote, “The reality of things is hidden in the realm of the unseen.”"
leo,2017-08-09,"You are happily shining your light today, hoping to spread a little love and kindness wherever you go. But one thing after another lures you away from your already-established itinerary. Nevertheless, each little distraction holds the possibility of  profound discoveries. Don’t leave any opportunity unexplored now, even if you end up with a day totally different than the one you planned. Embrace the unknown and let your life surprise you in the most delightful ways."
virgo,2017-08-09,"You can't help but wonder how so many people get along with so little common sense. Unfortunately, you may become anxious today, especially if others  break their promises. You’re not sure why they think that going back on their word is an acceptable behavior. Meanwhile, you avoid confronting anyone about your disappointment because you think that will just make matters worse now. There’s no doubt, your truth can upset someone at first, but don’t let that stop you. Ironically, bringing your annoyance out into the open will help everyone feel better in the long run."
libra,2017-08-09,"Your life is suddenly more complicated than it was yesterday. You move from situation to situation trying to catch up, but never quite reaching the present moment. You may not have a clue as to what you can do to put the craziness back in the box once it’s escaped. Nevertheless, you can still turn the day into a collection of memorable events if you relinquish any preconceived notions you might be harboring. Improvise, adapt and overcome."
scorpio,2017-08-09,"You may be in touch with your innermost mysteries, but that doesn’t mean everyone else wants to hear about them. You must be judicious when talking with others at work because you could say something that sounds colder than you intend today. Nevertheless, you are acting in the role of the truth-teller now, dropping bombs of honesty in casual conversations. You might feel like you’re left alone with only your integrity to keep you company. However, your actions resonate with others who are also champions of justice. United you stand; divided you fall."
sagittarius,2017-08-09,"You can put on quite a show today, bragging about your upcoming vacation. Although you know exactly what you’re doing and where you are going, how you’re going to get to your destination is more complicated. There are still so many details to be worked out that your trip is far from a done deal. Don’t try to fake it; it’s better to appear honest and uninformed now than be seen as a clever liar later. Author Janet Louise Stephenson wrote, “Authenticity requires vulnerability, transparency and integrity.”"
capricorn,2017-08-09,"You get the feeling that someone isn’t telling you all they know. In fact, people may be withholding information to protect your heart. You’re driven to get to the bottom of an interpersonal dynamic now, because you want all the facts at your disposal prior to making an important decision. Asking questions is usually smart, but your interrogation methods can be intimidating today. Save your intensity and courtroom drama for another day. Going undercover allows people to let down their guards and reveal the truth."
aquarius,2017-08-09,"Your non-conformist sense of identity may be confusing to others because they encounter you from a different perspective. People think you’re friendlier, happier and more optimistic than you might actually feel yourself, but you’re quite sensitive to your own thoughts. Your self-awareness is in a state of flux and you can’t see yourself clearly today, since your emotions overshadow your perceptions. Temporarily set aside your desires so you can explore your intellectual foundations without bias."
pisces,2017-08-09,"You may attempt to stay neutral in a little squabble at work, but following your diplomatic intentions isn’t your smartest strategy today. You don’t want to rock the boat by adding your radical perspective, but keeping everything calm isn't necessarily in your best interest now. Everyone will benefit by learning from your experience. Nevertheless, sharing a story or some poetry helps to make your point without offending anyone. Frank Lloyd Wright said, “The truth is more important than the facts.”"
aries,2017-08-10,"You’re likely to underestimate what’s required to complete a job today. You also tend to overestimate your ability to fix anything that goes wrong. Nevertheless, you can surprise everyone with your superb level of productivity if you keep your enthusiasm in check. The problem with unrestrained positive thinking is it sets you up for failure. Ironically, establishing realistic targets enables you to reach your unrealistic dream."
taurus,2017-08-10,"Your go-to response for nearly any dilemma is to create a sensible plan and then stick to it as much as you can. Although logic appears to be the key to your success, your strategy falls apart as soon as you swing into action today. Every obstacle you encounter now reminds you there is a significant difference between a good idea and a pragmatic solution. But don’t give up; Jon Sinclair wrote, “Failure is a bruise, not a tattoo.”"
gemini,2017-08-10,"You prefer to put a positive spin on all of your interactions today. However, it’s easy to gloss over the facts in your attempt to maintain an upbeat attitude. Thankfully, you are a wiz at finding innovative answers, but it’s challenging to convert your ideas into actions now. Each time you get close to manifestation, something happens and you’re back to square one. Don’t let a series of detours rob you of your optimism. Believe it to achieve it."
cancer,2017-08-10,"Your uncertainty is more of an asset today than a liability because it encourages you to keep your heart open. You don’t normally ask for other people’s input when you already have all the answers. Fortunately, your friends may be instrumental in helping you gain the clarity you seek. Sharing your hopes for the future is fine, but don’t turn it into such a big deal that you forget about the here and now. Buddhist teacher Thich Nhat Hanh says, “The present moment is the only moment available to us, and it is the door to all moments.”"
leo,2017-08-10,"You’re riding a tsunami of confidence today that’s so strong it might even frighten you, but that won’t stop you from surfing the energy while you can. However, one tiny slip and you could lose your balance. Of course, there’s no shame in falling; what matters is what you do next. You really don’t have the luxury of wallowing in your bad luck because you need to get right back up and prepare for the next ride. Every wave is a good wave if you’re lucky enough to be on top of it."
virgo,2017-08-10,"Your verbal eloquence is your secret strength today, but you could over-sweeten your message without realizing it. You prefer to keep your options open, but worry because you want everyone to entertain all the possibilities of the moment, instead of closing down because of their fears. Don’t be afraid to tell the truth as you see it, rather than trying to paint a picture so perfect that no one believes you. In the final analysis, your honest judgment could make or break a potential solution. Your faith is able to move mountains just as quickly as your doubt can create them."
libra,2017-08-10,"You’re unafraid to tell your friends what you want today, but they might not hear what you say. Everyone brings a unique set of personal desires and fears to each conversation. Sometimes these biases are so clearly obvious that they can be easily avoided. However, you inadvertently hit the hot buttons now, making each interaction like a walk through a carnival’s House of Mirrors. The distortions are more annoying than fun because you can’t discern what is real or fake. Don’t let negativity creep into your belief system. Chinese philosopher Mencius wrote, “Sincerity is the way to heaven.”"
scorpio,2017-08-10,"Your preferences are currently so entangled with your ambitions that you could get your priorities mixed up now. You tend to view your downtime as just another chance to do more work to get further ahead. There’s nothing wrong with being motivated to succeed as long as you don’t burn out in the process. Although you may feel invincible today, it’s essential to create a healthy balance in your life. Life is a marathon, not a sprint."
sagittarius,2017-08-10,"Your social life is heating up now and maybe even interfering with your responsibilities. Nevertheless, you won’t likely turn down an opportunity that sounds like fun. Unfortunately, you might misjudge your previous obligations, believing you can plow through your work in a flash. Discouragement may set in once you dig into your chores and realize how long they will take. Self-criticism is pointless; just stay focused and accomplish as much as possible before you head out for your next engagement. It’s not about having time; it’s about making time."
capricorn,2017-08-10,"You are usually the Champion of Structure, creating an ambitious schedule and then executing your plans with great efficiency. Unfortunately, complications arise today because time seems to be like rubber -- a fifteen-minute phone call could stretch into an hour or a short commute might turn into a long drive. Rearranging your calendar early in the day is helpful, especially if others are depending on your participation. Planning for the unexpected allows you to emerge a hero, no matter what."
aquarius,2017-08-10,"People come to your rescue today, whether you need help or not. Interpersonal dynamics can grow complicated if someone believes you can’t get along without their intervention. Meanwhile, all you want is the ability to make your own decisions without anyone else’s interference. You must be crystal clear and explain what you need now, because a lack of boundaries invites a lack of respect. Author Henry Cloud wrote, “You get what you tolerate.”"
pisces,2017-08-10,"You don’t mind it at all when the universe invites you to follow your fantasies. But you must juggle this potentially non-productive daydreaming with the demands of people who count on you at work. They think you shouldn’t let your imagination wander today, because it's a waste of precious time. Nevertheless, you know better because you can see the possibilities becoming certainties once you initiate action. Believe in what you want so much that it has no choice now but to materialize."
aries,2017-08-11,"Your patience has run out, prompting you to react without giving a second thought to the matter. Since you are the champion of shooting from the hip, you might feel confident about your ability to make the best decision on a moment’s notice. Unfortunately, you probably don’t realize you’re distorting your perceptions now, and responding to a set of circumstances that are in your head, not in the real world. The more hurried you feel, the more time you should take. Bruce Lee said, “A quick temper will make a fool of you soon enough.”"
taurus,2017-08-11,"You are adamant about enforcing your boundaries today because you need your personal space. You might feel as if someone is so clingy, there isn’t any room to think for yourself. Although you don’t necessarily want to make a big deal out of your wish for solitude, you must do something when pushed into a corner. Just remember that you can turn a simple fact into a complex fantasy now without even realizing it. Standing up for your alone time is healthy as long as you don’t overreact. Keep calm and carry on."
gemini,2017-08-11,"You have no problem at all laying your cards on the table once the Moon shifts into bossy Aries and your 11th House of Friends. But people may not be as responsive to your wishes as you expect, especially if they feel pressured by your words. What you say is less important today than how you say it. Your attitude dramatically shifts everyone’s opinions for better or worse, so carefully consider your message as well as your delivery. An Arab proverb states, “The Mouth should have three gatekeepers. Is it true? Is it kind? And is it necessary?”"
cancer,2017-08-11,"You want to make life easier for those you love, but sometimes your professional responsibilities get in the way. The spontaneous Aries Moon floods your 10th House of Career, shifting your attention to the larger issue of whether or not to reveal your feelings on the job. There are two distinct schools of thought; some say keep your personal business out of the workplace and others advise you to bring your whole self into the office. Ultimately, the choice is yours. Tycoon Richard Branson wrote, “Engage your emotions at work. Your instincts and emotions are there to help you.”"
leo,2017-08-11,"You’re passionate about making plans for the future, especially when you’re inspired by an idea or a cause near to your heart. However, you’re willing to pull out all the stops today no matter what is motivating you. You can’t help yourself; your destiny is calling and you’re answering with a resounding yes. Gymnast Mary Lou Retton said, “Optimism is a happiness magnet. If you stay positive, good things and good people will be drawn to you.”"
virgo,2017-08-11,"No matter how complicated the dynamics are in a significant relationship today, you’re eager to push through the uncharted emotional territory to reach your destination. Although you’re often the one who places great importance on logistical planning, you prefer flying by the seat of your pants now. You don’t want any more delays or setbacks. Nigerian rap artist Lyrikal said, “Never hesitate to follow your positive instincts; they could turn out to be your next positive direction.”"
libra,2017-08-11,"Your relationships are thrown off balance by your uncharacteristic disinterest in other people’s perspectives today. It’s not that you care any less; it’s just that time is of the essence and you don’t want to be distracted from your mission. You have a specific agenda and are willing to impose it onto those around you. Nevertheless, don’t confuse your path with your destination. Just because it’s stormy now doesn’t mean there isn’t sunshine around the next corner."
scorpio,2017-08-11,"Bringing a fresh round of emotional juice to an interaction can help to positively influence the outcome of a conversation. But you have no inclination to turn the current discussion into a major stumbling block if it doesn’t go your way. You possess sufficient common sense to know when to let go of your expectations. Nevertheless, learning with an open heart touches you in ways that call you to action. As Helen Keller wrote, “Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much.”"
sagittarius,2017-08-11,"Obstacles that have recently blocked your progress seem to disappear on their own now. Perhaps your courageous attitude changes the dynamics, but it’s your undying optimism that adds power to your current efforts. You may feel as if your life is back on track, but overconfidence can quickly become your undoing. Don’t get lazy even if everything seems to be coming up roses today. Mahatma Gandhi said, “The future depends on what we do in the present.”"
capricorn,2017-08-11,"You’re highly motivated to finish all the jobs you still have in process, but it’s challenging to convert good intentions into constructive actions. You possess an abundance of physical energy now, but seem to have trouble directing it into the necessary channels of expression. Nevertheless, your creativity is your secret weapon today; using your imagination inspires you to find new avenues to explore. Once you’re traveling down a different path, you’ll be surprised at how quickly your loose ends ties themselves up into tidy bows."
aquarius,2017-08-11,"People seem a bit too pushy for your taste today, but you’re not intimidated by their actions. In fact, you can use their aggressive behavior to fuel your personal agenda. Your emotions are fired up and need somewhere to go. Instead of resisting unwanted interference, shift the energy by claiming your own set of rules and projecting your priorities instead. Buckminster Fuller wrote, “You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.”"
pisces,2017-08-11,"Your actions won’t likely reflect what’s in your heart today, because you are driven by practical concerns rather than your need for love. Emotional recognition may be important, but you’re more interested in mundane matters now, like paying the bills and making dinner. However, you don’t need to ignore your heart, even if you don’t want to talk about your feelings. Just remember, the more you attempt to suppress certain desires, the stronger they become. Leonard Cohen wrote, “Act the way you’d like to be and soon you’ll be the way you act.”"
aries,2017-08-12,"You realize that your current work is not just about completing your chores today. It’s beginning to dawn on you that it’s going to be a while before you reach your current goals. Nevertheless, you’re committed to fulfilling your obligations, however long it might take. Make a list of everything you thought would be done by now but haven’t yet completed and set new milestones for the next few weeks. Motivational speaker Jim Rohn said, “If it’s important to you, you will find a way. If not, you’ll find an excuse.”"
taurus,2017-08-12,"Your love life is driven by fantasy today, but reality may deal you a different hand. In fact, you could feel as if you’re stuck; you aren’t making any progress, yet you’re not unhappy enough to attempt an escape. You have a fun-filled agenda mapped out for the weekend, but people might bail on you at the last moment, leaving you to fend for yourself. Although you’re fully capable of going it alone, don’t make it a habit now. Stepping outside of yourself and being part of a community allows you to find the love you seek."
gemini,2017-08-12,"You are ready to explore new territory today, but prior commitments make it difficult to find the time for your adventure. You don’t believe that anyone is purposefully holding you back, yet you’re willing to justify your behavior anyhow. Ultimately, private discussions with a close family member or friend will offer you the motivation you need. Screenwriter Mario Puzo wrote, “The strength of a family is in its loyalty to each other.”"
cancer,2017-08-12,"You may revisit an unfinished conversation with a friend in order to clear up a lingering misunderstanding. At first, the tension increases as you talk, making you question the wisdom of your actions. Emotions can become heated because your perspectives are so different. In fact, winning an argument is an unrealistic goal today. However, acknowledging one another’s positions can be healing, even if resolution is elusive. The Dalai Lama said, “Compassion is the radicalism of our time.”"
leo,2017-08-12,"You want to apply your quick thinking to invent new avenues of income. However, everything takes longer than it should today and you don’t understand the reason for all the delays. Instead of worrying about the timing, concentrate on the practicality of your plans. The more grounded your intellect, the sooner you can manifest the fruits of your labor. But don’t shy away from your intensity just to make others more comfortable. Your fiery passion is one of the main ingredients of your magic."
virgo,2017-08-12,"You might experience one annoying mix-up after another today, but nothing serious enough to stop you in your tracks. Your key planet Mercury turns retrograde in your sign, changing the rhythm of your conversations. You want to continue a discussion, but you’re at a loss for words. Don’t force any answers if nothing comes to mind. The flow will pick up again on its own accord, so be ready to ride the next wave when it hits. Mozart wrote, “The music is not in the notes, but in the silence between.”"
libra,2017-08-12,"You may be picking through the backwaters of your mind today in search of a lost idea or quote, but the more you look, the less you yield. You can’t find what you’re hunting for but neither can you set your quest aside. The subconscious has a magical way of adding meaning to whatever you perceive while clever Mercury retrogrades in your 12th House of Spirituality. There’s no reason to resist this inward journey but don’t rush it, either. Albert Einstein said, “Imagination is more important than knowledge.”"
scorpio,2017-08-12,"Try as you might, you can’t figure out your place in your network of friends now. One minute you feel like the ringleader of the pack, and the next minute you’re doubting the reasons for your participation. Thankfully, you can ground yourself today by following through on what you already started, stabilizing your role in the community. Trust your dreams, but don’t let them grow larger than life.

sagittarius,2017-08-12,"Your mind is on the long-term trajectory of your career and you wonder why your progress seems to be stymied now. You might feel frustrated if your ambitious strategy isn't creating the forward movement you expected. Nevertheless, this is not a smart time to walk away from your current plans. Make another attempt and fiercely focus on accomplishing your goals. Psychologist B.F. Skinner wrote, “A failure is not always a mistake. It may simply be the best one can do under the circumstances. The real mistake is to stop trying.”"
capricorn,2017-08-12,"You have recently stretched the envelope in new and daring ways. But you don’t want to take the time to explain your thought process to others. In fact, you may have left out quite a bit of the story, for the step-by-step details are not within your grasp today. Don’t get sidetracked by the minor obstacles that crop up now; plan on working out the rest of the plot as you continue on your way. Poet Mary Oliver wrote, “Keep some room in your heart for the unimaginable.”"
aquarius,2017-08-12,"You are turning into an investigator now and will continue to dig into the unknown until you have all the facts. However, you may be facing stiff resistance as you bump into someone who is opposing your progress. Don’t get caught up in petty ego battles; confrontation is not the highest use of your current passion. The more information you gather and the more experience you accumulate, the better decisions you will make. Wisdom is the ability to learn from change."
pisces,2017-08-12,"People may mislead you today, but they aren’t doing it on purpose. Mercury’s retrograde turn in your 7th House of Others can add confusion to a relationship because you’re likely to misunderstand one another. Fortunately, this is not rocket science; listen carefully and ask plenty of questions if you are unsure of what you heard. George Bernard Shaw wrote, “The single biggest problem in communication is the illusion that it has taken place.”"
aries,2017-08-13,"You are looking to the future with a very practical eye focused on your destination. Paradoxically, you may be quite satisfied even if you don’t reach your goals now, as long as you put your best foot forward. It’s better to fall short if you set your sites too high than to accomplish your objectives easily without being challenged. You have what it takes to be incredibly productive if you truly want to succeed. Napoleon Hill wrote, “When your desires are strong enough you will appear to possess superhuman powers to achieve.”"
taurus,2017-08-13,"You can feel your strength building and are motivated to put it to good use. You possess an extraordinary amount of stamina now that gives you the ability to finish what you start, even if it’s a larger-than-life project. There’s no reason to hold back when chasing your dreams. Set ambitious goals and be prepared to dedicate yourself to the task. Poet Ella Wheeler Wilcox wrote, “There is no chance, no destiny, no fate, that can hinder or control the firm resolve of a determined soul.”"
gemini,2017-08-13,"At first, you might resist the current cosmic message to slow down and do one thing at a time. Your restless mind enjoys bouncing around from one activity to another. However, the possible rewards of concentrating your energy rather than scattering it become more obvious throughout the day. Zen teacher Leo Babauta wrote, “Instead of focusing on how much you can accomplish, focus on how much you can absolutely love what you’re doing.”"
cancer,2017-08-13,"You nostalgically long for a return to the days when you could idly pass the time doing as little as possible. Unfortunately, you may suddenly realize that daydreaming will not bring you the same results today as creating and executing an action plan. Thankfully, you can schedule some rest and relaxation later as long as you follow through and finish your regular chores first. Author Steve Maraboli wrote, “Your life begins to change the day you take responsibility for it.”"
leo,2017-08-13,"It’s unnecessary to show the world how awesome you are today; instead, focus on the long haul if you want to experience lasting growth. Rather than seeking immediate gratification for something you do, initiate actions that continue to resonate into the future. Instead of reaping the fruits of your labors now, plant trees to be harvested down the line. It might sound crazy, but motivational expert Chet Holmes reminds us, “Most people spend more time planning a vacation than they do planning a life.”"
virgo,2017-08-13,"You are happy to plant your feet back on solid ground now, especially if you’ve recently been floating around in dreamworld. There are particular items you hope to cross off your to-do list and you’re eager to get started. Nevertheless, you need to cut yourself some slack while retrograde Mercury contributes to unexpected delays in the mundane world. Thankfully, your current efforts will pay off, even if you don’t see concrete results today. Author Tim Fargo wrote, “Patience and persistence are the providers of progress.”"
libra,2017-08-13,"Sometimes your desire to be with friends and family impedes your productivity, but your social inclinations work in your favor today. You tend to accomplish more when you’re in the company of others now. Even when you’re not working, your conversations seem to gravitate toward your future dreams and what you need to do in order to manifest them. Psychologist Fitzhugh Dodson wrote, “Without goals, and plans to reach them, you are like a ship that has set sail with no destination.”"
scorpio,2017-08-13,"You might choose to spend time with a close friend or partner today, but your career objectives are pressing on your mind more than relationship issues. You may be considering a change that could impact your fiscal position, but aren’t interested in making any sudden moves until you know your finances won’t suffer. Although a major shift will still require more planning, you are laying the foundations for your future. Dr. Alfred Adler wrote, “Follow your heart but take your brain with you.”"
sagittarius,2017-08-13,"You want everyone to take you seriously today, no matter what you are doing. Whether you’re participating in a sport, cleaning your house or working in the garden, there’s little room for fun and frivolity today. Pick a destination and stick with the activities that will facilitate your journey. But don’t just go along with others now; following the course of least resistance is a sad waste of the day’s potential. You can accomplish so much if you put your mind to it. Nevertheless, as Bruce Lee said, “Knowing is not enough, we must apply. Willing is not enough, we must do.”"
capricorn,2017-08-13,"You rarely stray far from thinking about long-term success, but you’re drawn toward more metaphysical concerns today. Although your current interests aren’t limited to getting ahead in the real world, you’re just as focused now when you contemplate spiritual pursuits. Perhaps it’s time to seek out a teacher or find an authoritative book on your favorite subject. Whatever path you choose to follow now, don’t be deterred by the fact that there's still a long road ahead of you. Novelist Saul Bellow wrote, “Whoever wants to reach a distant goal must take small steps.”"
aquarius,2017-08-13,"You are operating at peak efficiency today, especially if you’re participating in a group effort. You want to know how your part fits into the larger scheme of things, even if it’s something as simple as everyone helping around the home. You’re not interested in expending energy on trivial pursuits; it’s crucial to your happiness that your work is appreciated by others. Nevertheless, author Angie Karan cautions, “Don’t do something for recognition, Do it out of kindness. Do it because out of giving, it will make you whole and complete.”"
pisces,2017-08-13,"Taking care of business is so natural for you today, you might not even realize that you skipped your breakfast. You’re less interested in taking time off than you are in finishing the chores or projects that you start. Use your energy wisely now because you are functioning at optimum productivity. Instead of just drifting along through the day, establish ambitious priorities and work your way down through your list. Artist Suzy Kassem wrote, “If the fire in your heart is strong enough, it will burn away any obstacles that come your way.”"
aries,2017-08-14,"Although you might resist at first, you finally settle into the steady rhythm of the day. You wish the pace was quicker, but it’s wise to resign yourself to work within the constraints you cannot control. You may be annoyed if someone criticizes you for bucking the tide, even though you feel like you’re flowing with it. Your frustration builds until you no longer want to participate in group events at all. Remember, you can hold your ground without actually retreating. African-American scholar Anna Julia Cooper said, “Peace produced by suppression is neither natural nor desirable.”"
taurus,2017-08-14,"Withholding your needs seems like a strategy that will work today. You believe everyone will think everything is smoothly moving along according to plan as long as you don’t reveal what you really want. However, you may inadvertently wear your emotions on your sleeve now that the moody Moon is shining in your 1st House of Personality.

Poet Walter Scott wrote, “Oh, what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive.”"
gemini,2017-08-14,"Your friends might not recognize your behavior today, since you’re so quiet. In fact, your expressive energy seems restrained while the practical Taurus Moon hides in your 12th House of Privacy. Rather than wasting time asking others for what you want, you’re just taking care of business on your own. Still, you can’t help but think you’re coming into an adversarial phase when your needs will be more public and your drive for satisfaction will be apparent to everyone. English writer G.K. Chesterton noted, “There are two ways to get enough. One is to continue to accumulate more and more. The other is to desire less.”"
cancer,2017-08-14,"Your longings continue to intensify today, but you may be alienated because there’s little communication about your desires. You don’t mind if others are aware of your feelings; it’s just that you wish to avoid being the center of attention now. You prefer to make less waves and disappear into a group of like-minded friends than upset anyone with your needs that can’t easily be fulfilled. Mark Twain quipped, “Never tell the truth to people who are not worthy of it.”"
leo,2017-08-14,"You prefer sticking to your own agenda today because no one else’s plans make any sense to you. You want to collaborate with a coworker, but quickly abandon the idea when you realize how different your goals are now. There are times when compromise is a good idea because it allows you to combine forces for the common good. However, you may be better off proceeding on your own, especially if you’re following your dreams. Journalist Norman Cousins wrote, “The tragedy of life is not death, but what we let die inside of us while we live."""
virgo,2017-08-14,"You may be more expressive about your current need for excitement than you are about your day at work. In fact, you’re unlikely to disclose much about your professional activities. At first, it might seem as if you’re embarrassed about your career, but your motivation for secrecy comes from somewhere else. You simply want to be judged as a human, not for your job title. Swami Rama Tirtha said, “A god defined is a god confined.”"
libra,2017-08-14,"Although you enjoy your role as Diplomat-at-Large in the current social chaos, you might not know how to proceed without stirring up some friction. The more you remain true to yourself, the greater the stress between you and those around you. Nevertheless, at some point you must choose between following your own star or supporting the collective vision of your network of friends and associates. Fortunately, you can turn this situation into a win-win today if you heed educator Mollie Marti’s advice, “Allow the way to your great work be guided by your services to others.”"
scorpio,2017-08-14,"You might find yourself in a standoff with a close friend or lover today. The most obvious responses don’t seem to work, partly because you’re both so unwilling to give in. Unfortunately, it’s nearly impossible to merge two structures that are built on totally different foundations. Thankfully, you don’t have to combine them into one. The solution is so obvious now: just take the best from each and start anew. Indian author Shiv Khera wrote, “Your positive action combined with positive thinking results in success.”"
sagittarius,2017-08-14,"You have your work cut out for you today and although it may not be the most enjoyable task, you’re willing to do it anyhow. Unfortunately, you also have another set of goals that don’t reflect your job assignments; you’re interested in improving the life of everyone you know. You believe it’s your duty to pitch in and help the state of affairs all over the planet. Sometimes, it’s hard to know what to do but now your path is obvious. Don’t lose track of your aspirations, both mundane and altruistic. Balance your personal needs with those of the greater good for the best results."
capricorn,2017-08-14,"You’re thrilled when your personal needs support your deeper mission in life. The simplistic Taurus Moon dwells in your 5th House of Creativity, and your individual self-expression works hand in hand with a more powerful evolutionary force that’s guiding you in the direction of positive change. Don’t resist what you can’t yet understand. Your faith in the wisdom of nature will empower you to reap the rewards of spiritual growth. Politician Frank Clark wrote, “We find comfort among those who agree with us and growth among those who don’t.”"
aquarius,2017-08-14,"People seem to be overly insistent in their negotiations with you today. But you don’t want to give away so much that you feel there is nothing left. You may need to stand up and say no, even if you are in philosophical agreement with those around you. Reaffirming your boundaries not only protects you from exhausting your resources, it also boosts your self-confidence. Thich Nhat Hanh said, “To be beautiful means to be yourself. You don’t need to be accepted by others. You need to accept yourself.”"
pisces,2017-08-14,"You’re not interested in altering your schedule for anyone else today. In fact, you expect others to adapt to your calendar if they want to join in your cause. Being willing to meet on neutral territory makes a substantial difference.

taurus,2017-08-15,"There is a deluge of intense emotions flowing around you today, and it’s easy to get swept up in someone else’s drama. Every trivial event pushes your buttons, activating waves of fear or passion. You are compelled to take control of the situation, even if you don’t have the authority to do so. Nevertheless, the circumstances are not as dire as you think. There’s no need to panic; instead, step back from the chaos and take several deep breaths. Journalist Kimberly Jones wrote, “Don’t let people pull you into their storm. Instead, pull them into your peace.”"
gemini,2017-08-15,"Someone is pulling your strings at work today, and you’re not comfortable being played like a marionette. Although your adaptability is often your saving grace, it’s prudent to reconsider your reaction before taking the easy way out. You could fight back by resisting each tug one way or another.

Screenwriter Syd Field wrote, “Confusion is the first step toward clarity.”"

However, something weird happens now, and you could end up collecting more money at the cashier window than expected. Today’s lesson is about trust; when you relinquish control to the cosmos, things tend to work out in your favor. But if you deny your fears, you’ll find yourself in a losing battle. Eckhart Tolle wrote, “To offer no resistance to life is to be in a state of grace, ease, and lightness.”"
libra,2017-08-15,"You may be secretly battling your demons today, but you’re still able to put your best foot forward. No one realizes the intensity of your inner processing -- and that’s just fine with you because you’re not interested in revealing your vulnerability now. Unfortunately, it’s nearly impossible to deepen a relationship unless you can move past your fear of losing control. However, in order to benefit from someone’s support there must be mutual trust. Author Katrina Mayer wrote, “Integrity is making sure that the things you say and the things you do are in alignment.”"
scorpio,2017-08-15,"You’re eager to embark on an emotional journey if you think the destination is love. However, the cosmos is telling the story of your life today, and you can’t put the book down. Ironically, the plot is twisting in ways you don’t yet understand, which feels strangely familiar to you. You’re willing to follow along if you think there’s something for you to learn.

sagittarius,2017-08-15,"All the socializing in the world won’t save you from confronting your own emotions today. Paradoxically, you are attracted to the mystery of what could unfold in an intimate setting. Simultaneously, you’re afraid of getting in over your head. It appears that you must choose one or the other now, but the real cosmic message is you need to do both. Mooji teaches, “Face your fears and stop allowing the mind to hold you captive.”"
capricorn,2017-08-15,"The temptation of sweet romance plays on your heart strings now, but relationships come at a cost. You are acutely aware that innocence is beckoning you one way while the power of experience is pulling the other. However you proceed, don’t waste energy overthinking your decision today.

There is only one person responsible for the quality of your life; that person is you."
pisces,2017-08-15,"You may be obsessing over a person, place or idea today, yet you’re not necessarily telling anyone else about your feelings. However, the more you internalize your inclinations, the stronger they become. It makes more sense to get your emotions out in the open by confiding in someone you can trust. But be clear and let them know you’re not set on finding a solution; your intention is simply to get the facts off your chest. Your ability to express yourself confidently wins you the respect you deserve."
aries,2017-08-16,"It seems as if push has come to shove and you’re ready to rumble today. However, you may be explosive as contentious Mars rubs suspicious Pluto the wrong way. But the truth is you won’t resolve conflict by introducing additional drama. It makes more sense to take the high road by honoring your spiritual path, instead of undermining someone’s position.

taurus,2017-08-16,"You envision so many alternative routes into the future that you cannot tell which one is the most advantageous. Having all these choices is usually inspiring, but not if indecision prevents you from moving ahead. You might want to rely on your intuition now, instead of using logic to determine which way to go.

Imagination will take you everywhere."""
gemini,2017-08-16,"Your success is in question today, challenging you to make concrete plans to fortify your future. But four planets are aspecting illusory Neptune in your 10th House of Career, interfering with your sense of what’s real. Nevertheless, you want to demonstrate your competence by handling whatever life throws in your direction.

cancer,2017-08-16,"You’re more inclined to push past your fears today, and lay your feelings on the line. Nevertheless, you’re aware that people won’t necessarily agree with your heartfelt opinions. Honestly, you don’t mind a little dissension now, even if it contributes to your uncertainty.

leo,2017-08-16,"You may be surprised by the resistance you face as you strive to achieve your goals today. You believe you possess the stamina to fend off any disparaging criticism or overt obstruction. However, the real problem might stem from your unwillingness to compromise.

Social media consultant Simon Mainwaring wrote, “Creating a better world requires teamwork, partnerships and collaboration.”"

Author Charles Bukowski wrote, “Knowledge without follow-through is worse than no knowledge.”"
libra,2017-08-16,"Your plans for the future start off small but continue to grow larger by the minute. Although your ideas are worth cultivating now, they might become so inflated that they have no lasting value.

Goethe wrote, “Whatever you can do, or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power and magic in it.”"
scorpio,2017-08-16,"You are willing to put all your eggs into one basket today as you strive to reach the top of your profession. Unfortunately, you’re so determined to turn your ambitions into concrete achievements that you could misplace your social etiquette.

sagittarius,2017-08-16,"You’re thinking globally today, but need to rein in the scope of your plans if you are to succeed. Relationships can be complicated because others are supportive of your aspirations at first, only to remind you of your limitations later on. Your dreams seem so convincing now that it’s challenging to balance the possibilities with reality. Author André Gide wrote, “Man cannot discover new oceans unless he has the courage to lose sight of the shore.”"
capricorn,2017-08-16,"Although your destiny may be tied to someone else’s success, you’re willing to head out on your own today if necessary. You are so motivated by your ambitions that you will do nearly anything to accomplish your goals. However, ruthless Pluto controls your 1st House of Self now, demanding a direct and profound examination of your priorities. You’re tempted to impulsively act on your personal needs, but it’s imperative to take the concerns of others into account. Venkat Desireddy wrote, “Your wealth or status doesn’t make you. Your kindness and character does.”"
aquarius,2017-08-16,"Someone may be extremely melodramatic today in order to gain your attention. Although their goal is to persuade you to join in their fun, you have other activities on your mind. The talkative Gemini Moon brightens your 5th House of Self-Expression, urging you to share your plans with friends. Unfortunately, there are emotional undercurrents that need to be brought to the surface if you are to successfully engage with others now. Take a risk and show your true colors. Nietzsche wrote, “And those who were seen dancing were thought to be insane by those who could not hear the music.”"
pisces,2017-08-16,"You possess an excess amount of energy today, and prefer to channel your intensity into your work. A normally tedious regimen flows by quickly now that fiery Mars is heating up your 6th House of Daily Routine. However, its uncomfortable alignment with powerful Pluto is enough to turn an otherwise straightforward plan into a complex operation. Your motto for the day: less is more. Poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow wrote, “In character, in manner, in style, in all things, the supreme excellence is simplicity.”"
aries,2017-08-17,"Ignoring an intriguing opportunity isn’t your style, but you could be over-inundated with invitations that sound potentially rewarding now. You can’t stop people from sharing their big ideas with you when enriching Venus squares buoyant Jupiter in your 7th House of Others. However, it's prudent to be extremely discerning so you don’t fall into the trap of chasing every wild goose that catches your eye today, or you may end up with nothing to show for your efforts. Not all that glitters is gold."
taurus,2017-08-17,"Making time for guilty pleasures complicates your day, but that won’t likely prevent you from trying. You are longing for a taste of the sweetness of life while delicious Venus dynamically squares joyous Jupiter. Nevertheless, a whimsical fancy can grow into a distracting compulsion if you deny your needs.

Carl Jung wrote, “People will do anything, no matter how absurd, to avoid facing their own souls.”"
gemini,2017-08-17,"Thinking about a romantic liaison can hijack your morning, but following through might be more difficult than you expect. Oddly enough, what seemed so urgent earlier becomes lost in the busyness of the day. However, taking a break from the noise enables you to reconnect with the feelings you set aside.

cancer,2017-08-17,"Love is on your mind today, but you don’t need fireworks or expensive gifts. Instead, you long for emotional security and it might feel like you can’t get enough of it while romantic Venus in your sign squares giant Jupiter. You’re treading through tricky territory once the Moon enters tenacious Cancer, tempting you to cling to someone you adore. Acknowledging your needs is crucial now, but acting on them is not.

virgo,2017-08-17,"You may attempt to create opportunities to hang out with kindred spirits today. However, engineering social events is complicated by your preoccupation with unresolved emotional issues.

Cicero wrote, “Friendship improves happiness and abates misery by the doubling of our joy and the dividing of our grief.”"
libra,2017-08-17,"Your need to be recognized by your workmates may conflict with your wish to cultivate a personal relationship. Naturally, you want both but might have to choose one or the other because of demands on your time today.

sagittarius,2017-08-17,"Your friends are so supportive of your dreams now that it might feel as if the world is your oyster. Of course, it’s lovely when everything seems to be coming up roses, but it’s not so pretty when unspoken needs are left unfulfilled.

They are the gates and fences that allow you to enjoy the beauty of your own garden.”"
pisces,2017-08-17,"You might assume that everyone should know what you want when, in fact, you actually need to tell them.

Psychologist Brené Brown wrote, “If we want greater clarity in our purpose or deeper and more meaningful spiritual lives, vulnerability is the path.”"
aries,2017-08-18,"You need to take care of yourself now, and hope to enjoy a day of rest and relaxation.

Instead, establish the topic of your discussion around your frustration of feeling out of place. Brené Brown wrote, “Daring to set boundaries is about having the courage to love ourselves, even when we risk disappointing others.”"
gemini,2017-08-18,"Your self-esteem may suffer today if an authority figure gives you unsolicited feedback that’s less than stellar. The truth is that someone might be trying to help now by offering you constructive criticism. Unfortunately, you’re already assuming the worst possible review and all you consciously receive is the negative judgment. It takes extra effort to listen to what is being said rather than what you expect to hear. Winston Churchill said, “A pessimist sees the difficulty in every opportunity; an optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty.”"
cancer,2017-08-18,"You are rather thin-skinned today, possibly setting you up for a disappointment in a relationship.

Obviously, respecting boundaries is necessary; you don’t want to be overly needy by revealing too many unresolved feelings today. On the other hand, sharing your inner process fuels increased intimacy. Screenwriter Frank Crane wrote, “We're never so vulnerable than when we trust someone -- but paradoxically, if we cannot trust, neither can we find love or joy.”"
libra,2017-08-18,"You want your coworkers to reach a little further today when it comes to getting to know you. You could take the lead in nudging a professional relationship toward one of familiarity by sharing an experience from your personal life.

The safe place where we can go as we are and not be questioned.”"

In theory, you like the idea of emotionally bonding with someone you love; but in practice, you prefer to build intimacy by sharing an experience.

capricorn,2017-08-18,"A hot relationship may grow chilly today, especially if you’re unwilling to stick with an emotional conversation until the tide turns. This cooling off might simply be the natural backlash of recent overheating. Or, it can be the catalyst for an intense growth phase as a new wave of honesty pulls you closer to one another. The key is to remember that your feelings are in process now. If you pull away from the other person, a passing moment of discontent could become a permanent freeze. Anyone can love you when the Sun is shining. In the storms is where you learn who truly cares for you."
aquarius,2017-08-18,"You strive for consistency in your relationships  because your satisfaction is supported by emotional security.

Author Robert Holder wrote, “Your relationship with yourself sets the tone for every other relationship you have.”"
pisces,2017-08-18,"Your life is complicated by your current depth of feeling for someone special, yet you wouldn’t want it any other way. Love should be simple, but sometimes circumstances confront you with situations that are unchangeable. Meanwhile, you can’t just make an emotion go away because it’s inconvenient. In fact, denial only increases the intensity of an attraction. But all is not lost; as is often the case, communication is the key to deepening a connection.

gemini,2017-08-19,"There is a story to tell, and no one will dare to interrupt your performance now.

aquarius,2017-08-19,"Dealing with a relationship crisis continues to dominate your emotional bandwidth, even if it is part of a larger and more complex set of circumstances.

You enjoy getting to the bottom of a psychological mystery, but it might be better to just let this anomaly rest without further investigation. Giving others the space they need, whatever the reason, is a gift that actually improves your friendship. Respect is a two-way street."
sagittarius,2017-08-24,"Fantasy and reality overlap in confusing ways today, motivating you to sidestep an emotional encounter. However, your evasive tactics don’t necessarily resolve the issue and could lead to further uncertainty. Although asking a few simple questions may be enough to bring clarity, the answers you receive could raise twice as many concerns. Fortunately, you don’t have to understand everything now; you only need to know the facts. Keep connecting the dots and the big picture will make sense in time."
capricorn,2017-08-24,"People frequently rely on you Mountain Goats when they are trying to get their bearings. However, it’s as if your GPS doesn’t match up with reality now, leaving you unsure how to navigate through the unpredictable energies of the day. Unfortunately, the more you try to wrap your mind around the logistics today, the more disjointed you become. Once you choose to stop struggling, everything changes. Temporarily accepting the supremacy of your imagination frees you to enjoy the magic all around you. You will return to the real world before you know it, but with a wildly different perspective."
aquarius,2017-08-24,"You’re secretly thrilled about the prospect of tossing out your schedule and simply starting over from scratch. Perhaps you worked yourself into a corner by putting so much on your calendar today that the slightest deviation could bring it all down like a house of cards. Instead of waiting for the inevitable, you’re able to pull the plug yourself and breathe a sigh of relief. Nevertheless, once you have a clean slate, you still need to recreate your day. Thankfully, you can do it in a manner that works for you, instead of everyone else. What feels like the end is often the beginning."
pisces,2017-08-24,"Life is a juggling act today. On one hand, your associates may be pushing you for more details about your work schedule. On the other hand, you are less interested in the specifics of the real world while you are happily preoccupied with the supernatural dimensions of your daydreams. Normally, you can balance the two realms with great finesse, but you have little patience now for the trappings of the mundane. Nevertheless, you must compromise enough to successfully manage everyone’s expectations. Activist Gloria Steinem wrote, “Instead of either/or, I discovered a whole world of and.”"
aries,2017-08-25,"Someone may bring an intriguing opportunity to your attention today, but you don’t need to automatically accept the offer just because you can. In fact, this could be a test to see if your discriminatory powers are working at an optimal level. It’s tempting to react in a positive manner when the Moon cavorts with lucky Jupiter in your 7th House of Others, but only time will tell if your involvement is a wise move. Author George Eliot wrote, “It is a narrow mind which cannot look at a subject from various points of view.”"
taurus,2017-08-25,"You’re feeling very confident about your work today, but someone may have a hidden agenda lurking behind a smokescreen. Thankfully, you can take nearly anything in stride as long as your primary concern is everyone’s wellbeing. If you try to subvert the powerful cosmic energy for your individual benefit now, your scheme will likely backfire. Professor Carlos Wallace wrote, “The tide seldom shifts in favor of a selfish individual.”"
gemini,2017-08-25,"You have something on your mind and you’ll tell it to anyone who will listen today. It’s not necessarily an emotional disclosure as much as you wish to discuss your thoughts about a recent event or an unexpected interaction. You’ve analyzed it from every possible angle and are hoping to receive constructive criticism. Naturally, you have control over your words and actions, but may lack the authority to direct anyone else now. Don’t be concerned if feedback isn’t forthcoming yet. Aristotle wrote, “Patience is bitter, but its fruit is sweet.”"
cancer,2017-08-25,"Frustration sets in when you feel as if you’re at the end of your rope. It’s a tough position, but you realize there is nowhere productive to go from here.

Never underestimate your strength; never overestimate your weakness."
leo,2017-08-25,"The atmosphere is rife with potential for pleasure today. However, you might give up too soon, thinking you already missed your chance to indulge in the finer things of life. Nevertheless, your timing is off, since your best opportunities to find enjoyment are still just around the corner. But don’t wait for a better moment; seek satisfaction now with the understanding that it will likely be a while before you achieve gratification. Paulo Coelho wrote, “Why is patience so important? Because it makes us pay attention.”"
virgo,2017-08-25,"Your obsession for detail might conflict with your desire to meet someone’s expectations today. Of course, other people are likely to have lower production standards than you, so they may expect quantity rather than quality. Thankfully, the diplomatic Moon-Jupiter conjunction encourages you to set aside your penchant for perfectionism now in favor of getting more work done. Philosopher Immanuel Kant wrote, “Out of the crooked timber of humanity, no straight thing was ever made.”"
libra,2017-08-25,"You exude good vibes today, even if there are serious issues that prevent your mind from wandering too far off track. Your coworkers are more than curious about your ability to juxtapose lighthearted whims with heavier thoughts. Luckily, your no-nonsense attitude about your responsibilities elevates your reputation among your peers, especially if you can still enjoy a good laugh. Life coach Jana Kingsford teaches, “Balance is not something you find, it's something you create.”"
scorpio,2017-08-25,"Your current enthusiasm may not be so obvious to others today. In fact, you might consciously hide your optimism now that the Moon’s conjunction with cheerful Jupiter occurs in your 12th House of Secrets. Nevertheless, you’re able to project an emotional intensity that empowers you to finish your tasks. Although there are many sides to your complex nature, you’re not required to pick one while eliminating the rest. Shakespeare wrote, “There is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so.”"

pisces,2017-08-25,"The inner workings of your imagination inspire you to contribute at work in a unique manner now. It’s easy to quantify the production of someone who is performing a repeatable task. But it’s harder to measure the impact of your intuitive talent because it comes as a burst of ingenious magic. Going out on a limb may be necessary today, but any mistakes made are proof you are trying. President Franklin D. Roosevelt said, “Happiness lies in the joy of achievement and the thrill of creative effort.”"
aries,2017-08-26,"It’s as if summer is starting all over again and all you want to do is play. Although innocent Venus dances into your 5th House of Fun and Games, the Scorpio Moon’s square to Venus tints the color of romance with darker shades of gray. You are drawn to the transformational power of love, but wish to keep the energy light and easy. Resistance is futile when it comes to your heart. Author Sharon Salzberg wrote, “When we are willing to explore our own experiences, we open the doorway to deeper connection and intimacy.”"
taurus,2017-08-26,"Someone’s words or mannerisms can trigger memories that take you on a sentimental journey today.

cancer,2017-08-26,"Your senses are particularly sharp today, enabling you to tell the difference between acceptable and extraordinary. For example, some people might not notice, but you can discern the nuances between food that tastes good and an epicurean delight.

Hinckley wrote, “Mediocrity will never do. You are capable of something better.”"
leo,2017-08-26,"You attract the loveliest people you can imagine today because you are so disarmingly friendly to everyone you meet. Broaching a difficult topic now is no more difficult than chatting about the weather. In fact, you prefer to compromise or help others smooth over their disagreements because peace is more pleasant than conflict. Although it takes little effort to get your own way, the enjoyable benefits of delicious Venus in your sign only last for a few weeks. Make hay while the Sun shines. Opportunities to create harmony won’t last forever."
virgo,2017-08-26,"Your idea of love is entangled with service, and you may put everyone else’s needs ahead of yours now. Of course, caring for others might have a negative impact on a romantic connection, but delaying personal gratification can lead to longer-term spiritual satisfaction.

Define your boundaries and defend them with conviction."
libra,2017-08-26,"You are in your happy place when spending time with your friends or family. You thrive in social situations where conversations flow freely and affections are shared generously. Fortunately, you’re more enamored than ever with dancing, chatting and even flirting when appropriate. Don’t go looking for complications now; keep it simple while you can. There will be plenty of time later on to sink into the intensity of the shadow work yet to be done. Albert Schweitzer wrote, “Happiness is the only thing that multiplies when you share it.”"
scorpio,2017-08-26,"Regardless of what you do for work, and no matter what your role within the community, it’s time to bring more creativity into your public life. Although your feelings might be quite extreme now that the Moon is back in your passionate sign, you want to show everyone what a beautiful world people can create if they believe in themselves. Your voice carries immense authority today, so use it with care and compassion. Poet Emily Dickinson wrote, “I know nothing in the world that has as much power as a word. Sometimes I write one, and I look at it, until it begins to shine.”"
sagittarius,2017-08-26,"All too often you get bit by the travel bug and the only known cure is to pull out your passport and board a plane to distant lands. Unfortunately, a lunar square may not support your penchant for journeying to exotic places while pleasure-seeking Venus is moving through your 9th House of Big Ideas. You are not interested in accumulating awesome experiences like notches on your belt unless you can also connect with the meaning of life at the same time. Zig Ziglar’s advice still holds true today: “Don’t count the things you do, do the things that count.”"
capricorn,2017-08-26,"You must be careful or you could misinterpret someone’s actions today, thinking deeper yet unspoken emotions are attached to them. You are less interested in casual friendships now that loving Venus has taken up residence in your 8th House of Intimacy and Transformation. But self-awareness is key so that you don’t mix up your feelings with those of anyone else. Dr. Cornel West wrote, “We have to recognize that there cannot be relationships unless there is commitment, unless there is loyalty, unless there is love, patience and persistence.”"
aquarius,2017-08-26,"All types of relationships have a chance to grow sweeter now as you make your feelings known without leaving room for complications. A romance can deepen if you’re willing to expose your vulnerability by sharing your heart. Fortunately, you’re less inclined to try to get your own way while gracious Venus is traveling through your 7th House of Others. Working for mutual benefit is admirable as long as you don’t forget that loving others starts with loving yourself."
pisces,2017-08-26,"You are more comfortable showering your affection on someone today than you are receiving the sweet offerings of love. Oddly enough for you psychic Fish, it’s easier to participate in an intellectual conversation than an emotional one now. You might be less than romantically inclined while valuable Venus moves through your 6th House of Logistics. Focusing on the mechanics of the real world currently improves your relationships more than losing yourself in an unattainable fantasy. Let your actions speak for your heart."
aries,2017-08-27,"There are many techniques available to dig beneath the surface, but you may not need any of them because your senses are naturally attuned to subtle energies today. Although you often avoid the uncertainties of the dark, it’s easy to slip into unfamiliar waters as the emotional Scorpio Moon travels through your 8th House of Deep Sharing. Fortunately, you can trust your intuition now, because the cosmos is nudging you closer to the edge while protecting you from going over it. Walk on the wild side while you have the chance."
taurus,2017-08-27,"Sometimes it’s hard to understand why people make things so complicated. A close friend or partner may entangle your emotions with overly possessive behavior when the passionate Scorpio Moon activates your 7th House of Others today. Jealousy or suspicion could muddy the waters of an otherwise wonderful relationship. Fortunately, spilling all the details can clear things up quicker than you might imagine.

Whether you are dealing with long-term chronic problems, an acute pain, or just a minor readjustment, you can see your situation from a very practical perspective now. It’s not necessary to change everything all at once; just pick one aspect of your diet, exercise routine, or lifestyle and make a sustainable improvement. Inch by inch it’s a cinch. But don’t wait until tomorrow to do what can be done today."
cancer,2017-08-27,"Your feelings are running fiercely strong today, like an ocean current that is cutting a deep channel. People who don’t know you well might think you’re shy, but you’re holding back your emotions because they are powerful enough now to sweep others off their feet. However, you’re willing to share your desires and fears with someone who can meet you in those deeper waters without needing a flotation device. Joseph Campbell wrote, “The cave you fear to enter holds the treasure that you seek.”"
leo,2017-08-27,"Although you Lions are known to be social creatures, sometimes you need to roar, “Enough!” Establishing clear boundaries is a healthy strategy when you must escape from the noise of your life. The Moon’s visit to your 4th House of Security makes for a perfect day to hide away in the privacy of your own home or camp out under a favorite tree. But this retreat is not just about being alone now; it’s about journeying within and increasing your self-awareness. Kristen Butler wrote, “In solitude I find my answers.”"
virgo,2017-08-27,"Reclaiming ownership of your personal space may be more challenging than you expect. The Scorpio Moon encourages extreme emotional reactions today, and her visit to your 3rd House of Distractions inspires your current all-or-nothing attitude. But you might have a minor battle on your hands if someone feels excluded or even abandoned. However, this is not your problem unless you choose to engage it. Therapist Mary Crocker Cook wrote, “Without access to his feelings a man can’t help but lose track of who he is, what his priorities are and what is normal for him.”"
libra,2017-08-27,"Hold onto your money because your purchases may be motivated by all the wrong reasons today. The needy Moon is lingering in your 2nd House of Possessions, activating unconscious patterns that influence your spending habits. You can’t make fully informed decisions if your subconscious triggers reactions that are invisible to you. Spiritual master Dr. Amit Ray wrote, “Life is beautiful. Suffering is due to unconscious following.”"
scorpio,2017-08-27,"You are the epitome of moodiness today, but this doesn’t necessarily mean you’re wearing a frown on your face. Honestly, the changeable Moon’s current visit to your sign keeps you and those nearby hopping just to monitor the shifting emotional landscape. Fortunately, the Moon is nestled in between expansive Jupiter and contractive Saturn, empowering you to find the fulcrum on the see-saw of life. Hermann Hesse wrote, “You are only afraid if you are not in harmony with yourself.”"
sagittarius,2017-08-27,"You seem to have all the answers today, but appearances can be misleading. Clever Mercury energizes your 10th House of Status, blessing you with the necessary confidence to state your case clearly at work. But the opinionated Scorpio Moon is operating undercover in your 12th House of Invisibility, urging you to keep your feelings to yourself. You are under no obligation -- personal or professional -- to justify your restraint. Lao Tzu wrote, “Silence is a source of great strength.”"
capricorn,2017-08-27,"You feel overly protective toward your friends today, perhaps it is karma in action or simply that you woke up on the generous side of the bed. If they need defending, you are there in a moment’s notice. If they are hungry, you feed them. But you can’t be everything to everyone, so you must make some hard choices now. Acknowledging your limitations early in the day enables you to make the wisest use of your time. Dr. Lynne Namka wrote, “Love in action is service to the world.”"
aquarius,2017-08-27,"You are exceptionally benevolent and compassionate today, offering solace to those special people you love and respect.

You may be inadvertently inviting the resistance with your overly forceful approach. Relieve the pressure by backing off now. Publicist Jessica Hatchigan wrote, “There’s an important difference between giving up and letting go.”"
taurus,2017-08-28,"Interpersonal intrigue adds complications to your life today as conversations tread into unchartered territory. Although a discussion can reveal buried feelings, the outcome is relief once the truth is told. You have an opportunity to evolve and a chance to deepen an existing relationship now, if you’re willing to place yourself in a position of vulnerability.

Honesty saves everyone’s time."
cancer,2017-08-28,"Resolving a misunderstanding between you and a close friend is at the top of your list today. At first, you seem to be all over the map but your position becomes clear as you continue to talk. Perhaps your windup is slow, but your pitch is fast and smooth once you have an engaged audience. But don’t overstay your welcome; say what you must and then respectfully bow out. Rest assured your words will have their intended impact, but it might take time for your message to sink in. James N. Watkins wrote, “A river cuts through rock, not because of its power, but because of its persistence.”"
leo,2017-08-28,"An interpersonal or interdepartmental conflict at work can bring you out of your corner and directly into the fray today. It’s not that you’re looking for trouble; it’s just that you want to play your part in ameliorating the tension that’s distracting people from doing their jobs. Instead of climbing up on a soapbox and shouting your opinions, you can be a more effective agent of change now by asking intelligent questions. Naturally, gathering the facts helps you clarify your position, but it also enables everyone else to become more informed, too. Diplomacy is your friend."
virgo,2017-08-28,"You are not interested in dredging up more data today; you’re already swimming in a sea of unrelated facts. Instead, you can bring your expertise to a complicated situation at work by looking for patterns in what you already know. Focus on analysis rather than investigation. Isolate the most important points and then connect the dots so everyone can see things the way you do.

You are not typically one to stir up conflict, but you won’t avoid it today if you think you’re being manipulated. You believe your cause is worth fighting for now. Of course, you understand that everyone has their own agenda, but yours is one that is inclusive. You encourage others to pursue their own paths, but you demand the same in return.

scorpio,2017-08-28,"You’re ready to go to bat for your friends because you know they would do the same for you. Communicator Mercury is working in cohorts with potent Pluto, serving you an extra dose of courage. You don’t take your relationships casually and are willing to accept any criticism that might result as you cut to the chase. But don’t become too attached to achieving results. Since Mercury is still retrograde, it could take several days before you begin to see progress. It’s been said that there is no such thing as failure, only delayed success."
sagittarius,2017-08-28,"Sometimes it feels as if your world is moving in slow motion, even though you are going at full speed. Your frustration level could be on the rise now if your values clash with those of your boss.

capricorn,2017-08-28,"You know how the system is supposed to work, but somehow crossed wires are messing with the results. Rather than untangling the current communication snafu, you want to get to the bottom of the chaos by fixing the structure itself. Unfortunately, the way out of this dilemma is complicated by the fact that some key players won’t even acknowledge there’s a problem. There’s no point in trying to push your position now; change is more likely if people realize the truth on their own. Discerning the difference between what you can control and what you can’t saves the day."
aquarius,2017-08-28,"You’re unhappy with the current direction that’s being taken at work today. However, you don’t think it’s in your best interest to spend your time and energy fighting against the status quo, especially if your beliefs are in the minority.

Keep the faith; your moment in the spotlight is coming sooner than you think."
pisces,2017-08-28,"You’re busy mustering support for one of your pet dreams but can’t understand why others are slow to jump in with their support today. But the current lack of help might not be an indication that your proposed course of action is a bad one. It’s more likely that the weak link in the chain is your presentation rather than your proposition. Fortunately, your chances will improve once cerebral Mercury turns direct next week. In the meantime, continue to solidify your plan while rehearsing your performance. Cicero wrote, “We should be as careful of our words as of our actions.”"
aries,2017-08-29,"It feels as if yesterday’s siege is over. Everything at work that was shouting “No!” is now encouraging you by screaming “Yes!” Although this positive feedback sounds like good news, it might actually be too much excitement too fast. You may overreact to the bountiful reassurance, only to later realize that you’ve spread yourself too thin. Avoid problems by proactively resisting the temptation to promise to do it all. Novelist Charles Dickens wrote, “Scattered wits take a long time in picking up.”"
taurus,2017-08-29,"A feast of good luck signals the temporary end to a difficult period of profound change. You are acutely aware of the many blessings in your life now; suddenly there are too many opportunities rather than none. Although the current bounty assuredly feels better than the recent scarcity, you still long for simplicity, however elusive it may be today. Economist E. F. Schumacher wrote, “Any intelligent fool can make things bigger, more complex, and more violent. It takes a touch of genius -- and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction.”"

Ironically, you might feel as if you’re freer to operate with self-determination if you’re required to work within the sensible constraints of your limitations. Nevertheless, your I-can-do-it attitude still increases your chances of success as long as you don’t push yourself too hard. Poet E.E. Cummings wrote, “Once we believe in ourselves, we can risk curiosity, wonder, spontaneous delight, or any experience that reveals the human spirit.”"

You have little doubt that you can accomplish your goals on the job, especially since your optimism is supported by your mental acuity. But don’t get too cocky with your promises; there’s probably more work now than you estimated. Pace yourself and you could surprise everyone with how much you finish in just one day. Google co-founder Larry Page says, “Always deliver more than expected.”"
leo,2017-08-29,"You can’t figure out whether everything has changed permanently or if your current good luck is just a blip on your radar.

In fact, your actions today can stretch a passing opportunity into a long-term influence if you are willing to take a calculated risk. Roman poet Virgil wrote, “Fortune sides with him who dares.”"
virgo,2017-08-29,"Sometimes you can be so focused on one tiny detail of a project that you lose sight of the big picture.

Don’t let your fears shadow your productivity; just maintain your enthusiasm and do your best. Whatever you lose in efficiency now, you will compensate for with your positive attitude."
scorpio,2017-08-29,"You aren’t amused by someone’s cavalier approach to life today. You may be frustrated when people don’t seem to share the same commitment to follow-through as you. You understand that everyone varies greatly in their approach to work, but you find it difficult to cut them as much slack as they seem to need. However, relationships are two-way streets and you might be happier if there was compromise on both sides now. Giving people room to be themselves also motivates them to reach for higher levels of excellence. Lead by your actions, not your words."
sagittarius,2017-08-29,"You are wrangling with one of your familiar bouts of wanderlust, making it tricky to stay on task at work today. The Moon’s monthly visit to your travel-happy sign reminds you that adventure is just an airplane ticket away. But it may be less important to manifest your dream journey now than to understand why you want to escape. Reassess your current responsibilities and what you must do to be free of obligations.

Sir Thomas Browne wrote, “All wonders you seek are within yourself.”"

Although opportunistic Jupiter in your 10th House of Career is activated by four planets today, you can also feel overwhelmed by the scope of your current plans. There’s no need to rush the return of Saturn’s realism; the black-and-white details will be obvious soon enough. In the meantime, enjoy dwelling in the realm of possibility instead of the land of calculated certainty. Coloring outside the lines is healthy for your heart."
aquarius,2017-08-29,"It’s nearly impossible to keep your mind on the present moment when you can see so much positive potential in the future. You may be sitting on pins and needles as you try to anticipate what you will discover around the next bend in the road. But instead of attempting to garner a glimpse of the shape of things to come, enthusiastically embrace the unknown.

pisces,2017-08-29,"There’s little room for error as you calculate what you need to do to propel your life to the next level. Your current goal is to fully manifest your potential and take control of your trajectory -- no simple task, especially in these complex times. You don’t need to accept other people’s limited thinking or the restrictions they place on you now. Author Rasheed Ogunlaru wrote, “You'll find that more doors open if you approach them with an open heart rather than a closed mind.”"
aries,2017-08-30,"Alternating waves of hot and cold wash over you so quickly today that you can’t remember which side of the issue you’re on. It’s like playing on one sporting team and being traded to the opposing team in the middle of the game. Nevertheless, you still try to do the best you can to prove your worth. Fortunately, your flip-flopping leads to you knowing more about both perspectives than anyone else. People appreciate your judgment when you finally make up your mind. Confucius wrote, “It is more shameful to distrust our friends than to be deceived by them.”"
taurus,2017-08-30,"You may learn something today that helps you clarify your position on a work-related subject.

Unfortunately, complicating factors from other dimensions slip into the equation now, triggering doubt and confusion. An existential crisis can be painful, but deep thinking eventually leads to progress. You must polish many rocks until you discover a diamond."
gemini,2017-08-30,"It seems as if someone is purposefully restraining your creative expression today. Thankfully, an authority who resists your efforts at first, changes positions to return a little later as your biggest fan. But you must take the lead and go on record by clearly stating your values. Once everyone has shared a short opening statement, it’s easier to maintain group cohesion. However, it’s unnecessary to extract a concession from anyone. There is no endgame and no need for any one person to win. Bertrand Russell wrote, “The only thing that will redeem mankind is cooperation.”"
cancer,2017-08-30,"You’re unhappy with your schedule today, because there seems to be very little flexibility when it comes to your work. Your boss has given you specific deadlines when each part of the project must be complete. Although your trajectory was on target, something happens out of the blue and might set your progress back a bit. Your overall agenda is being rewritten and you have neither the initiative nor the stamina to follow it in detail. Clear your mind with a quick walk or a three-minute meditation. Resiliency is your friend."
leo,2017-08-30,"You are cautious in romance today because you want to create enduring satisfaction rather than chase unattainable wild swans. New love brings with it expectations, spoken or not, that grow in complexity as the partnership evolves. Relationships entail compromise, communication and commitment. Choosing your partners wisely includes listening to both your head and your heart. Poet Roy Disney wrote, “It's not hard to make decisions when you know what your values are.”"
virgo,2017-08-30,"A family member might actively play out your fear of losing control of your emotions today.

Zig Ziglar wrote, “Regardless of your lot in life, build something beautiful on it.”"
libra,2017-08-30,"You have been running hard just to keep up with all the changes, but you can pause and take a few deep breaths today. In fact, the buoyant Sagittarius Moon plays a game of truth or dare with authoritative Saturn in your 3rd House of Communication. You must clarify everything said to you now to make sure you heard it correctly. Don’t take anything for granted. Check your facts, check your schedule and then check your attitude. Slowing down allows you to get it right the first time."
scorpio,2017-08-30,"You may be your own harshest critic but self-reflection can lead to an important breakthrough in your thinking today. It’s one thing to talk yourself out of taking well-earned time off because you’re worried about negative feedback from your peers. Thankfully, a long conversation with a trusted friend helps you see the situation from a fresh perspective and frees you from unnecessary guilt. Book your tickets before you find another excuse to postpone a trip of a lifetime."
sagittarius,2017-08-30,"A sobering self-realization prompts you to get your head out of the clouds and reexamine every nook and cranny of your current life. Create space for contemplation and consider what is working for you now and what is not. But don’t let this just be a mental exercise today; you will need to act on your thoughts or they’ll just go to waste. However, Mercury is still retrograde, so set your launch date on your new and improved lifestyle for next week. Benjamin Franklin wrote, “Lost time is never found again.”"
capricorn,2017-08-30,"You can see the lights ahead of you are turning green one after another, as if the cosmos is informing you that you’re ready to begin a new project. Nevertheless, you’re in a tricky phase as the old cycle hasn’t quite drawn to a close, and there’s a few details still left to iron out. Use the extra time to finish old business and complete your preparations for the journey ahead. Don’t fritter away the hours; make a plan and stay singularly focused. Your future self will thank you for everything you do now."
aquarius,2017-08-30,"You’re looking ahead with great anticipation while still feeling overwhelmed with your current responsibilities. You aren’t thrilled that your coworkers are placing such high expectations on your contribution. You don’t think you can live up to their lofty demands. Unfortunately, your worries about your performance will take their toll, so you must break the vicious cycle before negative effects begin to accumulate.

pisces,2017-08-30,"A close friend is performing some important magic that can positively influence your day. You might believe you’re functioning in a vacuum at work and you are the only one watching out for your best interests. However, it turns out a secret admirer has been scheming on your behalf and may have a plan that improves upon your existing one. Whatever you do, don’t close out potentially helpful guidance, even if it comes from an unexpected source. Author George S. Clason wrote, “Advice is one thing that is freely given away, but watch that you only take what is worth having.”"
aries,2017-08-31,"An ambitious set of goals defines your priorities today, but your attention is pulled simultaneously in several different directions. You’re passionate about demonstrating your ability to make a plan and then execute it efficiently. However, trickster Mercury retrogrades into flirtatious Leo, inviting you to indulge in an instant replay of your favorite distractions. If you want to accomplish your original objectives, you can’t waste time drifting in daydreams now. Actions prove who you are; words just prove who you want to be."
taurus,2017-08-31,"Distant horizons beckon now and you’re already traveling down the yellow brick road in your mind. But you are not succumbing to unrealistic fantasies today; instead, you can see the long-term impact your current behavior will have on your life. You are determined to create the future you envision. But your key planet Venus is sending mixed messages, requiring you to discern which actions are productive and which can lead you astray. Novelist Jonathan Safran Foer wrote, “These little daily choices that we’re so used to thinking are irrelevant are the most important things we do all day long.”"
gemini,2017-08-31,"You’re unhappy about the weight of responsibility that’s falling on your shoulders today. A recent struggle established your current trajectory, but you thought you already did the hard work and only need to follow through with the details now. However, your assessment isn’t accurate as new challenges demand an additional level of commitment. Don’t question your previous decisions. Postpone social activities if you must and take care of the pressing business at hand. Aristotle wrote, “Pleasure in the job puts perfection in the work.”"
cancer,2017-08-31,You are one half of a partnership that is requiring you to show up in ways that are taxing your patience. Perhaps you are not as motivated to achieve worldly success as someone assumed. Or maybe your significant other seems more ambitious than you while the calculating Capricorn Moon visits your 7th House of Others. Don’t worry about your different workstyles today. Honor the nurturing perspective you bring to the table because it helps to balance the pragmatic nature of your work. Collaboration divides the task and multiplies the success.
leo,2017-08-31,"You may experience a positive boost of energy today, inspiring you to take on a new responsibility, participate in a fun activity, or a mixture of both. Mischievous Mercury backs into sassy Leo, joining sensual Venus and sexy Mars already camped out in your sign. Nevertheless, there is important work to be done and you can’t wait to start.

Working hard for something we love is called passion.”"
libra,2017-08-31,"Success isn’t necessarily limited to achievements in the outer world. In fact, the reflective Moon’s shift into industrious Capricorn highlights your 4th House of Family, turning your thoughts to your personal life rather than professional matters. You might pass up a lucrative work-related opportunity if it means you are able to spend more time at home. Take pride in making the ones you love your top priority. Walt Disney said, “A man should never neglect his family for business.”"
scorpio,2017-08-31,"You are very methodical in your approach to time management today. You are reevaluating your commitment to your career now that there are three planets rattling your 10th House of Public Life. Nevertheless, clever Mercury backs into playful Leo, blessing you with a childlike perspective on problem-solving and allowing you to look at a no-win situation in a new light. Thankfully, a couple of minor adjustments to your daily routine puts your life back on track. Actor Scott Caan said, “Good things happen when you set your priorities straight.”"
sagittarius,2017-08-31,"You can visualize your goals with amazing clarity today. In fact, you may even hear them calling to you from the distant horizon. However, you don’t have a clue how to get from where you are now to where you want to be. Be patient with yourself and the ideas will flow soon enough. Don’t expect immediate results, but everything will fall into place if your intentions are clear, your aim is true and you’re willing to commit to following through to the end. President Thomas Jefferson said, “I'm a greater believer in luck, and I find the harder I work the more I have of it.”"
capricorn,2017-08-31,"You are highly motivated to climb the ladder of success and your unrelenting commitment today all but ensures you will reach the top.

aquarius,2017-08-31,"Just because others can’t see how ambitious you are now, you’re not any less driven. In fact, the goal-oriented Capricorn Moon rules your day, but her presence in your 12th House of Secrets keeps her influence invisible to everyone except you. Meanwhile, interactive Mercury slips back into generous Leo and your 7th House of Significant Others, empowering you to shine your innocent love light rather than flash your relentless drive for power. Author Richelle E. Goodrich wrote, “Those things that inspire, enthuse, and compel you should consume your life.”"
pisces,2017-08-31,"You see everything in light of cause and effect today. Karma is ruling your roost, encouraging you to consider your behavior along with its consequences. However, your focus is not on your goals; it’s on the details of each and every action you initiate. It's all too easy to get so caught up in the minutiae that you lose sight of the big picture. Nevertheless, as Lao Tzu wrote, “A journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step.”"
aries,2017-09-01,"You’re eager for a simple solution to a complex problem today. Your key planet Mars encourages you to uncover the truth no matter what the cost, but its misalignment with wounded Chiron can send false signals that steer you in the wrong direction. But the elusiveness of a single answer becomes apparent the harder you push toward resolution. Ultimately, you may realize the only path now is one of flexibility, which obviously requires you to keep your options open. Entrepreneur Martha Stewart said, “The more you adapt, the more interesting you are.”"
taurus,2017-09-01,"You may be so set in your ways that you lose your ability to adjust to the changing dynamics of the day. However, your willpower is your not-so-secret weapon and it inspires you to replace the status quo with something new and different. Nevertheless, someone might step forward without warning to interrupt a part of your favorite routine. Instead of only reacting with resistance, explore several choices before deciding on your course of action. Author Israelmore Ayivor wrote, “Try again; you have millions of alternatives. Fill yourself with the bullets of hope and you will kill failure with one shot.”"
gemini,2017-09-01,"Although people might criticize your tendency to live on the lighter side of the spectrum, you can sink into the emotional complexities today as easily as you can fly a kite. The uncertainty of the darkness is not frightening to you while the Moon joins shadowy Pluto in your 8th House of Transformation.

Author Thomas Moore wrote, “It is only through mystery and madness that the soul is revealed.”"
cancer,2017-09-01,"It seems as if everyone is in your face today and an excess of passion is lurking at every gate that leads to another conversation. Ironically, the fantasies you try to hide are the very same ones that are responsible for making others seem so intense now. No doubt, a cooling off period would relieve the tension but it’s challenging to untangle your emotional webs. Rather than participating in someone’s melodrama directly, examining your core beliefs adds a layer of space between you and issues that are not yours to resolve. Author Joyce Rachelle wrote, “If people keep stepping on you, wear a pointy hat.”"
leo,2017-09-01,"You are like an entire parade today, all by yourself. There’s so much emphasis on the lively Leo planets today that it’s challenging to find any time to rest. However, you could become so involved with your work that you lose track of the time. Keep shifting your focus from the details in your immediate environment to the larger cosmic perspective. Your interest in maximizing change will serve you well in the long run.

Bennett wrote, “You will never follow your own inner voice until you clear up the doubts in your mind.”"
libra,2017-09-01,"You’re already planning your weekend but you could grow obsessive if you can’t decide whether you want to be social or stay home. Naturally, your choice doesn’t need to be one-hundred percent either way; you can combine the best of both worlds. Nevertheless, you may be stuck in an all-too-familiar dilemma because you can see the advantages either way. Make the most of the moment by listing all the costs and benefits for each option before settling on one way or the other. William Jennings Bryan said, “Destiny is not a matter of chance; it is a matter of choice. It is not a thing to be waited for, it is a thing to be achieved.”"

Perception precedes action. Right action follows the right perspective.”"
sagittarius,2017-09-01,"You might be revisiting old plans for a quick getaway, only to be disappointed when you realize that they’re so outdated you would be better to start anew. However, don’t be so quick that you toss out a good idea along with the rubbish.

Benjamin Franklin wrote, “An investment in knowledge pays the best interest.”"
capricorn,2017-09-01,"Mere mortals are no match for you today because your superhero stamina runs deep. A Moon-Pluto collaboration merges your feelings with a bottomless pit of passion, empowering you let someone know how you feel without getting pulled off track by irrelevant issues. There’s no reason to change your destination, even if there are substantial obstacles in the road. However, exploring other routes to the same goal will improve your chances for emotional satisfaction. Your heart knows things that your mind can’t explain."
aquarius,2017-09-01,"Your friends and colleagues may think you’re overly generous with your time today, but you’re not actually giving up as much independence as they assume. Three planets in dramatic Leo shine in your 7th House of Relationships, enabling you to project your playful energy now. Nevertheless, the passionate Moon-Pluto combo in your 12th House of Privacy urges you to hold significant feelings close to your chest. Others will make their judgments with whatever facts they have at their disposal; you’re the only one who knows how they deviate from the truth. Author Steven Aitchison wrote, “Honesty has a power very few people can handle.”"
pisces,2017-09-01,"You want to make a splash at work today and are willing to focus your energy on leaving positive influences in your wake.

Unfortunately, you may risk more than is logical as rebellious Uranus in your spontaneous sign activates Mars in your 5th House of Play. Thankfully, there’s also a serious streak running through your brain, cautioning you to do the responsible thing. Find a way to bring some excitement into your day without jeopardizing the stability of your closest relationships. Balancing your impulsive desires with your previous commitments is tricky business, but this is your challenge for the day."
taurus,2017-09-02,"It’s all too easy to settle into a comfortable routine, but something is preventing you from taking the tried and true path today. There’s plenty to do around the home and, luckily, you have an opportunity to explore new ways of doing the same old things. Taking a fresh approach may be all you need to put a bounce back into your step and a smile on your face. Meister Eckhart wrote, “Be willing to be a beginner every single morning.”"
gemini,2017-09-02,"You are at home today as the noise level picks up and you want to listen to every sound. Although there doesn’t seem to be enough time, you still want to do everything. Ironically, you might be able to get away with cramming more activities into your day than anyone expects. However, it’s wiser to set practical limits on your calendar or you could tire yourself out in the process of scattering your energy. John Lubbock wrote “A day of worry is more exhausting than a week of work.”"
cancer,2017-09-02,"A sudden shift in plans might include more people than you bargained for today. Red-hot Mars is heating up unconventional Uranus in your 10th House of Status, spontaneously pulling you into the public eye, even if you were imagining a quiet day at home. Acknowledging your mixed feelings about swimming in the social flow doesn’t necessarily lead to isolation. Rather than shying away from the spotlight, a shift in your current attitude allows you to bask in the love of those who wish to be a part of your life."
leo,2017-09-02,"You are as invincible as the Sun today, shining your love and light wherever you go. But you also carry the element of surprise, challenging others to figure out your next move before you make it. Your increased sense of independence surrounds you with an air of unpredictability that may be exciting for your friends because they know that hanging out with you won’t be boring. Nevertheless, your erratic behavior could be too much for more sensitive souls. Tempering your rebellious tendencies just a touch now creates a smoother rhythm to your day."
virgo,2017-09-02,"Although you are acutely aware of your reputation for efficiency, an unruly part of your personality could surface today. You might try to bury your heightened individualism because you don’t want to upset the proverbial apple cart. However, denial only strengthens your current need for nonconformity. Paradoxically, expressing your contrary nature as you feel it creates less of a stir than trying to hide it. Bertrand Russell wrote, “Never try to discourage thinking, for you are sure to succeed.”"
libra,2017-09-02,"Your friends seem to be operating outside the rules today and you don’t know how much they’re willing to risk. Although you might be unsure of your own limitations, you’re willing to see where the current situation will lead. You like the idea of breaking out of old patterns even if it makes you anxious at the same time. Fortunately, the unpredictability reminds you of possibilities you set aside for fear of being judged too weird. There’s no harm in going along for the ride now; if it becomes uncomfortable you can always get off. Rumi wrote, “The garden of the world has no limits, except in your mind.”"
scorpio,2017-09-02,"You can take control of the situation by clearly informing others of exactly what you want. Your words are so convincing now that it’s unlikely anyone will hinder your progress. However, you’re more apt to succeed if your goals benefit your family or community, too. Bending reality for your own gain will likely stir resistance that’s stronger than you expect. Use your gift of artful persuasion for the good of all. Novelist Daniel Wallace wrote, “A storyteller makes up things to help other people; a liar makes up things to help himself.”"
sagittarius,2017-09-02,"You may think you’re acting judiciously when you’re actually taking an unnecessary risk today. You see your goal as easily attainable now, without realizing you are miscalculating the distance.

You might not give a second thought to your snappy comeback, especially if you are trying to be funny. Nevertheless, your humor has a dark side, even if you intend no ill will.

taurus,2017-09-03,"You don’t like to repeat yourself, especially if talking about your emotions was difficult the first time around. However, rational Mercury is back-stepping through your 4th House of Security, requiring you to revisit the past and clear the air of your unresolved feelings.

gemini,2017-09-03,"Your impatience can get the best of you today, especially if you’re ready to move on in spite of lingering personal issues. In fact, your key planet Mercury is so busy in your 3rd House of Distractions that the pace of events may be too quick, even for you.

cancer,2017-09-03,"Your thoughts are turning to mundane matters today, particularly those that you recently let slide without final resolution.

The powerful Mercury-Mars conjunction in your 9th House of Big Ideas encourages you to explore new avenues of education.

Lloyd Alexander wrote, “Fantasy is hardly an escape from reality. It’s a way of understanding it.”"
scorpio,2017-09-04,"Idealizing your spouse, lover or friend can lead to an identity crisis today because sooner or later, you’re going to feel let down. Nevertheless, you may be combatting your current tendency to turn a good thing into something great. The real magic comes from seeing the world as it is, rather than how you want it to be.

But the straightforward communication that’s associated with one-to-one interactions isn’t as useful when emotions are entangled in ways that aren’t apparent. Unfortunately, logic won’t help you separate all the threads of interrelated feelings now. You might need to leave your analytical tools in the toolbox and trust your instincts today. Children’s author Madeleine L'Engle wrote, “Don't try to comprehend with your mind. Your minds are very limited. Use your intuition.”"
pisces,2017-09-04,"It doesn’t seem to matter how carefully you explain yourself today because people tend to misunderstand you anyway. But communication is a two-way street and it’s wise to check how well you’re listening, too. Although change is in the air, it’s too soon to tell where your current relationships might lead.

It might seem as if people are derailing your plans on purpose but you may be the real cause. The imaginative Pisces Full Moon reflects your 7th House of Others as they share their hopes with you.

Unfortunately, self-imposed isolation doesn’t help you find a cure; it only casts a brighter spotlight on the problem. Be courageous; showing up is half the battle.

The impetuous Aries Moon’s presence in your 9th House of Adventure is enough to get you all fired up as you look to your future.

pisces,2017-09-07,"Your friends and associates seem so cautious now that you’re afraid to take a chance on your own, even if your ideas are amazing.

Change your attitude and change your entire trajectory. Never let anyone dull your sparkle."
scorpio,2017-09-08,"You can build up such a high level of resistance today that you’re able to fend off an attack from someone who doesn’t want you to succeed. But you’re too weary of the drama to respond to each slight you may receive. However, it’s less work to react as things occur, rather than waiting for a critical point-of-no-return. Stay present with your feelings without expecting every interaction to end in a happy conclusion. Nevertheless, don’t let the tension grow until it’s out of control. Thoreau wrote, “You must live in the present, launch yourself on every wave, find your eternity in each moment.”"
sagittarius,2017-09-08,"A conversation may start out light and easy, but soon your discovery process stumbles onto something you wish you didn’t know.

Star Trek’s Data said, “Believing oneself to be perfect is often the sign of a delusional mind.”"
aquarius,2017-09-08,"You may resist the emotional intensity that seems to follow you around like a storm cloud today.

Your thoughts are intense while you attempt to rectify your whimsical desires for pleasure with a whole set of deeper needs that motivate you to seek emotional stability. You may struggle as you dance between seeking immediate gratification and long-term satisfaction. Eleanor Roosevelt said, “The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.”"
cancer,2017-09-09,"Relationships are no simple matter now, even if everything appears to be copacetic. You can tell that the story of your life is unfolding on two distinct levels. Interactions with those you love are passionate today, teaching you important lessons about your heart. However, there’s an entirely different dialogue occurring within your mind that’s questioning your shared experiences. Fortunately, there’s no need to decide which one is more real than the other; they both possess their own relevance. John Lennon said, “Reality leaves a lot to the imagination.”"
leo,2017-09-09,"Someone’s unexpected actions might cause you to briefly spin into self-doubt as you try to determine where your logic went wrong. Nevertheless, you’re more than capable of rolling with the incoming waves of change today; it’s as if your resolve is stronger than ever. You can slip into an existential funk that would overwhelm others while you effectively sort out your uncertainties. Luckily, your emotional reserves are filled with inner strength. Plato wrote, “We can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark; the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light.”"
virgo,2017-09-09,"Although you might experience annoying fantasies that won’t leave you alone today, they are like bothersome gnats rather than venomous scorpions. Still, you wish they would fly away so you can enjoy the beauty of the day. Fortunately, you have little doubt about your capabilities now that transformational Pluto is collaborating with the radiant Sun in your sign. The power of your convictions is so strong it could change the course of a river. Don’t waste the intensity of your influence on trivial matters when it comes to your heart."
libra,2017-09-09,"You may be struggling with secrets that must to be kept quiet today, yet you still wonder if you should change the game by spilling the beans. No doubt, someone will be angry with you if you break a confidence. But that little voice in the back of your head won’t stop nagging at you. Fortunately, powerful Pluto harmoniously trines the Sun in your 12th House of Privacy, blessing you with the spiritual fortitude to hold your tongue and maintain your integrity. Author Stephenie Meyer wrote, “Sometimes, loyalty gets in the way of what you want to do. Sometimes, it’s not your secret to tell.”"
scorpio,2017-09-09,"As much as you enjoy participating in social activities with your friends today, you also like the idea of catalyzing stuck energy even if it creates a bit of chaos. Your intention is not to stir up trouble; it’s to break down the walls that are holding emotions stagnant as the Sun shines its brilliant light onto transformational Pluto in your 3rd House of Communication. Focus your words so they hit their targets like lasers. You can earn bonus points by delivering your message with kindness. Out with the old; in with the new."
sagittarius,2017-09-09,"It’s as if you just obtained a state-of-the-art GPS that knows your location and has allowed you to set “success” as your end point. All you need to do is follow the turn-by-turn directions that emanate from the device. Unfortunately, life is not that simple; thankfully, your internal guidance system is magically downloading the exact steps required to get you to your destination. You just have to figure out how to save it to your hard drive. President Dwight D. Eisenhower said, “Neither a wise man nor a brave man lies down on the tracks of history to wait for the train of the future to run over him.”"
capricorn,2017-09-09,"It appears that you have ingested a healthy dose of superhero potion today. There is no stopping you now that the willful Sun is trining unrelenting Pluto in your sign. But remember, a real super-hero cannot use his or her powers for personal gain -- only for the good of all. Set lofty goals that will influence others in a positive manner, and don’t let up until you have succeeded beyond your wildest dreams."
aquarius,2017-09-09,"No matter how many conversations you participate in today, the real action is occurring within the confines of your mind. Whatever is pulling you into the real world -- relationship dramas, domestic responsibilities or social commitments -- don't let it distract you from your personal growth. You are in the process of having your software upgraded, but you must develop your own cerebral connection to the “Innernet” before it can be completed. Be patient and stay focused on the path that is for your steps alone."
pisces,2017-09-09,"Your special gift today is the magic you bring to individual relationships. Paradoxically, it doesn’t even matter who you encounter now; you can easily set your personal agenda aside and establish a heart-to-heart connection that changes people’s lives. Don’t waste your time trying to analyze how you transform empathy into intimacy. Instead of intellectualizing your journey, just jump in and feel it.

aries,2017-09-10,"Although you might be quite satisfied doing very little today, you are able to find an easy pace that allows you to complete chores around the home without much effort at all. In fact, your laid-back approach can be misleading to others because they may think you are being lazy.

The back-to-basics Taurus Moon empowers you to get in touch with the dirt while harvesting food or flowers. But once you stop working, you’re probably done for the day. Of course, you can always skip the chores completely and go directly to the beach, the couch or back to bed. Indulging in simple pleasures is good for your soul."
gemini,2017-09-10,"One of your best-kept secrets is how you can look extremely busy while doing absolutely nothing at all. Thankfully, today might actually be a designated day of rest. There’s no need to mislead anyone with made-up stories about what you’re doing later. In fact, there’s no reason to use misdirection at all; you’re a participant in life, not a stage magician.

Thomas Edison said, “The three great essentials to achieve anything worthwhile are, first, hard work; second, stick-to-itiveness; third, common sense.”"
leo,2017-09-10,"You are a rock that symbolizes strength to those around you, including your relatives and people in your community. Everyone relishes your stories, they are family-tested and children-approved. But it’s more than being an admired entertainer; you are deeply trusted for your honesty and respected for your integrity. There is no reason to change anything that’s already working. All you need to do is show up with an open mind and a receptive heart. Poet Robert Browning wrote, “Best be yourself, imperial, plain, and true.”"
virgo,2017-09-10,"You are currently performing at the top of your game. Whatever you touch seems to flourish.

Don’t give up; each failure is just a practice round for the real event.

scorpio,2017-09-10,"Your social world is buzzing today, yet you’re undecided if you wish to participate in the fun and frivolities. You might feel stretched so thin that you want to take some time to rest. Ironically, it’s not that you need to avoid others, it’s just that more complications sound exhausting.

Dr. Hans Selye wrote, “Adopting the right attitude can convert a negative stress into a positive one.”"
sagittarius,2017-09-10,"Although you might be luxuriating on your day off now, you’re still dreaming about getting ahead professionally.

Author Amy Leigh Mercree wrote, “Commitment mixed with drive and sprinkled with imagination creates sustained results. Stay focused and you will make your mark!”"
capricorn,2017-09-10,"You may be on a power trip today as you float through the day. Handling the intense energy will require you to channel your intentions through a very narrow gate. You can’t wander around beyond the pale and expect no repercussions. Stick close to home and tend to any disturbances in your immediate environment rather than traveling to a distant land in search of adventure. Novelist Brandon Sanderson wrote, “The mark of a great man is one who knows when to set aside the important things in order to accomplish the vital ones.”"

Those who don't believe in magic will never find it.”"

You might do your best to avoid involvement on a project at work because you don’t want to take sides in a developing disagreement over logistics. Nevertheless, you can’t help but deepen your participation, even if you remain ambivalent about the outcome. When asked, share your opinion as objectively as you can. Quantum physicist Niels Bohr said, “Never express yourself more clearly than you are able to think.”"
taurus,2017-09-11,"It’s tempting to resist change when everything in your life is working. At first, the lack of stress discourages you from taking any risks. Nevertheless, your feelings begin to shift as relationships put unexpected pressure on you. Doing the right thing isn’t always the easiest response in the moment, but it’s the healthiest in the long run. Author Caroline Myss wrote, “Always go with the choice that scares you the most, because that’s the one that is going to help you grow.”"
gemini,2017-09-11,"Although your calendar is already set in stone today, you’re still eager to gamble with your destiny. It’s as if you know when the space-time fabric is susceptible to weird fluctuations now, and you jump in with your agenda at exactly the right moment. However, you could overstate your case or underestimate someone else’s resolve. Don’t tie yourself to any one strategy yet. Magic is more likely to occur when you can build on a wave already in motion rather than creating one from scratch."
cancer,2017-09-11,"You may reach your emotional limit today, especially if you are spending a lot of time with your friends. You are quite sensitive to contradictory information yet you’re committed to sorting out useful facts from trivial data.

Honor your internal clock and only move forward at a speed that feels right to you."
leo,2017-09-11,"Frustration builds if you try to force your solution to a work-related problem onto others.

Taking the higher road now involves practicing patience and compassion. Meanwhile, remember the words of the Dalai Lama: “Do not let the behavior of others destroy your inner peace.”"
virgo,2017-09-11,"Handle important business as early in the day as possible while the energetic flow is still working in your favor. You can still be productive later on, but dealing with even the most minor matters might feel like you’re swimming upstream. Thankfully, the resistance you encounter won’t likely be enough to stop you in your tracks now, but it certainly could slow you down. Author Norman Vincent Peale wrote, “Stand up to your obstacles and do something about them. You will find that they haven't half the strength you think they have.”"
libra,2017-09-11,"You may be relishing your current anonymity because you don’t want to explain your recent decisions to others. Although you might be convinced to share your plans at the right time, you’re hesitant to defend your position on a contentious matter today. Nevertheless, you still could be drawn into a conversation that leads to more personal disclosure than you intended, which, in turn, can heat up an argument. Walk away before things turn ugly. Wayne Dyer wrote, “Conflict cannot survive without your participation.”"
scorpio,2017-09-11,"Your reputation often precedes you as someone who is willing to delve into a discussion about sensitive subjects. However, you hold the power to choose whether or not to proceed into dangerous territory. If you decide that a topic is off-limits, no one is clever enough to bait you into a conversation today. On the other hand, if you think something needs to be brought out into the open, you won’t be easily stopped. Just examine your motives before flashing a red light or green light. An old adage claims, “A tongue has no bones but it is strong enough to break a heart; so be careful with your words.”"
sagittarius,2017-09-11,"You don’t mind a bit of verbal fireworks today as long as there is a purpose to the exchange. A meaningful dialogue may be postponed for a variety of reasons and it feels good to get your thoughts out in the open when it finally happens. Keep in mind that any discussion now is likely the first in a series of interactions over the next several days. It’s not productive to assume you will reach a viable resolution right away. Benjamin Franklin wrote, “Take time for all things; great haste makes great waste.”"
capricorn,2017-09-11,"Building stability in relationships requires your sincere commitment. However, you expect the same loyalty from everyone else. You might grow annoyed when you realize you’re going through the motions by yourself today. Unfortunately, you can’t accuse someone of playing by different rules because that only pushes them further away. Instead, claim your authority and interact honestly without pointing blame. Giving others a little distance at the right time allows them to see things from your perspective. Respect cultivates trust."
aquarius,2017-09-11,"You’re concerned that your feelings are getting in the way of your interactions with others today. It might even seem like you’re stuck in an emotional tidepool with no way out to sea. Fortunately, the tides are always in flux and your fears will begin to dissipate once the fresh energy flows into your life. A short conversation with the right person could be enough to start the ball rolling. Although it won’t take much to initiate movement, your behavior is instrumental.

pisces,2017-09-11,"Your uncharacteristic stubbornness may help you convince others that you’re not to be trifled with today. However, your tenacity only takes you so far. It’s the right strategy to bring people into your world, but you could be so headstrong now that you lose your audience as quickly as you gained it. Fortunately, you Fish are no strangers to swimming with the flow. Lao Tzu wrote, “What is malleable is always superior to that which is immovable. This is the principle of controlling things by going along with them, of mastery through adaptation.”"
aries,2017-09-12,"You aren’t thrilled if your current responsibilities prevent you from taking the course of least resistance. Nevertheless, you begrudgingly accept the limitations on your life today. You don’t like to admit it, but you’re not as free and easy as you appear from a distance.

Eckhart Tolle wrote, “Acknowledging the good that you already have in your life is the foundation for all abundance.”"
taurus,2017-09-12,"You revel in the certainty that today’s good intentions will reap tomorrow’s just rewards.

Author Josh Shipp wrote, “Perseverance is stubbornness with a purpose.”"
gemini,2017-09-12,"Difficulty in sitting still and focusing on any one thing for more than a few minutes can bring a familiar kind of trouble today.

Right is right even if no one is doing it.”"
scorpio,2017-09-12,"Receiving accolades at work for all that you bring to the game feeds your ego. However, you want practical results rather than words of appreciation and a pat on the back. If your recent contributions have been exemplary, you might be happily surprised when you are offered a raise or a promotion.

You expect someone to step up and stand next to you as he or she speaks from the heart, especially if they are heaping praise on your long-term efforts. You want to be the one who can slip into a leadership role knowing that you have the support of your closest allies. Nigerian actress Sola Kosoko said, “Cleverness in itself is useless.

Unfortunately, sobering Saturn is crossing paths with the Virgo Sun, restricting the flow of love and light. There is a lesson for you to learn now, but the temporary isolation is not indicative of a permanent condition. Examine your own feelings to see if you’re the one who is retreating emotionally.

After a few false starts, you begin to worry that you will miss your chance to make anything positive happen at all. However, delays can be used in your favor while you sharpen your analytical tools.

However, you transform into a miracle worker once you know your needs are met and your heart is safe from harm. Author Manprit Kaur wrote, “Don’t whittle your potential, just because others don’t believe in you. The only worthy question is do you believe in you?”"
leo,2017-09-14,"Whether or not you realize it, you can be in touch with your soul’s purpose today. But you can’t use logic to make this connection; you must listen to your heart and trust your feelings, instead. The key is acknowledging your desires while pleasure-seeking Venus forms a creative alignment with potent Pluto. Don’t worry about justifying your ideal future; explore the possibilities in your dreams without trying to manifest any of them yet. Author Ray Bradbury wrote, “We survive by fantasizing. Take that away from us and the whole damned human race goes down the drain.”"
virgo,2017-09-14,"You could be feeling more vulnerable today than anyone realizes. You can easily hide behind your words because they sound more combative than you intend. Meanwhile, your real emotions are buried out of sight in hopes that no one will see them. Nevertheless, you don’t need to accept the status quo if you choose to break through your fear of sharing your heart. Japanese Buddhist priest Dogen Zenji said, “Enlightenment is intimacy with all things.”"
libra,2017-09-14,"Taking others under your wing at work today is a challenging process, especially if you’re feeling a bit insecure yourself. You want only the best people involved in your project, but you don’t necessarily enjoy it if they outshine you. Nevertheless, you can’t help but nurture those who need it the most now. Meanwhile, staying connected with your friends during the process is a good idea because it allows you to move through the rough spots without missing a beat. Competition makes us faster; collaboration makes us better."
scorpio,2017-09-14,"You may be at your most secretive today; you don’t want anyone to push their way into your world. Naturally, you’re not interested in setting yourself up for emotional suffering. Nevertheless, you might believe that holding your feelings close to your heart empowers you to engage socially without worrying about possible negative ramifications. Be firm about your boundaries so you don’t accidentally entangle anyone in your web of personal drama. Serbian poet Dejan Stojanovic wrote, “The most complicated skill is to be simple.”"
sagittarius,2017-09-14,"Sometimes you overcompensate for your tendency to generalize by placing undue importance on the most minute details. Although you are to be commended for your willingness to buck your big-picture trend, don’t get so lost that you can’t see the forest for the trees. Find a workable balance between your regular need to paint in broad strokes and your immediate interest in the finer points. Author Norbet Platt wrote, “The act of putting pen to paper encourages pause for thought; this in turn makes us think more deeply about life, which helps us regain our equilibrium.”"
capricorn,2017-09-14,"You’re not eager to go bounding off into the future until you finish wrapping up a few loose ends from the past. But deciding when to cut loose from prior attachments can be confusing now, especially if someone else is also involved. It might even be another person’s unwillingness to let go that causes friction while the nostalgic Cancer Moon is visiting your 7th House of Companions. But don’t just blame others for your current predicament. Continue to contemplate all the variables until the most important ones rise to the top. Futurist Erwin McManus wrote, “There are few things more powerful than a life lived with passionate clarity.”"
aquarius,2017-09-14,"You’re not one to seek the limelight today. In fact, you may do your best to avoid it while the shy Cancer Moon is hiding out in your 6th House of Work. You promised you would complete certain tasks and you don’t want anything to distract you from fulfilling your commitments. Nevertheless, you still can find time to lend assistance to someone in need if it’s a priority. Michelle Obama said, “Our greatness has always come from people who expect nothing and take nothing for granted -- folks who work hard for what they have, then reach back and help others after them.”"
pisces,2017-09-14,"You’re wary of sharing your emotions today, but enthusiastic to discuss more mundane things, such as your plans for the weekend. However, you might grow frustrated if someone wants more details about your schedule than you can give. The more they press for additional information, the less inclined you are to reveal anything at all. You could express your annoyance as outright hostility, even if it sounds angrier than you feel now. Avoid perpetuating negativity by transforming your exasperation into love. Ernest Hemingway wrote, “Courage is grace under pressure.”"
aries,2017-09-15,"Obviously, it’s always wise to fulfill your daily obligations, but your mind is likely preoccupied with other things today. You know what you should do, but your desire to socialize is stronger now than your resolve to work. There is always an impulsive element to your behavior but you can also benefit from considerable advanced planning. It’s easy to make everything look good when there are no immediate obstacles impeding your progress. The trick is maintaining your positive attitude even if you must change your plans to accommodate others. Flexibility is your friend."
taurus,2017-09-15,"You might be playing with the idea of taking a day trip with a few of your closest friends. Although you can benefit from doing something outside your regular work hours, you also look forward to squeezing some fun activities into your work schedule today. Give yourself permission to feel good; enjoying the present moment is a decision you get to make every single moment. Marcus Aurelius said, “Very little is needed to make a happy life; it is all within yourself, in your way of thinking.”"
gemini,2017-09-15,"You tend to thrive when so many different issues demand your attention. There’s little opportunity for boredom to settle in now, especially if you continue to say yes to everyone who brings you a problem or an unfinished project. Thankfully, you won’t likely feel overloaded if you are doing what you love; you can easily keep up with your responsibilities when your mission is clear. President Franklin D. Roosevelt said, “The only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today."""
cancer,2017-09-15,"Almost everyone may leave you alone today, and you really don’t mind the distance at all. However, you begin to long for uplifting interpersonal connections as the day wears on. Thankfully, you don’t need to try very hard in your search for companionship now. Once you make your availability known, potential partners-in-crime appear everywhere you look. Nevertheless, it’s still up to you to decide which one is the most compatible with your goals. Remember, it’s the friends you meet along the way that help you appreciate the journey."
leo,2017-09-15,"Contrary to popular belief, you Leos don’t roar all the time. In fact, you might be so quiet today that others don’t even notice your presence.

Although you’re not quick to reveal your innermost secrets, telling the truth as you see it can be liberating to all involved. Poet John Lyly wrote, “The true measure of life is not length, but honesty.”"
virgo,2017-09-15,"Fiscal issues may be on the front burner today as you sort out the costs of an unexpected purchase. However, the root of the problem stems from your current desire to possess nice things, tempting you to put a dent in your budget. Rather than spending money haphazardly now, itemize all the potential gains in one column and all the reasons against in the other. You might end up choosing to satisfy your craving regardless of your finances, but at least you will do it with a clear conscience. Tightening your belt is worth it if your heart is happy."
libra,2017-09-15,"Your little indulgences can lead to a big headache today. It might not be any one single thing, but your key planet Venus is flirting with giant Jupiter, enticing you to go back for seconds on dessert, buy something extravagant, or accept another social invitation even if you don’t have the time. Thankfully, it doesn’t take much energy to rein in your desires just a little. Make your motto quality over quantity and your day will be sweet. Paulo Coelho wrote, “If you conquer yourself, then you conquer the world.”"
scorpio,2017-09-15,"You may not finish all your work today, but you still perform well enough to impress your boss. You’re not sure exactly how you manage to get by, but everything seems to fall into place at the last minute. You may have unseen helpers watching over you now as jovial Jupiter sends positive energy to enriching Venus in your 10th House of Career. Leave the short-term distractions behind and confidently set a course into your future. Dr. Ivan Joseph wrote, “I am the captain of my ship and the master of my fate.”"
sagittarius,2017-09-15,"You’re so confident about your future that nothing can stop you today. In fact, there’s no reason to establish arbitrary limits now because they would only inhibit your self-expression. It’s as if you can instinctively see how far to stretch the envelope so no damage is done to the container. However, it’s prudent to be prepared for a sudden break in the flow when the moody Moon squares unpredictable Uranus. In the meantime, aim high while flying low."
capricorn,2017-09-15,"You’re tired of babysitting everyone around you today. It seems as if others should be perfectly capable of taking care of themselves. Like it or not, too many people rely on you for support when making important life decisions.

Prioritizing your needs is the first step to putting your life back in order. Henrik Edberg wrote, “Some things may be equally essential but nothing is more important than a healthy sense of self-esteem and loving yourself.”"
aquarius,2017-09-15,"Your ideas could turn into obsessions today, and it feels like there’s little you can do to prevent this transformation. Unfortunately, healthy partnerships can be overwhelming while expansive Jupiter aligns with showy Venus in your 7th House of Companions. Emotions may explode and feelings might get hurt; thankfully, relationship issues will settle down soon if you are willing to make amends. In the meantime, don’t let your search for happiness stand in the way of living a happy life."
pisces,2017-09-15,"You might find yourself in such a wonderful energetic flow today that time passes all too quickly. Naturally, you want this feeling to last longer, but you plan on making the most of this efficient groove while you can. The good news is that you will likely produce something tangible by day’s end that stands as a testament to your hard work. Anthony Robbins says, “There is a powerful driving force inside every human being that, once unleashed, can make any vision, dream, or desire a reality.”"
aries,2017-09-16,"Your forceful words can land you in a pile of trouble today unless you bite your tongue as often as you wish to speak. Chatty Mercury aligns with combative Mars, tempting you to lash out before you know all the facts. Complicating matters, your wrath could be misdirected as you aim your message at someone other than the offending party. However, exercising healthy self-restraint empowers your delivery and increases your ability to influence others with sound reasoning. Author Karen Salmansohn wrote, “Anger is a boomerang.”"
taurus,2017-09-16,"You are blessed with a nod from the cosmos today, allowing you to speak from your heart with keen clarity. Writing in a journal or just conversing with a friend helps you to sort out your divergent feelings. Don’t sugarcoat your truth; deliver good news and bad news with the same authority. Nevertheless, leave yourself room to grow as you learn new information. Frank Zappa said, “A mind is like a parachute. It doesn't work if it is not open.”"
gemini,2017-09-16,"Connecting current events with those of the past can be useful as you dig into family matters today. It may seem like you’re on a mission now, relentless in your efforts until you recover the memories relevant to the unfolding dynamics.

Winston Churchill said, “The farther backward you look, the further forward you can see.”"
cancer,2017-09-16,"Your precise use of language can make all the difference in your world today. Personal subjects are up for discussion now, and one of them may rub an old wound the wrong way. However, carefully describing your experience enables others to see things from your perspective without judgment. It’s pointless to approach a conversation as if it is a debate. There are no winners or losers unless you start off blaming someone else for your predicament. Proceed with caution and kindness. You will catch more flies with honey than you will with vinegar."
leo,2017-09-16,"You may become embroiled in an argument about a personal possession today. It’s tempting to be overly territorial while mischievous Mercury and contentious Mars join forces in your 2nd House of Money. You might even squabble with a friend over a trivial issue like whose turn it is to pick up the check for lunch. But a little disagreement is likely a symptom of a deeper issue that touches on your self-esteem. Thankfully, adopting a more pragmatic approach reestablishes harmony. Make sure others know where you stand on the issue, but practice flexibility in seeking a solution."
virgo,2017-09-16,"You are so on point today that all you need to do is start talking and you can easily win any argument. In truth, it might not be that easy, but others can’t match your grasp of the facts and your charming eloquence now. Your key planet Mercury the Messenger hooks up with Mars the Warrior in your analytical sign, tilting the odds of any debate in your favor.

An anxious Mercury-Mars conjunction heats up your 12th House of Invisibility, urging you to keep your thoughts -- and possibly your anger -- to yourself. You may be worried that something you say will be taken the wrong way. Although you might benefit from spending time alone to reconnect with your feelings, it’s unproductive to avoid confrontation now. Unresolved dynamics are more likely to work out favorably when everything is out in the open."
scorpio,2017-09-16,"You’re done with talking about the news of the present moment, and eager to jump into an honest dialogue about the future. You’re motivated to make lasting plans now, and you’re hoping to brainstorm with a trusted friend about your long-term goals. Don’t let a conversation drift into diaphanous discussions of spiritual platitudes or personal rationalizations. Keep it real by bringing the topic back to the most practical considerations. Clarifying your priorities sets you up for success."
sagittarius,2017-09-16,"Although you may be in the midst of your normal weekend routine, your mind is busy with larger issues now. If you’re not dreaming about getting ahead professionally or creating your personal statement in the real world, you’re making your presence known in your community.

President Barack Obama said, “It’s only when you hitch your wagon to something larger than yourself that you realize your true potential.”"
capricorn,2017-09-16,"It’s time to put your plans into motion. But rather than making any brash moves today, your next step is to share your ideas with those who will encourage you to be a catalyst for innovative change. You might need to refine your thinking now, especially if you take a brilliant concept and make it so grandiose that it’s beyond your scope. Paring back your goals enables you to maintain a practical focus and realize your dreams. Author LouAnne Johnson wrote, “Knowledge counts but common sense matters.”"
aquarius,2017-09-16,"You possess the rare ability to analyze a problem without being overwhelmed by the emotional dynamics, especially when there is someone else involved. Oftentimes, you sidestep a situation where you could get pulled into the complication of entangled feelings. However, you’re armed with an intentional Mercury-Mars conjunction in your 8th House of Regeneration now, inspiring you to jump into the fire without knowing what might happen. Don’t let your fears deter you from speaking the truth. Sticking with the process all but ensures your transformation into a more evolved state of being."
pisces,2017-09-16,"Personal relationships can be deceivingly complicated, especially when two people are standing on opposing ends of a disagreement. Unfortunately, you sometimes describe your feelings in such a manner that leaves others even more confused than before you spoke. However, you have a cosmic opportunity to clear the air now, improving the overall quality of communication in nearly any partnership. Don’t mince your words; express your heart and let the chips fall where they may. Honesty saves time."
aries,2017-09-17,"There are plenty of reasons to maintain a low profile today, but the temptation to do something crazy becomes harder to ignore throughout the day. You are painfully aware of your obligations and sincerely intend to fulfill your commitments. Nevertheless, you can’t quite let go of a risky plan that could fire up your adrenaline and, hopefully, put you on a path to pleasure. The choice is yours, but so are the consequences. There are times when even an impulsive Aries must sacrifice the fun and do what is right."
taurus,2017-09-17,"You are known for your easygoing but somewhat linear attitude to romantic relationships; you like the future to be a logical extension of the past and the present. However, you might be more inclined toward experimentation now that your key planet Venus is dancing with radical Uranus. You want to be surprised today, even if the uncertainty is discomforting. Gloria Steinem wrote, “Without leaps of imagination, or dreaming, we lose the excitement of possibilities. Dreaming, after all, is a form of planning.”"
gemini,2017-09-17,"You are hoping to be distracted by your friends today. Better yet, attending a social situation where you can circulate and meet new people might be your cup of tea. Unconventional Uranus excites pleasure-seeking Venus in your 3rd House of Communication, motivating you to interact with interesting people about a whole range of subjects. Your only agenda now is to satisfy your unquenchable curiosity. Benjamin Franklin wrote, “Tell me and I forget, teach me and I may remember, involve me and I learn.”"
cancer,2017-09-17,"Your friends wonder what got into you because you might be acting out of character today. Your normally reserved personality has been replaced by an exuberant and extroverted one. Instead of waiting for another person to start a conversation, you jump right in with pointed questions and respond with clever witticisms. Oddly enough, you don’t even think twice about your outgoing behavior. You only know that interacting with others is more fun now and you don’t want to rock the boat. Mark Twain said, “To get the full value of joy you must have someone to divide it with.”"
leo,2017-09-17,"You might get off to such a slow start today that you doubt your ability to turn the day around. But surprising Uranus zaps sweet Venus in sassy Leo, encouraging you to catch the wave of enjoyment, even if you must paddle extra hard at first. Thankfully, your perseverance is rewarded and you notice one thing after another falling into place. The dark clouds disperse and you’re eager to let the good times roll. Remember, it is your positivity that fuels your progress. Change your thoughts and change your world."
virgo,2017-09-17,"You’re worried that circumstances will quickly escalate out of control today. However, there is a rebellious voice whispering in your head now, telling you how much fun it will be if you’re released from your constraints. In fact, a part of you is ready to blow off a previous commitment to do something for the sheer pleasure of it. Chances are you won’t have to let anyone down now in order to follow your heart’s desire. This is one of those special times when you deserve to have your cake and eat it, too."
libra,2017-09-17,"A friend or acquaintance may approach you with an out-of-the-box invitation today. But instead of carefully weighing the pros and cons before you respond, you automatically say yes. You’re uncharacteristically emphatic about making the most of an opportunity, even if it stretches you beyond your limits. Electric Uranus shocks and awes your key planet Venus in your 11th House of Dreams, infusing you with a sense of urgency when it comes to experiencing pleasure. Your rearview mirror is worthless now; keep your eyes on the road ahead."
scorpio,2017-09-17,"You are trying harder than ever to break old habits and create new routines. You’re highly motivated to improve the quality of your life while enriching Venus harmonizes with progressive Uranus in your 6th House of Logistics. But you’re not interested in making a minor modification just so you can track its influence on your daily life. Consider this a cosmic wake-up call, demanding that you respond immediately or forever hold your peace. You have no choice but to concentrate your efforts on the power of now."
sagittarius,2017-09-17,"You love the idea of expanding your knowledge base and are willing to take a risk in the pursuit of learning. Whether you make a long-term plan to study an intriguing subject or you engage in a dialogue about a topic that is outside your normal interests, you want to dance with the edge and push your boundaries now. You don’t care if your new exploration threatens the foundations of your thinking. You’re driven to transcend your limits in your current search for the truth. Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. wrote, “A mind that is stretched by a new experience can never go back to its old dimensions.”"
capricorn,2017-09-17,"You’re in the mood for a different kind of love today. It makes more sense to shine your light into the darkness than to stagnate in the emotional security of a safe discussion. Even if you’re involved in a committed relationship, you want to intensify the connection by delving into the unspoken mysteries. There is magic to be discovered in the shadows and the lightning-like strike of Uranus is what you need to gain a deeper awareness of your heart. Rumi wrote, “Your task is not to seek for love but merely to seek and find all the barriers within yourself that you have built against it.”"
aquarius,2017-09-17,"You’re willing to entertain the craziest of ideas today. In fact, your key planet Uranus is electrifying your 3rd House of Information -- the more radical the ideas, the better. Of course, you shouldn’t believe every conspiracy theory you uncover now. Bring your latest discovery down to earth by verifying sources and researching the fine print. Make your choices based on facts not assumptions. B.B. King said, “The beautiful thing about learning is that no one can take it away from you.”"
pisces,2017-09-17,"Some people would try anything to get out of doing chores, but there’s something reassuring about the regularity and familiarity of your routine. Paradoxically, you’re more motivated by the response of those close to you than you are in the tasks at hand. You delight in putting on a show while vivacious Venus is visiting dramatic Leo. However, your mind is restless with erratic Uranus also in the picture today. You want tangible results but you’re ready to try an unconventional approach to your work. Be stubborn about your goals now, but flexible about your methods."
aries,2017-09-18,"You’re excited about all the possibilities that await you this week. As bored as you can get with familiarity, you’re still eager to jump back into the routine of work.

taurus,2017-09-18,"There is very little room for deviation today as you focus on revealing your heart’s secrets.

Alder wrote, “The need for control always comes from someone that has lost it.”"
gemini,2017-09-18,"You don’t like feeling limited in your options, but the more you assess your current situation, the fewer choices there are than you originally thought. You might become so frustrated that you abandon any pretense of rationality today. You often wing it and get by fine, making significant decisions on the fly. Nevertheless, you have a chance to step up to a new level of productivity by maintaining an analytical, rather than an instinctive approach. Gold medalist Jackie Joyner-Kersee said, “It’s better to look ahead and prepare than to look back and regret.”"
cancer,2017-09-18,"You are like a talk radio host today, sounding as if you’re wildly interested in whatever others are saying. However, you’re operating with an agenda of your own now, and each person you interview becomes a pawn in your scheme to promote your point of view. Getting carried away with your self-importance won’t further your cause, so check yourself before it’s too late. Relax your desire to control all the information by considering your role in the larger picture. Tony Robbins said, “Trade your expectation for appreciation and the world changes instantly.”"
leo,2017-09-18,"Your obsession with the material world can be useful when it comes to managing your resources, but it might also distract you from the most important issues.

Your strong opinions may fuel numerous disagreements between you and your peers unless you are able to compromise in your dealings with others. Actor Jason Kravits said, “Be infinitely flexible and constantly amazed.”"
virgo,2017-09-18,"Your thoughts could collapse under their own weight today unless you stop taking your goals so seriously. Fortunately, you’re able to use your insight productively to redirect your internal process toward a positive result. Channel your energy into self-reflection and self-expression now, for you are the source of all that happens in your world. Deepak Chopra wrote, “Our biological rhythms are the symphony of the cosmos, music embedded deep within us to which we dance, even when we can't name the tune.”"
libra,2017-09-18,"Your emotions are hidden behind a veil of good cheer today, and others might not have a clue about your true feelings. However, you may be keeping your thoughts secret for a good reason, especially if you believe you’re not being treated fairly by someone who sees you as a threat. Instead of expressing your anger directly now, channel it into your work where it can do the most good. Author T.F. Hodge wrote, “What you do teaches faster, and has a lasting impression, far beyond what you say.”"
scorpio,2017-09-18,"You are a tough one to fool because you can see right through another person’s mask. Your psychological x-ray vision immediately tells you if someone is telling the truth or if you’re being played. You’re short on patience now, so you are unlikely to cut someone a little slack while they figure out their story. Nevertheless, avoid jumping to conclusions today, even if you think your intuition is on the mark. Philosopher Michael Huemer wrote, “If you're rational you don't get to believe whatever you want to believe.”"
sagittarius,2017-09-18,"Your master plan for professional success has taken nearly everything into account.

capricorn,2017-09-18,"You excel when working within a well-defined structure because it empowers you to calculate all your options and make the best choices. However, without those established boundaries in place, you may vacillate between wrapping your brain around all the facts while trying to grasp the big picture.

aquarius,2017-09-18,"A working partnership can be very complicated now, and it’s a challenging task to untangle all the interrelated threads. However, it’s imperative that all financial dealings are clearly agreed upon before moving forward. Additionally, it’s wise to be specific about the division of duties because an unresolved issue will likely come back to create real havoc down the road.

Lao Tzu wrote, “One who is too insistent on his own views finds few to agree with him.”"
pisces,2017-09-18,"It’s no fun to discover that you are oversimplifying the solution to a relationship dilemma. Instead of listening to what is being said, you tend to only hear what you want someone to say now.

Thankfully, you don’t need to come to an absolute agreement on every issue, but it’s still better to know where the lines are drawn.

Your message may be concise and to the point, yet there is a subtle undercurrent that conveys an entirely different subtext. Something as simple as the tone of your voice can make the difference in what others actually hear. Be aware of how you express your intentions so there is no room for any misunderstandings. Listening with your psychic radar will help you navigate the waves."
taurus,2017-09-19,"You might think that you are being completely transparent now, so you don’t understand why your friends are confused by what you say. Unfortunately, there is an apparent disparity between what leaves your mouth and what enters someone’s ears today. Do your best to get your point across and then let it go. Your packed schedule doesn’t leave you much time to backtrack to explain your message. Wyatt Earp said, “Fast is fine, but accuracy is everything.”"
gemini,2017-09-19,"Your thoughts are like sharp knives today, cutting through the mundane distractions. You are feeling more service-oriented as your key planet Mercury focuses your efforts on making emotional connections now, even in the workplace. Nevertheless, it’s a mistake to assume that your associates are comfortable with this uncharacteristic level of personal disclosure. There’s no reason to shift gears and bring up your feelings unless others are doing the same. Mutual consent keeps everyone on stable ground."

Your focus determines your future."
leo,2017-09-19,"It’s completely your choice whether to handle unfinished financial business today, or skip out on your responsibilities. Oddly enough, your business partner is luring you into a spiritual quest but you can’t just leave your mess behind now, expecting that someone else will clean it up.

virgo,2017-09-19,"A relationship dance may be strangely confusing today, even if you think you know the steps at first glance.

libra,2017-09-19,"You may be overwhelmed with emotion today, but you can’t easily tell whether these feelings are yours or someone else’s. If they belong to you, it’s your responsibility to honor them and share them in a manner that resonates with your heart.

Bennett said, “Listen with curiosity. Speak with honesty. Act with integrity.”"

Don’t get sidetracked by everything you see; more than ever, the truth comes from within."
libra,2017-09-24,"You might feel as if you’re on a wild goose chase today, or perhaps you’re busy chasing ghosts. A spacey Mars-Neptune opposition activates your 12th House of Spiritual Mystery, turning hard cold reality into a fleeting concept. Of course, narrowing your concentration helps, but not if it leads to obsession over details that block your view of the big picture.

In a world where you can be anything, be kind."
scorpio,2017-09-24,"You are normally up for any challenge as long as you have all the facts at your disposal. Unfortunately, good information is difficult to find today, because other people’s behavior doesn’t seem to match up with what you know.

Alder wrote, “Compassion is not something you have; it is something you share.”"

Nevertheless, Dr. Jeffrey Frey wrote, “Having more data does not always give you the power to make better decisions.”"
scorpio,2017-09-25,"Your sense of self can go from one extreme to another today. One moment, you know how irreplaceable you are and what skills you bring to the table. But just a short time later, you may be caught up in a whirlpool of self-doubt that has you questioning your competence. Although you can’t do everything all at once, your ability to stick to a job until it’s done makes you a valuable player on any team.

sagittarius,2017-09-25,"You may carry the weight of the world on your shoulders today, but you also have an escape plan in your mind. Although the Moon’s return to your sign puts you in touch with unrealized dreams, restrictive Saturn draws your thoughts back to work. Unfortunately, your current commitments could prevent you from gallivanting off in search of adventures. Pastor Sunday Adelaja said, “There is always a great price to pay for irresponsibility.”"
capricorn,2017-09-25,"You appear competent today as if you’re in complete control of your environment. However, your heart may not be in your work now, and upon closer examination others might see you wistfully gazing off into the distance. Nevertheless, rational Mercury’s dynamic square to your key planet Saturn requires you to limit your sphere of activity until you accomplish your assigned tasks. Author Simon Sinek wrote, “Responsibility is not doing as we are told, that's obedience. Responsibility is doing what is right.”"
aquarius,2017-09-25,"Surrounding yourself with like-minded people reveals unexplored paths into the next chapter of your life.

Thankfully, karma is on your side now and your valuable contributions won’t go unnoticed. Rabindranath Tagore said, “You can’t cross the sea merely by standing and staring at the water.”"
pisces,2017-09-25,"You dream of being at the top of your professional game now, but you don’t necessarily want to climb all of the necessary steps to get there. You’re perfectly capable of achieving wonderful accomplishments on your own, but it’s nice to know that others are standing by ready to assist. Unfortunately, it’s not in your best interest to adopt a cavalier approach to your career trajectory just because the know-it-all Sagittarius Moon has set up shop in your 10th House of Status. Zig Ziglar said, “There is no elevator to success; you must take the stairs.”"
aries,2017-09-26,"You have a ticket to ride today, but you must still choose your destination. Your exuberance may be apparent to others, but they’re not aware of your internal struggle as you decide what to do with your newly found freedom.

Assess your current location before running off in the wrong direction. Don’t make a permanent decision on a temporary emotion."
cancer,2017-09-26,"You might become overwhelmed when you see too many distinct possibilities in your future. You wish life was simpler now, but you are resigned to work your way through this nexus of opportunities.

Starve your distractions; feed your focus."
leo,2017-09-26,"You’re not motivated to meet your responsibilities today because nearly anything sounds like more fun than doing your work. Although you might get away with an unauthorized diversion or two, you won’t find it as rewarding as you expected.

virgo,2017-09-26,"People appear to give you mixed signals today. However, you’re unlikely to lose your center of gravity while the Sagittarius Moon collaborates with stabilizing Saturn in your 4th House of Foundations.

libra,2017-09-26,"Mysterious cosmic currents create complex emotional dynamics today, challenging you to find your way back to smoother waters. Although you gain support from your family, they also make your life more difficult now because each person has a different opinion about your path.

capricorn,2017-09-26,"Spiritual breakthroughs can be surprising, awe-inspiring and tricky to manage. Nevertheless, expanding your world view may be more hard work than you signed up for now.

aquarius,2017-09-26,"Your plans are leading you one way but your life seems to be taking you another.

Psychologist Carl Jung wrote, “Where wisdom reigns, there is no conflict between thinking and feeling.”"
pisces,2017-09-26,"You cannot intellectually rationalize your religious beliefs because they exist outside of the realm of logic.

Although you can immediately see the potential, you’re hesitant to pursue it until you have all the information you need. Don’t be distracted by someone’s enthusiastic analysis.

gemini,2017-09-27,"Your self-confidence may be growing by leaps and bounds, motivating you to express your ideas artistically by exploring a variety of creative methods. Obviously, you must already be skilled in order to produce something masterful.

You know more than you think you do."""

Things aren’t always what they seem to be.”"
virgo,2017-09-27,"A sudden change in your cash flow could be a catalyst that prompts you to reassess your financial condition. Whether you’re confronted with an unexpected expense or blessed with a windfall now, this is an opportunity to solidify your position for the long term.

An ample dose of pragmatism enables you to stabilize your world by cultivating a healthier relationship with your possessions."
libra,2017-09-27,"You might already be experiencing significant growth on multiple fronts in your life. Although too much change too fast often produces stress, it can also resolve lingering tension in the flash of the moment.

However, there’s no need to wait for good things to happen; instead, open your eyes and search for the undiscovered treasure right in front of your eyes."
scorpio,2017-09-27,"It may feel as if you are riding a seesaw, balancing the unpredictable daily demands of work with meaningful spiritual development. It’s easy to slip into a magical space of contemplation today, only to be rudely thrust back into the mundane world where others wait for you to finish a task. Although these two realms seem so separate, it’s your job now to combine them through some form of enlightened self-expression. Author William Plomer wrote, “Creativity is the power to connect the seemingly unconnected.”"
sagittarius,2017-09-27,"Brilliant ideas spark through the neurons of your brain, like millions of tiny lightbulbs inside your head. You realize the innovative quality of your current thoughts and strive to turn them into tangible inventions. Fortunately, you have the chance to create something extraordinary now, but you must take action before it’s too late. Make time to capture your brainstorms by writing them down before a flash of awareness disappears back into the darkness. Henry Van Dyke wrote, “Genius is talent set on fire by courage.”"
capricorn,2017-09-27,"The ladder of success appears to be your friend now, as the way up seems to be an easy climb without obstruction. You are making steady progress and can quickly ascend to the top if you’re willing to take a calculated leap of faith. Although unexpected changes will likely work out in your favor, don’t push your luck. If you become overly confident today, obstacles may suddenly materialize in your path. Humility is your secret weapon."
aquarius,2017-09-27,"You are experiencing a growth spurt, prompted by a sudden shift in your beliefs. You may be immersed in a new course of study or just intrigued by an unconventional school of thought. On one level, this is an ideal situation for you Aquarians; embrace the opportunities offered by developing your potential. Nevertheless, your current mind expansion is not useful in the long run if it is only an intellectual pursuit. Singer Harry Styles said, “A dream is only a dream until you decide to make it real.”"
pisces,2017-09-27,"Your most valuable resource is not something that you own. Your most priceless treasures are the people who support your dreams. Although receiving a financial gift is possible today, it’s likely that an inheritance is more metaphysical than physical. The skills of your allies are more important to you now than money in the bank. Entering a new business relationship can be a catalyst for your personal development. Teamwork makes the dream work."
aries,2017-09-28,"You’re ready to move your plans for world domination forward today, only to discover that you’re not even in control of your own life.

Nevertheless, telling others about your aspirations is not wise because they might conclude that your heart isn’t in your current work. Silence speaks when words can’t."
gemini,2017-09-28,"Your emotional insecurities could get the best of you today, tempting you to criticize other people’s plans. Unfortunately, you might not get the opportunity to share your perspective, which prompts you to turn your negativity inward. Be careful with your thoughts, whether you express them or not. Sometimes it’s better to say nothing if you can’t say something nice. However, novelist David Mitchell wrote, “True metamorphosis doesn't come with flowcharts.”"
cancer,2017-09-28,"You might grow anxious if you think that someone is trying to control your message today.

Author Bryant McGill wrote, “Real transformation requires real honesty. If you want to move forward, get real with yourself.”"
leo,2017-09-28,"Your commitment to a project is so strong that you amaze your coworkers with your current dedication.

In the meantime, channel your energy into cultivating your most creative ideas for a prime-time audience. Author Lailah Gifty Akita wrote, “Why harvest before the fruits get ripe?”"
virgo,2017-09-28,"You cannot keep your thoughts to yourself today. You know something that you believe must be shared, but others may not want to hear your opinion if it’s not in harmony with their reality. Nevertheless, you’re so adamant about making your point -- even at the risk of creating a scene -- that you forge ahead no matter what. Nothing good will come of your persistence now, so let the dynamics of the moment transform on their own. Trust your intuition to tell you when the time is right to deliver your message."
libra,2017-09-28,"People won’t leave you alone as they try to get you to spill the beans today. Although you aren’t interested in revealing your inner world now, everyone seems to be ignoring your “Do Not Disturb” sign. Unfortunately, their insistence only drives your thoughts deeper, souring your good intentions.

Charlie Chaplin said, “You need power only when you want to do something harmful; otherwise love is enough to get everything done.”"
scorpio,2017-09-28,"Use caution when communicating because your words could pack a serious punch today. You might say something casually, only to discover later that your message was taken out of context.

Robin Williams said, “No matter what people tell you, words and ideas can change the world.”"
sagittarius,2017-09-28,"Intellectual currents begin to slowly settle back down to normal now, but you’re not willing to sink gently into silence. You sense that a window of opportunity is closing and you want to take action while you still can. However, you must first examine your values and make a statement that inspires others rather than disempowering them. Folksinger Theodore Bikel said, “I have always striven to raise the voice of hope for a world where hate gives way to respect and oppression to liberation.”"
capricorn,2017-09-28,"You are a force to be reckoned with today, and you won’t let anyone stand between you and your goals. You believe that you can accomplish anything now, but you still might run into a snag along the way. Don’t just ride roughshod over obstacles; they offer critical feedback that can teach you an important lesson necessary for your success. Use what you learn for self-improvement and to set a positive example for others. A Native American proverb states, “We can only be what we give ourselves the power to be.”"
aquarius,2017-09-28,"You are holding back a tsunami of emotions today, because you don’t want them to wash away your intellectual framework.

pisces,2017-09-28,"A long-standing relationship heats up or someone new catches your eye as intense emotions break though into your awareness today. You feel hard-pressed to resist such powerful forces when your heart is in the mix.

aries,2017-09-29,"Cultivating a peaceful environment at work is more important than being productive today. However, complications still can arise if you misunderstand what’s expected of you.

taurus,2017-09-29,"Social interactions may be confusing today as the distinctions between professional and personal relationships blur. Two people can have very different expectations, making it all the more urgent to clear up any potential ambiguity.

Nevertheless, Will Smith said, “The greatest dreams are always unrealistic.”"
cancer,2017-09-29,"You are fixated on a specific image that captures a romantic fantasy and you can’t get it out of your mind. Paradoxically, glimpses of perfect love vanish when you try to share your vision with someone else. In fact, the more you talk about it, the less clear it becomes.

Shakespeare wrote, “Expectation is the root of all heartache.”"
leo,2017-09-29,"You might find something so beautiful today that you want to purchase it, no matter what the expense. Spending money on art for the purpose of investment makes sense only if you can afford it. Unfortunately, you may create a financial mess if you reach too far beyond your means.

It’s not about how much money you make; it’s how you save it."
virgo,2017-09-29,"Relationships pose a peculiar dilemma today because reality is bent out of shape by your expectations. You see people through rose-colored glasses now that illusory Neptune in your 7th House of Others opposes romantic Venus in your sign. The good news is your dreams have the potential to come true.

libra,2017-09-29,"The cosmos is sending you love letters today, and you open each envelope with eager anticipation. Whether you’re enchanted with the idea of invigorating a current relationship or cultivating a new one, your fantasies reveal the lay of the land in the realms of emotional sharing. Just remember to be honest with yourself or you could become so consumed with creating an ideal partnership that you miss out on the magic already present in your life. Nevertheless, give yourself permission to explore all the possibilities in the safety of your imagination before choosing the one you want to pursue."
scorpio,2017-09-29,"Although you know exactly what you need in your love life, you don’t always do such a stellar job of communicating your desires to others. In fact, those closest to you might not be able comprehend what you are saying now if your words don’t match your actions. Ultimately, people see in you what they want, rather than who you are. Walking your talk enables you to solve problems before they manifest. Lao Tzu wrote, ""He who does not trust enough will not be trusted."""
sagittarius,2017-09-29,"You want everything related to your career to be chugging along on track, but you might not know how to clear a path to success now.

capricorn,2017-09-29,"You can dream your way to success today, but you still must do the hard work to reach the top of your game. It’s also necessary to pursue your goals ethically, especially while enriching Venus in your 9th House of Higher Truth opposes spiritual Neptune. However, it’s all too easy to talk yourself into believing that your perspective is built on moral high ground. Remain flexible and continue to use an objective eye to look at the facts as they arrive. Socrates said, “The unexamined life is not worth living.”"
aquarius,2017-09-29,"You may be so clever today that you outsmart your own intentions. Naturally, you want to succeed, but there could be unconscious factors at play which can work against you when you least expect it. Your smartest strategy to prevent negative consequences requires you to explore the backwaters of your imagination. Shining the light of your awareness into the twilight of consciousness enables you to make previously invisible treasure apparent to all."
pisces,2017-09-29,"You could be sending mixed signals to others because you’re ambiguous about your relationship goals today. Fortunately, people close to you won’t be deterred by your lack of clarity because they can see right through your defense mechanisms.

Hunt wrote, “Decide what you want, decide what you are willing to exchange for it. Establish your priorities and go to work.”"
taurus,2017-09-30,"Although you want to establish your autonomy today, you resist working too hard to do it. In fact, you might find self-motivation a real challenge now, and taking the easy way out seems like a clever idea.

If you take care of your senses, everything else will take care of itself."
gemini,2017-09-30,"You are not restrained by the same rules everyone else must follow today. It’s as if you’ve been given the green light to create your own laws and abide by them.

cancer,2017-09-30,"You may head out for a little adventure on your own today. You are eager to do something special with your newfound sense of freedom. Although you might miss the company of your loved ones, being able to do whatever you want without waiting for approval is exhilarating. Testing your limits encourages your personal growth, but you look forward to returning to the safety of your nest later on. Balancing your current desire to stretch your wings with your need for emotional security brings satisfaction on both sides of the equation."
leo,2017-09-30,"Someone might be acting weird today, as if they need to place additional emotional distance between you and them. Let people go through their motions, even if you don’t understand their current behavior. Rather than trying to co-ordinate activities with your friends now, just make room in your plans for them to join you if they wish. The less control you exert, the more likely your buddies will want to participate in the fun. President George Washington said, “It is better to be alone than to be in bad company.”"
virgo,2017-09-30,"Everyone is counting on you to work out the details on a family outing or an excursion with friends today. Naturally, they trust your organizational abilities but you might overdo it in your haste to pack as much as possible into a short amount of time. Although excessive Jupiter is egging you on now, it’s smarter to err on the side of less because you can always fill in the empty spaces on the fly. Simplifying your plans streamlines your day and amplifies everyone's satisfaction."
libra,2017-09-30,"You’re eager to talk, yet reluctant to share your feelings today. In fact, your tendency to chat is magnified by loquacious Mercury’s shift into your relationship-oriented sign. But your verbosity is like a stage magician’s use of misdirection as your words shift the focus of your audience from your emotions to your thoughts. There’s nothing you need to do to change the dynamics now; just enjoy participating in the mental games while they last."
scorpio,2017-09-30,"You’re longing for a bit of downtime in order to recharge, and the best way to make that happen is to hide out at home today. It’s not that you’re avoiding social contact; in fact, you may set up a meeting with a close friend as long as the energy is mellow. More than anything, you need some peace and quiet so you can reconnect with your soul and prepare for the next round of magic that’s looming just around the bend. Dr. Fred Luskin wrote, “The only moment where you can change anything about your life is now.”"
sagittarius,2017-09-30,"It’s as if you plugged in every device you own for the sake of keeping all social media channels wide open. You want to connect with like-minded people in cyberspace, or any space, in order to satisfy your need to be with friends, family or tribe. However, you could exhaust yourself if you forget to monitor your own energy levels. It’s all too easy to overindulge when sweet Venus hooks up with joyous Jupiter in your 11th House of Community. Enjoy yourself; just remember to return to Earth for a bit of rest and moderation."

Showing up authentically will win you more respect in the long run than anything else."
aquarius,2017-09-30,"Your mind is primarily consumed with your long-term goals now, and the more you think about them, the more excited you become. But you’re not lost in idle fantasies about unattainable dreams today. Your objectives are ambitious and you’re unwilling to settle for less. Thankfully, you realize that it will still take time before you begin writing the next chapter of your life. However, every day is another opportunity to inch along in the right direction."

Meanwhile, a friend or partner may be rather insistent when inviting you out to play. Spending time with someone you love sounds wonderful, but you still might not be ready to put yourself in a vulnerable position now. Paulo Coelho wrote, “Listen to your heart. It knows everything.”"
aries,2017-10-01,"Your work is clearly laid out before you and you can’t wait to get started. It really doesn’t matter if you are overcommitted; you believe you’re invincible, even if others think your agenda is too ambitious. However, you must be realistic or you might find yourself backed into a corner by your misjudgment. Good intentions are not a substitute for critical analysis and sound planning. Former U.S. Senator Lewis Cass wrote, “People may doubt what you say, but they will believe what you do.”"
taurus,2017-10-01,"Pursuing pleasure is a practical matter today, rather than some fleeting folly. Relentless Pluto trines assertive Mars in your 5th House of Self-Expression, motivating you to reach your goals no matter how long it takes. Both planets are in fellow earth signs, demanding that you be realistic in all your endeavors. Fortunately, your drive is strong and you will likely accomplish whatever you envision. Life coach Emily Guay wrote, “Believe in yourself and you will be unstoppable.”"
gemini,2017-10-01,"An uncharacteristic determination pervades everything you do today. In fact, you are empowered by a palpable force that won’t let up until you get what you want. Unfortunately, you could waste your momentum on a trivial goal unless you weigh all your options before choosing one destination. However, you must resist the urge to rethink the same thoughts again and again. You’ll be happy with your investment of time if you make a decision and stick with it. Martin Luther King Jr. said, “Faith is taking the first step even when you don't see the whole staircase.”"
cancer,2017-10-01,"You want to connect with a dear friend or lover today in ways that go deeper than just a casual meeting. Sinking into a juicy conversation is just what your heart desires. But you won’t need to stage a melodrama; an objective discussion about your dreams may be all you can ask for while the emotionally detached Aquarius Moon is on the scene. Poet Audre Lorde wrote, “Our feelings are our most genuine paths to knowledge.”"
leo,2017-10-01,"Your self-confidence is unshakable today, even if someone you love seems a bit distant. Perhaps you had expected to do something special with a close friend, only to discover they made plans that didn’t include you. Thankfully, your happiness is not dependent on external circumstances, so you can roll with the changes without taking anything too personally now. Author Nabil N. Jamal, PhD. wrote, “He who is satisfied with what he has, is a rich man.”"
virgo,2017-10-01,"You want love to conform to your notion of perfection today, but feelings are messy. You must make a choice: risk failure in the exploration of an emotional connection or allow it to close down without further pursuit. There is no guarantee of success; relationship chemistry works outside the realm of logic. Normally, you might let the opportunity pass, but it seems as if the odds are in your favor now. Performance artist Jeanette Coron wrote, “If you stop being afraid of the word no and take more chances, you will get more yes.”"
libra,2017-10-01,"Although your opinions are uncharacteristically strong today, you can fool others into thinking you don’t have a preference. Appearing uncommitted works to your advantage because classic Libra diplomacy prevents you from offending anyone with your ideas. Nevertheless, non-negotiable Pluto trines pushy Mars buried in your 12th House of Secrets, prompting you to hide your motives from anyone who might oppose your plans. Thankfully, honesty doesn't require you to reveal every little thing you discern and feel. Dr. Assegid Habtewold wrote, “That is why we have the word discretion.”"
scorpio,2017-10-01,"The cosmos is playing your song now and you can’t help but dance to the music. But you’re not interested in following anyone else’s steps. You need to be the leader today, and won’t relinquish control, regardless of the situation. Although you may have all the right moves, your power originates from your relationship with others. A solo act is sure to fail, while collaboration is your ticket to success."
sagittarius,2017-10-01,"Although it may be a day of rest for many, you’re obsessed with solidifying your plans for success. You can see your place on the summit of the mountain and won’t let up until you’ve proven your competence. You aren’t interested in achieving your goals on someone else’s back. However, if you make it to the top, you want your peers to reach it along with you. An African proverb teaches, “If you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go with others.”"
capricorn,2017-10-01,"You are quite comfortable playing your cards out in the open today. Your strategy might be quite unnerving to others because you suddenly don’t seem to care if everyone knows everything about your intentions. Each action you take moves you closer to your goals and there’s little anyone can do to prevent you from executing your entire plan. Just don’t get too cocky or you could slip and make a foolish step, jeopardizing all your recent progress. Oscar Wilde said, “Confidence is good, but overconfidence always sinks the ship.”"
aquarius,2017-10-01,"Your secret weapon is the strength of your convictions, even if you don’t loudly advertise them to others. But this is not about you thinking you’re right about any one specific issue. Instead, you are stubbornly rigid in your belief that everyone should have a voice. However, it’s ironic that the same people you are standing up for now think that you are wrong. Ultimately, there are many ways to look at the same reality, even if it seems so complicated today. Nevertheless, the Dalai Lama said, “My religion is very simple. My religion is kindness.”"
pisces,2017-10-01,"There’s a lot weighing on your mind, but you might keep your feelings locked up so they can’t negatively impact anyone today. Ironically, the very act of denying your emotions adds to their power and increases their unwanted influence. Meanwhile, sharing your secrets with those you trust lightens your load. Don’t let your fears hijack your day; facing them directly enhances your position, clearing a path for your participation in the greater energetic flow. Philosopher Alan Watts wrote, “The only way to make sense out of change is to plunge into it, move with it, and join the dance.”"
aries,2017-10-02,"Your creative approach to your work today quickly distinguishes your contributions from everyone else’s. Your efforts might not be appreciated at first because you’re busy blazing your own trail. However, results speak louder than anyone else’s protests. Although you strive to be the leader of the pack, you have nothing to prove and would prefer to work alone once the Moon enters your 12th House of Privacy. Theologian Benjamin Jowett wrote, “The way to get things done is not to mind who gets the credit for doing them.”"
taurus,2017-10-02,"You might believe that your associates will come to your rescue today. Although you wish to demonstrate your ability to achieve your goals on your own, the Moon’s shift into altruistic Pisces and your 11th House of Groups tempts you with visions of successful collaborations. Nevertheless, you won’t likely give up control until you’ve run out of other options. Thankfully, your unwavering determination will ultimately overpower your ego’s desire to be self-sufficient. Cooperate with others; compete with yourself."
gemini,2017-10-02,"Your notions of success inspire you to visualize your ideal future. But the Moon’s entry into your 10th House of Profession shifts your focus away from unrealistic fantasies as you make plans to advance in your career. However, it’s still challenging to get a firm grip on reality when your imagination makes everything seem possible today. Nevertheless, you must clearly define the line that separates pie-in-the-sky possibilities from what you can actually manifest. Harvey MacKay wrote, “A goal is a dream with a plan and a deadline.”"
cancer,2017-10-02,"You may be overly sensitive to someone’s subtle attempts at controlling your actions today. You expect others to behave with the highest ethics, but their actions leave you wondering. Unfortunately, it’s hard to tell if people are really interfering with your plans or if a sudden brush with unsubstantiated paranoia is getting the best of you. Don’t let your self-doubt pull you down a rabbit hole when there are more important issues to address. Choose the most honorable path possible without being concerned about anyone else’s expectations. Author Robert Tew wrote, “Nothing and no one can make you happy until you alone make you happy.”"
leo,2017-10-02,"There are many reasons to maintain a positive attitude today, but it’s all too easy to worry about trivial matters instead. In fact, an unimportant piece of information could quickly turn into an obsession that sidetracks your focus. If it seems like you’re concentrating on too many details, shift your attention from the trees to the entire forest. Broadening your perspective can inspire you to see solutions where previously only problems were found. If you wish to change the world, change your mind."
virgo,2017-10-02,"You are the first one to acknowledge the importance of having fun today, but not in place of meeting your obligations. You are quite comfortable with your priorities and expect everyone else to deliver on their promises as well. However, no one seems to measure up to your high standards. It’s as if the distant drummer they are dancing to is in another world, inviting them to evade responsibility. Your job is to be patient with people now as they come and go on their own terms while you remain singularly focused on your goals. Fortunately, your success is not dependent on anyone else."
libra,2017-10-02,"Following through with your intentions is crucial today, but your colorful daydreams keep pulling you off course. The Moon slips into spacey Pisces, further encouraging you to entertain your fantasies even while you’re on the job. The edge between fact and fancy is where the magic lives. There’s nothing wrong with indulging your imaginative powers as long as you know when to return back to reality. Scientist Douglas H. Everett wrote, “There are some people who live in a dream world, and there are some who face reality; and then there are those who turn one into the other.”"
scorpio,2017-10-02,"Self-expression comes easily today, but your words may have a completely different effect than you intended. It’s not that your message is unclear; in fact, your blunt style leaves little to the imagination. It’s just that you could misjudge how others will react. Examining your motives for sharing helps you understand how you are perceived and how your actions could be interpreted. Remember, no matter how easygoing you are, there’s an underlying agenda. Consciously letting people know what you’re up to empowers them to play along or fall to the sidelines for all the right reasons."
sagittarius,2017-10-02,You’re torn today between striving to reach ambitious career goals and wanting to let the world pass you by while you sit back and relax. You are set on achieving excellence in your profession but your heart would prefer to recharge its batteries while the sensitive Pisces Moon influences your 4th House of Emotional Security. Rest up while you can since the downtime will not last long. Be fresh and ready to run the race when the starting gate opens tomorrow.
capricorn,2017-10-02,"You’re on a mission and intend to complete it in a timely manner. However, you seem to intermittently lose focus today and can’t figure out why. It’s as if you keep receiving phone calls from a parallel universe now, yet no one is there each time you answer. You feel as if you’re missing something important and can’t take the next step until all the necessary facts are in order. Trust your intuition to tell you when to act. Nevertheless, as Mark Twain said, “The secret of getting ahead is getting started.”"
aquarius,2017-10-02,"You might not be as certain about your core values today, leading you to question your overall direction in life. Thankfully, your objectivity saves the day, enabling you to examine profound existential concerns without being overwhelmed. Nevertheless, you could lose your enlightened emotional detachment in a flash if you let your desires overrule your logic. Instead of blindly chasing a pleasurable fantasy, consider what’s most important to your overall happiness."
pisces,2017-10-02,"Your innate sensitivity allows you to respond with compassion, even in situations that might scare off those who are less trusting. Unfortunately, your empathy is a double-edged sword that could work against you if you don’t establish clear boundaries today. It’s one thing to feel someone else’s pain; it’s another thing to mistake it as your own. Practice discernment by asking yourself whether a feeling is truly yours or if it belongs to someone else. Being an effective agent of positive change requires a healthy mind, body and spirit."
aries,2017-10-03,"Your unwillingness to make less of your feelings today is admirable, especially if you are encountering harsh judgment from others. Although it’s important to stand up for your beliefs, you still need to get along with those close to you. Don’t try to persuade anyone to see your decisions from your perspective. Step beyond your comfort zone and listen to the feedback you’re receiving now, even if it’s not what you want to hear. Author John C. Maxwell wrote, “Change is inevitable; growth is optional.”"
taurus,2017-10-03,"You’re not one to turn your feelings off or on in a moment’s notice. In fact, you’re known for your stubbornness when people try to convince you to change your mind. Although you might encounter resistance when you express your desires today, you won’t likely back down in the face of disapproval. In fact, you’re more than ready to confront any opposition, especially if you are shining your love light for the benefit of others. Author Cathy Hopkins wrote, “Don't wait for your ship to come in, swim out to it.”"
gemini,2017-10-03,"You typically trust the logic of words more than the unreliability of irrational feelings. However, you are in no mood to explain your behavior today, and might ignore those who try to reason with you. Nevertheless, there are several ways to view the current situation, especially if it involves complicated emotional dynamics. Don’t assume your certainty means that you are taking the best course of action. Demonstrate your intelligence by remaining open to alternative interpretations now. Your independence is non-negotiable; the final decision is still yours."
cancer,2017-10-03,"You’re capable of seeing people from a very different perspective today. While your natural tendency might be to judge someone’s lifestyle choices based upon yours, you could easily take a more enlightened attitude and support them -- even if you don’t approve of their behavior. Nurturing those you respect is your highest calling and you can operate at the top of your game now if you refrain from imposing your values on others. Artist Vincent van Gogh wrote, “Love is something eternal; the aspect may change, but not the essence.”"
leo,2017-10-03,"There’s no need for dramatic gestures today when expressing your heart’s desire. But navigating the wild emotional swings you’re feeling is tricky because suppressing them only makes them stronger. Nevertheless, a calm and cool approach to achieving satisfaction will get you further than throwing a tantrum. Your best bet is to focus on balancing the unrestrained passion you’re experiencing on the inside with the even-keeled behavior you want to express on the outside. When your love is strong, you don’t have to shout."
virgo,2017-10-03,"You can focus your creativity like a laser beam today, inspiring you to accomplish amazing results in a very short period of time. It’s as if you possess the magical power of being able to stop the clock while you continue to move at the speed of light. Your current success will depend on your willingness to temporarily let go of your self-criticism and trust your heart. Get your ideas out into the open now, and then improve upon them later on. Author H. Jackson Brown, Jr. wrote, “Strive for excellence, not perfection.”"
libra,2017-10-03,"You are in touch with the inner workings of your heart today, prompting you to explore the origins of your desires. But others may not realize how intense your attractions are while your key planet Venus the Lover is hiding out in your 12th House of Invisibility. Nevertheless, her easy connection with shadowy Pluto enables you to recover hidden treasures from the darkness of your subconscious. Stay away from crowds and take a walk within. You can make an amazing breakthrough now, even if no one else notices."
scorpio,2017-10-03,"You are determined to tell your friends how important they are to you now. However, your passionate nature might make some people uncomfortable. Although you have no reservations about sharing your heartfelt appreciation today, your message may seem too personal for someone who isn’t at ease with their own feelings. Thankfully, you can avoid an awkward interaction by choosing words that don’t trigger such an emotional charge. Nevertheless, as former Israeli President Ezer Weizman said, “Anyone who says he is not emotional is not getting what he should out of life.”"
sagittarius,2017-10-03,"You are looking at your life through a very practical lens today. Although you can project your current circumstances into the future and visualize your path forward, you’re more concerned with how your journey will translate into financial success. You want to be appreciated for your continuing contributions at work, but you might prefer a pay raise to words of praise or a new title. Fortunately, enriching Venus in your 10th House of Career is supported by powerful Pluto’s presence in your 2nd House of Money. Bob Dylan quipped, “Having these colossal accolades and titles, they get in the way.”"
capricorn,2017-10-03,"You’re intent on demonstrating your leadership skills today, but you don’t necessarily want to flaunt your power. In fact, you would rather set the pace by running ahead of the pack, inspiring others to follow your example. You’re less interested in exerting control because you want to avoid being set up for a fall. Nevertheless, you can have the best of both worlds by simply actualizing your potential. Nelson Mandela said, “There are times when a leader must move out ahead of the flock, go off in a new direction, confident that he is leading his people the right way.”"
aquarius,2017-10-03,"You’re uncharacteristically eager to sink into your feelings today because of an irresistible connection with someone special, whether in reality or in fantasy. You’re extremely attracted to the same emotional mysteries that you normally avoid. Although you’re often satisfied with love as an intellectual abstraction, you are enchanted by the possibility of expressing your passion through a total mind-body experience now. Follow your heart; it knows the way."
pisces,2017-10-03,"There is no such thing as a gradual approach to love today. Your passions are running steamy hot or icy cold with very little moderation now. Thankfully, you are quite comfortable with your emotional extremes while potent Pluto aligns with virtuous Venus in your 7th House of Relationships. This current intensity can be very refreshing if you simply engage the energy directly. However, too much sustained excitement eventually becomes exhausting. Enjoy the magic while it lasts without trying to hold onto it once it subsides."
aries,2017-10-04,"Stepping into the middle of a disagreement seems like the right thing to do today, especially if you could help reestablish harmony. Your diplomatic inclinations lead you to believe that your words can smooth over ruffled feathers and put others at ease. However, you might just as easily misread the entire situation and make matters worse. Avoid the tendency to charge ahead with your unilateral plan without considering the needs of all involved. Surprise others with your kindness and grace."
taurus,2017-10-04,"Balancing your personal goals at work with those of the group may be more challenging than you expect. You could get off to a bad start today if you jump to an inaccurate conclusion based upon your past experiences rather than the current situation. In fact, projecting your fears onto everyone else is not a helpful strategy. Instead, ask questions and listen carefully to the spaces in between the words. Practicing compassion by opening your heart and your mind is a surefire way to set you back on a productive course."
gemini,2017-10-04,"You are acutely aware of how your words can alter the overall mood of people around you. You are extra mindful of everyone else’s feelings now and want to be a force for positive change. However, too much thinking turns a simple plan into a logistical nightmare. Oftentimes you need to slow down and reconsider your message before saying something you later regret. Today, it’s more important to express yourself before the moment passes you by. Authenticity matters."
cancer,2017-10-04,"You want to speak your mind but are afraid of stepping too far out of line today. You believe that others expect you to be supportive of their efforts even if you’re not totally on board with their plans. Nevertheless, you need to stay true to your fundamental values, despite any inconveniences you may create by sharing your thoughts. Ultimately, you won’t regret your actions now if you let your integrity do the talking."
leo,2017-10-04,"Asking lots of questions is one method of obtaining missing information, but you might actually know more than you realize now. Nevertheless, you don’t like it when you feel as if you’re being pressured to act before you’re ready to make a choice. Instead of overreacting by digging in your heels to delay the process, trust your intuition and take a leap of faith. Author Robert Kiyosaki wrote, “The biggest risk a person can take is to do nothing.”"
virgo,2017-10-04,"Yesterday’s certainty morphs into today’s doubt. Ironically, your wavering self-confidence is prompted by someone else’s questionable behavior. You know that there are many strategies for improving your attitude, but you might not know where to begin. Unfortunately, asking others for help will only confuse matters further now. The answers to your questions must come from within; no one can tell you what to do. Believe in yourself; your journey is yours and yours alone."
libra,2017-10-04,"Your reputation for fair-mindedness is more important to you than anything else today. But deceptive Neptune can mislead communicator Mercury and the Sun as they travel through your 1st House of Self, sending you down the proverbial rabbit hole. You might be so clever that you almost end up deceiving yourself. Fortunately, the crisis could be averted if you set clear objectives and focus on your top priorities. Nevertheless, you must still keep your eyes on the open horizon or you could get lost in the minutiae. Liberian President Ellen Sirleaf said, “If your dreams don’t scare you, they aren’t big enough.”"
scorpio,2017-10-04,"Being creative might be a lot more fun if you can keep your work private today, but your friends won’t leave you alone. You may secretly worry that your finished product won’t meet their demanding expectations. Nevertheless, your imagination is so vivid now that you can’t help but express your originality through your art. There’s no reason to stop from singing your song. Dr. Wayne Dyer wrote, “Don’t die with your music still inside you.”"
sagittarius,2017-10-04,"Planning the next phase of your life could be less complicated if there weren’t so many things blocking your progress. At least, that’s the story you’re telling yourself now. Although you don’t want to lose your sense of security while banking on the future, it’s time to move beyond your self-imposed limitations. Fortunately, you gain the power to alter your path by taking the road less traveled. Carl Jung wrote, “Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.”"
capricorn,2017-10-04,"You might believe you can talk your way to success today, but words will only take you so far. Nevertheless, setting the right goals is an important start, especially while the willful Sun and thoughtful Mercury are busy strategizing in your 10th House of Status. Unfortunately, objectivity is challenging to find while delusional Neptune is also in the picture. Thankfully, your unflappable common sense helps you make the right choices now. Mahatma Gandhi said, “Action expresses priorities.”"
aquarius,2017-10-04,"Although you want to be pragmatic while moving forward, it’s nearly impossible to keep your mind on the essentials. Making concrete plans enables you to progress with confidence. However, spiritual Neptune’s gentle presence in your 2nd House of Finances reminds you that there’s a metaphysical component to money, too. The seen and unseen worlds both offer worthwhile opportunities for investments of your time. Deciding what you value most determines your options."
pisces,2017-10-04,"There is an uneasy relationship between reality and your imagination today. Unfortunately, you can’t just choose one over the other, even if each seems to be operating independently. Nevertheless, fact and fiction are merely two sides of the same coin and cannot be separated. Functioning in the real world while still honoring your need for fantasy is not just a compromise; it’s a viable strategy for satisfaction and success."
aries,2017-10-05,"Your logic filter might not be functioning optimally today, prompting you to act on a gut feeling before your common sense kicks in. Unrestrained impulsivity may be a familiar problem for you spontaneous Rams who like to live in the present moment. Although the individualistic Aries Full Moon emphasizes your 1st House of Self, you cannot avoid people’s reactions to your ill-conceived behavior. Norman Cousins wrote, “Wisdom consists of the anticipation of consequences.”"
taurus,2017-10-05,"You might be feeling on edge today, but you don’t want anyone to know that you’re hiding anything. Although the Aries Full Moon activates your 12th House of Privacy, your secrets cannot stay buried forever. It’s challenging to know how to proceed because your unexpressed passion can lead to frustration. At the same time, revealing your heart isn’t always the socially appropriate thing to do. Better to be safe than sorry; channel your passion into your work."
gemini,2017-10-05,"You’re ready for a pleasant social distraction but you’re torn between a night out on the town or a quiet evening at home. On one hand, the Aries Full Moon charges your 11th House of Groups, encouraging you to lose yourself in a crowd of like-minded folks. On the other hand, you also see the advantage of focusing your energy on just one person, immersing in the sweetness of connecting on a deeper level. But you might not be limited to one or the other. You can always choose one option today and then schedule something different for tomorrow. Variety is the spice of life."
cancer,2017-10-05,"There is more than one way to nurture your soul today. The extroverted Aries Full Moon fuels your 10th House of Career, motivating you to express your maternalistic inclinations on the job. Taking coworkers under your protective wing extends your love into the community. However, you must balance this need for external accomplishment by also acknowledging your more private side. Spending time with friends and family recharges your soul. Poet Emily Dickinson wrote, “That love is all there is, is all we know of love.”"
leo,2017-10-05,"Your message is on point today, whether you’re discussing politics, religion, or work. People are impressed by your breadth of vision because your clarity sparkles even when you're talking in generalities. The enterprising Aries Full Moon brightens your 9th House of Big Ideas, inspiring you to paint a picture with broad brushstrokes before going back to fill in the details. Although your ability to step outside your personal perspective also enables you to see both sides of an issue, don’t stand on the fence for fear of upsetting someone. Honor your core values and choose your position accordingly."
virgo,2017-10-05,"Although you are happily wearing your creativity cap today, you want your work to be useful. You’re not interested in making anything unless it holds substantial value for others. In fact, your heart feels most fulfilled now when your words and actions have an immediate positive impact on others. Let your originality be your guide as the pioneering Aries Full Moon illuminates your 8th House of Deep Sharing. Novelist George Eliot wrote, “Blessed is the influence of one true, loving human soul on another.”"
libra,2017-10-05,"You may be so determined to empower people now that you encourage their growth and satisfaction over your own. But flaunting your desires isn’t necessary in order to satisfy your needs. In fact, the self-directed Aries Full Moon lands in your 7th House of Others, reflecting your soul in the eyes of those around you. The external world is a mirror of your internal state of mind. Turn the tables and take care of yourself first today. Paradoxically, your closest allies will gain unexpected benefits from your self-fulfillment."
scorpio,2017-10-05,"It’s time for radical action as you create a new routine at home or at work. The urgent Aries Full Moon blasts your 6th House of Habits, pushing you to reconsider which patterns are of value and which ones are not.

sagittarius,2017-10-05,"You might believe that you can get away with nearly anything today as long as you are true to your spirit. Nevertheless, it’s wise to consider other factors before doing something you later regret. Although the Aries Full Moon ignites your 5th House of Self-Expression, it does not work in isolation. In fact, Luna’s opposition to the relationship-oriented Libra Sun is a reminder that you exist within a social context. Novelist Emily Giffin wrote, “You can only control your own actions, not other people’s reactions.” Everything you do now alters your future by setting other scenarios into motion."
capricorn,2017-10-05,"Your ambitious approach to your career is counterbalanced by your current need for time away from work. Whether it’s the call of family responsibilities, a plan to start new projects at home or the simple desire to have a personal life, you realize there’s more than getting ahead at work. The assertive Aries Full Moon highlights your 4th House of Foundations, encouraging you to fortify your external achievements with internal stability. Albert Einstein said, “Try not to become a man of success, but rather try to become a man of value.”"
aquarius,2017-10-05,"You longingly envision a future where you have plenty of time to pursue a variety of interests. You might fantasize about studying an exotic culture or an esoteric philosophy, but a long list of chores prevents you from exploring these dreams. Your current circumstances seem to offer no relief. The Aries Full Moon magnifies your 3rd House of Distractions, making you busier than you expected -- and you’re not sure how you lost control of your calendar.

Remember, in the end you only regret the chances you didn’t take."
aries,2017-10-06,"Your sudden outburst might surprise those closest to you, but they should have seen it coming. If you are keeping your feelings hidden, someone’s behavior could act as a trigger today, unleashing your pent-up emotions. Nevertheless, it’s wise to review the facts and make sure you’re not jumping to an erroneous conclusion. There’s nothing wrong with getting something off your chest as long as you’re aiming your message at the right person for the right reason. Author Tim Fargo wrote, “Good intentions might sound nice, but it’s positive actions that matter.”"
taurus,2017-10-06,"You can put your best foot forward today, convincing everyone that you have everything under control. However, behind the pleasant veneer, your thoughts are tumultuous. Although you cannot rein in your fantasies, you could minimize their negative effects by burying your feelings. Fortunately, time is on your side and the Moon’s shift into your sign later in the day offers you a refreshing opportunity to reestablish your emotional equilibrium. Finding your center is as simple as listening to your heart."
gemini,2017-10-06,"It’s as if you had an extra dose of caffeine today and can’t sit still. Everyone you encounter inspires you to play another round of connect-the-dots. There’s no apparent limit to the ways you can distract yourself from completing your work. In fact, your key planet Mercury is busy making mischief with illusory Neptune, enticing you to bend the truth in your favor. However, it’s unwise to hang a “Do Not Disturb” sign on your door and then head out to go fishing. Reality will catch up with you soon enough. Instead of plotting your escape now, keep your map ready for when the time is right."
cancer,2017-10-06,"An abrupt shift of direction at work may be upsetting at first, especially if you are comfortable with your current assignment. However, you quickly could see the big picture now, seizing the opportunity to become an integral part of the team. Don’t wait for the dust to settle; jump in without reservation. Risk-taking isn’t risky if you’re confident in your abilities. Today’s unexpected events can lead to tomorrow’s stability."
leo,2017-10-06,"If there was a way to gain information through osmosis or to download an amazing experience, you would be the first person to sign up. But your impatience doesn’t necessarily serve you well today, for there are no shortcuts to learning that lasts. Although you might be in a rush, don’t let anyone convince you that faster is better. Take a few deep breaths; your world will return to its regular speed once the Moon shifts into methodical Taurus later in the day. Artist Masashi Kishimoto wrote, “There's no advantage to hurrying through life."""
virgo,2017-10-06,"A friendship or business partnership could hit a patch of rocky road today as unforeseen events test the integrity of the relationship. Ironically, it might be more challenging to manage success than failure. For example, a lucrative deal may suddenly broaden your prospects, but can also require you to rethink your strategy. Fortunately, a shared commitment to a common goal could be the glue to hold things together as long as you are both willing to discuss all of your options. Muhammad Ali said, “Service to others is the rent you pay for your room here on Earth.”"
libra,2017-10-06,"You may be shocked out of your ambivalence by someone’s radical behavior today. Although you accept the fact that you’re not calling all the shots, you wish everyone would play by the same rules as you do. You want to be fair, but it’s difficult to remain impartial when your emotions are bent out of shape. Instead of automatically reacting now, stand back far enough to gain a wider perspective of the situation. Distance increases objectivity."
scorpio,2017-10-06,"You’re tired of people who block your innovative ideas and you are ready to intervene on behalf of your creativity. In fact, you might want to start a revolution now, but you’re not willing to suffer the consequences of collateral damage. Instead of trying to fix a scratch on a mirror with a sledge hammer, find and use the appropriate tools before ending up with an irreparable mess. Fortunately, controlled chaos is the source of your magic."
sagittarius,2017-10-06,"A brilliant solution to a long-standing problem comes to you in a flash today. You see the path open up before you and you can’t wait to put your ingenious idea into motion. However, translating your vision into reality may not be as straightforward as you wish. Nevertheless, the time you put into developing your plan now is a worthwhile investment for the future. Cultivating a dream cannot be rushed. Caesar Augustus said, “Make haste slowly.”"
capricorn,2017-10-06,"Managing your personal affairs takes on a sense of urgency when an unresolved domestic issue suddenly grabs your attention today. It may be something as simple as an unpaid bill that disrupts your phone service. But whatever it is, you must redirect your energy and handle the crisis right away. Other responsibilities won’t disappear, but you remain on heightened alert at home until you address this matter. Remember, it isn’t about creating problems; it’s about finding solutions."
aquarius,2017-10-06,"You’re ready to rock out because the cosmos is playing your song on the intergalactic radio. You are tuned into your dreams today, making it all too easy to be amused by otherworldly fantasies. Although you like what you hear now, you could become so enthralled that you let something of significance in the real world slip through the cracks. Periodically reminding yourself to reconnect with reality is an antidote to trouble later on. It’s much more effective to monitor your behavior throughout the day than to repair the damage after it’s done."
pisces,2017-10-06,"You’re seeking emotional security at the most fundamental level today. Focusing on the connection between your material success and your spiritual contentment motivates you to explore a variety of paths to happiness. However, the road to satisfaction cannot be found on a map. The most useful clues come from examining the leanings of your heart. A journey within could lead to  surprising treasures."
aries,2017-10-07,"Signs everywhere are telling you to slow down, but you might recklessly choose to disobey them. You still have plenty to accomplish today, and you’re not in the mood to lose momentum. Unfortunately, you must reevaluate your strategy of denial if you find yourself stuck in mud. It’s one thing to persist in spite of hardship, but only a fool would try to forge ahead when no progress is being made. There’s a world of difference between giving up and knowing when enough is enough."
taurus,2017-10-07,"Inertia is not your friend today because an object at rest tends to stay at rest. Ironically, your thoughts are racing all over the map but there’s so much mental activity that it’s tough to find a place to jump in and get started. Ultimately, you might try to take the easy way out by just letting time float by. However, inaction isn’t a viable option because you’ll end up annoyed with your lack of accomplishment. Persisting in the face of resistance is a sign of strength."
gemini,2017-10-07,"You may feel as if you’re disconnected from the rest of the world today, even if nothing has changed recently. Rather than interacting through social media, you might read other people’s posts without reaching out yourself. But invisibility isn’t your natural style even if you are successful with your disappearing act now. Don’t waste energy whining about your temporary isolation. Instead, use your alone time to reconnect with your inner realms. Author Katrina Kenison wrote, “Solitude is the soul’s holiday, an opportunity to stop doing for others and to surprise and delight ourselves instead.”"
cancer,2017-10-07,"You are looking at your life through a very sensible filter today. You want to make plans, but are hesitant to push the envelope now that the practical Taurus Moon is visiting your 11th House of Long-Term Goals. You’re aware of the widening gulf between your visions and reality. Oddly enough, this apparently unbridgeable gap gives you permission to go anywhere in your fantasies because you believe them to be unreachable. Much to your surprise, your daydreams create metaphysical scaffolding upon which you can build an amazing future you want to live in."
leo,2017-10-07,"You wish to be known as a reliable resource in your community now. In fact, the determined Taurus Moon’s presence in your 10th House of Public Responsibility indicates you might just get what you want. However, it may take more time than you expect, since earning respect doesn’t happen overnight. In fact, there’s no way to rush the process; you must grow into your role as an authority figure by working hard to prove your competence. Psychologist William James wrote, “Act as if what you do makes a difference. It does.”"
virgo,2017-10-07,"You’re inspired by the simplest dreams now. You are more excited about a goal that is easily attainable than by unrealistic fantasies that are currently beyond your reach. But imagining a pleasant experience isn’t enough to bring you satisfaction; you still must take the initiative to make it happen. Unfortunately, there are so many paths that appear to lead in the same direction, you can’t choose which one is your best bet. But indecision won’t move you any closer to your goal, so pick one road and set out without further delay."
libra,2017-10-07,"You believe that a successful relationship requires both people to be equal participants. But sometimes subtle inequities can pull a partnership out of balance. You may be entangled in such a delicate situation now, and want to understand your role so you can improve the dynamics. Starting a dialogue about what you each bring to the dance enables you to map out a strategy for realizing your highest potential. Philosopher Mortimer Adler wrote, “Love without conversation is impossible.”"
scorpio,2017-10-07,"It’s annoying when others behave as if they have all the answers, especially if you can see through the façade of their self-confidence. Unfortunately, a spirited conversation won’t lead anywhere productive while the presence of the stubborn Taurus Moon in your 7th House of Companions indicates another person’s lack of flexibility. However, it takes two to tango; your actions can stand in the way of progress, too. A breakthrough is more likely if you approach the situation from a fresh perspective. George Bernard Shaw wrote, “Those who cannot change their minds cannot change anything.”"
sagittarius,2017-10-07,"You seek ways to engage your friends in conversations about your future. Although you like the idea of brainstorming, the back-to-basics Taurus Moon is visiting your 6th House of Logistics, requiring you to attend to the details. You might feel as if you’re caught in an uncomfortable struggle between the very large and the very small. Striving for balance sounds like a wise pursuit, but it will probably only increase your anxiety now. Instead of seeking a solution to your dilemma, let the divergent perspectives exist side by side without conflict."
capricorn,2017-10-07,"Although realistic planning usually brings satisfaction, something about it doesn’t work today. The steady Taurus Moon falls in your 5th House of Play, but her stressful aspects make it difficult for you to relax and enjoy life. There are facets of the day you can change and those you cannot. Work to improve the things within your control and let the others go. Focus on whatever brings you pleasure. Rumi wrote, “When you go to a garden, do you look at thorns or flowers? Spend more time with the roses and jasmine.”"
aquarius,2017-10-07,"Although you don’t want to wait for all the wonders of the future to arrive, you have no choice but to take the only route that goes there. Fortunately, you’re also oddly fascinated with the status quo and are quite satisfied to remain in the present while it lasts. However, the time between now and then is a mystery that can unwrap the secrets of happiness. Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, “Life is a journey, not a destination.”"
pisces,2017-10-07,"You need to be surrounded by people who can hold up their end of a conversation now. However, you won’t be satisfied with run-of-the-mill discussions about mundane events. An uneasy collaboration between progressive Uranus and spiritual Neptune lures your thoughts into uncharted mystical waters. You are sure to be captivated by a more philosophical approach to life, yet you still need to bring even the most radical ideas back down to Earth where you can put them into practice. Think cosmically; act locally."
aries,2017-10-08,"You might feel as if you’re being shortchanged in a relationship today. It seems like you’re not being heard, no matter what you say. Unfortunately, you may be so worried that you won’t measure up to someone else’s standards, that you don’t even try. However, if you fail to show up now, you could inadvertently create the same situation you were trying to avert in the first place. Author Vironika Tugaleva wrote, “Fear becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Thinking that there is something to be avoided manifests something to avoid.”"
taurus,2017-10-08,"Every word you utter today seems to require extra effort. You might even be tempted to remain silent and save the communicating for another day. However, taskmaster Saturn tests gracious Venus as she visits your 5th House of Love, and it’s not in your best interest to ignore this challenge. Although you may feel as if you’re skating on thin ice at first, it becomes more solid as you start the conversational ball rolling. Face your internal struggles and watch the obstructions shatter as you speak your truth."
gemini,2017-10-08,"You may think you’re shouting into the darkness today and could convince yourself that no one can hear you as you share your heart’s desire. You have something important to say and it’s your job to deliver your message even if it seems to fall on deaf ears. But, the truth is that someone might be listening, even if they are pretending otherwise. Your sweet words will have the impact you hope as long as you stay on point. Plato said, “Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a harder battle.”"
cancer,2017-10-08,"Your desires are pretty simple today. You’re not expecting the Moon and the Stars, only the loyalty of a close friend. Nevertheless, you’re concerned that you still may be asking for too much while needy Venus in your 3rd House of Communication squares naysaying Saturn. But don’t assume the worst; your positive attitude improves the interpersonal dynamics, paving a road to emotional fulfillment. Professor Scott Sorrell said, “You make the world a better place by making yourself a better person.”"
leo,2017-10-08,"Love seems hard to find today, even if you know that everything will be okay in the long run. It’s as if your heart is being squeezed through a narrow passage. Although it might not be pleasant in the moment, this process requires you to leave behind unnecessary emotional baggage. Keep your eyes on the light at the end of the tunnel. You could be quite surprised by how exhilarated you feel once you get to the other side. President John Quincy Adams wrote, “Courage and perseverance have a magical talisman, before which difficulties disappear and obstacles vanish into air.”"
virgo,2017-10-08,"Domestic responsibilities take up so much energy today that you are left without time to pursue your own interests. Nevertheless, your family relationships are of significant value to you, contributing to the stability of your personal life. Unfortunately, you must make choices because you can’t do everything now. The long-term benefits of focusing on those you adore outweighs the fleeting satisfaction of pleasures that will not last. Coach John Wooden said, “Passion is momentary; love is enduring.”"
libra,2017-10-08,"You’re not very talkative today -- you don’t have a lot to say if you can’t say something nice. However, keeping your dark thoughts to yourself is not necessarily a wise plan. Delving into the shadows can quickly turn into a downward spiral. Unfortunately, if you suppress negative feelings now, they only gain strength. But self-doubt can be easily avoided by consciously choosing to discuss your dilemma instead of hiding it. Sharing the burden lightens the load."
scorpio,2017-10-08,"You need a reality check from your friends today, partly because you’re wondering if they really like you or if they are just humoring you. Thankfully, your current insecurity could lead to a heart-to-heart chat that enables everyone to put their feelings out into the open. Instead of criticizing someone else’s behavior, try a more encouraging approach. Your attitude will determine the emotional tenor of the ensuing discussion. Esther Hicks wrote, “In optimism there is magic. In pessimism there is nothing.”"
sagittarius,2017-10-08,"You may feel blocked in your career, especially if you think your hard work has gone unnoticed. Regardless of how close you may be to success, it seems far away today. You might be considering a change of direction, but this is not a smart time to throw in the towel. Your greatest strength is your faith in your potential, so don’t lose hope now. The glass is half-full, not half-empty; your job is to fill it the rest of the way. Dr. Joyce Brothers wrote, “A strong, positive self-image is the best possible preparation for success.”"
capricorn,2017-10-08,"You enjoy setting goals and then excel at creating viable plans to achieve them. Your objectives are clear now, and you’re willing to commit all your resources toward reaching the pinnacle of your success. Although you may spend your time in contemplation today, you’re busy strategizing for the action-packed days ahead. It’s not necessary to rush into anything yet; you will be dancing in the spotlight soon enough. Seneca wrote, “Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.”"
aquarius,2017-10-08,"You have a strange feeling that something wonderful could happen today, but you’re hesitant to buy into your fantasy because you’re afraid of being disappointed. Whether or not your day turns into a magical one, the power of positive thinking makes all the difference in the world. Nevertheless, if nothing out of the ordinary materializes, don’t write the day off as a failure. Your experience offers you an important lesson if you’re open to it. A Chinese proverb teaches, “Learning is a treasure that will follow its owner everywhere.”"
pisces,2017-10-08,"A friend or lover may ask you for a special favor today. Naturally, you want to help if possible. However, previous commitments might make it impossible to assist in the way you wish. Don’t make any promises you cannot keep. It’s better to say no right away than to end up being unreliable. The truth isn’t always easy to deliver, but the sooner you address the facts, the better it is for everyone involved. Honesty is the kindest gift you can give now."
aries,2017-10-09,"You might not trust someone’s assistance today because you’re suspicious of their hidden agenda. Although Mercury in gracious Libra falls in your 7th House of Companions, its square to Pluto may prompt a conflict over the direction of your life. But taking on an opponent is tricky business when you’re unclear about their intentions. Nevertheless, you can help to ameliorate the tension by being very specific when describing your goals. Author Earl Nightingale wrote, “All you need is the plan, the road map, and the courage to press on to your destination.”"
taurus,2017-10-09,"You assume your blueprint for success contains enough contingencies to handle nearly anything that might happen. Unfortunately, you can’t know everything that might occur in advance. Although you can be slow to respond to unforeseen circumstances, the adaptable Gemini Moon is your saving grace today. Sticking to your plan is admirable only until you know it doesn’t work. Winston Churchill said, “Success is not final, failure is not fatal; it is the courage to continue that counts.”"
gemini,2017-10-09,"Although you often demonstrate your intelligence with words, your gift of gab can work against you today. You might say something quite casually, only to learn that your message was taken the wrong way. Sadly, the more you defend your innocence, the less you are believed now. Instead of ratcheting up an argument, give others space and just write your thoughts down for a later conversation. Sometimes it’s really wise to let a sleeping dog lie if you don’t want to cause a scene."
cancer,2017-10-09,"You’re hoping a diplomatic approach to an adversary will prevent an unpleasant confrontation. However, leaving your thoughts unexpressed only gives others the justification to go ahead with their plans, even if their behavior is destructive today. Fortunately, you can see the current emotional landscape clearly enough to navigate a route through the uncertain territory. Share your vision, but don’t make the mistake of thinking it’s the only worthwhile one. Author Rick Yancey wrote, “Without trust there's no cooperation. And without cooperation there's no progress. History stops.”"
leo,2017-10-09,"You think that you can organize people with various ideas into a single collaborative group simply by sharing your words of wisdom. However, making a provocative declaration can stir up chaos instead of cooperation today. Thankfully, the smooth-talking Gemini Moon's presence in your 11th House of Networking enables you to quickly repair the damage. Don’t be afraid to upset the applecart now, as long as you have a better strategy in mind and are willing to stick around to make it happen. Zig Ziglar said, “The most important persuasion tool you have in your entire arsenal is integrity.”"
virgo,2017-10-09,"You want to be taken seriously at work, but you could go overboard while making your point today. Your key planet Mercury forms a compelling square with unrelenting Pluto in your 5th House of Self-Expression, urging you to state your case with extreme conviction. But your refusal to negotiate may be perceived as an unwillingness to play nicely with others. Don’t let your fixation on a particular method stand in the way of your success. Max McKeown wrote, “Adaptability is about the powerful difference between adapting to cope and adapting to win.”"
libra,2017-10-09,"A feeling of panic might trigger you to take drastic action today. It seems as if a window of opportunity is closing now that propitious Jupiter is leaving your sign after a yearlong visit. Fear of failure could prompt you to unleash a tirade of words and a flood of suppressed emotions as you try to prevent a fortuitous moment from passing. There’s no reason to look back or to cling to the past when your future holds so much unrealized potential. Author Bob Goff wrote, “Embrace uncertainty. Some of the most beautiful chapters in our lives won’t have a title until much later.”"
scorpio,2017-10-09,"People may make the mistake of thinking they know what you’re up to today. But you are quite introspective now, and won’t likely share your powerful inner experiences with just anyone. Nevertheless, you’re standing at the entrance to a brave new land; your future beckons and you cannot resist the call. Don’t bother putting so much energy toward protecting your secrets when it’s healthier to let go of old patterns that no longer work in your best interest. Antoine de Rivarol wrote, “It is the dim haze of mystery that adds enchantment to pursuit.”"
sagittarius,2017-10-09,"It seems like everyone wants to talk about trivial matters today, but you’re more intrigued by substantial subjects. In fact, there may be conflict brewing beneath the surface that brings your core beliefs into question. You’re not interested in discussing your values to reach an agreement with those who differ. Instead, you simply want others to know where you stand and to adapt to your position. Your intentions are honorable, but your expectations can lead to frustration. The Bhagavad Gita teaches, “The secret of human freedom is to act well, without attachment to the results.”"
capricorn,2017-10-09,"Pressure to change, whether it originates from people or circumstances, only motivates you Mountain Goats to dig in your hoofs and prepare to stand your ground. You already have your agenda clearly mapped out today, and you’re not eager to make any modifications. Unfortunately, you might not have as much say in the matter as you wish. Pick your points of contention carefully or exhaust yourself fighting about the wrong issues. Without applying a little common sense, you could win every battle and still lose the war."
aquarius,2017-10-09,"A rational approach to learning inspires you to consider a new course of study. However, you may run into surprising resistance from an unlikely source today. Your immediate reaction might be to double down and reaffirm the importance of your new intellectual endeavor. However, rather than assuming you’re on the right track, it’s wiser to hold space in order to examine all your possible choices. Coach Phil Jackson said, “Always keep an open mind and a compassionate heart.”"
pisces,2017-10-09,"You can’t rely on cool logic to think your way out of an intense emotional conundrum today, especially if you’re only an observer. You value your role as a fair-minded mediator and you’re quick to offer an unbiased ear. Although you can see both sides of the issue, you have a definite preference in a drama that’s unfolding in your social sphere. Nevertheless, it’s a mistake to reveal your position yet. Let the situation develop without contributing opinions that could skew the results. Remaining impartial enables you to do the most good."
aries,2017-10-10,"You’re ready to jump into an uncomfortable relationship discussion because you believe your words can act as a healing balm. Giant Jupiter shifts into your 8th House of Deep Sharing, encouraging you to step beyond lighthearted chatter. You have no shortage of thoughts to discuss, but if your intervention just sounds like noise to the others involved, they might want you to stop talking. Zig Ziglar wrote, “People don’t always need advice. Sometimes all they really need is a hand to hold, an ear to listen and a heart to understand them.”"
taurus,2017-10-10,"You might profess your attraction to someone, only to find your feelings thwarted. Romantic Venus opposes wounded Chiron in your 11th House of Social Networking, stressing the boundaries between friends and lovers. Thankfully, buoyant Jupiter moves into your 7th House of Others, inspiring you to look past any current uncertainties to see the positive potential of relationships. You probably won’t reach the satisfaction you desire now, but you can salvage an awkward situation through honest dialogue. Novelist Rita Mae Brown wrote, “Language exerts hidden power, like the Moon on the tides.”"
gemini,2017-10-10,"Meaningful connections are elusive today, leaving you to wonder what you are missing. Everyone seems to be on your case, judging your behavior for no reason at all. However, the world is not necessarily out to get you; your current attitude has a larger impact on the reactions you receive than you realize. Nevertheless, you won’t likely fix everything now, regardless of what you do. Thankfully, beneficent Jupiter takes up residence in your 6th House of Details, rewarding small steps in the right direction. Slow progress is still progress."
cancer,2017-10-10,"Explaining your feelings sounds like more trouble than it’s worth today. You’re content to pass your time hiding out under the covers, but unfortunately, the world might not let you escape so easily. You must push through your own resistance and step into the spotlight now. Luckily, auspicious Jupiter’s shift into your 5th House of Fun and Games means your party is ready to start. Unfortunately, managing your emotions is mandatory before you go out to play."
leo,2017-10-10,"You’re happiest today when you are in the company of your closest friends and family. Jupiter’s move into your 4th House of Domestic Conditions resonates with your desire for emotional security. You’re not interested in wasting your time or energy on irrelevant projects, but you are willing to do whatever is necessary to rejuvenate your system. Nevertheless, it’s all too easy to be swayed by gloss and glitter because you’re feeling so restless now. George Lucas said, “Always remember, your focus determines your reality.”"
virgo,2017-10-10,"When it’s quiet today, you quickly long for a distraction. But when it’s noisy, you remember how much you prefer silence. Either way, you want what you don’t have. However, excessive Jupiter's entry into your 3rd House of Communication increases your need for heartfelt interactions. Unfortunately, satisfaction is impossible when you expect more than what is available. Thankfully, you can change your mind quickly now, enabling you to move with the fluctuating tides. Joseph Campbell wrote, “We must let go of the life we have planned, so as to accept the one that is waiting for us.”"
libra,2017-10-10,"An old emotional wound may resurface today, preventing you from realizing a dream. Spending time exploring your fantasies sounds like fun, but actualizing them requires a considerable amount of work. Fortunately, you can enjoy envisioning your next great adventure without actually going there yet. Optimistic Jupiter steps into your 2nd House of Self-Esteem, inviting you to consider the relationship between your long-term goals and your past accomplishments. Don’t wait for the next opportunity to knock at your door. Fine-tuning your plan now ensures your future success."
scorpio,2017-10-10,"You are standing on the precipice of a wondrous journey. Joyful Jupiter enters transformational Scorpio and your 1st House of Self for a yearlong visit, closing one chapter of your life and opening the next. Reflect over the past year to reassess your successes and your failures. Take an inventory of all unfinished business so you can effectively allocate your time. More importantly, create a sweeping new list of ambitious goals for your future. You don’t need to set sail today as long as you aim yourself in the right direction."
sagittarius,2017-10-10,"You have a new theme song today. Harry Nilsson sang, “Everybody’s talkin’ at me, but I can’t hear a word they’re saying, only the echoes of my mind.” The loquacious Gemini Moon in your 7th House of Others might be enough to fill your world with an endless stream of verbal yammering. However, it’s boisterous Jupiter’s presence in your 12th House of Soul Consciousness that creates the psychic reverberations in the vast halls of your imagination. You have a choice to make now; let your dreams fade away or make them come true."
capricorn,2017-10-10,"There are so many items on your to-do list that you don’t know where to start. It may even feel like a hopeless cause, since you surely won’t be able to complete all of your work now. Thankfully, bountiful Jupiter enters your 11th House of Long-Term Goals, shifting your focus from the specifics of today’s chores to the generalities of tomorrow’s horizons. Nevertheless, you can’t just walk out on your current responsibilities. Put your shoulder to the wheel and hold up your end of the deal."
aquarius,2017-10-10,"Although your mind is overflowing with a surplus of innovative thoughts today, they won’t necessarily lead to a productive outcome. Nevertheless, propitious Jupiter moves into your 10th House of Career, increasing your chances for a promotion. Don’t let an ingenious idea or ambitious plan fade back into the shadows of your subconscious mind before you have a chance to act on it. Instead of leaving your future in the hands of fate, take it into your own hands. Goethe wrote, “Whatever you can do, or dream you can do, begin it. Boldness has genius, power, and magic in it.”"
pisces,2017-10-10,"You try to avoid doing anything that creates unnecessary stress today. However, your personal life is a source of emotional turmoil now that romantic Venus opposes wounded Chiron in your sensitive sign. Meanwhile, journeying Jupiter enters your 9th House of Distant Horizons, and your immediate concerns dissipate as you look further into your future. But your optimism is not sufficient to put bread on your table. Author Alan Cohen wrote, “There is virtue in work and there is virtue in rest. Use both and overlook neither.”"
aries,2017-10-11,"Responsibilities call and you have little choice but to do what is expected. People have no patience with you now, especially if you offer excuses rather than making good on your promises. Although thinking about completing a project may be overwhelming today, you can use the cosmic energy to your advantage. Listen to action-oriented Mars as it travels through your 6th House of Details, reminding you to take progress one small step at a time. Inch by inch, it’s a cinch; yard by yard, it’s hard."
taurus,2017-10-11,"Your desires are running wild today, and you wish you were free enough to follow every whim. However, you may feel energetically stifled, even if you know what you want out of life. Although circumstances beyond your control seem to be working against you, you’re not in any mood to accept no for an answer. However, taking a shortcut will only stir up additional friction. Adopting a conservative plan that doesn’t push other people’s limits too far is a sensible strategy. It’s never wise to rush things that need time to grow."
gemini,2017-10-11,"You may be operating with caution as you sink into a defensive mode today, triggered by the red lights around you. Others may be fooled by your lack of enthusiasm but they would be wrong to write you out of the game. You’re no less excited about the prospects for your future; it’s just that you’re frustrated by other people’s negativity. Flaunting your optimism could rile someone’s ire -- and arguing with them now is a waste of your energy. Focus on your goal and don’t look in any direction but ahead."
cancer,2017-10-11,"You want to be judged in a positive manner by your coworkers today. Unfortunately, they might be stressing you out with too many demands, making it  difficult to do your job successfully. Although there is a lot on your plate, you may also be overly sensitive now that the moody Moon is back in your sign. Don’t get sidetracked by self-judgment since it sets up a negative dynamic between you and everyone else. Establish realistic goals for the day and progress steadily toward them without worrying about what others think. Let your work speak for itself."
leo,2017-10-11,"Managing your feelings of jealousy isn’t always as simple as you wish, especially if someone is giving you the cold shoulder. Your goals are pretty straightforward now, yet your attempts to fulfill your emotional needs may appear blocked. Although it could seem that the problem originates with someone else, it might actually be your unexpressed fears that are influencing others. Instead of blaming anyone else for your lack of satisfaction today, take responsibility for your own emotions. Happiness blooms from within."
virgo,2017-10-11,"Your impatience can get the best of you today, but a little self-restraint works wonders. Impulsive Mars in your sign encourages immediate action but its square to karmic Saturn requires you to consider the possible adverse consequences, too. However, it’s a mistake to assume that your imagined worst-case scenarios will automatically manifest. Nevertheless, there are plenty of alternatives now, and one of them may be more productive than your first selection. Author Rick Riordan wrote, “The right choice is hardly ever the easy choice.”"
libra,2017-10-11,"You might feel as if you have worked yourself into a corner today, but giving up is not an option. In fact, the message you are receiving from sobering Saturn now is a wake-up call that reveals where your plan needs more work. Instead of struggling to escape from the current situation, acknowledge your role in creating the restrictive circumstances and consider what you can do to change your long-term trajectory. A setback is not a failing grade; it’s a clarification of lessons you have yet to learn."
scorpio,2017-10-11,"Awesome possibilities are appearing everywhere you look now, but they all seem to be just beyond your reach. You might overreact and try to grab an opportunity anyhow, only to miss your chance because your imagined sense of urgency disrupts your balance. You could work yourself into a state of frenzy today, especially if you fear the potential of the moment will pass you by. Fortunately, you can shift the energy by simply allowing yourself more time to respond. Just breathe; life goes on."
sagittarius,2017-10-11,"External circumstances seem to be leaning on you in a way that makes you uncomfortable now. For example, you may be reluctant to participate in a new work project today, and end up pushing back in order to establish your boundaries. Unfortunately, you might ultimately be required to join the parade anyhow, even if you’re ambivalent about its purpose. It’s more important to keep the peace than to create a conflict over an issue that won’t matter in the long run. Author Fredrik Nael wrote, “It takes both sides to build a bridge.”"
capricorn,2017-10-11,"Decision-making could be a piece of cake today, especially if  you are clear about your goals. Although you might have very strong opinions about a particular situation, it’s challenging to connect them with the bigger picture. In fact, you may follow your instincts now, only to later realize that you’ve complicated your work. Nevertheless, don’t succumb to fear; your concerns about self-sabotage are unwarranted. Do what feels right in your heart and deal with the consequences as they manifest. It’s better to keep your options open than your eyes closed."
aquarius,2017-10-11,"A disagreement with a partner won’t be solved today by putting a bandage on it. You need to reexamine your beliefs and possibly modify your position on a complex matter of mutual interest. Money or shared property may be at the root of the current conflict as a delay prompts you to blame the other person. Unfortunately, there will be no winner if either of you feels like a loser, so you must take the high road by seeking a solution that works for everyone. Author Jonathan Lockwood Huie wrote, “Forgive others, not because they deserve forgiveness, but because you deserve peace.”"
pisces,2017-10-11,"You may be handed a specific list of unfinished tasks today without any warning. Unfortunately, you don’t know what to do because you can’t spread yourself any thinner. Nevertheless, you run the risk of eliciting an angry response if you just say no. A delicate situation requires your finesse in order to avoid an unproductive and unnecessary conflict. Expressing your support for another person’s goals doesn’t mean you must adopt them as your own. Columnist Irma Kurtz wrote, “Givers need to set limits because takers rarely do.”"
aries,2017-10-12,"You may be licking your wounds over a past misunderstanding but, thankfully, your recovery is steady now. Your analysis of recent events can leave you feeling discouraged, but your assessment of the current situation reveals progress today. Although you might still feel wary, you can’t help but rebuild your confidence as the day wears on. Your willingness to see your predicament from someone else’s point of view enables you to widen your perspective. Poet Mildred Barthel wrote, “Happiness is a conscious choice, not an automatic response.”"
taurus,2017-10-12,"You don’t appreciate it when others interfere with your established routine. However, someone’s suggestions might actually make sense today, and heeding their advice is wise, even if it’s a step into uncertainty. Thankfully, steady Saturn grounds you with its cooperative sextile to Mercury in your 6th House of Habits. Sometimes, overturning the status quo can lead to a vast improvement on the old way of operating. Guru Ram Dass said, “Without remaining open to change, we cannot remain open to life.”"
gemini,2017-10-12,"Your emotional attachment to the past is emphasized now if someone in the present moment reminds you of an old friend or lover. You quickly slip into a daydream to replay scenes from your life story. However, you may encounter more than you bargained for as other memories flood into your awareness, luring you away from your current obligations. Fortunately, you possess the ability to override your propensity to fantasize today. Businessman Jack Welch said, “Face reality as it is, not as it was or as you wish it to be.”"
cancer,2017-10-12,"Making progress at work is an uphill battle when you must frequently interrupt your regular tasks to solve a problem. Thankfully, solutions arrive effortlessly today, but not until you go through the motions of deconstructing the dilemma and constructing a better plan. Your only adversary is your own self-doubt; giving yourself a quick pep talk motivates you to dismiss any negative thinking. Anthropologist Carlos Castaneda wrote, “We either make ourselves miserable or we make ourselves strong. The amount of work is the same.”"
leo,2017-10-12,"You rarely mind being in the spotlight, even though it seems instinctive to keep your feelings undercover today. In fact, it is your ability to subdue your emotions that empowers you to present your ideas in a clear and succinct manner now. All types of communication are more effective as long as you maintain an unwavering commitment to remaining objective. Demonstrating your respect for opinions different than yours cultivates a stronger connection with others."
virgo,2017-10-12,"You can muddle your way through a complex tangle of emotions today by focusing your attention on the past. Paradoxically, your retrospection enables you to calculate your trajectory. However, you must be careful or you could miss a hazard in the road ahead. Thankfully, there is a simple remedy to your dilemma: keep one eye on the rearview mirror and the other on the path in front of you. Time traveling in your mind expands your perspective and gives you more choices in the present moment."
libra,2017-10-12,"You take your responsibilities quite seriously today. You feel empowered with the authority you need to lay down the law as taskmaster Saturn offers a helping hand to messenger Mercury. However, it’s smarter to lead by example rather than by demanding obedience. In the long run, you will accomplish more if you inspire others rather than impress them. Motivational speaker Brad Montague said, “Be somebody who makes everybody feel like a somebody.”"
scorpio,2017-10-12,"You might rather watch a documentary today than star in one. Interactive Mercury is hiding in your 12th House of Privacy, urging you to remain quiet while austere Saturn approves of your introverted behavior. Gathering information is more useful than dispersing it now, and your research could pay off sooner than you think. Nevertheless, don’t lose sight of the relationship between your current due diligence and the implications it will have down the road. Inventor George Washington Carver wrote, “Education is the key to unlock the golden door of freedom.”"
sagittarius,2017-10-12,"You’re so involved with the pressing issues of the day that you can’t envision a simple way out of your dilemma. Instead of pushing for a solution, a temporary retreat may be in order now so you can contemplate your situation. Exploring alternative strategies gives you a sense of power and prepares you to react quickly to the changing circumstances today. However, having too many choices is just as overwhelming and can hinder your actions. Bruce Lee said, “Your level of success is determined by your level of discipline and perseverance.”"
capricorn,2017-10-12,"You are preoccupied with the hopes and dreams of others today, and may have trouble concentrating on your own.

Opera singer Jessye Norman said, “Problems arise in that one has to find a balance between what people need from you and what you need for yourself.”"
aquarius,2017-10-12,"Your daydreams are less fantasies now than a process by which you create a map into the future.

Luckily, the meticulous Cancer Moon is camped out in your 6th House of Details, motivating you to achieve your goals. Don’t be concerned if progress is slow as long as you’re not losing ground.

Entertainer Eddie Cantor quipped, “It takes twenty years to make an overnight success.”"
aries,2017-10-13,"The weekend can’t come soon enough, especially if your work has piled up to the point of it being overwhelming. Nevertheless, you don’t have the power to freeze the clock. Forget about taking off early; there are too many loose ends that you can’t leave untied. Fortunately, there’s no reason to worry about missing out on the fun when you will have the opportunity to make up for lost time later on. Author M.H. McKee wrote, “Wisdom is knowing the right path to take; integrity is taking it.”"
taurus,2017-10-13,"Someone might demand that you explain your role in a recent problem at work, and they won’t stop pestering you until you respond. However, you don’t like being pressured under any circumstances, especially when you’re not the one to blame. Nevertheless, pushing back won’t necessarily achieve the desired result today. Your smartest move may be to drop your pride at the door and simply state your case. No expectations, no disappointments."
gemini,2017-10-13,"Your to-do list has grown long and complicated, but you don’t mind because it gives you a chance to keep your options open. However, too many choices -- even if they seem wonderful-- can be so confusing you can’t pick one. Although it may not seem natural, a cautious approach to your work schedule could be just what you need. Finish what’s already started before taking on any additional tasks. Trust that an ending is followed by a beginning."
cancer,2017-10-13,"You’re concerned with the fundamentals today, like managing your money or maintaining your car. However, this orientation toward the material world is symbolic of a deeper need to take care of your inner world. Your spiritual pursuits might not be obvious to others now, but they are a significant factor in your current search for contentment.

Nobel laureate Dr. Linus Pauling said, “Satisfaction of one’s curiosity is one of the greatest sources of happiness in life.”"
leo,2017-10-13,"You are buzzing like a honeybee in a field of wildflowers on a sunny summer day. The playful Leo Moon urges you to enjoy the moment in all its glory. However, you’re unable to shake off your responsibilities today, even if you've already exceeded other people’s expectations. You don’t get to rest on your laurels as long as there are more blossoms that need to be pollinated. Tom Petty said, “No matter how long you play the guitar, there’s always something else to learn.”"
virgo,2017-10-13,"You light up when you dream of your performance as the star of the show. However, you also contract with fear at the thought of being on stage in front of so many people you don’t know. Nevertheless, you have a job to do and are committed to accomplishing it. Magically, something happens while you’re playing your part and your anxiety vanishes into thin air. Lao Tzu wrote, “Those who flow as life flows know they need no other force.”"
libra,2017-10-13,"Your friends may refer to you as the hostess with the most-est today. You can anticipate what others want and often manifest it before they even ask. However, it’s important to question your own motives by asking if your actions are truly in the best interest of others. It’s possible that your desire for personal growth could overshadow everything else in your world now. Ultimately, your intentions are of less concern as long as your behavior improves the wellbeing of all."
scorpio,2017-10-13,"Don’t let your optimism fool you today. Although your efforts at work will likely be rewarded, the road to success is not a paved highway. The proud Leo Moon illuminates your 10th House of Career, reflecting your need to be acknowledged professionally.

In the final analysis, your intuition will offer your best guidance. Quiet your mind and listen to your inner voice."
sagittarius,2017-10-13,"The cosmos is on your side today, supporting your cause by making your best efforts sparkle and shine. Although the sky is the limit now, you can’t just reach out and grab a distant star. Karmic Saturn's presence is a long-term reminder that no shortcuts are allowed when it comes to manifesting your dreams. Thankfully, if you show up and do the work, the wind will fill your sails and you will successfully reach your destination. Direction is more important than speed; many are going nowhere fast."
capricorn,2017-10-13,"Your self-confidence could land you in trouble today if you don’t verify all of the facts. Unfortunately, seeing reality clearly isn’t as straightforward as you wish. Each and every piece of information that comes your way needs to be assessed on its own merit now, without bias. Don’t wait until it’s too late; assume everything is fiction until proven factual. Saint Augustine wrote, “The truth is like a lion; you don’t have to defend it. Let it loose; it will defend itself.”"
aquarius,2017-10-13,"It’s annoying when someone close to you makes such a big deal about nothing at all. The melodramatic Leo Moon floats through your 7th House of Companions, making others appear more needy than ever. However, you aren’t interested in theatrics now; you just want to establish a new set of goals and embark on your journey of accomplishment. Dr. Nido Qubein wrote, “Your present circumstances don’t determine where you can go; they merely determine where you start.”"
pisces,2017-10-13,"You don’t mind jumping through a few hoops at work today, as long as your contribution is recognized and rewarded.

You might be required to log some overtime hours as you ramp up your effort to stabilize your place in the world. Race car driver Mario Andretti said, “Circumstances may cause interruptions and delays, but never lose sight of your goal.”"
aries,2017-10-14,"Twinges of uncertainty float through your awareness today as you make plans for your future. Although you Rams may be the most independent sign of the zodiac, you can’t escape the fact that there are others in your life who you depend upon. Instead of focusing on your needs alone, open your heart to the feelings of those closest to you, too. Thankfully, you can see love from both sides now as romantic Venus dances into your 7th House of Relationships. Elizabeth Lesser wrote, “Look for a way to lift someone up. And if that’s all you do, that’s enough.”"
taurus,2017-10-14,"Your approach to the finer things in life is pretty simple; you let your senses be the judge of what you like and what you don’t. Although you can be quite decisive when evaluating a person or an experience, it becomes harder to reach a conclusion after your key planet Venus soars into ambivalent Libra. Your uncertainty may be confusing to others, but you need to follow your own inner guidance now, postponing your final decision until you weigh all the pros and cons. Don’t let anyone rush you; honor your methodical process, even if it seems to have a mind of its own."
gemini,2017-10-14,"Behaving in a practical manner seems to be growing more difficult day by day. You can step through your logical analysis as you consider how to respond to others, only to make a last-minute decision that comes from your heart and not your head. In fact, you may be so sure of your choice that you can retroactively compile a list of all the reasons that justify your actions. Trusting your feelings is commendable as long as you don’t succumb to irrational fear. Novelist Zelda Fitzgerald said, “Nobody has ever measured, not even poets, how much the heart can hold.”"
cancer,2017-10-14,"You know what you want to say, but your words might not convey your intended thoughts. Although the problem may appear to be with the receiver, you could be inadvertently contributing to the confusion today. Don’t hold back; your sensitivity to someone else’s feelings can prompt you to water down your message. Instead of assuming people understand your position, ask them for feedback now. Stephen Covey wrote, “Most people do not listen with the intent to understand; they listen with the intent to reply.”"
leo,2017-10-14,"The Golden Rule is based on the concept of reciprocity; treat others as you want to be treated. Unfortunately, there could be a surprise in the relationship between cause and effect today. You might go out of your way to be extra nice to someone who doesn’t respond in kind. However, an unexpected twist in the plot of your day doesn’t mean you should change tactics. A generous gesture isn’t really generous if it’s based on your expectation of getting something in return. The Dalai Lama said, “The root of happiness is altruism -- the wish to be of service to others.”"
virgo,2017-10-14,"You may try to accomplish more than is possible today because it seems like you’re running out of time. Your feelings might cool as sweet Venus leaves your earthy sign for the heady skies of airy Libra. However, this change of pressure in emotional atmosphere can work in your favor if you haven’t already written the next scene of your movie. Temporarily set your preferences aside and wait to see what the cosmos offers you. Once you know where your path is leading, your choices will be clearly evident."
libra,2017-10-14,"Although you aren’t necessarily home free, you are pleased that a weight seems to be lifting from your shoulders. You might still have to follow through on a previous commitment, but the light at the end of the tunnel is finally getting brighter now that your key planet Venus returns to your sign. Changing circumstances contribute to your growing pleasure, but so does your newfound flexibility. It’s easier to smile when you’re not so fussy about what you want. Nevertheless, establishing your limits improves your chances of finding happiness."
scorpio,2017-10-14,"You’re still adjusting to a new outlook on life and you’re not ready to share your thoughts yet. You can tell that your values are shifting now, but you don’t know where your final priorities will end up. In the meantime, continue to put your best foot forward, even if your previous destination has lost its glimmer. Acknowledging that you’re in a time of transformation relieves the pressure of having to finalize your plans. As with many things in nature, your process will unfold at its own rate."
sagittarius,2017-10-14,"You may be so fascinated with a particular place today that you cannot get it out of your mind. Naturally, you travel-prone Archers aim your thoughts at distant targets and sometimes are lucky enough to pursue them in the real world. Nevertheless, you enjoy planning a future adventure once magnetic Venus moves into your 11th House of Friends. Sharing your dreams with a group of like-minded people inspires you to turn your fantasies into reality."
capricorn,2017-10-14,"Making time to network within your community is crucial today, but not just because you enjoy the camaraderie. You also want to be part of a larger scene outside of your social sphere. Fortunately, charming Venus enters your 10th House of Status, creating favorable circumstances in the outer world and drawing powerful people into your orbit. For example, you could meet someone socially who is able to help you professionally. Nevertheless, it’s best to enjoy an interaction for what it is in the moment, rather than encumbering it with your expectations. Your authenticity is your best selling point."
aquarius,2017-10-14,"You want to step outside of your regular routine to partake in an enjoyable experience that you can add to your scrapbook of memories. Although your current desires might not seem out of character to your closest friends, they may think it odd if you make a big commotion out of your wishes now. Nevertheless, your attraction to other cultures and new ideas can be slightly obsessive while indulgent Venus influences your 9th House of Big Ideas. Have fun exploring the possibilities, wherever your dreams might take you. Author William Arthur Ward wrote, “Curiosity is the wick in the candle of learning.”"
pisces,2017-10-14,"Your chores might be the defining factor of your day, but they won’t detract from your inner work. You can do everything just right today, amazing your friends and family with your ability to deliver on your promises. However, they may not realize you’re suppressing darker feelings because your smile is so bright. Ironically, the potential for healing is possible as long as you can see beyond your point of view. Nevertheless, you need to take the scary step of revealing your emotional process to someone you trust. Sharing your struggles is good for your heart."
aries,2017-10-15,"Imagine your surprise if a mild-mannered friend says something so outrageous you can barely catch your breath. Ironically, you’re often the one whose impulsive actions shock others, but today the tables are turned. Instead of trying to make sense of something that just doesn’t fit into your existing frame of reference, step through the opening and explore what’s on the other side. Author Dan Brown wrote, “Sometimes a change of perspective is all it takes to see the light.”"
taurus,2017-10-15,"An unanticipated reversal of direction at work could shock your system at first, but you quickly readjust when you realize the potential of the new situation. Or, perhaps, something else that you didn’t bargain for occurs today, eliciting a similar sense of surprise. In any event, you must acknowledge and accept the changes that are beyond your control or you’ll end up frustrated and angry. Eckhart Tolle wrote, “To offer no resistance to life is to be in a state of grace, ease and lightness.”"
gemini,2017-10-15,"You're not one to suffer from boredom, and you’re anxious to supercharge your creativity now. Stagnating behind a dam can be disheartening, especially when you know what it’s like to ride the wild rapids on a free-flowing river. Thankfully, obstructions suddenly fall away today, awakening your ingenuity and clearing a path for your imagination to work its magic. Albert Einstein wrote, “Innovation is not the product of logical thought, even though the final product is tied to a logical structure.”"
cancer,2017-10-15,"You want to clear the air by talking about a sensitive issue today. But your thoughts might not see the light of day if someone cuts you off with an inconsiderate retort before you even finish a sentence. Nevertheless, you don’t need to follow your self-protective instincts now and give up. This is a test to see if you can separate your current experience from the memories connected with old fears. The shadows of your past need not darken the doorway to your future."
leo,2017-10-15,"You may feel as if you’re in a tug of war with people who are disagreeing with your assessment of the current situation. However, it’s confusing when others use vague opinions and philosophical generalities to counter your specific points of concern. Unfortunately, you cannot participate in a fair debate unless both sides stick to the facts. Most likely, there is a deeper conflict that is contributing to the dissonance now -- and it’s there you must explore. President Thomas Jefferson wrote, “Difference of opinion leads to inquiry, and inquiry to the truth.”"
virgo,2017-10-15,"It seems as if someone is deliberately pushing your buttons today, and you don’t like it. You might become overwhelmed by your feelings once the Moon shifts into your sign, but you have the ability to remain calm rather than being swept away in an emotional tidal wave. Allowing yourself to fall victim to your own fears won’t help the situation. Although it’s easy to control your thoughts, it’s not possible to simply turn off your emotions. Keeping your head above water is much easier now if you can maintain a rational perspective."
libra,2017-10-15,"You are preoccupied by an imbalance in relationship dynamics if someone suddenly behaves out of character today. You assume their unexplainable actions are symptomatic of an unexpressed issue, but you don’t yet know the details. In absence of the facts, your mind is likely to run wild now, filling in the picture with your own fears. Unfortunately, your thoughts could spin out of control unless you nip the problem in the bud. You cannot change what you refuse to confront."
scorpio,2017-10-15,"A startling turn of events can be precipitated by a friend’s sudden disclosure. Your routine may be turned inside out as you ride to the rescue. Naturally, you will lend your support however you can, even though you might wish to stay at home. Mischievous Mercury in your 12th House of Invisibility encourages your reclusive needs now, but its opposition to wild Uranus in your 6th House of Service has a much different agenda for you. Buckle up and enjoy the ride, for you’re on a trajectory that is beyond your control. Let go and let live."
sagittarius,2017-10-15,"You are capable of singularly focusing your intentions on a specific chore today, even if distractions call from every direction. It’s as if your current penchant for concentrating on one task at a time is your defense against the urge to join your friends in a day of fun. Naturally, you want to play, but the Moon’s visit to hardworking Virgo and your 10th House of Responsibility reflects your need to do the right thing rather than the enjoyable thing. Sometimes delaying instant gratification enables you to experience long-term satisfaction."
capricorn,2017-10-15,"You think your words carry extra weight today, but your authority could disappear in a flash if others choose to ignore you anyway. You may find yourself in an unwinnable argument with a family member or, perhaps, your parenting skills might be called into question if you’re dealing with a difficult child. An autocratic approach only makes matters worse now, giving others good reason to rebel. The solution is to talk it out, but make sure you do more than your fair share of listening. It's amazing what you can learn when you open your ears and close your mouth."
aquarius,2017-10-15,"Your friends’ irreverent ideas sound like music to your ears today. The further out of the box someone’s plan, the more you are drawn to it. Thankfully, you haven’t lost all of your ability to reason now, prompting you to do your research. Unconventional Uranus zaps logical Mercury in your 9th House of Adventure, inspiring you to think in a way that breaks the mold. Quantum physicist Niels Bohr once told a graduate student, “Your theory is crazy, but it’s not crazy enough to be true.”"
pisces,2017-10-15,"Oddly enough, a disagreement over finances may actually be about something else. Although a disruptive Mercury-Uranus opposition triggers your money houses today, this particular conflict might stem from a clash of core values. But rather than focusing on the differences, it’s more constructive to establish common ground now. You don’t have to be on the same side of every issue; you only need to be heading in the same direction."
aries,2017-10-16,"Your responsibilities are clearly defined today and you can’t wait to get to work. Ironically, it doesn’t even matter whether you enjoy your job; you are simply excited about establishing priorities and completing tasks one at a time. You possess an uncanny level of concentration now that is boosted by a pragmatic Sun-Saturn sextile. Fortunately, there is a direct cause-and-effect relationship between your efforts and your accomplishments. Karma delivers in mysterious ways."
taurus,2017-10-16,"You are a master at work as you meticulously transform your plan into reality today. Your steady approach is amplified by ambitious Saturn’s connection with the Sun in your 6th House of Employment. People know they can rely on your word; if you say you’ll do something, there’s no question you will come through with the goods. However, you could get so distracted by a trivial detail now that you lose sight of your overall goal. Pay attention to your progress moment by moment while keeping one eye on the distant horizon."
gemini,2017-10-16,"You want nothing more than to please your boss now and are willing to work extra hard to demonstrate your diligence. The radiant Sun in people-pleasing Libra harmonizes with demanding Saturn, requiring you to go the extra mile in order to shine your brightest. But don’t get lazy and fall back on your charm as a substitute for blood, sweat and tears. Author Jack Canfield wrote, “There is only one person responsible for the quality of your life. That person is you.”"
cancer,2017-10-16,"You are torn between hard work and no work today. The pleasure-seeking Libra Sun tempts you to put up your feet and kick back, even if there are plenty of chores calling your name now. But the Sun’s non-negotiable alignment with dutiful Saturn in your 6th House of Logistics reminds you that it’s disrespectful not to show up when others expect you to hold up your end of the deal. Unfortunately, you can’t call it quits until you meet your obligations. Author Seth Godin writes, “Keep starting until you finish.”"
leo,2017-10-16,"You can make your super-packed schedule work smoothly today by sticking to it with no exceptions. But everything is so tightly booked that it could quickly fall apart as soon as you add any extraneous activities. However, practicing self-discipline enables you to accomplish an amazing amount of work. Ultimately, your success depends upon creating a realistic agenda. Warren Buffet said, “I don’t look to jump over seven-foot bars; I look around for one-foot bars that I can step over.”"
virgo,2017-10-16,"You take your work quite seriously today because you don’t want to be distracted by irrelevant matters. You’re clear about your values and committed to acting in accordance with them. However, the fussy Virgo Moon encourages you to be so focused on the minutiae that you may lose sight of the big picture. Thankfully, common sense prevails because realistic Saturn requires you to be practical over anything else. It’s been said that life is like a cup of tea; it’s all in how you make it."
libra,2017-10-16,"Your reputation for accommodating others often precedes you, but you can be a force to be reckoned with when necessary. You are wielding an iron fist in a velvet glove today as heavyweight Saturn adds a sense of authority to the diplomatic Libra Sun. Anyone who mistakenly thinks you are a pushover will quickly discover that they are dealing with a master strategist. You possess an intuitive understanding of how an action can influence a trajectory of events into the future. Author Doe Zantamata wrote, “Your intuition is the most honest friend that you will ever have.”"
scorpio,2017-10-16,"You are trying to budget your time extremely carefully today, since you need to make observable progress on a project to satisfy your boss. Unfortunately, the picture others see doesn’t tell the whole story while the Sun is shining in your 12th House of Secrets. Paradoxically, the harder you try to please someone else now, the greater the potential for failure. Continue on your present course without worrying about falling short of anyone’s expectations. Journalist Jim Watkins said, “A river cuts through rock, not because of its power, but because of its persistence.”"
sagittarius,2017-10-16,"You might believe there is only one true path to success yet you cannot tell whether or not you are on it. The exacting Virgo Moon urges you to analyze all the choices before picking the best one. Meanwhile, the open-ended Libra Sun supports nearly any rational decision you make today as it sextiles shrewd Saturn in your 1st House of Self. However, once you choose your direction, you must swiftly set out on your journey. Act now or forever hold your peace."
capricorn,2017-10-16,"Your objectives are so specific now that it’s easy to gauge your progress. There’s no doubt that you’re on track, but you may wish you were closer to fulfilling your ambitions. Don’t get hung up about the timing of your success; just keep on marching forward with a determined confidence today. As long as you stay focused on your primary intention, you’ll arrive at your destination sooner than you think. Author Jim Rohn wrote, “Discipline is the bridge between goals and accomplishment.”"
aquarius,2017-10-16,"You gain strength from interacting with your peers today, especially if you are willing to let them help you. Fortunately, the people-oriented Libra Sun cooperates with stabilizing Saturn in your 11th House of Groups, creating a strong interdependence between you and your teammates. Unfortunately, it’s not always easy to get along with others, but you can learn from their constructive criticism. Sufficient self-assurance enables you to truly listen to feedback, especially if it’s not what you want to hear. Goethe wrote, “To accept good advice is but to increase one’s own ability.”"
pisces,2017-10-16,"Your altruistic ideals and high standards can limit your choices at work now. Opportunities may open up that are in conflict with your personal code of ethics, requiring you to get in touch with your moral compass. But don’t fret if you have to decline due to a conflict with your life’s purpose; serving the wrong master will only create heartache in the long run. There’s no reason to deviate from your prime directive even if another goal seems more lucrative. Rumi wrote, “Whatever purifies you is the right path.”"
aries,2017-10-17,"Although you have a detailed list of everything you want to accomplish today, it’s an uphill battle to make as much progress as you wish. Normally, whenever you run into an obstacle, you simply regroup and try again. However, the resistance likely comes from within now, as your tumultuous feelings get in your own way. Managing your frustration from the beginning is crucial or you might end up dealing with the results of misplaced anger. Deepak Chopra teaches, “Negative emotions are like unwelcome guests. Just because they show up on our doorstep doesn’t mean they have a right to stay.”"
taurus,2017-10-17,"You could feel blindsided if a close friend or associate’s temper boils over today. Their negativity isn’t necessarily directed at you, but you can’t help but take it personally, anyway. Although your feelings may run amok, at least the atmosphere will clear once the reflective Moon shifts into peace-seeking Libra and your 6th House of Employment, enabling you to get back to work. Novelist Susan Wiggs wrote, “Unexpected change is like a breath of fresh air -- a little brisk at first, but magic for the body and soul.”"
gemini,2017-10-17,"Overbooking your day’s agenda is a familiar problem for you overactive Twins. However, you might have stretched the limit too far. You may try to cover your scheduling mess by rushing around even faster now, assuming you can still complete everything in a timely manner. Unfortunately, this ambitious strategy won’t likely save the day. Ultimately, concentrating on one task at a time is more efficient than spreading yourself too thin. Put your life back in balance by admitting you can’t be in two places at once."
cancer,2017-10-17,"You want to see the visible results of your efforts right away, but circumstances beyond your control prevent you from completing the task at hand today. Unfortunately, an unfinished project doesn’t produce the impact you seek, leaving you with little to show for your work. Fortunately, your natural tenacity rides to the rescue now, inspiring you to persist as long as necessary. The initial deadline might come and go, but your unrelenting desire to achieve a positive outcome all but ensures your ultimate satisfaction."
leo,2017-10-17,"You believe that you can run any race successfully today, but your self-confidence might set you up for a swift disappointment. Aiming for ambitious objectives motivates you to work harder, but you could exhaust yourself before you reach the finish line if your goals are unattainable. Arthur Ashe said, “The doing is often more important than the outcome.” Nevertheless, it’s helpful to remember that you’re running a marathon, not a sprint."
virgo,2017-10-17,"Getting something off your chest sounds like a good idea today -- until you open your mouth and begin talking. Unfortunately, it’s easier to start the conversational ball rolling than to stop it once it’s in motion. If you have been withholding your feelings because you didn’t want to upset someone, you could unleash a tirade of emotions before you even realize what happened. Once Pandora’s box has been opened, you can’t reverse the effects. Samuel J. Hurwitt wrote, “Never trust your tongue when your heart is bitter.”"
libra,2017-10-17,"When you inform others that everything is wonderful today, you might actually be convinced you’re telling the truth. However, your smile may be hiding anger that is lurking just below the threshold of your awareness. Exploring your inner world now could uncover subconscious feelings you didn’t know existed. Although courage is required to begin this journey of self-discovery, the Moon’s alignment with sweet Venus indicates that peace of mind is much closer than you think. Greek essayist Plutarch wrote, “What we achieve inwardly will change outer reality.”"
scorpio,2017-10-17,"The most regimented and orderly parts of your life are the targets of your strategic rebellion today. You are willing to plot your course against the grain in an attempt to release pent-up tension. However, communicator Mercury colludes with boisterous Jupiter in your passionate sign, prompting you to believe that happiness can be yours if you take radical action to remove the obstacles in your path. Unfortunately, your unrestrained behavior could create more damage than you expect. Confucius warns us, “When anger rises, think of the consequences.”"
sagittarius,2017-10-17,"You’re playing to win today and you’re unwilling to settle for second place. The Moon’s conjunction with warrior Mars fuels your aspirations and inspires you to fight for what you want. However, competition won’t contribute as much to your progress now as cooperation. Success isn’t about being better than anyone else; it’s about being better than you were before. Author Michael P. Watson wrote, “Strong people don’t put others down. They lift them up.”"
capricorn,2017-10-17,"Your ambitions are motivated by inner emotional turmoil now. You may attempt to counterbalance your uneasy restlessness by pursuing the thrill of accomplishment. Unfortunately, the excitement of the moment only offers fleeting satisfaction. Meanwhile, cerebral Mercury joins propitious Jupiter in your 11th House of Long-Term Goals, inviting you to set your sites on a more enduring result. Ask yourself if what you’re doing today is getting you closer to where you want to be tomorrow."
aquarius,2017-10-17,"You are plotting your course to success and won’t be satisfied until you achieve world domination. Although you could become obsessed with your unrealistic goal now, there is a deeper truth that is gnawing away in the back of your mind. You possess the ability to distinguish yourself professionally while clever Mercury and fortuitous Jupiter conspire in your 10th House of Status. Maria Robinson wrote, “Nobody can go back and start a new beginning, but anyone can start today and make a new ending.”"
pisces,2017-10-17,"People seem extra touchy today, like they could lose their temper with only the slightest provocation. You’re stepping through an emotional minefield and it’s hard to tell if everyone is truly acting as they feel now, or if you’re doing something to push them over the edge. Either way, it’s disconcerting to have anyone’s anger directed at you. Rather than engaging in fearful negativity, you can elevate the conversation by showing respect, even to someone who hasn’t earned it. Former First Lady Michelle Obama said, “When they go low, we go high.”"
aries,2017-10-18,"You’re all too willing to cut a person some slack today, but not just to be nice. One-to-one relationships are cast into the spotlight now, requiring you to consider another person’s point of view and not only your own. Meanwhile, an intensely fierce Mercury-Jupiter conjunction encourages you to maintain a positive attitude at any cost -- even if you must overlook reality. Thankfully, you possess the determination to push past your resistance and seek the truth that’s hiding in the dark. Ram Dass teaches, “The shadow is the greatest teacher for how to come to the light.”"
taurus,2017-10-18,"People seem to think they can put one over on you today, but you’re more perceptive than they realize. Chatty Mercury joins jovial Jupiter in your 7th House of Others, bringing you an opportunity that looks too good to believe. Unfortunately, the truth is a moveable feast as a friend or associate uses imagination rather than the facts to tell a story. It’s unwise to make a decision based on what you hear. Instead, rely on your direct observations for guidance now. Historian Daniel J. Boorstin said, “The greatest enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of knowledge.”"
gemini,2017-10-18,"At first glance, a new idea feels like a breath of fresh air today. However, the sparkle fades upon deeper examination, leaving you with a dull ache of disappointment. You don’t know whether to reengage with hopeful thoughts of salvaging something useful from this inspiration or if you should just let it go. Ironically, the more intensely you are motivated to pursue the possibility now, the wiser you are to opt out while you still can. Publisher Malcolm Forbes wrote, “How to succeed: try hard enough. How to fail: try too hard.”"
cancer,2017-10-18,"You are dead serious about being playful today. In fact, you might try to schedule your spontaneity if you thought it was possible. The truth is you are more likely to act on a whim if you’re already taking a planned break. In any event, you will be happier when you communicate your feelings through some kind of creative expression, whether or not it is productive. Theologian Thomas Merton wrote, “Art enables us to find ourselves and lose ourselves at the same time.”"
leo,2017-10-18,"Reminiscing isn’t an escape from the present, but rather a way to bring the past back to life as you create the future. Any memories that enter your awareness now are signposts that help you navigate through the backroads of your imagination. Reflecting on your inner life enables you to describe your outer world. You are on a quest to transform your dreams into reality. Poet William Blake wrote, ""What is now proved was once only imagined."""
virgo,2017-10-18,"Although you fully enjoy your time with coworkers, you might not be as productive as you wish today. Actually, you’re probably having too much fun to worry about your responsibilities while you’re caught up in the intellectual feeding frenzy of the moment. But more is going on than meets the eye now. The fast repartee and clever witticisms are only the fabric upon which ideas are being exchanged. However, you’re more intrigued in applying information that leads to something tangible. Author Aldous Huxley wrote, “Dream in a pragmatic way.”"
libra,2017-10-18,"You say what you mean today, and you surely mean what you say. Verbose Mercury converses with opinionated Jupiter in your 2nd House of Values, urging you to talk about your fundamental beliefs. Although you’re not necessarily trying to sell your point of view, you’re also not interested in adopting anyone else’s. Unfortunately, others could quickly become defensive when facing your rigid attitude and extreme enthusiasm. Lead by example instead of wasting time on artful persuasion. Martin Luther King Jr. taught, “We must learn to live together as brothers or perish together as fools.”"
scorpio,2017-10-18,"Your relentless passion goes a long way to get the ball rolling today, but there must be real substance to your ideas or you will be left unsatisfied. Logical Mercury conspires with philosophical Jupiter in your 1st House of Personality, leading you to examine what it really means to be your authentic self. In theory, you like the idea of putting your best foot forward but, in practice, you don’t want to lose the spontaneity of your interactions with others. Philosopher Alan Watts wrote, “The real you is not a puppet which life pushes around; the real, deep down you is the whole universe.”"
sagittarius,2017-10-18,"It might be easier for you to talk with angels today than it is with your next-door neighbors. You can relate to conscious wisdom in whatever form it arrives now, regardless of the source. In fact, even a possible dimensional gap won’t negatively impact a meaningful friendship. An inspired Mercury-Jupiter conjunction stimulates your 12th House of Spirituality, revealing intriguing messages that arise from your subconscious. Albert Einstein said, “The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and science.”"
capricorn,2017-10-18,"You see yourself as one of the dreamers today, but your departure from reality has a specific purpose. You’re on a mission now as you weave the fibers of your imagination together with the threads of the real world to produce a rich tapestry that adorns your life. However, your thoughts are aimed at the future while you still attempt to maintain the status quo. There seems to be an ever-widening scope which encompasses your vision of things to come. The trick is to live fully in the present moment while still daring to dream."
aquarius,2017-10-18,"You have big plans when it comes to your career now, but you could over-inflate a brilliant idea to the point that it becomes unwieldy and unmanageable. Rather than watching your best scheme spin out of control today, rein it in while you still can. Ruthless pruning is an investment in the clarity of your future. It’s much easier to cut back before the new growth establishes structural integrity. Setting realistic targets is the most reliable tactic for reaching an unrealistic dream."
pisces,2017-10-18,"You can see further now than before because you’re standing upon a mountaintop and your vision is unobstructed. It’s as if you designed and built a metaphysical tower comprised of ingenious thoughts and innovative ideas -- and you’ve scaled this structure as high as it allows. Although expansive vistas of possibilities spread out before you today, it will all be for naught unless you’re ready to take a calculated risk. Gold medalist Gail Devers said, “Every accomplishment starts with the decision to try.”"
aries,2017-10-19,"You want to be in a relationship just as much as you long for your autonomy. The Libra New Moon emphasizes your 7th House of Partnerships, encouraging you to balance your needs with someone else’s. However, its opposition to independent Uranus in your 1st House of Self brings the primary focus back to you. Finding common ground can be the start of a shared journey as long as you believe your freedom isn’t threatened. Compromise requires courage; nothing ventured, nothing gained."
taurus,2017-10-19,"You are eager to do your share of the work, but only if everyone else does the same. The gracious Libra New Moon occurs in your 6th House of Employment, enabling you to play nicely with your coworkers unless you conclude someone is trying to pull the wool over your eyes. You may appear complacent today, but anyone who thinks they can take advantage of you is in for a big surprise. Nevertheless, you’re willing to give others the benefit of the doubt. W. Edwards Deming wrote, “When we cooperate, everybody wins.”"
gemini,2017-10-19,"Your romantic attractions take center stage today, prompting you to share your feelings with someone special. This person -- whether a new acquaintance or your long-time partner -- may be surprised by your sweet overtures. Either way, you’re waxing poetic as the Libra New Moon inspires your 5th House of Self-Expression. However, using all the creative tricks in your bag won’t guarantee the outcome you imagine. Ultimately, setting your expectations aside allows a memorable moment to magically happen on its own. Novelist Amy Tan wrote, “If you can’t change your fate, change your attitude.”"
cancer,2017-10-19,"You hope to gain some peace of mind about the unsettled atmosphere at work. You may be inclined to withdraw from the madness and seek refuge in the comfort of your home. Reminiscing as you reflect on memories is an obvious way to get perspective on the present moment. Fortunately, the Libra New Moon refreshes your 4th House of Security, blessing you with a sense of familiarity. No matter what, don’t dwell in the past; just use your recollections as insight while creating your plans for the future."
leo,2017-10-19,"You are motivated to discuss your position on an unresolved matter of importance with your friends. The Libra New Moon energizes your 3rd House of Communication now, but you’re thinking so fast on your feet that you could jump to a conclusion before you have all the essential facts. Although you’re trying to be fair-minded today, your analysis is more subjective than you realize. Your personal needs warp your logic and bend your reasoning toward your preferred point of view. Remember, truth has no agenda."
virgo,2017-10-19,"Although your relationship with the material world might be unwaveringly stable, your financial situation can change at the drop of a hat now. The Libra New Moon falls in your 2nd House of Resources, reminding you that a balanced budget is a beautiful thing. However, you can’t help but confuse your net worth with your self-worth today, making it tough to address money matters objectively. Unfortunately, relying on others won’t solve your problem because their fiscal circumstances are no more certain than yours. Greek philosopher Heraclitus wrote, “Change is the only constant.”"
libra,2017-10-19,"You might appear cool, calm and collected, but you can’t prevent your thoughts from running around in circles now. Clear thinking often leads to sound decisions, but obsessively playing the same recordings again and again won’t help you find your way out of an endless cycle. Luckily, the Libra New Moon motivates you to put your best foot forward, even if your direction is undetermined at first. Don’t let your lack of certainty slow you down; solid answers will come much quicker than you think. Own your power and your intuition will do the rest."
scorpio,2017-10-19,"You appear to be forthcoming today, but might be keeping the most interesting pieces of information to yourself. The Libra New Moon is operating undercover in your 12th House of Secrets, enabling you to bury your emotions in full view of those around you. However, the deeper you hide your passions, the more dramatic the scene when the lightning strikes and everything is exposed. Instead of waiting for something unexpected to happen, take the reins of control and preemptively turn on the lights."
sagittarius,2017-10-19,"Your personal interactions with others are invigorating today, and you seek them out for the good vibrations they emanate. The people-oriented Libra New Moon creates a buzz in your 11th House of Social Networking, enticing you to engage in conversations with friends about a wide range of subjects. Unfortunately, your words can be unintentionally shocking to your audience, possibly upsetting someone more than you expect. Nevertheless, feel free to speak your truth as you experience it. Alan Watts wrote, “Waking up to who you are requires letting go of who you imagine yourself to be.”"
capricorn,2017-10-19,"You may be obsessed with making yourself known today. The Libra New Moon lands in your 10th House of Authority, inciting you to capitalize on your knowledge and experience. However, an emotional bombshell temporarily destabilizes your home life and disrupts your concentration. Although you must respond to the domestic crisis, don’t take your eyes off your long-term destination. Poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow wrote, “Perseverance is a great element of success. If you only knock long enough and loud enough at the gate, you are sure to wake up somebody.”"
aquarius,2017-10-19,"You are enjoying the panoramic view as you check out the multitude of options spread out before you. You can see all the beautiful possibilities because there are no obstructions anywhere in sight. The Libra New Moon points to your 9th House of Distant Horizons, shifting your awareness from the present moment into the distant future. Gazing forward puts your current activities into a much larger frame of reference. Sometimes all one needs is a change of perspective."
pisces,2017-10-19,"You’re quite flexible most of the time when it comes to getting your needs met. Although the Libra New Moon shadows your 8th House of Deep Sharing now, your values may clash with someone else’s even if you thought you were on the same page. Oddly, you might not understand what’s missing, but you want to know where you stand before making a long-term decision. Getting to the bottom of a mystery shouldn’t be so challenging, but everything is more complicated when there is another person involved."
aries,2017-10-20,"It’s a new day and new rules apply. You have danced around the edge of change while gathering information so you could make the perfect choice. Finally, you can see what is missing now and are ready to commit to a plan that makes sense. However, you might be so certain of your success that you forget your actions impact others as well. Don’t ignore the advice you receive from those you trust the most. Craig D. Lounsbrough wrote, “Truth speaks for itself if we’d just let it speak.”"
taurus,2017-10-20,"It may seem as if people aren’t considering your boundaries today when they attempt to convince you to join their causes. It’s not that you disagree with their positions; it’s just that you don’t like being coerced into taking action before you are ready. The truth is that your priorities may be different and you cannot commit your time to another endeavor without spreading your resources too thin. Fortunately, you have the power -- and the right -- to just say no."
gemini,2017-10-20,"You might good-humoredly agree with others who accuse you of being scattered at times. However, you are as concentrated as the light in a laser beam while three planets conspire in your 6th House of Details today. But filtering out all the extraneous distractions isn’t enough to guarantee your efficiency now. You must also aim at the right target or you could maintain focus while still missing your destination. Roy Disney said, “When your values are clear to you, making decisions becomes easier.”"
cancer,2017-10-20,"You are full of surprises today as you take the lead and initiate a conversation about your feelings. In fact, you’re likely to share more than you intended, which could lead to a very revealing conversation about personal matters. You might open the door to a topic that’s sensitive enough to make you feel uncomfortably vulnerable. Nevertheless, a wave of self-assurance washes right over any hesitation and nudges you into new emotional territory. Don’t waste time looking back or you will miss the opportunity that’s directly in front of you."
leo,2017-10-20,"You may draw an apparently arbitrary line in the sand that prohibits others from getting too close today. Although you state your boundaries clearly, your declaration might unintentionally keep out the wrong person. Make sure you don’t scare off a potential friend or inhibit a potentially powerful conversation with a significant other. In any event, you can increase your self-awareness if you’re willing to shift your analysis from the outer world to the inner realms. Eckhart Tolle wrote, “Being at ease with not knowing is crucial for answers to come to you.”"
virgo,2017-10-20,"Managing your time in a realistic manner is crucial today or your schedule might become quite unhinged. Unfortunately, an ambitious approach to efficiency could lead to an impractical agenda as you attempt to juggle all your commitments and preferences. Instead of trying to fit everything into one day, take a step back and reconsider your priorities. Paradoxically, logic won’t bring you the solution that intuition will. Get out of your head and into your heart before deciding what can be postponed and what can't wait."
libra,2017-10-20,"You may precipitate a financial crisis today, unless you balance your desires with more sensible considerations. A celestial confluence in your 2nd House of Possessions includes excessive Jupiter, encouraging you to satisfy a craving for something beautiful in the form of a material purchase. But think about two things before you buy a glamorous ring or an expensive piece of art. First, ask yourself if you really need it. Second, make certain it is within your budget. Unless both conditions are met, do yourself a favor and keep your wallet in your pocket."
scorpio,2017-10-20,"Your unrelenting passion for an idea or a person might bring uncontainable joy or inconsolable frustration today. However, a triple conjunction of the Moon, Jupiter and Mercury in extreme Scorpio indicates there won’t likely be any middle ground now, unless you watch carefully for the signs as the day unfolds. Nevertheless, it’s unwise to cling to an unrealistic fantasy if you notice a widening gulf between your imagined future and your current reality. Following your dreams comes with a cost."
sagittarius,2017-10-20,"You can call it your karmic destiny or just good old-fashioned luck, but you believe you can’t fail today. Your self-confidence is one of your strong suits, but only if you balance it with a serious dose of humility. Although there’s no reason to go out of your way looking for things to sour, you might miss a critical observation if you’re already convinced that all is perfect. As Leonard Cohen sang, “There is a crack in everything, that’s how the light gets in.”"
capricorn,2017-10-20,"Instead of channeling all your efforts into your action plan for success, you prefer fantasizing about your future now. In fact, you might be ready for a mental holiday, giving yourself permission to set aside your real-world endeavors today. The simple act of hanging out with a few friends enables you to share philosophies, explore metaphysics and delve into the mysteries of the cosmos. Tom Petty wrote, “You belong among the wildflowers. You belong somewhere you feel free.”"
aquarius,2017-10-20,"Only a sense of entitlement can come between you and your previously established goals today. You know the strength of intention and yours is unflappable when the Moon joins auspicious Jupiter and intelligent Mercury in your 10th House of Authority. Whatever you say sets the stage for what happens, so it’s critical to only speak with integrity. Obviously, follow-through is still required. Magic is an equal mixture of wishing and working."
pisces,2017-10-20,"You’re cruising the back roads of your mind, searching for the next big thing in your life. You might be dreaming of a new relationship that takes you to places you’ve never been, or you could be fantasizing about a solo adventure to somewhere exotic. In any case, the key is extending your mental, emotional or physical reach beyond your current bounds as the powerful Scorpio Moon joins journeying Jupiter and mental Mercury in your 9th House of Distant Horizons. You can go as far as you can imagine."
aries,2017-10-21,"If all work and no play really makes Johnny a dull boy, then you are desperately eager for change now. Your key planet Mars is spending its final day in industrious Virgo, motivating you to finish as many incomplete chores as you can. But you want more out of life than the satisfaction of a few more jobs well done; your thirst for knowledge about larger issues is growing and you won’t be happy until you know what makes the universe tick. Albert Einstein quipped, “I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious.”"
taurus,2017-10-21,"You are an intensity magnet today, attracting a variety of emotional melodramas. Although psychological thrillers make fascinating stories, you must be careful not to get so entranced by one that you take it on as your own. Fortunately, you can be a supportive ally while still maintaining your autonomy by practicing self-awareness and creating safe boundaries. Once you slip over the line, it becomes impossible to remain objective and you lose your ability to help a friend sort out the truth. Aesop wrote, “A fair-minded man tries to see both sides of an argument.”"
gemini,2017-10-21,"You may surprise others today with your uncharacteristic ability to finish every little project you start. You are highly motivated to waste less time and work with greater intention while the Moon sheds her light in your 6th House of Habits. You know that a pattern of consistency ends up being more effective than a short burst of supercharged energy. In the long run, you want your efforts to be productive, whether anyone notices what you’re doing or not. President Abraham Lincoln said, “Don’t worry when you are not recognized, but strive to be worthy of recognition.”"
cancer,2017-10-21,"It’s rejuvenating to nurture your soul while you’re in your element and share your experience with someone special today. A watery Scorpio Moon provides the anchor for your swirling passions, offering you emotional stability in the midst of changing interpersonal dynamics. Sometimes you Crustaceans cautiously cling to the past while fearing the future, but now you are ready to explore the possibilities with a trusted companion. Oprah Winfrey said, “When you live with an open heart, unexpected, joyful things happen.”"
leo,2017-10-21,"You are perfectly happy with the idea of being left to your own devices today. Although you’re likely to accept a social invitation, you probably won’t go out of your way to join in a group activity. Fortunately, you’re not lonely when you’re by yourself because your mind is preoccupied with numerous projects that await your attention. Create your own path to fun, even if you’re on a solo mission. Playwright Diane Grant wrote, “It’s better to walk alone than with a crowd going in the wrong direction.”"
virgo,2017-10-21,"You are quietly proud of your recent accomplishments over the past couple of months, but you also know this is no time to rest on your laurels. Irrepressible Mars is kicking it for one more day in your perfectionist sign, giving you an opportunity to make one more concerted push in your drive to mold your vision into reality. There will still be plenty to do in the upcoming weeks, but your initial efforts can quickly take on a more solid form. Pastor Louie Giglio wrote, “You don’t have to know everything about the mountain in front of you to take the next step.”"
libra,2017-10-21,"It’s nearly time to come out of the shadows and step into the light of day. If you have been busy working behind the scenes, your unseen contribution to a cause is about to be celebrated. But you don’t need the public recognition because of an egoistic desire for fame and fortune. Instead, it’s about how acceptance by your peers elevates your confidence, making you feel as if you’re an equal player on the team. Fortunately, your overall productivity increases in relationship to your sense of self-worth. Marilyn Monroe said, “Everyone’s a star and deserves the right to twinkle.”"
scorpio,2017-10-21,"You’re in no mood to be messed with while the evocative Moon reflects the wide spectrum of your emotional experience. You believe you’re the master of your own destiny and you’re taken by surprise if someone throws you off balance today. You’re unhappy with the excessive amount of energy it takes to put yourself back on track and would prefer to avoid the experience in its entirety. However, there is a lesson available if you can put your pride aside long enough to learn it. Author Doreen Virtue wrote, “Boundaries are a part of self-care. They are healthy, normal, and necessary.”"
sagittarius,2017-10-21,"You are masterful at putting up invisible walls today, especially if you are being pestered by someone wanting to know how you feel. Rather than boldly defending your sovereignty and your right to experience your own emotions, you may choose to just go silent. Unfortunately, people often expect you to be a happy-go-lucky extrovert and they grow insecure when you withdraw. Nevertheless, it’s not your job to wear a smile just to make others comfortable."
capricorn,2017-10-21,"You want to be a member of the pack today, but you’re very picky about the skills of the other participants. You aren’t willing to compromise your high expectations for the sake of peace and harmony. Nevertheless, your swift judgment of others can be the source of an irresolvable struggle now, leaving you feeling isolated and working on your own. Connection is the cure to your sense of alienation. You don’t need to lower your standards if you can change your frame of reference."
aquarius,2017-10-21,"Strange days are upon you. You long to be in a leadership position within your community, but you don’t want anyone to know your true intentions. Naturally, this creates an obvious dilemma because it’s nearly impossible to be the center of authority while maintaining anonymity. Nevertheless, you are undeterred and willing to try to achieve your unrealistic dream. Get your head out of the clouds; set your feet back on the ground before reassessing your current position and setting new goals."
pisces,2017-10-21,"You could easily talk yourself into believing a philosophical idea or a spiritual teaching so fervently that you exclude all other ideas today. Unfortunately, the moment you do this, you lose your connection with truth because reality is multivalent. There are many ways to describe an experience, depending on your point of view. Instead of trying to find fault with someone’s else’s idea now, seek points of common interest. Psychologist Abraham Maslow wrote, “You will either step forward into growth, or you will step backward into safety.”"
aries,2017-10-22,"You’re itching to take off into the wild blue yonder but you can’t file a flight plan yet because you’re unsure of your specific destination. It’s difficult to choose one when there are several directions that appeal to your wanderlust. Nevertheless, you are resigned, even excited, by the notion of flying by the seat of your pants and a lack of details won’t hold you back. Unfortunately, once you’re on your way, you will wish you took the time to decide where you wanted to land. Remember, follow your heart but bring along a map and your common sense to be safe."
taurus,2017-10-22,"You may be so concerned about your health today that you take specific steps to modify your lifestyle. Although you can research all the dietary options in the world, you won’t improve your physical wellbeing unless you make tangible changes to your eating habits. But embarking on a new regimen is tricky business; making small adjustments that last is better than turning your life upside down for a short period of time. Virgil wrote, “The greatest wealth is health.”"
gemini,2017-10-22,"You can think of a hundred reasons to fall in love today; however, there’s one good reason why you shouldn’t. Feisty Mars flirts with sensual Venus and the radiant Sun in your 5th House of Romance, feeding your thoughts with lovely desires. However, stern Saturn is standing in the shadows, registering his opposition to your amorous intentions. Ultimately, you are responsible for your actions, no matter what anyone else does. Fortunately, you can navigate your way toward pleasure as long as you play by the rules."
cancer,2017-10-22,"Revisiting a past experience by tripping back through your memories can help to settle an old score now. You have the ability to see a situation from a different vantage point, which radically alters your judgment of the situation. The key to your current breakthrough is to avoid being attached to your previous assumptions and conclusions. A fresh perspective opens the door to new possibilities. Billionaire J.P. Morgan said, “The first step towards getting somewhere is to decide that you are not going to stay where you are.”"
leo,2017-10-22,"You might think you can evade your obligations today, but your carefree attitude could backfire on you pretty fast. You’re in a playful mood and you’re searching for a sweet distraction. Nevertheless, you will have to face some unpleasant music later on if you don’t keep your priorities straight. Thankfully, nothing will prevent you from enjoying yourself if you plan your schedule in advance. Author Jack Canfield wrote, “I believe that people make their own luck by great preparation and good strategy.”"
virgo,2017-10-22,"It’s as if your cerebral engine ran out of gas today, but the quiet is just a sign that assertive Mars has left your industrious sign for the peaceful fields of Libra. Thankfully, you can finally take a few deep breaths and slow down. There’s no need to pretend you’re busier than you are. Instead of working extra hours to finish all your chores, claim your well-earned downtime to recharge your batteries. As Meher Baba taught, “Don’t worry, be happy.”"
libra,2017-10-22,"Laziness is not in your vocabulary now. You are highly motivated to accomplish your goals while superhero Mars is reactivating your 1st House of Self. However, you don’t need to finish everything you start immediately since the action planet continues to energize your sign until December 9. But there is no excuse for procrastination; the more you do today, the more time you will have to enjoy the fruits of your labor down the road. Benjamin Franklin wrote, “You can do anything you set your mind to.”"
scorpio,2017-10-22,"You can’t make up your mind about whether you want to be with people now or spend the day on your own. Your key planet Mars sinks into your 12th House of Invisibility, compelling you to slip out of sight. Retreating into your inner sanctuary seems natural as you embark on a spiritual journey that follows a path meant for your steps alone. However, you are not trying to escape the real world forever; you’re preparing to reenter it refreshed and revitalized. Author Paulo Coelho wrote, “If you’re brave enough to say goodbye, life will reward you with a new hello.”"
sagittarius,2017-10-22,"It’s nearly impossible to hide your emotions today, but the good news is that you actually want others to see your vulnerable side. The moody Moon’s return to idealistic Sagittarius encourages you to share your inner process with your friends. Nevertheless, you still might plan on withholding a part of your story if you think it could upset someone. Unfortunately, you’re more likely to spill all the beans once you start talking. Author Annie M.G. Schmidt wrote, “Every story has a happy ending; you just need to know when to stop.”"
capricorn,2017-10-22,"You might finally give yourself a day off; no doubt, you deserve it. Nevertheless, militant Mars marches into your 10th House of Career, pushing you to work harder to get ahead. Ironically, there may be little you can do that’s job-related today. Although you’re content to relax and count your blessings now, you could be simultaneously obsessing over your plan to achieve success in your profession. Author Lee Bolman wrote, “A vision without strategy remains an illusion.”"
aquarius,2017-10-22,"It’s natural for Aquarians to look toward the future with anticipation. Your dreams grow even more vivid after the Moon shifts into your 11th House of Long-Term Goals. You’re fascinated by how many different paths there are before you now, and you imagine taking each of them, one at a time. Unfortunately, it requires extra effort to stay focused on the present moment today, and you could easily miss an amazing opportunity that’s right in front of your nose if you allow yourself to get distracted. Eckhart Tolle wrote, “Awareness is the greatest agent for change.”"
pisces,2017-10-22,"Although your friends and family appreciate your presence at social gatherings, you also hope to be recognized for all the wonderful ideas you bring to the party. Nevertheless, you may refrain from saying too much about your feelings because you don’t want your subjectivity to hinder your message. Unfortunately, your detachment could make you seem uncaring or insensitive, which couldn’t be further from the truth. Thankfully, it’s not an all-or-nothing situation; sharing your emotions at the right time conveys your compassion. Drop your ego at the door and let your heart lead the way."
aries,2017-10-23,"You may be driven by forces you don’t fully understand today, but you’re hopeful they will lead you in the right direction. The Sun’s shift into your 8th House of Transformation could send you on your own personalized version of Joseph Campbell’s “Hero’s Journey.” Sinking into the psychological mysteries of your subconscious can be a frightening venture, yet you’re likely to return with insights of great value. Mythologist Campbell wrote, “It is by going down into the abyss that we recover the treasures of life. Where you stumble, there lies your treasure.”"
taurus,2017-10-23,"Working with others is your key to success now. The Sun illuminates your 7th House of Partnerships, focusing your attention on your coworkers. Fortunately, everyone has something special to teach you; it’s your job to discover what you can learn from each of your relationships. However, unrealistic expectations will only lead to discouragement, so make sure that your fantasies are not mistakenly mixed up with reality. Just remember that limits, like fears, are often just illusions."
gemini,2017-10-23,"Temporarily setting your goals aside is discouraging if you lose perspective on your life. The Sun’s move into your 6th House of Service demands that you closely reexamine your daily routine so you can form a clear picture of the tasks you must perform on a regular basis. Delaying personal gratification does not imply failure. Instead, setting new priorities is an opportunity to derive satisfaction from a job well done. Allowing someone else’s needs -- your boss, a client or an associate -- to come before your own may be a humbling experience, but an important one for your spiritual growth."
cancer,2017-10-23,"You are relatively free to express yourself without fearing repercussions today. The radiant Sun shines its light in your 5th House of Creativity, encouraging you to be true to your own inner nature. Raising expectations about your performance motivates you to work harder to realize your dreams. Although you might be overly optimistic about the results of your current activities, no harm will be done if you fall short of your goals. Robert T. Kiyosaki said, “Failure defeats losers; failure inspires winners.”"
leo,2017-10-23,"Although you may be heading back to work or school today, your attention is inwardly directed. The Sun enters emotional Scorpio and your 4th House of Foundations, shining the light of your awareness into the most private parts of your soul. Psychological issues are brought into sharper clarity as you rummage through your memories to get in touch with the source of a current dilemma. Fortunately, you’re likely to find the needle in a haystack now if you stay singularly focused on the solution. Wayne Dyer wrote, “Our intention creates our reality.”"
virgo,2017-10-23,"You don’t mind sorting through piles of data to get to the truth. In fact, you’re a champion at separating the useful facts from the extraneous fluff, especially now that the Sun is visiting your 3rd House of Information. But arriving at an answer through rational analysis is not your final goal now; you aren’t finished with your job until you communicate your findings to those closest to you. Just make sure that the core of the matter isn’t diminished during your delivery of the message. Have courage and be kind."
libra,2017-10-23,"Balancing your needs with the desires of others is an ongoing practice. Finding a place for the expression of your individuality while in a close relationship is an issue all too familiar to you. Fortunately, you can make solid progress on establishing healthy boundaries now that the Sun brightens your 2nd House of Values. Defining what’s most important to your soul is a necessary start. Deciding which of your beliefs are non-negotiable enables you to communicate with anyone, without losing your sense of self in the process."
scorpio,2017-10-23,"Shining your inner light seems so natural today that you might wonder why it’s ever a struggle. The Sun strides into your 1st House of Self, illuminating your soul from the inside out. You can’t help but exude magnetism and charisma now. In fact, this is your time of year to recharge your emotional batteries. Luckily, you receive an extra gift of cosmic assistance from bountiful Jupiter at this solar return. However, your newfound optimism may trick you into taking on more projects than you can handle. Thankfully, performing a quick reality check allows you to keep your expectations in balance."
sagittarius,2017-10-23,"It’s as if you are reaching the end of your personal year, looking back to see what you accomplished and looking ahead to decide what’s next. The Sun slips into your 12th House of Destiny today, reminding you that present actions will reverberate long into the future. Your vision is crystal clear now, and your instincts are right on target. All you need to do is quiet the chatter in your mind so you can hear the subtle voice of your intuition. Silence holds the most poignant answers in the universe."
capricorn,2017-10-23,"You are thrilled to work as a part of a team now, because you see the positive potential of many people pulling in the same direction. The radiant Sun highlights your 11th House of Groups, encouraging you to examine the benefits you derive from collaborative efforts. Although you don’t want the plodding progress of the crowd to impede your progress, you still recognize the disadvantage of heading off on your own. Industrialist Henry Ford said, “If everyone is moving forward together, then success takes care of itself.”"
aquarius,2017-10-23,"Increased recognition now means more responsibilities, too. The Sun joins auspicious Jupiter in your 10th House of Status, spotlighting your professional accomplishments. However, you might not be able to avoid taking on additional obligations as your past performance is rewarded by putting you in charge of a new project. Nevertheless, accepting a role that’s beyond your skill set is not wise. Instead of pretending you are someone you are not, show the world who you are and what you can do. Your transparency is your badge of courage."
pisces,2017-10-23,"You may be given a chance to pursue a new area of interest now. Or, perhaps, you become fascinated with an activity that turns into a substantial hobby. However you choose to widen your horizons, the Sun’s entry into your 9th House of Big Ideas will bring new experiences within reach. Although you might be more receptive to exploring an opportunity today, it’s still up to you to extend enough to grab one and make it part of your life. Adventure awaits."
aries,2017-10-24,"You could go out on a limb today by sharing your feelings before you have a context in which to process them. Your emotional response to someone’s behavior can be immediate, but it’s unwise to jump to conclusions prior to turning your logic loose on the situation. Keep in mind that your gut reaction contains information that’s crucial to your understanding of the present circumstances. Nevertheless, it’s not helpful to indiscriminately open your heart before you engage your head. Author Joyce Meyer wrote, “Discipline enables you to think first and act second.”"
taurus,2017-10-24,"People seem to say all the right words today, as if they were composing love sonnets on the spot. But everything that glitters is not gold, nor are all beautiful declarations truthful. It’s not that anyone is intentionally trying to mislead you; in fact, it’s probably your own imagination running wild. Take off your rose-colored glasses so you can see the world as it is now, and not as you imagine it. Tim McGraw sang, “Chase your dreams but always know the road that’ll lead you home again.”"
gemini,2017-10-24,"Unfortunately, you won’t find the straightest path to success by logically analyzing all the variables and eliminating the least effective routes. You will progress further and faster today if you bypass rational thought and trust your intuition. Quicksilver Mercury’s superconductive trine to surreal Neptune offers a direct connection to your destination, magically bending the fabric of space and time. Anything can be created in the realms of the imagination. Reality begins in your dreams."
cancer,2017-10-24,"Your wishes seem to be within your grasp today; the only limits are the limits you place upon yourself. Your perceptions are incisive now, but you could easily draw the wrong conclusions if you think you know the answer prior to asking the question. Taking a shortcut won’t work to your advantage unless you fully prepare by putting all the details in order before you start. If you do your absolute best every day, realizing your fullest potential will soon be a piece of cake."
leo,2017-10-24,"You may be uncomfortable with someone’s noncommittal attitude today. You are so excited about your mission that you don’t understand why anyone would drag their feet when presented with your plan. Unfortunately, you won’t win others over so easily now. You need to return to basics by revealing your logic because your emotional appeal alone won’t likely close the deal. Author Aldous Huxley wrote, “Facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored.”"
virgo,2017-10-24,"The only person who can pull the wool over your eyes today is you. Although clever Mercury harmonizes with illusory Neptune in your 7th House of Partners, reality is not what it appears to be now. It seems as if you are looking out into the world around you, but you’re actually staring into a metaphysical mirror. Remember, you can transform your relationships in a heartbeat by shifting your frame of reference. The brightest stars are those that shine for the benefit of others."
libra,2017-10-24,"The harder you try to zone in on reality today, the more elusive it becomes. However, all you want to create is a manageable balance between the world as it is and the world as you imagine it to be. Ideally, you should be able to drift back and forth between the world of substance and the realms of dreams because they are simply reflections of one another. Rod Serling said, “Fantasy is the impossible made probable.”"
scorpio,2017-10-24,"Your perceptions are accurate and your reasoning is shrewd. Nevertheless, you may tumble down a rabbit hole of doubt if you mix up facts and fantasies today. There’s nothing wrong with meandering along a stream of consciousness if you know when to step back onto dry land. Fortunately, your daydreams widen your vistas of possible futures. Exploring many alternative realities increases your chances for success as long as you can keep your eyes on your destination."
sagittarius,2017-10-24,"Your dreams are lit up today, leaving you with vivid impressions of your fantasies. But you’re unlikely to share these messages from your subconscious because there’s something oddly intimate about them. It’s as if opening a doorway to your inner world could make you feel so vulnerable that you might want to run and hide. Nevertheless, the potential for growth is significant enough to convince you to take a risk. “Peter Pan” author J.M. Barrie wrote, “The moment you doubt whether you can fly, you cease forever to be able to do it.”"
capricorn,2017-10-24,"Your friends may look to you for inspiration today and you won’t let them down. It’s as if you’re operating with a direct communication channel open to your future, empowering you to see the outcome of current behaviors before they manifest. But don’t try to uncover the source of your knowledge now, since intellectually analyzing your gift might actually close down your penetrating perceptions. However, there’s no need to push an idea to conclusion. It’s more important to maintain an open mind so you don’t miss an opportunity when it knocks at your door."
aquarius,2017-10-24,"You are quite persuasive today, especially when trying to convince others that your plan to achieve extraordinary goals is within your scope of ability. However, you grow even more motivated to explain your cause when you encounter someone who can’t seem to grasp your message. Speaking with absolute certainty can be a remedy for being seen as possibly unreliable, but you will still need to come through with the goods. Albert Einstein said, “To punish me for my contempt of authority, fate made me an authority myself.”"
pisces,2017-10-24,"You need to know that your hopeful dreams can positively influence your life today. You may be fantasizing about business travel, strategizing about a new direction to take at work, or just feeling inspired by someone who opens your mind. In any case, there are ways of engaging with associates and potential clients that go beyond traditional methods. Employing social media to increase connectivity can change the rules of the game. However, you must continue moving forward. Ann Landers wrote, “Nobody gets to live life backward. Look ahead, that is where your future lies.”"
aries,2017-10-25,"Setting your sites on a distant destination can be an act of faith for many people. But you are so determined to reach your goal now that you spend more time collecting information and creating a strategy than is necessary. Of course, being well-prepared increases the likelihood of a favorable outcome, but your atypical behavior is puzzling to those who know you well. Don’t waste energy worrying about anyone else’s analysis of your efforts today. The only one who you need to prove anything to is you."
taurus,2017-10-25,"Although you are driven to honor a high ethical standard, your need for practicality might tempt you to soften your stance now. Searching for the truth can be a fulltime job, especially if you decide to leave no stone unturned until you find the answers to all your questions. But sometimes, fulfilling basic needs becomes so urgent that you must let your idealism slide. Don’t be too hard on yourself during this temporary state of affairs. Robert Tew wrote, “The struggle you’re in today is developing the strength you need for tomorrow.”"
gemini,2017-10-25,"Finishing a job is easier than it looks today. Nevertheless, you’re still subject to your all-too-familiar attraction to variety. Fortunately, you can perform a bit of magic now by asking structured Saturn for help. Set a timer when you start a task and every time you are distracted, bring your attention back to the clock. This simple practice helps to set an efficient rhythm to your work. Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, “Concentration is the secret of strength.”"
cancer,2017-10-25,"You can make extraordinary gains on a major project today, especially if you remain open to receiving assistance from your peers. It’s not that you are dependent on others; it’s just that a simple nudge or a bit of well-timed advice is more significant than you realize. Naturally, you must do your part by committing to a schedule and working hard to meet your deadlines. Your exemplary example sets the tone for everyone else. Hal Elrod wrote, “The moment you take responsibility for everything in your life is the moment you can change anything in your life.”"
leo,2017-10-25,"Scheduling your activities carefully so you can meet all your commitments is a smart strategy. But you could add so much structure to your day that you’re constantly thinking about what you need to do next, rather than being present in the moment. People notice a change in your attitude today and might even think you are micro-managing everything. Gaining efficiency is an admirable goal but not at the expense of meaningful human connections. Over-planning kills the magic of spontaneity and the joy of surprise."
virgo,2017-10-25,"There may be so much happening in your life now that it’s challenging to focus on one thing at a time. Your performance at a routine task feels empty today, even if your coworkers appreciate your effort. You want your creativity to be acknowledged, not just your hard work. Unfortunately, finding your productive groove might prove to be a simpler task than maintaining it throughout the day, requiring extra concentration on your part. Consistency is your friend."
libra,2017-10-25,"Your self-confidence is the only necessary ingredient to start a project, and your growing enthusiasm even motivates others to care about your cause. Naturally, you like the idea of collaboration, but you might find it particularly taxing to work with anyone else now. Sometimes, embarking on a course of action excludes outside assistance, especially if you’re not sure yet where you want to end up. Businesswoman Anne Sweeney said, “Define success on your own terms, achieve it by your own rules, and build a life you’re proud to live.”"
scorpio,2017-10-25,"You are caught in an unusual dilemma of your own making today. You know you’re on a positive track that’s leading you to a successful conclusion of a job well done. But you can’t seem to escape a handful of self-limiting beliefs that impede your progress. It is said that working smarter is more productive than working harder. Part of your current intelligence is the wisdom to relinquish some aspect of the past, which, in turn, allows you to release old behavior patterns that are no longer of use. Don’t overthink, just let it go."
sagittarius,2017-10-25,"You’re not in the mood to share your goals with anyone today. You prefer everyone to think that all your efforts are going toward more immediate concerns. Nevertheless, it’s impossible to take your mind off your future now, since you know that every move you make is part of a long-term trajectory. Unfortunately, the amount of cerebral energy you use to keep your deep-rooted truth a secret is a greater burden than describing it. Revealing your dreams inspires others to do the same."
capricorn,2017-10-25,"Although you’re willing to discuss your plans today, you might keep a few parts of your overall strategy under wraps. You want to engage in conversations that could spark new ideas, but your cautious nature won’t allow you to give away any trade secrets. You are a champion at calculating the best odds and you’re not interested in reducing your chances for success now by encouraging any serious competition. Economist Michael Porter wrote, “The essence of strategy is choosing what not to do.”"
aquarius,2017-10-25,"You have unused skills and undeveloped talents that can elevate your standing in your career. However, you’re in no hurry to bring out these secret weapons yet. You believe that you only get one chance at making your impression on those who could help you professionally -- and you’re willing to exercise your self-restraint while you continue to sharpen the tools in your toolbox. Joyce Meyer wrote, “Patience is not the ability to wait, but the ability to keep a good attitude while waiting.”"
pisces,2017-10-25,"Oftentimes, you set a goal and figure out your plan while you’re already in motion. You Fish like to zig-zag back and forth as you wiggle your way closer and closer to your loosely defined destination that gains clarity as you approach it. However, your modus operandi is radically different today as you rely on a detailed itinerary that you have already created and revised many times. Your advanced preparation will serve you well now, clearing the way for your steady progress until you reach your dreams."
aries,2017-10-26,"You’re not satisfied easily today because you’re so sure of your destiny that you’ll do nearly anything to fulfill it. You can visualize a best-case scenario and can’t wait to put your plan into motion. Although there may be other people involved who have a variety of conflicting issues, you believe you intuitively know how to steer the group in your direction. Unfortunately, you could achieve your goals while creating chaos in the process. Consider the price you’re willing to pay for success before you embark on a course you might later regret."
taurus,2017-10-26,"Someone may present you with the proverbial deal you can’t refuse today. An offer could look so good on paper that you want to say yes before reading the fine print. Luckily, the opportunity might actually turn out to be as awesome as it appears. Nevertheless, doing due diligence is always prudent when stepping into unknown territory. Once you have uncovered all relevant information, you will be in a better position to make the smartest choice. Fortune favors the bold."
gemini,2017-10-26,"Your physical wellbeing is on your mind today, whether you’re feeling under the weather or just looking for an energetic boost. Thankfully, a propitious Sun-Jupiter conjunction blesses your 6th House of Self-Improvement, all but ensuring positive results from any changes you make now. Although you might have a clear idea of what your perfect regimen entails, there are experts who can offer sound advice to help you on your path. Your vitality is at stake, so thoroughly investigate your options before selecting a new lifestyle trend that may or may not work. Your health is your wealth."
cancer,2017-10-26,"You don’t want to waste your precious time fending off the manipulative behavior of someone at work. Confronting the person won’t likely help now; they’ll just deny your accusations or take the position that they’re doing it for your own good. Thankfully, you have a secret defensive weapon in your arsenal that doesn’t involve direct conflict. In every moment, you can choose an action that spreads good will instead of fear or anger. Make love, not war."
leo,2017-10-26,"There may be an impossible list of chores that must be finished today, and you don’t know if you’re feeling up to the task. Nevertheless, your stamina is strong and you might even surprise yourself with what you can do now. There’s no need to proclaim your superiority or get swept up in an old drama. Just quietly go about your business while methodically focusing the best of your intentions onto your immediate environment. Work hard in silence; let your success be your noise."
virgo,2017-10-26,"Your practical sense of reality informs nearly every aspect of your behavior. You might harbor extreme feelings about someone close to you today, but you don’t want to say anything negative because you think it will reflect badly on you. Nevertheless, avoidance is not a strategy that works for anyone involved now. Calmly express your anger before it transforms into resentment, which makes matters much more complicated to resolve in the long run. Author Fiona Childs wrote, “Be kind, be honest, be loving, be true and all these things will come back to you.”"
libra,2017-10-26,"Paradoxically, your self-esteem soars today, but you still may need to face your insecurities. You’re confident of your capabilities on the job and can create a strategic ladder that will carry you to the top of your field. However, your feelings stand on shakier ground now, and you might slip into the underworld for a remedial course on the magic of emotional transformation. Whatever happens, maintain your balance. Standing on the border between worlds requires serious concentration, but the rewards are worth the risks."
scorpio,2017-10-26,"You move through the day with exaggerated emotions and behaviors that are symptoms of your larger-than-life approach to everything. An auspicious Sun-Jupiter conjunction occurs in your sign every twelve years, opening the floodgates of opportunity and inspiring you with such confidence that you believe anything is possible. But there’s still a nagging sound of the tiniest alarm of self-doubt ringing in the back of your head. Your accomplishments speak for themselves; take on the world with a humble heart and a can-do spirit."
sagittarius,2017-10-26,"Your favorite tune comes wafting through the cosmos today, and nothing will prevent you from singing along. The Sun’s annual conjunction with your key planet Jupiter is a beacon of hope that inspires you to live your life according to your highest ideals. However, shining your light in the right direction doesn’t automatically mean you will reach your destination. Nevertheless, your word is sacrosanct; skipping out on your commitments is not an option. False promises hurt."
capricorn,2017-10-26,"You can see right through someone’s negativity today, like a cosmic ray passing directly through a wall. The take-no-prisoners Moon-Pluto conjunction lands in your pragmatic sign, making you a passionate catalyst for change wherever you go. The good news is you don’t even slow down when confronted with unwarranted criticism. Unfortunately, the bad news is you may ignore crucial feedback that could increase your efficiency and improve your chances of manifesting your ideal future. Humility is the secret ingredient of success."
aquarius,2017-10-26,"Your career is like a rocket ship on the launch pad now, and your optimism can propel you to new heights. Although all systems have been meticulously checked and are in working order, you still need to decide on a destination. Fortunately, you know more about your goal than ever before, even if you haven’t revealed it to anyone yet. Announce your plans so you can be cleared for take-off while the cosmos is offering clear skies and the promise of the wind beneath your wings."
pisces,2017-10-26,"You spend a lot of time projecting your current situation into the future, playing out every possible scenario in your mind now. In fact, you could become obsessive as you try to increase the odds of your success, operating as if your life is a casino game of chance. Although the Sun’s conjunction with lucky Jupiter is a fortuitous sign, you’re not home free yet. Assume the best, but don’t be surprised if there are a few unexpected twists and turns along the way. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said, “We must accept finite disappointment, but never lose infinite hope.”"
aries,2017-10-27,"On the surface, everything appears to be copacetic, but there may be a tempest brewing out of sight. You can pretend to be innocent and focus only on what is pleasant today, but failing to acknowledge the tension won’t prevent it from making itself known. Luckily, you have the power to turn an uncomfortable feeling into a catalyst that deepens a relationship instead of destabilizing it. The key to transformation is communication. Mutual respect and trust means that nothing of potential significance is off limits for discussion. The more you talk, the less it hurts."
taurus,2017-10-27,"You might sense that something isn’t quite right in a relationship at work. Relying on the familiarity of routine is often enough to put your anxious thoughts to rest. Unfortunately, the status quo is not your friend today because it allows an untreated trivial wound to fester. Thankfully, addressing the problem when you first notice it -- however minor it may seem -- prevents it from becoming more serious. Ben Franklin wrote, “You may delay, but time will not.”"
gemini,2017-10-27,"Your attempts to take a relationship to the next level may lead you through rough terrain today. Normally, you might turn back at the first signs of difficulty, but you’re empowered now by your unrelenting quest to be seen and acknowledged by someone you love. Since communication is a two-way street, a conversation that’s built upon honesty can clear a path directly to the heart. Newscaster Edward R. Murrow said, “To be persuasive we must be believable; to be believable we must be credible; to be credible we must be truthful.”"
cancer,2017-10-27,"You don’t necessarily want to go over an emotional waterfall; you wish you could find an easier way to reach the calmer waters down below as you struggle to find your voice in a relationship. Unfortunately, a more circuitous route might lead you so far off course that you get lost before you realize it. Fortunately, you’re much tougher than you think and have little to fear except your own apprehension. Jump into the swiftly moving rapids and let your feelings flow as they will. Poet Robert Frost wrote, “The best way out is always through.”"
leo,2017-10-27,"You are hoping to avoid an intense exchange with someone who appears to be exercising too much control over your life. You wish you didn’t need to set such firm boundaries now, but it seems to be the only way to maintain your autonomy. Misplaced negativity could sideswipe an already impassioned interaction today, making a difficult conversation even worse. Nevertheless, you can avert a crisis with kindness rather than anger. Statesman Hubert Humphrey said, “The greatest healing therapy is friendship and love.”"
virgo,2017-10-27,"You are motivated to initiate a dialogue about a very sensitive topic today, because you are so positive about your position that you’re willing to take on anyone. Although you might even believe you’re invincible, powerful feelings are unleashed and you are not immune to their effects. You assume you can cling to your objectivity now, but you are quickly swept up in a whirlpool of emotions. The more you resist, the stronger the current. Spiritual leader Sri Chinmoy taught, “Surrender is a journey from the outer turmoil to the inner peace.”"
libra,2017-10-27,"You are quick to offer to act as the mediator in a domestic disagreement today. Although it hurts your heart when people are in conflict, you are eager to step in to reduce the emotional tension through diplomatic means. However, the discord runs deep now and a lasting resolution may demand more than just discussing the differences. Sooner or later you must accept that the problem is not yours. Do what you can to broker a peace agreement and then leave the process to those who are directly involved. Deepak Chopra said, “In the midst of movement and chaos, keep stillness inside of you.”"
scorpio,2017-10-27,"You are strongly opinionated today, and your passion could act as a lightning rod that attracts an unsolicited argument. You believe someone is purposefully trying to pick a fight, but you won’t have any part in it. You might put on a happy face, thinking you can smile your way around a conflict, but the more you hide your true feelings, the stronger they grow. Educator Vida Dutton Scudder wrote, “The suppression of war is not the equivalent of peace.”"
sagittarius,2017-10-27,"Your friends might say the nicest things to you today, but you are suspicious of their hidden agendas. No matter how you try to reframe their compliments, alarms are ringing and causing you concern. However, you’re hesitant to broach the topic because you don’t want to appear as if you’re paranoid. Nevertheless, it’s not in your best interest to stay silent now. Find a way to start a conversation without making accusations or blaming anyone else. If deeper issues show up, follow the thread. If nothing surfaces, forget about it and move on."
capricorn,2017-10-27,"You may think that others are taking you for granted today. You wish your contributions were recognized and appreciated more often. Ironically, your needy behavior could be the cause of your apparent invisibility as you try harder than ever to be noticed. People might be put off by your pushy approach, choosing to withdraw from engaging with your energy now. Just go about your work without any fanfare and watch as you gain status among your peers. A Chinese proverb teaches, “The journey is the reward.”"
aquarius,2017-10-27,"You’re faced with a conundrum today as you’re tempted to participate in a group activity while simultaneously wanting to escape. You long for a deep connection with your peers and wish to pursue current opportunities to develop meaningful relationships. However, an inner voice tells you to step back from the crowd now, warning you about the possibility of losing your individual identity in the process of joining a team. Author J.K. Rowling proudly proclaimed, “I always felt an outsider.”"
pisces,2017-10-27,"A social cause could catch your attention and reel your heart in before you know it. You might not be aware of how significantly your involvement will impact your life until it’s too late. Nevertheless, you can justify your actions with your commitment to following a higher calling. Unfortunately, a conflict between your immediate desires and your long-term goals makes you unsure of your decision. Harville Hendrix wrote, “Nature doesn’t care that you are comfortable, only that you evolve.”"
aries,2017-10-28,"Hanging out with your friends is less of a social activity today than a chance to reflect on your dreams and the steps you need to follow to make them come true. The Moon’s visit to your 11th House of Long-Term Goals shifts the emphasis from the here and now to a vague point far off into the future. However, you might be surprised to discover that talking about your vision is challenging because it’s so indefinite. Nevertheless, keep trying; each time around the nondescript images become more describable. Thoreau wrote, “The world is but a canvas to the imagination.”"
taurus,2017-10-28,"Revealing your innermost feelings to someone you trust sounds harmless, but people don’t seem to understand your true intentions now. They might think you’re operating with a specific agenda, but your only purpose is to deepen a friendship by revealing your vulnerable side. Observe how the other person reacts and take your cues from their behavior, especially if there is a sudden chill in the air. But don’t spend too much time worrying about the stability of your relationship today, since you’re both likely to reconnect later with more admiration and respect than before."
gemini,2017-10-28,"You would do anything to extract yourself from the middle of an intense situation now. Although you don’t think this drama belongs to you, somehow you seem to be at the center of the emotional storm today. Try not to make any sudden moves; just back away from the turmoil. If the unsettled energy follows you on your retreat, you might have more ownership of the stress than you thought. Don’t play the victim of circumstances you helped to create."
cancer,2017-10-28,"You’re unhappy if you feel isolated from your closest friends and family. Although all the same people might be easily accessible, there seems to be an invisible wall that’s separating you from those you love today. Unfortunately, your alienation and frustration will continue to grow as long as you rely only on words to bridge the gap. Stop talking about your feelings and perform intentional acts of kindness instead. A meaningful gesture touches the hearts of others more than you know."
leo,2017-10-28,"Although relationships are back on the front burner, you’re not necessarily seeking to dive into emotional intimacy today. In fact, your ideal interaction is based upon sharing an idea or an activity now, rather than your feelings. You like the easy expression of emotionally detached companionship that allows you to operate free of unspoken expectations. Author Steve Maraboli wrote, “Friends are medicine for a wounded heart, and vitamins for a hopeful soul.”"
virgo,2017-10-28,"You could be so particular about the information you receive today that you need to verify every single fact. You take nothing at face value until it’s been checked out three times over. Others might think you are acting bizarrely -- and you are. Nevertheless, you have your reasons now; you don’t want to be fooled or to look like a fool. Thankfully, your careful analysis won’t lead you astray. Actor Leonard Nimoy said, “Logic is the beginning of wisdom, not the end.”"
libra,2017-10-28,"Expressing your needs is effortless today, which could create a unique set of problems. Your desires don’t necessarily conform to everyone else’s sense of normalcy, and discussing your divergent values can lead to an impasse. You know exactly what’s negotiable and what’s not. However, people see you as more ambivalent than you actually are now. There’s no need to feed into their assumptions. Although you think your honesty might upset someone, speak your truth and let the chips fall as they may."
scorpio,2017-10-28,"Your no-nonsense attitude can be so intimidating that you could unintentionally scare someone away today. However, your words may not accurately convey your true feelings, leaving others to fill in the blanks with their fears or insecurities. You might be empowered when you notice the current dynamics, but trying to capitalize on your dominant position is beneath your integrity. Instead, level the playing field by softening your approach. Adopting a gentler disposition fosters a more collaborative atmosphere."
sagittarius,2017-10-28,"You stop to talk with everyone you encounter today, but you might not say anything important. In fact, you could fill up any silence with rambling thoughts about unusual people, places and things. But your current penchant for the weirdest facts and figures is only a distraction from the main event, which you are keeping to yourself. Unfortunately, your protectionist strategy may not be useful in the long run. Take a risk and open your heart now, since vulnerability is the only path to intimacy."
capricorn,2017-10-28,"You are almost always striving to better your position at home or in the community. Normally, your need to honor social conventions drives your behavior, but today you’re looking to break some rules to separate yourself from the crowd. Before you commit to a radical course of action just to garner some fast fame and fortune, consider the repercussions of your personal rebellion. Ezra Taft Benson wrote, “You are free to choose, but you are not free to alter the consequences of your decisions.”"
aquarius,2017-10-28,"You feel as if the cosmos has given you a free license to express any and all of your moods today, no matter where it leads. Nevertheless, the Moon’s visit to your non-conformist sign can incite you to intentionally shock someone with your revelations. Unfortunately, you could complicate your life when there’s really no reason to alienate your best supporters. Just because you experience a particular emotion now doesn’t mean you must share it with your peeps. Sometimes it’s wise to heed Thumper’s advice and remain silent unless you have something nice to say."
pisces,2017-10-28,"Your spiritual journey lures you into the shadows today, inviting you to find the hidden beauty. But you’re unwilling to follow in someone else’s footsteps; you’re on a path that’s yours alone. Although you feel like a metaphysical adventurer, you wish you didn’t have to blaze a trail now just to reach your current destination. Nevertheless, you’re devoted to discovering the truth for yourself, whatever it takes. Goethe wrote, “Courage is the commitment to begin without any guarantee of success.”"
aries,2017-10-29,"People around you seem extra irritable today, possibly even overreacting without provocation. You might even have a minor crisis on your hands if you don’t handle the tension right away. Unfortunately, engaging antagonistically with others in an attempt to defend your behavior will only amplify the negativity. President Barack Obama said, “It’s the lack of empathy that makes it very easy for us to plunge into wars.” Thankfully, deescalating a looming interpersonal conflict is a simple task if you just stop to listen with an open heart."
taurus,2017-10-29,"You are happy to jump in and help someone finish a project today, without expecting anything in return. Nevertheless, you’re unwilling to put up with their criticism of the work you or anyone else is doing now. Unfortunately, there’s probably no easy way to bring up your grievance. Calling the person out will likely lead to an unnecessary argument with no immediate resolution. Remember, you are there of your own volition. Instead of stirring the pot, just gently remove yourself from the situation. Wayne Dyer wrote, “Conflict cannot survive without your participation.”"
gemini,2017-10-29,"Not only does your lack of discipline annoy others today, your laid-back attitude could derail your productivity. You’re more interested in talking about all the things you need to do than actually taking action to get them done now. Unfortunately, discussing your plans might be helpful under normal circumstances, but there’s no benefit to justifying your procrastination. Instead of complaining about your obligations, channel your angst into your chores. A little accomplishment under your belt allows you to sleep better tonight."
cancer,2017-10-29,"You have a rare opportunity to make substantial progress on a project at home. Fortunately, your creativity is running strong now, and you see solutions rather than problems everywhere you look. However, it’s not your goal to merely complete your work today; the finished product must also be pleasing to the senses. Although your artful intentions are admirable, there is a trade-off between beauty and efficiency. Pay attention to the ideal point of balance for the best results."
leo,2017-10-29,"Social activities are the source of pleasure, but they may also bring conflict today. Your strong opinions about political or philosophical concerns could stir the stew of unrest, especially if you think it’s your place to deliver the truth. Although intelligent people can arrive at different conclusions from the same data, there are some issues that are critical enough to fight for now. Make sure your desire to stand on your soapbox is coming from a higher perspective and not just your ego wanting some attention. Let your moral compass decide what matters most."
virgo,2017-10-29,"Your lingering indecision could instigate a conflict with a friend today. You might see something you want, but are unsure if it’s a wise purchase. Normally, you have no problem making up your mind; you just look at the facts and the answer is obvious. But you’re stuck in an endless mental loop and dragging someone else into your personal dilemma doesn’t help now. Your previously internal argument is exacerbated once it has an anchor in the real world. Ending the struggle is simpler than you think. Make a decision and move on."
libra,2017-10-29,"Your opinions or actions may be misinterpreted today, and the more you defend them, the worse the misunderstanding becomes. However, you’re not likely to retreat if your anger is aroused. Your eagerness to engage in a war of words might surprise people, but you feel as if you must make your point. You’re not interested in following someone else’s lead now; you want to pursue your own agenda, even if you lose the support of those closest to you. Oprah Winfrey said, “Don’t back down just to keep the peace. Standing up for your beliefs builds self-confidence and self-esteem.”"
scorpio,2017-10-29,"You appear as if all is well in your world today, while your emotions are seething below the surface about a recent conversation gone wrong, an old emotional hurt or a current social injustice. Whatever the cause, you could be unconsciously cruising for a fight now, just waiting for someone to disagree with your position on anything. Unfortunately, you can lose your temper so easily that you precipitate a conflict. Instead of wasting time cleaning up an unnecessary mess, encourage others to express their opinions, too. A healthy debate rooted in mutual respect clears the air for everyone involved."
sagittarius,2017-10-29,"You’re happy to hang out with your friends today, expecting to share adventures wherever you may roam. However, it might be difficult to get along with others if your agenda differs from theirs. At first, you remain quiet since you don’t want your preferences to hijack the fun. But a minor annoyance can quickly build into resentment now, triggering an emotional outburst as you try to set things straight. Don’t wait for your feelings to take over; discuss a possible compromise as a proactive measure. Mythologist Joseph Campbell wrote, “Regrets are illuminations come too late.”"
capricorn,2017-10-29,"Contemplating your long-term goals can lead to anxious feelings today, especially if close friends and family members take issue with your plans. However, you want to share your dreams with those closest to you without being put in a defensive position. Your irrational concerns could prompt you to overcompensate by pushing people away. In fact, you might even go out of your way to fuel an open argument with someone you see as a potential adversary. Unfortunately, confrontation only makes matters worse. Downplaying the conflict is not a final solution, but it’s your wisest strategy for now."
aquarius,2017-10-29,"Your current notion of pleasure is engaging in anything that expands your mind. However, you don’t want to take an idea so far that it destabilizes the parts of your life that work. For example, there’s no harm in learning a foreign language as long as you’re not considering an impulsive move around the globe to immerse yourself in that culture. Even the most outrageous dreams can be of value now if you don’t act on them yet. Leo Tolstoy wrote, “The strongest of all warriors are these two: time and patience.”"
pisces,2017-10-29,"A significant decision about your future may be the source of a disagreement with your spouse or business partner today. Walking away from the conflict without a settlement is not an option, especially if the dispute is over money or other jointly held resources. Unfortunately, an argument could spark unresolved issues that explode into awareness, complicating the original negotiation. The key to navigating through this tricky territory is simple; no matter how intense your feelings may be now, treat one another with kindness and respect."
aries,2017-10-30,"You don’t know whether to proudly hold your ground against the forces of evil today, or to run for the nearest cave and hide. Naturally, your first instinct is to muster up your courage and share your message to combat any negativity that’s wafting through the atmosphere. Although fighting for your beliefs is admirable, you can’t do it alone now. Working with others strengthens your resolve and magnifies your effectiveness. Act synergistically; the whole is greater than the sum of its parts."
taurus,2017-10-30,"There is an unspoken bond between you and your allies today. It’s as if you’re all part of a conspiracy to bring compassion into the workplace. In a competitive environment, one person’s sensitivity might be frowned on as a weakness. Nevertheless, there is power in numbers and anything is possible when many people collectively display empathy and tolerance instead of fear and judgment. Poet Ryunosuke Satoro wrote, “Individually, we are one drop. Together, we are an ocean.”"
gemini,2017-10-30,"You’re less interested in climbing the ladder of success today than you are in making meaningful connections with others at work. But your desire for camaraderie goes beyond a social inclination; you believe big changes are afoot and you are strengthening your bonds with people you want in your tribe. Networking is not a casual distraction now when you’re preparing for the future. Oprah Winfrey said, “Only surround yourself with people who will lift you higher.”"
cancer,2017-10-30,"Separating your visions of an ideal future from the practical realities of tomorrow can be a daunting task. You Crabs are attuned to the Moon as she swims through some rather magical and mysterious waters today, cutting you loose from the normal restraints of reality. Yours is a diaphanous dream world where your thoughts spin fantasies faster than you can decipher their meanings. Don’t waste too much energy trying to uncover the facts now; they will make themselves known when you need to make a decision. Rest assured that you become what you believe."
leo,2017-10-30,"You are primarily attracted to those things that can be perceived by your five senses. However, you are enchanted today by the exquisite beauty and complexity of all that exists beyond the veil that separates this world from the other side. Strangely, there seems to be cosmic leakage as the energy from higher dimensions precipitates into this one. Disparate events are somehow connected now. Fate has a stronger hold on your life, but thankfully, there’s no reason to fight against your destiny. The universe is conspiring in your favor."
virgo,2017-10-30,"Your life is complicated today by the people around you who are unable to make decisions and then follow through on their promises. Although you may feel as if you’re being set up by those who let you down, their intentions are probably honorable. Unfortunately, your concerns might be quite specific while others are thinking about more esoteric things. Try not to be so judgmental if someone else doesn’t share your priorities now. Stephen Covey writes, “Strength lies in differences, not in similarities.”"
libra,2017-10-30,"You can’t seem to make your actions conform to your established schedule today. Instead of being punctual, you’re either running early or late. Ironically, you might finally arrive at an appointment on time, only to find yourself waiting for someone else. The truth is you’re more closely connected to the realms of imagination now than the real world -- and force fitting one to the other may be an act of futility. Give yourself permission to explore your fantasies while you can. Poet William Blake wrote, “The hours of folly are measured by the clock, but of wisdom no clock can measure.”"
scorpio,2017-10-30,"You may be in trouble today if you need to deal with the mundane details of life. You really don’t want to be bothered with practical questions or tedious chores now. But you could spend hours wrapped up in watching a movie, listening to music or gazing at clouds. Anything that allows your mind to wander helps you get in touch with who you really are. Unfortunately, work isn’t cancelled just because you’re in a dreamy mood. Author Dave Ramsey wrote, “Being willing to delay pleasure for a greater result is a sign of maturity.”"
sagittarius,2017-10-30,"Balancing your natural extroverted tendencies with your current cravings for solitude can be tricky. It’s doubly difficult to pull off a disappearing act when your friends expect you to be congenial, entertaining and inspirational today. Nevertheless, the benefits you derive from introspective contemplation is well worth the temporary isolation, even if you must disappoint others in the process. Even you high-flying Archers need to cool your jets once in a while. Recharge, reconnect and relax."
capricorn,2017-10-30,"Everything seems a bit surreal today, yet you can’t put your finger on the true nature of the energy. It’s as if dreams from your previous night of sleep have seeped into the day, infusing it with a weird mixture of hope, magic and the unknown. However, you can tell that you are bending reality slightly out of shape and don’t know how to get your feet back on the ground. This little adventure into the realms of fantasy might make you uncomfortable at first, but also helps you see your world from a vastly different perspective. There’s nothing to do but enjoy the view while it lasts."
aquarius,2017-10-30,"On one hand, your tenuous relationship with the material world is stressful if you’re not motivated to take care of practical responsibilities. On the other hand, you’re fascinated with the cosmic download you’re receiving now. You watch amazed as images and symbols roll past your mind’s eye, even if you’re not sure of the source. You love being moved by the magic of spiritual awakening, but you don’t like losing touch with the simplicity of living in the moment. As Prince sang, “Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to get through this thing called life.”"
pisces,2017-10-30,"You are blissfully floating in your element today, content to contemplate the meaning of the cosmos and your place in it. However, someone may be upset with you if you’re not concerned about mundane things like work schedules and deadlines. Obviously, you can’t just walk away from your obligations now, but no one can prevent you from traveling to distant worlds within your imagination if you keep up with your responsibilities, too. Environmentalist Edward Abbey wrote, “Balance, that's the secret. Moderate extremism.”"
aries,2017-10-31,"You’ve stretched reality as far as you can, and now it’s time to face the facts. Although the fantasy-prone Pisces Moon is still floating through your 12th House of Spirituality, unavoidable circumstances require you to pull your head out of the clouds. Stop entertaining far-fetched dreams and get to work creating the world you want to live in. Author Brian Tracy wrote, “Your true success in life begins only when you make the commitment to become excellent at what you do.”"
taurus,2017-10-31,"An arrangement you made with a friend or business partner could falter today as one of you decides the deal needs to be revised. Unfortunately, it’s less likely you will find common ground now as stern Saturn leaves very little room for negotiation. Additionally, you might feel as if you’ve already compromised more than you intended, prompting you to hold steady to your previous position. But shutting down too soon won’t help you get any closer to an acceptable solution. Rabindranath Tagore wrote, “Everything comes to us that belongs to us if we create the capacity to receive it.”"
gemini,2017-10-31,"You have no choice but to put away your fantasies about chasing rainbows today. You must set aside your dreams while you perform less-than-glorious tasks that can’t be left unfinished. You won’t likely receive any kudos, even when you execute your work in an exemplary fashion. You may suffer an emotional setback from the lack of recognition, but your discouragement won’t last long. Nothing is to be gained by wallowing in self-pity. Dr. Harold Taylor wrote, “The roots of true achievement lie in the will to become the best that you can become.”"
cancer,2017-10-31,"You are at a turning point today; you need to make some aspect of your dreams real or walk away from them without looking back. Your work is set out for you and there’s no avoiding it. You must incorporate recently learned information into your plan or watch it fall apart before your eyes. Fortunately, your logic is sound now, so don’t be afraid to trust your own judgments. Once you embark on a new path, be firm in your convictions and apply yourself relentlessly until you manifest your vision. As Yoda said, “Do or do not; there is no try.”"
leo,2017-10-31,"You tire of exploring metaphysical realms and intangible ideas. You long for the simplistic reality of the three-dimensional world now, along with its straightforward relationship between action and reaction. But your knowledge that nothing exists in a vacuum sets you back out on a path of discovery as you search for the fundamental truths of the cosmos. Unfortunately, you could look so hard that you can’t see anything at all. Too much looking often blinds the eye that seeks but never finds."
virgo,2017-10-31,"Your open heart and curious mind create a perfect recipe for trouble today as someone tugs at your emotions and tickles your brain at the same time. You can’t help but follow the energy as it leads you down a magical path of interaction with a friend or lover. However, there is a very real price to pay for allowing your feelings to overrule your thoughts, and karmic Saturn is standing by to collect his fee. Your best protection against a bad ending is being honest with yourself and others from the start."
libra,2017-10-31,"You might have underestimated the amount of time and energy required to complete a job. If you already committed to meeting a deadline, you will need to offer those involved a revised delivery schedule and a sincere apology. However, you may receive little sympathy for your admission today. There isn’t much you can do at this late date but learn from the situation in order to prevent it from happening again. Actress Amy Poehler wrote, “Sometimes painful things can teach us lessons that we didn’t think we needed to know.”"
scorpio,2017-10-31,"Your plans may include a bit of well-deserved self-indulgence today, as you look forward to spoiling yourself with something special. But your dreams run into a roadblock when you compare the cost of your activity or purchase with the cash you have on hand now. But don’t let disappointment ruin your day. Head back to the drawing board and rethink your options. Thomas Edison said, “There’s a way to do it better -- find it.”"
sagittarius,2017-10-31,"You’re reluctant to share your doubts with anyone today, simply because you don’t want to give them voice. You’re less worried about people’s reactions than you are about empowering your own negativity. But denial is never useful when it comes to handling difficult issues. It’s all the more urgent to express yourself authentically if you’re concerned about your ability to perform adequately. Mickey Rooney said, “You always pass failure on your way to success.”"
capricorn,2017-10-31,"Your ambitions could be thwarted by your own actions today. You might misunderstand the instructions you are given, only to successfully complete the wrong task. Naturally, you may be quite upset when you learn that your efforts were for naught. But don’t waste time being mad about things that cannot be undone. Assess your current condition, figure out what still needs to be accomplished and get to work. Your goals don’t care how you feel, but you will feel much better if you reach them."
aquarius,2017-10-31,"No matter how much you contribute to a group effort now, you still might worry that it’s not enough. However, your concerns about whether or not you carry your own weight as a team member are not likely about the current situation. Instead, an old wound may resurface today, reminding you of a past failure. The first step in elevating your self-esteem is to recognize the negative influence of your memories. Hillary Clinton said, “Every moment wasted looking back keeps us from moving forward.”"
pisces,2017-10-31,"Responsibilities at work leave you with little time for contemplation, but that could work out to your advantage today. Someone’s actions may have triggered recollections of a childhood rejection that still gnaws at you from the hidden recesses of your subconscious. Rather than ruminating about water that has long flowed under the bridge, you can’t dwell on it because you’re so wrapped up in the demands of the day. Publisher Louise Hay wrote, “The point of power is always in the present moment.”"
aries,2017-11-01,"You are reminded of your birthright to act spontaneously, even if you haven’t yet considered what might happen. The enterprising Aries Moon encourages you to make the most of the moment by seizing the current opportunity before it fades into the past. You’re willing to take a chance by putting an incomplete plan into motion. In fact, inaction seems like a bigger risk than doing something that doesn’t turn out. Don’t fear failure; fear being in the exact same place next year as you are today."
taurus,2017-11-01,"You’re excited to start a new project at work today, but one thing after another blocks your progress. Although someone’s lack of confidence in your plan could influence others not to support your efforts, your self-doubt also contributes to your current troubles. Don’t talk yourself out of your personal success by letting someone discourage your ambitious attitude. You don’t need a fan club to achieve your goals; be your own source of motivation."
gemini,2017-11-01,"You can’t wait to share your amazing plans for the future with your friends. Although you crave the feedback from your peers, you’re probably not fully prepared to launch the next phase of your life. Nevertheless, you expect to receive support to build your self-confidence. Keep in mind that life will only change when you become more committed to your dream than you are to your comfort zone. Author Marie Forleo wrote, “The key to success is to start before you’re ready.”"
cancer,2017-11-01,"You want everyone to know you’re watching out for them today yet you could be overly protective in the process. Although you mean well, others might think you’re being a bit too pushy or even manipulative. Avoid reacting defensively by withdrawing completely, for that won’t help the situation at all. Instead, consider what you can do to bridge the gap between people’s perceptions and your intentions. Simply stepping back just a little may be sufficient to give others the space they need. Loving someone requires a delicate balance between holding on and letting go."
leo,2017-11-01,"You can see a direct path to nearly any destination you can imagine today. But visualizing a goal is much different than actually manifesting your vision. If you grow frustrated with your lack of observable progress, you may need to reframe your experience. Instead of dealing with setbacks and delays, be thankful that you are being given an opportunity to improve your plan before trying again. Rather than changing your yes into a no, just turn it into a later. Counting your blessings changes your perspective."
virgo,2017-11-01,"Rushing ahead with your latest and greatest plan is a fantastic use of your current enthusiasm -- but only until your resources are depleted. Although you are normally quite practical, ignoring your common sense today could lead to running out of time, energy or money before you reach your goal. Unfortunately, there will be a serious price to pay if you just barrel ahead without honoring your regular need for due diligence. Race car driver Bobby Unser said, “Success is where preparation and opportunity meet.”"
libra,2017-11-01,"Although you need more time to finalize your plans, someone could insist that you make a commitment today. Since you are very serious about arriving at the right decision, you could already be deep in your evaluation process. Others may think your ambivalence is a weakness, when it’s actually your greatest strength now. Continue to weigh the pros and cons of each possible course of action before choosing the path that best suits your needs. Nelson Mandela said, “May your choices reflect your hopes, not your fears.”"
scorpio,2017-11-01,"Everything seems to be black and white today with very little middle ground. Although your emotions are often extreme, you can jump to a conclusion very quickly now. You’re unlikely to be open to negotiation once you make up your mind. Thankfully, you can save yourself from a headache down the road by consciously delaying the announcement of your final judgment. Putting it off as long as possible allows you to continue your research and analysis. Richard Rainwater wrote, “Someone asked me what are the secrets to my success, and I said ‘There are three: Timing, timing, timing.’”"
sagittarius,2017-11-01,"You’re hot to trot today; every situation appears to be an invitation to another adventure. You can’t see any sensible reason to contain your enthusiasm for the smorgasbord of possibilities  stretching all the way out to the horizon. Nevertheless, the reality factor will kick in sooner or later, even if the path ahead seems clear from your current vantage point. Just remember that you can’t be sure of what’s around the first bend. It’s better to be careful right from the start than to be caught speeding over a treacherously bumpy road without functional brakes. Confucius said, “The cautious seldom err.”"
capricorn,2017-11-01,"You’re on a mission today and have an ambitious plan to reach your lofty goal. But others may not realize what you’re up to because you might downplay your objectives. Keeping your agenda to yourself is a way to prevent the possibility of negative feedback. Unfortunately, this encourages you to build your strategy in a bubble of blind optimism. Instead of overextending your reach by trying to accomplish more than is possible, share your ideas with someone you trust and take the feedback to heart. William Arthur Ward wrote, “Before you speak, listen.”"
aquarius,2017-11-01,"You could run around in circles doing many things today, only to find yourself at the end of the day without anything to show for your efforts. If looking busy is your goal, you will succeed beyond your dreams. But if creating tangible results is what’s important, then you need to alter your modus operandi. Think carefully about each move before you make it. Ask yourself if your next action will directly contribute to reaching your objective. If it doesn’t, skip it and consider something else. Goethe wrote, “Things that matter most must never be at the mercy of things that matter least.”"
pisces,2017-11-01,"Since you may have your head filled with bigger-than-life goals today, you might think about striking out on your own. You certainly don’t want to be inhibited by anyone else’s more conservative approach. Nevertheless, circumstances can make it nearly impossible for you to do anything without the involvement of others. Pushing them away could fuel an adversarial relationship that is wise to avoid at all costs. Accept the fact that the pace of work is beyond your control. Thankfully, as English playwright John Heywood wrote, “Many hands make light work.”"
aries,2017-11-02,"You might not like it when someone tells you the truth today, but keeping an open mind is still your best strategy. Having more facts at your disposal enables you to make smarter decisions. Nevertheless, courage is required in order to be an active listener, especially if what you learn contradicts your current perspective. The more receptive you are, the more informed your choices will be. Poet Walt Whitman wrote, “Be curious, not judgmental.”"
taurus,2017-11-02,"Words have the power to heal what ails you today, but they also may also be quite disruptive. Ironically, the same words create extremely different outcomes, depending on the context. Your simple message can positively alter someone’s life if you speak the truth with conviction. However, stirring the pot for shock value alone undermines the best of intentions. Consider how others might react before saying something you will soon regret. Remain open to everything without growing attached to anything."
gemini,2017-11-02,"Your boss might be sticking his nose into your business today, causing you great concern. Although you believe you have nothing to hide, you may be in for a rude awakening when a tidbit of information unexpectedly comes out into the open. Unfortunately, you can’t go back and bury what has been seen by all. Nevertheless, your full cooperation ultimately creates the smoothest path into the future. Psychologist Brené Brown wrote, “Courage starts with showing up and letting ourselves be seen.”"
cancer,2017-11-02,"Your dreams are alive and well today; although they reflect your hopes for the future, they can also contain unrealistic goals. Unfortunately, you may contribute to setting yourself up for failure unless you practice self-restraint before getting in over your head. Be particularly wary of any sudden shifts in your thinking. A brilliant idea that arrives like a stroke of lightning may be exhilarating, but it could quickly steer you off course. Decide on a realistic path into the future and save the exciting breakthroughs for another day. Author Nilesh Rathod wrote, “What good is speed without the ability to brake?”"
leo,2017-11-02,"Although you can see your future in a very positive light, it’s not wise to take anything for granted today. In fact, postponing any major initiatives works in your favor as long as you don’t promise anything you can’t deliver. Instead of dispersing your energy with several false starts, fight the impulse to act by going inward. Contemplation is your friend now and could save you valuable time in the long run. Aristotle wrote, “Patience is bitter but its fruit is sweet.”"
virgo,2017-11-02,"You realize there is more going on than meets the eye, but you’re eager to make a decision based upon what you currently know anyhow. However, you’re able to consciously override your urge to act first and think about it later. You hold the key to your successful future in your hands. By practicing self-discipline, you can improve your game prior to stepping out onto the playing field. A methodical approach to life increases your chances to co-create the world you want to live in."
libra,2017-11-02,"You want to talk with someone about a sensitive issue today, but you can’t just trust anyone with your story -- especially if you’re trying to sort out a delicate relationship dilemma. Although you know that an objective opinion is just what you need, you’re afraid of placing yourself in a vulnerable position by revealing information you prefer to keep private. Choosing the right person to be your confidant is crucial, so avoid making an impulsive choice. However, this opportunity to share will pass, so do it while you have the chance. Author Erica Jong wrote, “If you don’t risk anything, you risk even more.”"
scorpio,2017-11-02,"You may be questioning your ability to live up to people’s expectations. Meanwhile, others believe you’re doing a fantastic job because they think your level of confidence is high. Ironically, your self-doubt increases when you learn of someone’s inflated praise for your work. Fortunately, you can break this vicious cycle once and for all by simply choosing to perform to your own standards rather than anyone else’s. Author Suzy Kassem wrote, “Doubt kills more dreams than failure ever will.”"
sagittarius,2017-11-02,"You might feel as if you recently learned a tough lesson about setting your goals too high. But instead of letting discouragement stand in the way of success, review your progress and reestablish your priorities based upon what you now know. No matter what you currently believe, you don’t have to settle for less. Lowering your expectations is a short-term strategy that allows you to accomplish your objective, which, in turn, builds your confidence and prepares you for the next hurdle. Remember, you didn’t come this far to only come this far."
capricorn,2017-11-02,"Putting your finger on the source of an energetic blockage can be challenging. Perhaps you feel that something is obstructing your road to success. Maybe you are aware of a repetitive cycle that manifests setbacks or obstacles in your path when you get close to achieving your dream. There’s no reason to despair, for these tests are actually signs that you’re on the right track. No one said reaching your goals would be easy. In fact, mythologist Joseph Campbell noted, “If the path before you is clear, you’re probably on someone else’s.”"
aquarius,2017-11-02,"Your determination to reach your career goals is strong. You’re even willing to withdraw socially for a while in order to devote more time to achieving fulfillment from your profession. Nevertheless, old emotional wounds could bring up buried resentment that comes to the surface when you must choose between work and play. Your emotional reactions grow extreme when you’re under pressure to make a choice. Although you might believe you’re onto a quick fix to a long-standing problem, it’s likely just a wild goose chase. Robin Sharma wrote, “Stop managing your time. Start managing your focus.”"
pisces,2017-11-02,"You could be uncertain about where you’re heading now but oddly enough, your lack of direction won’t necessarily slow you down. You have a general idea of your destination, yet you don’t have a clue as to how to get there. Resist impulsive urges to be creative; your departure is not as urgent as it seems. In the meantime, do everything you can to stabilize your current position. Arthur Ashe wrote, “Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can.”"
aries,2017-11-03,"Try as you might to express yourself authentically, reality is elusive today. You’re more than willing to explore the uncertainty of your emotions in search of stability, but each time you get close to the heart of the matter, the truth slips out of your reach. Although you may grow frustrated, thinking that you’ll never figure out what’s happening, eventually your persistence will pay off. In the meantime, cut yourself some slack and worry less about reconciling your intuitive perceptions with the current circumstances. A head full of fears has no space for dreams."
taurus,2017-11-03,"Your dreams can come true today as long as they are within reason. Although some of your fantasies might be far-fetched, you have the ability to discern which ones are realistic enough to pursue. However, limiting your process of imagination is a mistake; let your thoughts carry you wherever they may. It’s tempting to bask in the glow of your own light, but manifestation requires action and perseverance. The more alternatives you have to choose from, the greater the chance of finding a golden opportunity."
gemini,2017-11-03,"You may obsess over an idealistic plan about what you can accomplish professionally. Of course, keeping a journal doesn’t automatically mean you will write the next best-selling novel. However, reality doesn’t prevent you from fantasizing about impossible goals. Although you might fall short when you compare your current circumstances with your unrestrained visions, don’t let that stop you from dreaming. Abolitionist Harriet Tubman said, “Always remember, you have within you the strength, the patience, and the passion to reach for the stars to change the world.”"
cancer,2017-11-03,"Concentrating on your work requires an intense effort today because your thoughts are drifting into the distant future. Uncharacteristically, you’re just as comfortable thinking about tomorrow as you are remembering yesterday. But living only in the realm of potential doesn’t empower your current actions. Fortunately, you receive a blast of cosmic pragmatism from the down-to-earth Taurus Moon that grounds the energy of your 11th House of Long-Term Goals. Imagine the possibilities, but keep your finger on the pulse of the present moment."
leo,2017-11-03,"Your fantasies are so vivid today that they might confuse you. The good news is that everything is shrouded in a beautiful haze that hides the imperfections of the three-dimensional realms. Meanwhile, you hold your perceptions to be accurate indicators of what reality might be. Unfortunately, your sense organs are more likely to describe you than the world around you. Albert Einstein said, “Reality is merely an illusion, albeit a very persistent one.”"
virgo,2017-11-03,"You want to cooperate with people in your immediate environment, but find it nearly impossible to do so. Coworkers are confusing when they say one thing yet mean something entirely different. Nevertheless, you won’t let misunderstandings get in the way of your larger plans. There’s no stopping you today if you can remain open to the conflicting messages you’re receiving. As much as you wish a simple answer was obvious, it’s not. Thankfully, the incomprehensible quality of relationships now is counterbalanced by your commitment to finding the truth, even if it takes time."
libra,2017-11-03,"You are a walking paradox today. You appear to be as sensible as anyone, but your feet are not really on the ground. Although realistic Saturn is manifesting practical magic through valuable Venus in your 1st House of Self, other planetary indicators are elevating the importance of your spiritual pursuits now. Nevertheless, clarifying your real-world objectives helps you filter out the extraneous noise. Ultimately, dancing in the gray zone between self and other, night and day, or fact and fiction is where you’ll find the most valuable rewards."
scorpio,2017-11-03,"Someone in your life may be the source of your angst today as he or she seems to have all of the answers, but no questions. Meanwhile, your mind is churning out fantasy vignettes faster than you can analyze them for meaning. Don’t impede the process by shifting into an intellectual approach. Thoughts won’t take you far now at all. Watery emotions may move slower than airy ideas, but the currents are stronger than breezes and will endure. Stop thinking so much and just go where your heart takes you."
sagittarius,2017-11-03,"You might think that your shot at fame and fortune has already come and gone, but there will be many more chances for you to proudly strut your stuff. Although you prefer to work behind the scenes now, you’ll step onto center stage as soon as you think it’s necessary. Thankfully, your performance will be top notch if you have the courage to trust your imagination. Once you dream it, you can make it real."
capricorn,2017-11-03,"Although your vision of the future may be quite concrete -- with lots of specifics colored in with illuminating detail -- you still could feel lost because you don’t know which way to turn next. You’re not happy when your course of action is unclear. In fact, you might actually pretend to have a game plan in your possession so you don’t look ill-prepared for the tasks ahead. Nevertheless, there’s no valid reason to project false self-confidence now. Author Eckhart Tolle wrote, “When you become comfortable with uncertainty, infinite possibilities open up in your life.”"
aquarius,2017-11-03,"There is no career goal that’s out of reach now and no personal dream that’s impossible. Your vivid imagination has snatched the reins of control away from reason. You recently bumped up against your limitations and are now ready for another attempt to break through them. Fortunately, inspirational Neptune is harmonizing with the willful Sun as it shines in your 10th House of Status, blessing you with the power of positive thought. Yesterday’s impossibilities are today’s probabilities."
pisces,2017-11-03,"You are hooked on your search for truth today and won’t stop until you find it. The passionate Scorpio Sun is illuminating your 9th House Journeys, urging you to head out prior to answering your existential questions. However, you may be so good at spinning yards while dreamy Neptune is in the picture, that you slip into believing in the truth of your fantastic stories right along with everyone else. Businessman Robert Half said, “Convincing yourself does not win an argument.”"
aries,2017-11-04,"Your longing for emotional harmony prompts you to consider someone else’s feelings prior to your own. But the stubborn Taurus Full Moon illuminates your 2nd House of Values, making it next to impossible to deny your core beliefs for the sake of tranquility. Nevertheless, it’s possible to balance your drive for authenticity with your desire for excitement. Instead of focusing on your needs alone, shift your attention to the give and take of communication. Enhance the passion you seek by listening with an open heart, without the need to get in the last word."
taurus,2017-11-04,"You’re willing to go to extremes if you believe your behavior will lead to stability in a relationship. The pragmatic Taurus Full Moon brightens your 1st House of Self, giving you a chance to reflect on your fundamental needs. Although you want the emotional security that typically comes with a partnership, you might be afraid to reveal your more radical desires. Nevertheless, being honest about your fantasies with someone you trust is less of a risk than keeping silent. Croatian author Eraldo Banovac wrote, “Telling the truth is less demanding than telling a lie.”"
gemini,2017-11-04,"You know there are parts of your regular routine that no longer serve you well, but you don’t want to lose the precious gains you’ve already made. However, your inner turmoil may not be obvious to those who only see your eagerness to participate in the fun. The Taurus Full Moon highlights your 12th House of Privacy, tempting you to simply keep your thoughts to yourself and wait until the storm blows over. But destiny might have other plans for you if you’re unwilling to show up honestly for your friends. A French proverb claims, “You often meet your fate on the road you take to avoid it.”"
cancer,2017-11-04,"Your network of family and friends is your lifeline and you know you can rely on others when you need them. The Taurus Full Moon stabilizes your 11th House of Community, surrounding you with the emotional comfort you seek. Nevertheless, the relationship between your inner and outer worlds is tense now because of larger uncertainties from global, political and social spheres. Your current happiness depends upon your ability to discern what you can control from what you cannot. Joan Borysenko wrote, “Every day brings a choice: to practice stress or to practice peace.”"
leo,2017-11-04,"Reflecting on your life purpose helps you clarify your current path. Although you want to share your plans with friends so they can support your efforts, you’re not seeking their advice. The fixed Taurus Full Moon shines in your 10th House of Authority, encouraging you to take complete responsibility for deciding your place in the world. Nevertheless, you reserve the right to change your mind without warning if new data warrants a mid-course correction. A Chinese proverb teaches, “A wise man adapts himself to circumstances, as water shapes itself to the vessel that contains it.”"
virgo,2017-11-04,"Although you know the importance of being practical, you simultaneously feel as if you are somehow above mundane consideration today. The Taurus Full Moon emphasizes your 9th House of Higher Truth, shifting your focus from obtaining tangible results to considering philosophical contingencies. Nevertheless, you cannot avoid the cause-and-effect relationship between your behavior and reality. Ultimately, you get what you deserve because karma always come around to even the score."
libra,2017-11-04,"Simplifying your life sounds like a wonderful idea, but the complications of human emotions turn a casual interaction into a serious melodrama. The unavoidable Taurus Full Moon lands in your 8th House of Deep Sharing, inviting you to approach a conversation with unrestrained curiosity and an open mind. Much to your chagrin, your off-the-cuff remarks can instigate an intense exchange that won’t necessarily lead anywhere productive. Be gracious and have patience; the verbal conflict will likely settle back down as quickly as it erupts. Give others the respect you wish to receive in return."
scorpio,2017-11-04,"Someone may be so obstinate today about a trivial matter that you decide to make an end run around the issue to move past the conflict. However, your evasive tactics don’t resolve the tension that’s created by the single-minded Taurus Full Moon in your 7th House of Significant Others. An unconventional approach to finding a remedy is required since you are probably as resolute as your counterpart. Human rights activist Dorothy Thomas wrote, “Peace is not the absence of conflict, but the ability to cope with it.”"
sagittarius,2017-11-04,"You just want to go about your chores today, uninterrupted by anyone else’s agenda. The determined Taurus Full Moon settles into your 6th House of Logistics, encouraging you to make a plan and stick to it. Unfortunately, you may choose to ignore the presence of your friends who are insistent on including you in their shenanigans. Thankfully, a slight modification to your schedule might be all that’s required for you to join the fun. Author Simon Sinek wrote, “The goal is to make our work and our play indistinguishable.”"
capricorn,2017-11-04,"The nice thing about being a hard worker is your ability to occasionally schedule well-deserved time off. The Taurus Full Moon invigorates your 5th House of Fun and Games, giving you the go-ahead to run wild while you can. Just remember that everything you do has consequences, even if you have good intentions. Nevertheless, you may doubt your decision to play if others judge your behavior as irresponsible. Buddhist teacher Thich Nhat Hanh said, “To be beautiful means to be yourself. You don’t need to be accepted by others. You need to accept yourself.”"
aquarius,2017-11-04,"You like the idea of escaping from the status quo, if only to create a bit of excitement in your world. While others balk at the notion of chaos, it actually gives you the freedom to do what you want, unnoticed by everyone trying to regain a sense of order. Temporary domestic uncertainty doesn’t rock your boat while the steadfast Taurus Full Moon anchors your 4th House of Home and Family. Go ahead and have your fun as long as you don’t do it at the expense of anyone else. Author Kurt Vonnegut wrote, “If you can do no good, at least do no harm.”"
pisces,2017-11-04,"You don’t want any surprises in your corner of the world today. The unwavering Taurus Full Moon floods your 3rd House of Communication, immersing you in a deluge of information that may or may not be of practical use. Nevertheless, you must assimilate the incoming data so you can make the necessary decisions about what to take or leave. Although you might attempt to employ logic to sort through the noise, ultimately relying on your intuition will bring the best results. Steve Jobs said, “Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice."""
aries,2017-11-05,"Although today is a day of rest for some people, you’re too busy to think about relaxing. The Moon’s shift into your 3rd House of Communication keeps you hopping with an endless flow of phone calls, emails and texts. Everyone seems to enjoy their interactions with you now because of your optimistic outlook and enthusiastic response. Thankfully, there’s much to be learned from this stream of casual interactions with friends. Kindness grows where kindness is sowed."
taurus,2017-11-05,"Your friends might seem a bit flighty today but you want them to come back to Earth for a serious conversation about an important topic. You wish they would react with passion from the heart rather than hiding behind cool rationality. Nevertheless, other people’s intellectual idealism is so reassuring that you want to believe them. Thankfully, there’s no reason to look for stress when it’s not there. The Dalai Lama teaches, “Do not let the behavior of others destroy your inner peace.”"
gemini,2017-11-05,"Focusing on one thing at a time is challenging today. You want to do everything in the present moment and cannot understand why this is impossible. Someone might try to show you the folly of your ways, but you may need to learn for yourself. In the meantime, you could thoroughly enjoy indulging every whim, even if you seem scattered to others. Nevertheless, paring back your activities just a bit allows you to experience each one more profoundly. Author Terry Tempest Williams wrote, “To slow down is to be taken into the soul of things.”"
cancer,2017-11-05,"Your thoughts are racing through your mind and they seem to have a life of their own. You might try to ignore them, but the more you shift your focus to other things, the louder they become. Instead of burying your ideas -- however irrelevant they may seem -- try sharing them with a friend and see where the conversation goes. You don’t need to have an agenda, just a willingness to engage in an open dialogue without any desire to lead it in any particular direction. As the Beatles sang, “Oh that magic feeling... nowhere to go.”"
leo,2017-11-05,"You’re less interested in what you do today than you are in planning for your future. However, you don’t feel any pressure to come up with a specific strategy; you are content to dream about all the possibilities that stretch out before you. Still, some idea might be exciting enough that you want to initiate action immediately. It’s not time to get hung up in practicalities; express your intentions however you can. Psychologist Brene Brown wrote, “What's the greater risk? Letting go of what people think - or letting go of how I feel, what I believe, and who I am?”"
virgo,2017-11-05,"You may feel as if you’re in a poem by Robert Frost, standing at the divergence of two roads. You’re not sure which one will further your success, but the dualistic Gemini Moon’s visit to your 10th House of Status makes it difficult to eliminate either. Although you might be required to make a choice now, there is no reason to squelch the other dream. You can follow one path while keeping the other alive in your heart."
libra,2017-11-05,"The walls that normally keep you on course have suddenly disappeared. The Moon’s move into your 9th House of Faraway Places pulls your attention away from the most pressing concerns and far into the future. Although it might seem frightening at first because there’s nothing to prevent you from making a wrong move, you have the freedom now to explore options that were previously off limits. But before you do something you regret, entertain the various possibilities in your imagination rather than in reality. You must arrive somewhere in your mind prior to finding your way there in real life."
scorpio,2017-11-05,"You possess the ability to analyze your emotions with logic rather than passion today. Thankfully, this objective approach paves the way for you to tackle a complicated issue. Taking a philosophical look at those things that are the most important to you enables you to dig right to the core of your beliefs. Just remember that overconfidence doesn’t serve you well because you might forget the gravity of a situation when other people’s feelings are involved, too. Author Mason Cooley wrote, “Compassion brings us to a stop, and for a moment we rise above ourselves.”"
sagittarius,2017-11-05,"Your cavalier approach to a relationship may not sit well with the other person. Don’t try to avoid an in-depth discussion just because it could bring up an uncomfortable topic. If someone wants to talk things over, your job now is to create safe space for the conversation. Communication isn’t always easy, especially when there is a real and defined difference of opinions. Nevertheless, the tension will likely begin to dissipate once the door to compromise is opened. Statesman Mark Udall said, “Genuine dialogue, not rhetorical bomb-throwing, leads to progress.”"
capricorn,2017-11-05,"You can think of so many little ways you can improve your health today that you might feel unable to make up your mind and do any one of the them. Ironically, you’re often a master of developing successful strategies, but you can’t seem to settle on even the simplest of plans now. Every new idea leads to several others, adding more branches to your tree of possibilities. Go ahead and enjoy the view as long as you remember you can’t do it all. Author Seth Godin wrote, “In a world where we have too many choices and too little time, the obvious thing to do is just ignore stuff.”"
aquarius,2017-11-05,"Your communication skills enable you to say exactly what you mean today, leaving little doubt in anyone’s mind about your true intentions. Thankfully, you can easily win people over to your side of an argument by ignoring convention and taking a creative approach to sharing whatever is on your mind. Don’t stop to think about someone’s reaction now because it will only introduce a seed of doubt into your thinking process. Poet Letitia Elizabeth Landon wrote, “Of all the follies that we can commit, the greatest is to hesitate.”"
pisces,2017-11-05,"You may do your best thinking at home today, even if you’re devising a strategy to reach your objectives at work next week. Although you’re envisioning the future, your effective planning range now can be measured in days, not weeks. You realize that the more specific you are now, the more effective you will be. Nevertheless, don’t lose sight of the bigger picture; your daily routine will only make sense once you see it in light of the greater whole. Perspective changes everything."
aries,2017-11-06,"Prioritizing your activities is challenging today because every idea that pops into your head seems like the most amazing one you ever had. Mental Mercury's visit to your 9th House of Big Ideas provides a seemingly endless stream of inspirational visions. Unfortunately, you can't indiscriminately chase the thought of the moment and still expect to accomplish anything tangible. Being mindful of the need for self-restraint throughout the day will prevent discouragement later on. Poet Dorothy Parker wrote, ""Creativity is a wild mind and a disciplined eye."""

Psychologist Brene Brown wrote, ""Until we can receive with an open heart, we're never really giving with an open heart."""
gemini,2017-11-06,"You can roll with incoming waves of unexpected change today because you're eager to engage each moment as if it were a puzzle rather than an obstacle.

leo,2017-11-06,"You are motivated to declare your idealistic views today, but it's not just because you're seeking approval from a friendly audience. In fact, you already know your fans are going to love your ideas. Your true motivation now is to flaunt your ability to put your thoughts into words while clever Mercury moves through your 5th House of Self-Expression. However, you must follow through by transforming your message into concrete action or your performance will be for naught. Greek philosopher Epictetus wrote, ""It's so simple really: If you say you're going to do something, do it. If you start something, finish it."""
virgo,2017-11-06,"Although your responsibilities may be varied today, you strive to stay true to your soul's purpose. However, sometimes it's tough to know what's most important in the grand scheme of things. Rather than jumping from one task to another, retreat long enough to reconnect with your inner wisdom while quicksilver Mercury settles into your 4th House of Roots. Luckily, your intuition won't let you down as long as you take the time to tune into the stillness within. Quieting the mind allows your heart to speak its truth."
libra,2017-11-06,"You have big ideas about how much you can fit into your day now. Although there are only a finite number of hours available for working, rational Mercury in your 3rd House of Immediate Environment enables you to justify an overbooked schedule. You believe anything is possible, but soon discover there are practical limits on your capabilities if you attempt to stretch reality too far. Unleash your exuberance where you can do the most good."
scorpio,2017-11-06,"You may be juggling numbers today in order to purchase something special. Since your coveted acquisition isn't necessarily in your current budget, you need to make sure you can actually afford to spend the money. Fortunately, you're able to explore your options from at least a couple of different vantage points while thoughtful Mercury is hanging out in your 2nd House of Finances. Ultimately, it's easier to justify your actions if you believe you're making an investment.

However, finding solid footing is tough when everywhere you step seems to be as diaphanous as your thoughts.

Electric Uranus sparks chatty Mercury in your 11th House of Social Networks, increasing your inclination to connect with others. You might believe that everyone is as wired to the rest of the group as you, only to discover that you have overestimated their level of participation. Honest communication is key to finding the answers you seek. Author Don Miguel Ruiz wrote, ""The way to keep yourself from making assumptions is to ask questions."""
pisces,2017-11-06,"You have high hopes for a swift climb to the top of your profession. You believe that everything is in place now, and you are just waiting to be recognized and promoted. Unfortunately, you could easily misread the signs since trickster Mercury is triggering your 10th House of Status; the road to success may be more circuitous than you think. Prepare for the long haul if you want to excel. Don't be afraid of setting new goals that are beyond your current reach. Norman Vincent Peale wrote, ""Shoot for the Moon. Even if you miss, you'll land among the stars."""
aries,2017-11-07,"You may grow anxious today as you struggle to use your logic to manage your feelings. You're willing to explore the irrational realms of emotions because you enjoy the accompanying adrenaline rush that stems from your inability to handle a situation. But you're in a love-hate relationship with your need to be in control. Experiencing chaos is thrilling, but only for a few minutes at a time. The excitement quickly fades when you realize the magnitude of your uncertainty. Actor Tom Hanks said, ""A hero is somebody who voluntarily walks into the unknown."""
taurus,2017-11-07,"You might be attracted to someone today because they are so different from you. Although you enjoy the simple things of life, you could find yourself fascinated with the most complicated person you ever met. You may feel a compulsive need to connect with the flip side of your coin. But some relationships are better left to the imagination because of the problems they create in the real world. Spiritual teacher Jean Houston said, ""No matter the situation, never let your emotions overpower your intelligence."""
gemini,2017-11-07,"You long to be left to your own devices today and you don't want any distractions. In fact, you could temporarily shut everyone out to avoid a potentially awkward moment. You can see a positive outcome for the work you do, but your road to success is not a straight one. Thankfully, your concentration is unparalleled now, making it difficult for anyone to impede your progress. Create a plan, narrow your field of vision, and don't take your eyes off your goal until you reach it."
cancer,2017-11-07,"Your state of heightened sensitivity is a mixed blessing today. You can intuitively sense people's reactions to the complex dynamics before they are even aware of their own emotions. Nevertheless, you can't say anything yet or your response will fall on deaf ears. Respecting someone's personal space creates an opportunity for them to talk. You must wait until the subject is brought up for discussion by the other person before sharing your opinion on the matter. As Tom Petty sang, ""The waiting is the hardest part."""
leo,2017-11-07,"You don't want people to know that you're wrestling with feelings that don't fit into your immediate situation. Rather than complicating the current circumstances, you may think it's easier to just keep your personal drama to yourself. You might be surprised how easy it is to continue a conversation by chatting about everything except what's in your heart. However, creating a split between your inner and outer worlds only amplifies your stress. President James A. Garfield wrote, ""The truth will set you free, but first it will make you miserable."""
virgo,2017-11-07,"Your desires are extremely focused today; you know what you want and can share your needs with great clarity. In fact, your words might be so direct now that you catch others off guard. People don't have sufficient time to erect barriers, especially if they hope to avoid a conversation that is too revealing. But you are a master of strategy and can slide right past someone's defensive perimeter before they know what happened. Author Jim Rohn wrote, ""If you just communicate, you can get by. But if you communicate skillfully, you can work miracles."""
libra,2017-11-07,"You might act tough today, but those close to you can see right through your game face. The truth is you care so much about others that everyone with a wounded heart or self-doubting brain becomes your next project. However, you worry that your attempts at fixing them will likely fall short of your intentions, prompting you to emotionally withdraw so people don't see your vulnerability. Stop hiding behind your fears. Push through your self-judgment and reveal your softer side. There's no need for you to solve anyone else's problems. Just showing up with your integrity intact does more good than you realize."
scorpio,2017-11-07,"You might be unclear about your long-term goals now, but you can't bury your feelings in the present moment. You know in your heart that love is the answer, no matter what the question is. Unfortunately, sharing your personal stories can make someone uncomfortable, especially if they think you're revealing more than they need to know. Nevertheless, this is not a good enough reason to hide behind a veil of social acceptability. Take a risk and confront your self-imposed limitations. If not now, when? If not you, who?"
sagittarius,2017-11-07,"You continue to ride a wave of self-confidence today, but you're also beginning to wonder if too much disclosure starts to lessen the impact of your words. You still move through your day portraying the optimist, especially if you consciously refocus your intentions on your objective. However, something is lost when you're so singularly attentive to one goal. Soften your resolve just a bit and make space for the magic to enter your life from the outside in."
capricorn,2017-11-07,"You are extremely selective when it comes to expressing your feelings to others. Obviously, you must trust the person first and they need to demonstrate their loyalty to you. However, you're more than willing to deepen a friendship or to take a potential romance to the next level once certain requirements have been met. However, navigating interpersonal relationships is not an all-or-nothing proposition. Don't jump in too hard and fast, or you could easily frighten away the very person you're trying to attract. The magnet of love requires a gentle touch."
aquarius,2017-11-07,"Paradoxically, quietly working behind the scenes today can gain you notoriety. You're happiest now when you're efficiently performing your work-related chores, whether or not anyone notices. In fact, every task you complete places you one step closer to your long-term goals. Fortunately, karma is operating in your favor now and your current concentration on the details will be rewarded sooner than you expect. Tony Robbins teaches, ""It's not what we do once in a while that shapes our lives. It's what we do consistently."""
pisces,2017-11-07,"You're dreaming of that fantasy getaway again, but this time you vow to make it come true. Luckily, your financial outlook is optimistic now, and you might be able to swing your vacation by next summer. But don't just run off the deep end; create a travel budget and start putting away a set amount of money every month. You'll have the resources you need to pull off another amazing adventure before you know it. Abraham-Hicks said, ""Use your imagination until your big dream feels so familiar that the manifestation is the next logical step."""
aries,2017-11-08,"Although you expect others to reveal their secrets and share their feelings with you, you might not be willing to respond in the same manner. Unfortunately, one-way communication creates an awkward dynamic that sabotages your intentions to deepen a relationship. Self-analysis can help you to pinpoint the source of your resistance to open up. You may be afraid of being vulnerable if you show your cards. Obstacles are put in your path to see if what you want is really worth fighting for now. Your willingness to push past your fears determines your happiness."
taurus,2017-11-08,"You’re very empathic today, but you may be picking up something on your emotional radar that you can’t quite wrap your head around. You can tell that you’re missing some facts and you’re on a mission to find them. But if you just start asking a bunch of questions, the information you’re seeking becomes even harder to find. The most fruitful approach to your search is an indirect one now. Watch for signs and follow your instincts. You already know the truth; you only need to remember it."
gemini,2017-11-08,"You might find yourself in a struggle for control with a powerful person today. Or you may need to clarify financial arrangements with a business partner. Either way, you won’t be able to reach a satisfactory settlement if you rely on force to make your case. Emotions, not logic, rule the day. Expressing your feelings without blaming anyone else allows trust to grow as others discover what you are willing to bring to the table. Ultimately, cooperation, not competition, leads to success."
cancer,2017-11-08,"Your coworkers might be afraid to discuss an important matter with you today because they’re worried that you’ll take their words too personally. But even if they say nothing, you may notice that there is an energetic break, leading you to assume the worst. Thankfully, you’re in no danger of contributing to the strange tension if you foster an emotionally safe space where anything can be shared without fear of judgment or retribution. A meaningful conversation turns a cold gray day into a bright sunny one."
leo,2017-11-08,"Telling someone what you want is nearly impossible today because isolating any one feeling is extremely complicated. Every single desire exists as part of a complex web of interrelated considerations. By sharing one thread, you’re not in any way describing the tapestry from which it came. You may need to use more tools than language alone in order to make your point. Psychiatrist William Glasser wrote, “If you want to change attitudes, start with a change in behavior.”"
virgo,2017-11-08,"Participating in planned activities with your community or your coworkers can be quite entertaining today, but solely defining your identity with your social experiences isn’t healthy. Spending time with others deepens your personal connections, but don’t surrender your power to discover who you are on your own. Hindu sage Ramana Maharshi said, “Your own self-realization is the greatest service you can render the world.”"
libra,2017-11-08,"You want your actions to be noticed by others today, yet you don’t necessarily agree with the principles behind your assignment. Logic tells you to go ahead and do your job, but your intuition is shouting no. Nevertheless, you take your role as a team player very seriously. You might think you’re demonstrating strength by remaining silent, but keeping your thoughts to yourself is actually a sign of weakness now. Thomas Carlyle wrote, “Conviction is worthless unless it is converted into conduct.”"
scorpio,2017-11-08,"You might not have a lot to say today, but you’re plugged into your most powerful feelings and you want to make sure everyone knows your position. There are many ways aside from words to effectively communicate with a significant other. Sharing a magical experience or expressing yourself through a gesture of love can be more meaningful than delivering a string of all the right words. Showing your appreciation through positive action conveys your message with a clarity that can’t be misunderstood."
sagittarius,2017-11-08,"An intense exchange with someone special can transcend the boundaries that normally define and confine you. But you won’t back down once you reveal your opinion on a sensitive topic. Standing up for your beliefs is normally admirable, but don’t let your stubbornness turn into a useless obsession. Experiencing the emotional power that’s being released now can feel overwhelming if it's bottled up. Stop making excuses today. Channel your passion into everything you do."
capricorn,2017-11-08,"A friend’s intuitive advice may push your buttons today. It’s as if others know what motivates you now and they show up ready to support your actions. But no one is demanding that you achieve greatness; their primary concern is to validate your dreams and nurture your soul. Fortunately, someone can make a real difference in your life without being rich or brilliant. All they need to do is demonstrate that they care. Love works in mysterious ways."
aquarius,2017-11-08,"Health-related issues may be on your mind today. You might modify your intake of vitamins and herbs if you’re feeling just a tad below the weather. But even if your stamina is strong, consider what improvements you could make to your daily regimen. Keep in mind that anything you do now, however inconsequential it seems, can have a profound influence over time. Confucius said, ""The man who moves a mountain begins by carrying away small stones."""
pisces,2017-11-08,"You’re quietly optimistic today, but might not let others know that you’re busy envisioning your ideal future. You may downplay your big dreams now because you really don’t want them to be scrutinized by anyone else just yet. There’s no need to waste precious time defending your plans when you prefer to share them only after things are further along in development. Don’t tell people your dreams. Show them."
aries,2017-11-09,"You believe you have a wonderful plan today, but you’re not quite sure how all the pieces will fit into place. It’s so easy to share your feelings with someone special that you might not consider all the factors that are converging on the current circumstances. Taking care of your own needs would be simple if there weren’t people’s conflicting needs to be managed, too. Being transparent with your intentions now is more important than having all the answers."
taurus,2017-11-09,"You can tell that pleasure is yours for the asking today but, ironically, you may not know who to ask. Nevertheless, you’re so motivated by the idea of indulgence that you’re still willing to start your quest. On the surface, your path to fulfillment could seem straightforward yet grows more complex once you begin. Instead of focusing only on the finish line, find the joy in your journey with every step you take now. If you get lost, just follow your soul; it knows the way."
gemini,2017-11-09,"In a perfect world, you could harness your colorful creativity and channel it into your job. You might even gain recognition for your self-expression. However, in the real world, you may end up frustrated if you assume you’ll be able to mix work and play without provoking trouble. Nevertheless, you can reduce the pressure to perform by changing the rules of the game. You don’t need to prove that you’re better than anyone else today since you’re the only one keeping score."
cancer,2017-11-09,"Although your dreams inspire you to strive for success, you might lack the fiery ambition to do something about making them come true. Unfortunately, inaction isn’t a viable option now, because it leads to dissatisfaction later. Thankfully, there is a middle path that enables you to find peace of mind today. Aim high, but with the understanding that your trajectory is a long-term process rather than an immediate goal. This strategy allows you to feel good about your efforts without having to bite off more than you can chew."
leo,2017-11-09,"You’re eager to step into the spotlight today and put on a show that will delight your audience. You might think that you can play nearly any role you wish, but others won’t be as convinced if your character is too far removed from reality. The most important factor now is your imagination. If you truly believe in yourself, so will everyone else. Your faith can move mountains."
virgo,2017-11-09,"You can list the pros and cons of working closely with someone else now, but you can’t decide if collaboration is worth the extra stress. It’s as if your vision is warped simultaneously by your dreams of success and your fears of failure. Unfortunately, rational analysis won’t help you cut through the current clouds of illusion. In fact, clarity may remain elusive today, no matter what you do. Nevertheless, don’t say maybe if you really want to say no. Establishing boundaries is easier right from the start."
libra,2017-11-09,"Your friends and associates may misinterpret your actions today, leaving you unsure of where you stand. But you’re less concerned about carrying out your plans than you are about maintaining a solid relationship with your support network. If you become aware of a growing gulf between you and others, your self-confidence could suffer. Fortunately, you can rely on honest communication to straighten out any wrinkles in your immediate environment. Essayist Joseph Joubert wrote, “The aim of an argument or discussion should not be victory, but progress.”"
scorpio,2017-11-09,"Connecting with like-minded folks who share your goals is at the top of your agenda today. However, you may be so driven to succeed that others find you too overbearing for their comfort. You can lay on the charm whenever you choose, but your motives will still be obvious enough that people might see through your mask. Granted, you’re not responsible for how everyone reacts to you, but a more subtle approach will surely allow you to progress further with your ideas. A proverb teaches, “Use soft words and hard arguments.”"
sagittarius,2017-11-09,"You’re not necessarily doing anything differently today, but everyone may see you as a natural-born leader. You’re comfortable making choices when others falter, especially if you know that you’re acting on behalf of the group, not just your own interests. Show your true colors instead of suppressing your take-charge instincts now. But monitor your actions for any trace of selfish activity for the sake of integrity. Alexandre Dumas wrote, “All for one and one for all; united we stand, divided we fall.”"
capricorn,2017-11-09,"You are like a four-star general on the battlefield of business today, whether you’re defending hard-earned territory or stepping into a new market. You possess a sharp instinct for outwitting the competition and your strategic decisions are second to none. However, you could lose your sense of perspective since each winning activity adds to your sense of invincibility. Fortunately, you can capitalize on your current achievements as long as you don’t overextend your position. Finding the right mix of confidence and humility is critical to your success."
aquarius,2017-11-09,"A trivial setback could be enough to catalyze a crisis of confidence today as you recollect a failure from your past. Although retrospection is useful as a tool for self-development, it can also become a hindrance if it becomes obsessive. Thankfully, it’s your choice: either slip back into familiar sentimental memories or look ahead toward the excitement of the unborn future. Author Tim Ferriss wrote, “Think big and don’t listen to people who tell you it can’t be done. Life’s too short to think small.”"
pisces,2017-11-09,"You prefer to make a big splash in a small pool today, rather than creating insignificant ripples in the universal ocean. Often, you’re able to lose yourself in a crowd or disappear within a school of fish. However, you want to be noticed now, and won’t take no for an answer. Thankfully, you are a shapeshifter and can appear to others nearly any way you choose. Deepak Chopra said, “Find the place inside yourself where nothing is impossible.”"
aries,2017-11-10,"You might try to keep your mind on work today, but it quickly drifts off to more enjoyable activities. Unfortunately, it’s all too tempting to waste precious time pursuing imaginary pleasures in your daydreams. But it’s also unproductive to initiate chasing unrealistic goals in the real world. Although you are the source of your frustration now, you can also be the solution. All you need to know is found within. Do what is right, not what is easy."
taurus,2017-11-10,You nostalgically remember a less stressful time in your past as you try to recreate the peace you seem to have lost. It’s tempting to leave your worldly responsibilities for another day while you sneak home and hide away. But your obligations never take care of themselves without your attention. You can’t believe that burying its head in the sand ever worked for an ostrich -- and it certainly won’t work for you now. Let all your yesterdays fade; happiness can only be found in the present moment.
gemini,2017-11-10,"You’re no stranger to sustaining a conversation, but can often get lost in casual chit-chat. Although the pursuit of trivia may be a lovely distraction, it will leave you quite unsatisfied today. You long for the give and take of dialogue, yet want to address emotional issues of substance. Uncharacteristically, you don’t care whether or not you find the answers to your questions as long as you learn something new in your current exploration about yourself and the ones you love. Author Gianna Perada Carini wrote, “Some things scratch the surface while others strike at your soul.”"
cancer,2017-11-10,"It’s tempting to recognize all your material possessions as the basis of your happiness. But giving external things the power to determine your emotional health is a path to be avoided. Naturally, having food and shelter, along with a few creature comforts is a great starting point. Thankfully, your attitude is under your control, and nothing can change your internal state of affairs. Greek philosopher Epicurus wrote, “He who is not satisfied with a little, is satisfied with nothing.”"
leo,2017-11-10,"Your ability to turn on the charm at will today encourages everyone to listen to your message. But others notice how fickle you are as you change your story as quickly as a breeze shifts direction. Thankfully, you can be quite convincing as long as you know when to stop preaching. Watching the subtle reactions on people’s faces enables you to quit talking while you’re still ahead. Nevertheless, all the strategizing in the world doesn’t measure up to the truth. Aristotle wrote, “Character may almost be called the most effective means of persuasion.”"
virgo,2017-11-10,"Trusting someone is difficult today, especially if you already feel misunderstood. You might hide your authentic self because you don’t want to be put in a position of having to defend your heart. But suppressing your emotions to feel safe is counterproductive, since your lack of sharing creates the very gulf between you and others that you’re trying to avoid. Fyodor Dostoyevsky wrote, “Much unhappiness has come into the world because of bewilderment and things left unsaid.”"
libra,2017-11-10,"It’s crucial to be consistent in your dealings with your friend today. But your moods may be overly reactive to the changing aspects of the Moon, prompting you to be emotionally inconsistent with those closest to you. But don’t be too rigid in your expectations or your wonderful intentions will backfire. You’ll be most successful in your endeavors if you can balance your opinions with what you learn from your social interactions. Emperor Julius Caesar said, “Experience is the teacher of all things.”"
scorpio,2017-11-10,"You quickly grasp the meaning behind unspoken words, giving you a distinct edge when working with others. You can utilize your intuitive hunches if you have the courage to act on them. However, you might also jump to a wrong conclusion if your feelings have been hurt or marginalized. A quick round of inner exploration may be useful as a remedial course now so you don’t end up taking an official stand against an imaginary enemy. Stop overthinking or you’ll just create problems that aren’t there. So many assume. So few know."
sagittarius,2017-11-10,"You’re cruising the backroads of your imagination, looking for ways to escape boredom and free your mind. The good news is you can dream up one contingency plan after another. The bad news is you may have so many ideas that you can’t remember any of them. It’s better to narrow your band of concentration by choosing one good scenario and manifesting it. Your current key to success is to limit your options. Stephen Covey wrote, “The main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing.”"
capricorn,2017-11-10,"Your current activities might require you to micromanage money or resources you share with others. It may be as simple as keeping track of several people’s schedules since time is a limited asset. But you are only one person involved in an investment or a project, and the coordination between the participants demands your attention. Don’t fall into the trap of worrying about your position more than anyone else’s. When there are multiple parties working together, you succeed or fail as a group."
aquarius,2017-11-10,"It may seem as if you are cool, calm and collected today while others are behaving in an overly emotional manner. However, it might be that you’re attracted to people who are in close contact with their feelings to compensate for your current detachment. The symbiotic relationship between these two approaches can be quite powerful. Your conceptual or mechanical mastery brings a much-needed intelligence to a relationship while someone else’s passion helps to set your imagination on fire. Osho taught, “Get out of your head and get into your heart. Think less, feel more.”"
pisces,2017-11-10,"You can imagine your way to sickness or to health today. The mind-body healing connection is particularly strong now, and your attitude makes all the difference in the world. If you’re tired or depressed, you may leave yourself open to unpleasant physical symptoms. But hiking in the woods, meditating on your blessings or listening to music improves your mental position and therefore strengthens your immune system. A proverb claims, “The body heals with play, the mind heals with laughter and the spirit heals with joy.”"
aries,2017-11-11,"You have run out of patience often over the past few months and once again might find yourself ready to cash in your chips. However, something is different now. It’s as if your previously crazy plan has solidified over time and is finally ready to see the light of day. Even if it feels like you’re rushing into something new, it could work beyond your wildest dreams if you can slow down the process and keep your long-term goal in mind. Dr. Abdul Kalam wrote, “Excellence is a continuous process and not an accident.”"
taurus,2017-11-11,"You may be more flexible now that you see exciting possibilities for your future beginning to take shape. However, you worry that your dreams could vanish in a flash. You’re aware that pushing a delicate process of emotional growth too hard or too fast might upset the equilibrium and damage what has already been created. But you also recognize that inaction is counterproductive. You have come a long way toward manifesting your vision. Acknowledging your progress helps to ameliorate your current fear. Slow and steady wins the race."
gemini,2017-11-11,"You might self-identify with Dr. Dolittle’s “Pushmi-Pullyu” as you receive cautionary admonitions from someone close to you while simultaneously being encouraged by someone else. At first, you’re inclined to listen to those saying yes because you truly want to do something new. However, you become more hesitant today as you think about what could go wrong. Ultimately, you will know in your gut if it’s time to put your plan into effect. Anais Nin wrote, “And the day came when the risk to remain tight in a bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom.”"
cancer,2017-11-11,"You crave more freedom at work but the nature of your commitments may prevent you from reaching your goal. You’re unwilling to sacrifice financial security for the sake of independence. Nevertheless, you’re probably seeing the options in terms of all or nothing. The real challenge now is to find ways to express yourself when you’re not on the job. Achieving satisfaction means balancing your need for personal fulfillment with meeting your ongoing responsibilities. Author Joshua L. Liebman wrote, “Maturity is achieved when a person postpones immediate pleasures for long-term values.”"
leo,2017-11-11,"Entering a new phase of personal development can be both thrilling and frightening. A sensible strategy to minimize the fear is to reinforce those routines that work while replacing those that don’t. But deciding which pieces to leave behind could be overwhelming. However, you might be relieved of this challenge now as unexpected circumstances seem to choose your fate. Fortunately, bringing the most satisfying parts of your life into the future sets you on a path to happiness. Poet Mark Strand wrote, “Old ways won’t open new doors.”"
virgo,2017-11-11,"Your past seems to catch up with you now, but you’re not doomed to repeat it. In fact, your current stroll down Memory Lane may be a perfect walk to take with a close friend or lover in order to free you from patterns that have outlived their usefulness. Don’t be trapped by the familiarity of your personal history. It has brought you to the present moment, but you are free to take any road you choose into the future. Deepak Chopra wrote, “No matter what the situation, remind yourself, ‘I have a choice.’”"
libra,2017-11-11,"Although an unexpected shift in the dynamics of a significant relationship might be upsetting at first, the ground feels more solid once the facts are out in the open. Thankfully, you can breathe a sigh of relief if you discover that your greatest fears were unfounded. Nevertheless, there may have been a grain of truth in your suspicions that, once discussed, can finally be put to rest. Better the devil you know than the devil you don’t."
scorpio,2017-11-11,"The regular routines of your life offer you emotional security, but they can also stifle your creativity. Shaking up your schedule is exactly what the doctor ordered. You might feel a bit out of sorts because you can’t fall back on familiar habits, but your exhilaration is worth the temporary loss of comfort. However, taking a different approach is only the first step. Capture your current enthusiasm by producing something of lasting value. Any project that adds beauty to your surroundings is worth embarking on now. Ralph Marston wrote, “What you do today can improve all of your tomorrows.”"
sagittarius,2017-11-11,"You are tired of waiting for the perfect moment to act. In fact, you’re ready to throw caution to the wind and go for a cosmic joyride. Although you don’t know where a gust might carry you, you aren’t tied to a particular destination; your goal is to be somewhere else. But your eagerness to fly is not about escaping your current situation; it’s about improving the overall quality of your life. Your actions may seem impulsive to others, but appearances don’t tell the whole story. Novelist Tom Robbins wrote, “You should never hesitate to trade your cow for a handful of magic beans.”"
capricorn,2017-11-11,"Your friends might think you are being silly because you’re overly cautious now. But you are worried that you don’t have all the facts and you’re willing to wait until you do before making a major move. Nevertheless, an unforeseen change of circumstances could catalyze your decision-making process today and cause you to forget about your prior concerns. Although you may surprise others and change your mind suddenly when you take a new course of action, your current choices are grounded in practicality. Amelia Earhart said, “The most effective way to do it is to do it.”"
aquarius,2017-11-11,"You’re hesitant to commit to a group activity today because it’s easier to say no right away than it is to establish boundaries later on. You’re afraid that people will expect more from you than you’re willing to give. However, you could be so adamant about the limits of your participation that you overstate your case when turning down an invitation. There’s no reason to be so blunt that you offend a friend or potential ally. A bit of diplomacy and kindness goes a long way to building community. Don’t cut off your nose to spite your face."
pisces,2017-11-11,"Envisioning ways to get ahead at work or inventing schemes to increase your income could actually lead to concrete actions. There’s no pressure to do anything today except to explore all the alternatives for advancement by running through every scenario in your mind. Ironically, it’s your willingness to let your imagination run free that can generate a radical breakthrough. You’re not going to make progress now through incremental steps. Your fantasies might not be as far-fetched as they seem. Set logic aside and dream the impossible dream."
aries,2017-11-12,"You are sure that a recent choice was the right one, but your confidence might create unnecessary conflict if a friend questions your wisdom. Dismissing someone’s valid concern without even considering its worth may be enough to escalate a sincere and caring inquiry into a full-blown argument. Unfortunately, the real issue can quickly be lost as emotions cloud your thinking. Sometimes the protective walls you build are the biggest obstacles to intimacy. Rumi wrote, “Love is the bridge between you and everything.”"
taurus,2017-11-12,"You wish that every moment of the day could be planned in advance today to compensate for a lack of certainty that’s crept into your life. It’s not like you want to be that busy; you just need to feel like there are some variables you can control. Nevertheless, micromanaging every activity won’t bring you any closer to happiness. Rather than striving to create a false sense of security, find joy in the excitement of the unknown."
gemini,2017-11-12,"You might lack a clear understanding of your role in other people’s lives today. You strive to have a positive influence in all your relationships, but it’s nearly impossible now to discern the direct consequences of your actions. Although being of service to your friends is an admirable goal, attempts to gain their approval may turn into a wild goose chase. Mark Nepo wrote, “The flower doesn’t dream of the bee. It blossoms and the bee comes.”"
cancer,2017-11-12,"Overloading people with a pile of facts is a distraction rather than a benefit today. Naturally, everyone craves credible information that empowers them to make the smartest decisions. But you can bury the truth quickly with a truckload of superfluous data. Instead of impeding progress by pulling everyone’s eyes off the main event, encourage each person to create their own perspective now. Sometimes supporting someone means getting out of their way."
leo,2017-11-12,"Gaining clarity about a business relationship requires your full commitment because you could be negatively judged if you’re not on the same page. Although you likely know your own strengths and weaknesses in great detail, others might harbor some misconceptions about your possible contributions to a partnership. Rather than using logic to predict the potential pitfalls of a collaborative effort, let your actions appeal to the highest ideals of everyone else."
virgo,2017-11-12,"You are attracted to artists, musicians and dreamers today. Paradoxically, you also know that these free spirits can be your downfall if their stories are so captivating that they distract you from your worldly commitments. Logically, you think you should keep your distance from anyone who simultaneously excites and confuses you. Nevertheless, the lure of partnership is irresistible while the Moon opposes Neptune. Don’t be deterred by your fears; relationship magic could enrich your life now if you’re willing to let down your guard and open your heart."
libra,2017-11-12,"Many unanswered questions are on your mind today, yet you won’t likely let others know of your concerns. You prefer to put up a defensive front so no one suspects that you’re experiencing doubt. But the amount of psychic energy necessary to hide your uncertainty can take its toll over time. Fortunately, a more radical approach brings your worries to the surface. Trusting someone enough to be honest about your feelings leads to a surprising positive turn of events."
scorpio,2017-11-12,"A torrent of creativity may be building behind a dam that is about to burst under the pressure. However, it’s difficult to see the potential when you are feeling the frustration of being blocked. Luckily, establishing an easy flow of artistic self-expression is easier than you realize. It’s like priming a pump that’s gone dry. Read one of your favorite poems or listen to music that makes you want to dance -- anything to get the juices flowing. Start slowly and watch the trickle build into a raging river of brilliance."
sagittarius,2017-11-12,"You live under the illusion of believing you can say nearly anything that’s on your mind. However, when people misinterpret your words today, you might wish you kept your thoughts to yourself. It’s as if there’s an invisible filter between your emotions and other people’s ears while the moody Moon squares communicator Mercury in your sign. Instead of unsuccessfully trying to explain your feelings, just wait until tomorrow before delivering your news. Some things should not be rushed."
capricorn,2017-11-12,"Making plans can be a form of enjoyment for you goal-oriented Capricorns. Nevertheless, some days are better than others for doing the foundational work that ultimately makes or breaks a project. Fortunately, a Moon-Pluto trine supplies you with a seemingly endless supply of energy and you are excited to make the most of this cosmic momentum. But don’t assume you have forever to launch a new enterprise. Time waits for no one."
aquarius,2017-11-12,"There are emotional complexities at play that you cannot quite decipher. You know you are missing part of the evidence that you need to strengthen your case, but you can’t describe what you don’t yet understand. Your most efficient way to gather data now is by asking direct questions to those in charge. If you are careful in your approach to avoid implying any blame today, you might just get solid answers to your inquiries. Integrity breeds integrity."
pisces,2017-11-12,"You might experience a bit of role reversal today as you show up to a meeting supported by a wealth of details. Unfortunately, someone else might criticize you for being lost in an analytical detour when it’s your emotions that reveal the real meaning. But you’re having a hard time trusting your feelings now, especially if expressing them is going to complicate matters. Make no mistake about it, the dynamics of a relationship will only grow significantly more convoluted if you remain silent. Speak now or forever suffer the consequences."
aries,2017-11-13,"Although the universe seems to be conspiring to bring you a double dose of pleasure today, your system can only handle so much before it reaches overload. Nevertheless, you could be so wrapped up in the experience now that you might overindulge before you come to your senses and say enough. Unfortunately, you could regret your disdain for limits if you wait too long. Will Rogers said, “Good judgment comes from experience, and a lot of that comes from bad judgment.”"
taurus,2017-11-13,"You may be very happy today because someone you adore treats you like royalty. There’s no reason to doubt any longer if you were uncertain about their feelings toward you. Nevertheless, there’s always room for confusion to slip into the current dynamics. A conversation could take a funny turn and lead you into uncharted territory. Take it all in stride; you don’t always need to know where you are going. Sometimes, it’s sufficient to simply be appreciative of receiving love and respect from those you love and respect."
gemini,2017-11-13,"You are the source of an endless stream of words today, but the water runs dry unless you have someone to act as your muse. You need the give and take of ideas in order to stimulate your imagination. But your creative collaboration won’t automatically occur with just anyone. Your partner in crime must possess the right combination of optimism and realism, along with a dash of emotional intensity. However, your current pickiness could backfire if everything isn’t exactly as you imagined. Actor Jason Kravitz said, “Be infinitely flexible and constantly amazed.”"
cancer,2017-11-13,"Your heart is smiling today because you’re able to feel the love within as well as the love directed your way. You are passionate when you talk about something that’s important to you and your exuberance is contagious. People don’t only want to know the facts; they also want to hear you tell an evocative tale of personal redemption now, whether or not it's completely true. Terry Pratchett wrote, “If you don’t turn your life into a story, you just become a part of someone else’s story.”"
leo,2017-11-13,"You are known to be dramatically expressive when you’re interacting with others. But your colorful words are only distractions today, obscuring your true emotions. You’re not worried about revealing your vulnerability or being rejected for your beliefs. You simply want enough privacy to work on healing your old wounds without any outside interference. You are ready to unload some emotional baggage before moving on to the next chapter of your life. Pema Chodron teaches, “Inner peace begins the moment you choose not to allow another person or event to control your emotions.”"
virgo,2017-11-13,"Your past may sneak up on you today, pulling you back into your own personal history. You can be flippantly cavalier about an event that still influences your decisions, but your actions are probably some form of denial. You might rationalize your behavior by thinking it doesn’t really matter because no one will notice. However, those closest to you can see through your attempts to hide your stress now, and accept you in spite of your frailties. The truth is your humanness makes you more lovable than you realize."
libra,2017-11-13,"You may be overly concerned about your wellbeing today, especially if you are feeling under the weather. But even if you are in great physical shape, you could be tired from keeping your life running orderly for so long. You need some time off for rest and relaxation now. Luckily, the cosmos is conjuring up something special on your behalf. If you are longing for a change in your routine, a break might be much closer than you think. Anne Lamott wrote, “Almost everything will work again if you unplug it for a few minutes... including you.”"
scorpio,2017-11-13,"Your charm is operating on overdrive today, giving you the ability to get what you want in an important negotiation. Others might not realize what hit them until it too late, but they will probably be surprised when they finally comprehend what they gave up in the final deal. However, it’s unfair to use your secret weapon of mind control on others. Be honest, state your needs, and keep kindness on your lips. The art of persuasion is best used when combined with the highest intentions."
sagittarius,2017-11-13,"It’s so easy for you to see the best in any situation today that you might end up exaggerating every time you open your mouth. But others can quickly spot when you stretch the truth or bend reality -- and they don’t approve of your tactics. Nevertheless, there are some secrets you can keep, making it impossible for anyone to tell whether or not you’re doing it on purpose. But things can become confusing because once you say something out loud, you could believe your own story. Honoring the fine line between the facts and your dreams prevents trouble from surfacing down the road."
capricorn,2017-11-13,"You can successfully hide your optimism today, which encourages people to side with you because they believe they are helping the underdog. However, nothing could be further from the truth. You are actually at the top of your game, but are afraid your looming success will put others off and motivate them to work against you. Nevertheless, your plan is ill conceived and will likely backfire. Sun Tzu wrote, “Pretend inferiority and encourage his arrogance.” Instead of playing games, just show up as your authentic self. Never let anyone dull your sparkle."
aquarius,2017-11-13,"You seem to have the Midas touch at work now and everything you become involved with turns wildly successful. Although fulfilling your commitments to your coworkers is very important to you, you must also keep yourself in tip-top shape or you’ll be of no use to anybody at all. Don’t wait for a perfect moment; create your future by acting in a positive manner every chance you get. This year will surely bring new opportunities through your current employment or your community at large. Robin Sharma wrote, “Dream big, start small, act now.”"
pisces,2017-11-13,"Concentrating on your work is nearly impossible when you are so captivated by your tantalizing fantasies about an upcoming trip. Although you must interact with teammates throughout the day, you can’t keep your mind on the details being discussed now. Your imagination is running wild; each meeting is like a pre-game locker room pep talk. Just remember that the ensuing activities are as real as they get. Hold onto your dreams, but not so tightly that they negatively impact your performance. Deepak Chopra teaches, “The choices you make today design your future.”"
aries,2017-11-14,"Understanding someone else’s perspective isn’t always the easiest thing for you to do. Although you might grasp the meaning of their words, practicing compassion can be an intellectual activity rather than an emotional experience. However, you are poised to make a breakthrough today as the reflective Libra Moon travels through your 7th House of Others. Let old self-limiting boundaries fall and open your heart to a wider spectrum of feelings. Entertaining multiple points of view brings you closer to the truth."
taurus,2017-11-14,"Your coworkers rely on your sense of fair play today as they try to untangle a complicated issue that’s affecting other employees. You are known for your pragmatic approach to problem solving. However, you also feel an intuitive connection with the underdog in the current conflict now that Chiron the Wounded Healer aligns with your key planet Venus. But nothing will be gained by taking sides. Listen to everyone’s stories with equal concern. Objectivity is your friend."
gemini,2017-11-14,"You possess an excellent sense of timing today when it comes to getting what you want. The diplomatic Libra Moon’s presence in your 5th House of Self-Expression enables you to say the right thing, but knowing when to stop talking is essential. In fact, you’re so smooth now that others might not even realize there is a negotiation in process. Your current charm comes with a warning: karma will come around quickly if you misuse your powers of persuasion. Author Roxana Jones wrote, “Transform selfishness into selflessness, life is that beautiful and that simple.”"
cancer,2017-11-14,"You are looking at the wide world through your picture window, safe and secure in your protected corner of the universe. Although you accept the limitations of your current circumstances, you wonder what it would be like to throw caution to the wind and buy a one-way ticket to an unknown destination. For now, you have the luxury of exploring this fantasy from your familiar home base. Keep the dream of adventure alive. Henry Miller wrote, “One’s destination is never a place, but rather a new way of looking at things.”"
leo,2017-11-14,"Your schedule seems to slip out of its constraints today, no matter how much attention you give it in advance. Whether you run behind because of circumstances beyond your control or a misunderstanding leads to delays, you might need to abandon your previous agenda and fly through the day by the seat of your pants. Placing blame on anyone, including yourself, is counterproductive. Author Steve Maraboli wrote, “The greatest step towards a life of simplicity is to learn to let go.”"
virgo,2017-11-14,"You’re trying to maintain your reputation for being efficient today, but everything you do seems to take more time than allotted. You can’t tell if you underestimated the complexity of a task or if you’re working slower than normal now. Either way, there’s a problem if others are dependent on your production schedule. Rather than allowing discouragement to hijack your day while you obsess about your shortcomings, focus on your progress. You can improve your attitude simply by imagining the glass half full, not half empty."
libra,2017-11-14,"Making up your mind is often challenging because you can naturally see both sides of an issue. Finalizing a decision is even harder today now that the moody Moon is visiting your ambivalent sign. But another layer of complication is added when you realize that neither available option works for you. Rather than accepting your current limitations, you may become angry because you're feeling trapped. However, no one said you couldn’t explore more alternatives. Author T.F. Hodge wrote, “Freedom is realizing you have a choice.”"
scorpio,2017-11-14,"Trusting the blessings that arrive at your doorstep now can be an uphill battle. You have an eye for realism and usually spot trouble before it arrives. Unfortunately, you may be so good at unearthing what’s hidden that you turn a perfectly lovely situation into a swamp full of alligators. Your powers of manifestation are so strong that reality might actually conform to your fears. Don’t ignore your intuition, but be certain you’re not dredging up issues from the past that will negatively impact the present. Sanaya Roman wrote, “Whatever you appreciate and give thanks for will increase in your life.”"
sagittarius,2017-11-14,"You’re eager to do something enjoyable with your friends today, and you’re willing to be the ringleader if necessary. But you may have a hidden agenda in wanting others to participate in your activities because you believe they will support you no matter what kind of mischief you manifest. However, you’re probably reading the energy wrong. It’s more likely that people are ambivalent about your proposal and will bail if they sense anything is out of balance. Be wise and reassess your plan before you involve anyone else. Better safe than sorry."
capricorn,2017-11-14,"Your public image is important to you because you sincerely wish to be taken seriously by your peers. Although you normally strive to be known for your competence, you’re more interested now in appearing fair to all parties involved. You are happy to temporarily brush aside your authority and power today so you can become the consummate diplomat. English poet Francis Quarles wrote, “Blessedness is promised to the peacemaker not the conqueror.”"
aquarius,2017-11-14,"You may explore a variety of possibilities to learn more about the world in which you live. You’re motivated now to improve your position at work and you think that additional education could be your ticket to advancement. Although there is an obvious link between your schooling and your job, more knowledge isn't the only thing that will impact your career trajectory. It never hurts to check in with a life coach or mentor before making a final decision that will determine your success."
pisces,2017-11-14,"You’re ready for some emotional deep-diving today, and you won’t be satisfied with casual conversations about trivial matters. Although your current explorations are more fun when shared with a trusted friend or lover, you can rely on a variety of spiritual pursuits to assist your journey. Personal disclosure might feel awkward at first, but with a bit of practice under your belt, your journey of self-discovery is destined to grow into an epic tale of adventure."
aries,2017-11-15,"Your interactions with someone might become quite adversarial today, even if you believed you were both on the same team. You can easily justify your behavior, claiming it is appropriate in light of the other person’s verbal aggression. But everything is subjective, and the perceived attack may have been much milder than you think. In fact, you are wired for action and reaction, ready to jump at a moment’s notice. Although your instincts are to engage head-on, you know better. Mahatma Gandhi said, “An eye for an eye will only make the whole world blind.”"
taurus,2017-11-15,"You are not a fan of relationship conflict and normally do almost anything to avoid it. However, you’re quick to see red if someone’s inconsiderate behavior disrupts your day. You thrive on the stability offered by routine and are quite irritated when it’s suddenly interrupted. But rather than impulsively lashing out at an unsuspecting person today, imagine where your anger might lead. Whether or not you acknowledge it, your words have consequences that extend beyond the moment you utter them. Think twice so you only have to speak once."
gemini,2017-11-15,"Your friendships seem precariously unstable now as work-related obligations make others less available. You encourage people take care of their own responsibilities, but you also want them to leave more room to pursue mutual interests with you. Although you know you’re being unreasonable today, your hurt feelings may prompt you to say something you later regret. Count to ten before doing anything that could jeopardize a healthy relationship. If you’re still inclined to overextend your demands, count to twenty. Foolish behavior based on transient emotions hardly ever makes sense in the long-run."
cancer,2017-11-15,"A new boss might be overbearing today, and you don’t know how to fit the extra work into your busy schedule. Unfortunately, it seems like everyone is expecting more than you can hope to deliver. Your growing anxiety about letting someone down may be unsettling, but you can overcome your worries by focusing on the desired goal rather than the fear of failure. Thankfully, the cosmos supports your efforts to meet your obligations now. Your positive attitude coupled with hard work will take you further than you think. J.K. Rowling wrote, “Anything’s possible if you’ve got enough nerve.”"
leo,2017-11-15,"You aren’t happy if someone challenges you today. You might be sharing an experience or stating your position on a certain matter only to run into a critic who marginalizes your words. Taking time to defend a simple statement or opinion is annoying, but it’s worth your time and effort now. You don’t need to attack anyone for putting you through your paces. Simply respond to the objections as clearly as possible and then let the matter go. Standing up for your beliefs inspires others to do the same."
virgo,2017-11-15,"You might think you have a solid handle on your finances, so you’re quite surprised when an unexpected expense throws your budget out of whack today. Your immediate reaction to any sort of cash flow problem is one of stress but this only aggravates matters more. Take a deep breath and analyze the situation with an objective eye. Fortunately, a logical approach will reveal a workable solution to the temporary crisis quicker than you think. Dave Ramsey wrote, “You must gain control over your money or the lack of it will forever control you.”"
libra,2017-11-15,"Sometimes people think they can get away with bad behavior around you because you’re so fast to forgive. But your strong reaction to someone’s impetuous antics could surprise them enough to make them wish they were more thoughtful. However, your kindness is often mistaken for weakness. Practicing compassion is wonderful, but occasionally setting boundaries is necessary to keep a rude person in line. Self-help author Henry Cloud wrote, “You get what you tolerate.”"
scorpio,2017-11-15,"You may try to bury your anger today because you believe it will only sidetrack you from reaching your goals. Although recent encouragement from the cosmos has opened new vistas for you to explore, someone’s actions alter your routine now without giving you any advanced notice. But hiding your feelings creates larger ripples that anchor you to the present moment, preventing you from moving forward with your plans. Ultimately, expressing your truth wins you the support from an ally you otherwise might have lost."
sagittarius,2017-11-15,"You approach your friends and coworkers with a sense of emotional detachment today, but your motives aren’t obvious to them. They might misinterpret your actions to mean you don’t want to be included in social events or other group activities now. However, you simply have your own agenda and prefer not to have any interference from the outside world at this time. Flying solo takes courage. Activist Emma Goldman wrote, “People have only as much liberty as they have the intelligence to want and the courage to take.”"
capricorn,2017-11-15,"You might be anxious today if your support system is not firmly in place. Perhaps you feel abandoned if a family member is unavailable to receive your call or, maybe, a domestic squabble is isolating you from someone you love. Rather than blowing your current stress out of proportion, acknowledge your feelings and then move on with your life. Fulfilling your worldly obligations first gives you some much-needed space to reassess your relationship priorities. Time is a precious commodity; spend it wisely."
aquarius,2017-11-15,"Although your career ambitions continue to motivate you at work, you’re not only interested in success as defined by society. You are on a spiritual quest today, seeking a wider understanding of your place in the world. You’re willing to disappoint others as you break free from the status quo because you’re no longer limited by their values. Don’t be afraid to show your true colors if someone questions your integrity. Charlie Chaplin declared, “This is a ruthless world and one must be ruthless to cope with it.”"
pisces,2017-11-15,"You’re unafraid when confronted by negativity today. But your lack of fear is not because of denial; you can see directly into the shadows and fearlessly assess the danger. Although people might say that love conquers all, it’s just a pretty sentiment to many of them. You, on the other hand, take this idealist concept as the foundation of your current plan. You know that resistance will fade when it meets the light of your soul. Tom Petty sang, “I won’t back down.” And neither will you."
aries,2017-11-16,"You’re not satisfied with the love that’s available in the real world, so you create an image of relationship perfection in your fantasies. On one level, this is a quick and easy solution to any frustration you might experience, but there’s a cost to living in your dreams. Imagining happiness rather than manifesting it can magnify the emotional distance between you and a romantic partner. Philosopher Phil Cheney wrote, “Balance is only meaningful when we choose love as the center of gravity!”"
taurus,2017-11-16,"It appears as if you have caught someone’s eye now and you’re flattered by the attention. Although you may be attracted to your admirer, you might not be ready to jump into a relationship. Whether you’re already involved or your focus is elsewhere, you’re under no obligation to take this flirtation any further. However, your heart is giving you conflicting signals today, possibly leaving you uncertain as to your next move. Keep in mind that every success begins with the decision to try."
gemini,2017-11-16,"No matter how much work is packed into your schedule today, you could make it all vanish in the blink of an eye. Unfortunately, as powerful as your fantasies are now, denial doesn’t change what will be waiting for you when you return from your daydreams. But your imagination can be put to good use by practicing creative visualization. Just remember that once you envision your project list completed, you still need to perform in the real world. The distance between your dreams and reality is called action."
cancer,2017-11-16,"Your day may get off to a slow start, build to an easy pace and end with a powerful crescendo. Thankfully, you’re swimming in your element as six planets in water signs validate your feelings and soothe your soul. Ironically, there is little uncertainty in your life now, even though your imagination plays a powerful role in determining your behavior. Co-creating the future is possible if you actually take the time to color in all the details of your daydreams. Vincent Van Gogh wrote, “What is done with love is done well.”"
leo,2017-11-16,"Your needs are quite complex now, making it difficult to put them into words. Nevertheless, you’re willing to try, even if your mixed signals leave people more confused than ever. But you are speaking your truth and your cryptic messages are accurate representations of your inner world. Nothing is to be gained by harsh self-judgment because you can’t communicate your desires in simple terms today. Forgive yourself for your shortcomings while also forgiving someone for their failure to reach out and meet you halfway. Yoko Ono said, “Healing yourself is connected with healing others.”"
virgo,2017-11-16,"You are captivated by someone’s magic today and there’s little you can do to put him or her out of your mind. Although you might attempt to run evasive maneuvers, love will find its way into your heart. But instead of building protective walls for emotional safety, open all channels of communication now. Don’t make the mistake of trying to precisely define the interpersonal dynamics because they could elude description. Art speaks when words can't."
libra,2017-11-16,"It's impossible to get a straight story out of anyone today, or so it seems. Those coworkers who are usually the most trustworthy appear to be talking out of both sides of their mouth now. Honestly, you’re just looking for some solid facts you can bank on. However, if you can’t find the information you seek, you could always make it up. Don’t let reality limit your options when you have the ability to make your dreams come true all on your own."
scorpio,2017-11-16,"You possess the magical power of creation today. Although this gift is neither easy to come by nor is it simple to use, you are the master of your destiny. It’s almost like you can live in your ideal world now by simply proclaiming it to be as you wish. But you might have to learn the hard way that there are no free lunches. Even simple acts of wizardry still require work in the real world. Determination and discipline are essential ingredients of success."
sagittarius,2017-11-16,"Surprisingly, you are more private than anyone today, but may still come out of your shell when all the external factors are just right. In fact, under the perfect circumstances you are likely to wax poetic into the wee hours of the morning. The presence of a romantic interest amplifies your heartfelt desire for a spiritual connection. However, even with the possibility of sharing your dreams with someone special, you still must return to your inner sanctuary to reclaim your balance. Lao Tzu wrote, “To the mind that is still, the whole universe surrenders.”"
capricorn,2017-11-16,"You might believe you’re the luckiest person in the world because you have such an amazing group of people that you are proud to count as your friends. However, your rich fantasy life enables you to avoid relationship obstacles, since you can just make them disappear in your mind today. Unfortunately, blind optimism is never an intelligent strategy because it’s accompanied by too many headaches. Seeing the best in others is not the same as altering reality to conform to your fantasies. Robert Ingersoll wrote, “We rise by lifting others.”"
aquarius,2017-11-16,"You can conjure up idealistic visions of your future success, but it’s challenging to find anyone else with similar goals now. You wish you could establish a mentorship program that gives people more opportunities to manifest their dreams. Although you really don’t want to strike out on your own today, others may be slow to join in what seems like just another one of your crazy ideas. Follow your heart, even if it means you must fly solo. Henry Van Dyke wrote, “Genius is talent set on fire by courage.”"
pisces,2017-11-16,"Although you might not be able to escape from the watchful eye of an authority figure today, you’re happy to maintain a dual set of goals in order to keep your dreams alive. It’s possible that no one truly understands your aspirations, yet you don’t want to waste energy trying to explain what motivates you to help change the world. Instead of allowing reality to encroach upon your visions, continue to open the curtains to the most magical things in the cosmos. The source of inspiration is within."
aries,2017-11-17,"It might feel as if you’re not receiving the support you expect from others as they withhold important facts from you. But you can also see how you've contributed to the current sticky situation. You’re concerned that you misinterpreted someone’s behavior and hope to set the record straight today. However, it seems as if you are running out of time and must take action immediately or you will lose your chance. Thankfully, interactive Mercury cooperates with your key planet Mars, enabling you to convey your point of view with great clarity. Speak now or forever hold your peace."
taurus,2017-11-17,"A powerplay at work could leave you on the sidelines today. The political dynamics may shift so quickly that you don’t even see the changes coming. But you’re unwilling to sit quietly when you’re itching to be in the game. Fortunately, you can positively impact the situation now by boldly revealing your impressive skills. But this is a tricky moment because you don’t want your assertive behavior to stir any antagonism. A diplomatic approach demonstrates your desire to be part of a winning team. Intervene gently and then step back; let the circumstances play out on their own."
gemini,2017-11-17,"It’s always better to be honest, yet sometimes you struggle with full disclosure if you think your words will upset others. Thankfully, there is an opportunity to clear the air today as your key planet Mercury receives an energetic boost from warrior Mars. You are ready to face the consequences of your words with an unshakeable sense of self-confidence. Nevertheless, it doesn’t pay to be cavalier when sharing your truth. Ernest Hemingway wrote, “There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man; true nobility is being superior to your former self.”"
cancer,2017-11-17,"You may choose to keep your feelings quiet today because you assume people will find your moods too intense. You don’t want to alienate others by mixing personal issues with your job, yet you also wish you could be open about your internal process. Ironically, you might discover the tables are turned when someone else comes to you with an emotional story. Be as receptive to another person as you wish them to be for you. Putting the Golden Rule into action sets a wonderful example for others to follow."
leo,2017-11-17,"Balancing work and play can be rather difficult today, especially if you don’t acknowledge your true desires. It’s all too easy to become so wrapped up in meeting your obligations that you suppress your need for downtime. Unfortunately, your unexpressed feelings could turn to resentment, making it harder to find enjoyment even after you are off the clock. Be careful about blaming anyone else for your lackadaisical time management. Thankfully, you can still make room for pleasure if you think ahead. Antoine de Saint-Exupéry wrote, “A goal without a plan is just a wish.”"
virgo,2017-11-17,"Putting your best foot forward is usually a smart strategy, but your overconfident behavior today may actually reveal that you’re hiding something. Your self-esteem might be slipping as your inner critic focuses on your lack of perfection. You’re like a stage magician that’s skillfully practicing misdirection, but people can see through your mask before you even realize you’re wearing one. Oddly enough, you’re overcompensating when there really isn’t a reason. More transparency, less stress."
libra,2017-11-17,"You may take it upon yourself to save the day by stepping into a developing conflict and playing the part of a mediator. Energetic Mars is visiting your fair-minded sign, strengthening your diplomatic abilities. Meanwhile, Mercury the Messenger plays a supporting role, enabling you to say the right thing at the right time. You can successfully resolve a crisis before it fully emerges as long as you don’t make it about you. Inspirational writer William Arthur Ward penned, “When we seek to discover the best in others, we somehow bring out the best.”"
scorpio,2017-11-17,"Downplaying your power is one way to take the bright spotlight off you today. You don’t necessarily want everyone to see what you’re up to yet because you’re not quite ready for an audience critiquing your every move. Nevertheless, your story is important and anyone who listens to you now will be duly impressed. Although it makes good sense to wait until after tomorrow’s Scorpio New Moon before presenting your plan for the weeks ahead, don’t fret if some of your ideas leak out sooner. Anticipation makes everything a little sweeter in the end."
sagittarius,2017-11-17,"You are a natural spokesperson for a cause today. Whether you’re carrying the torch for your local community, social network or workgroup, people easily accept your words as representative of theirs. In fact, they are happy to have you stand on the soapbox and be the lightning rod for everyone else’s reactions. Although you’re not immune to public criticism, you have a knack for letting negativity roll off you like water off a duck’s back. Miraculously, you can’t hear any feedback now, unless it’s constructive. Believe in your message and others will too."
capricorn,2017-11-17,"You might as well be running the entire show today because you can scan all the variables spread out before you like a chess master sees the chess board. Warrior Mars is doing your bidding now as he marches through your 10th House of Public Status. You’re not afraid to enter into verbal combat with anyone who stands in your way. Fortunately, no one is likely to be brave enough to question your authority. Author Shiv Khera wrote, “Your positive action combined with positive thinking results in success.”"
aquarius,2017-11-17,"Your career continues to be one of the main driving forces in your life, but you may grow anxious today when you measure your current position against where you want to be. There seems to be an insurmountable gulf between your future hopes and the reality of the present moment. However, you can’t compare your long-term goals with your immediate situation because progress is gradual and isn’t always measurable by what’s obvious. The only failure is when you say, “I give up.”"
pisces,2017-11-17,"You can talk a fine game today, but your words must be supported by your actions for them to have a lasting impact. Thankfully, you have the intention and the energy to follow through on what you say. However, you might envision a straight path to success, but the actual road will be fraught with unexpected twists and turns. Don’t think for a moment that an obstacle is a sign that you’re on the wrong track. Roadblocks are merely opportunities for you to improve your skills. The comeback is always stronger than the setback. Your best competition is yourself."
aries,2017-11-18,"You may be alarmed when you find yourself pulled into deep water today. Complex emotions swirl over your head as relationship dynamics intensify. The magnetic Scorpio New Moon charges your 8th House of Intimacy and Transformation, urging you to sink into your feelings rather than run away from them. Your fears arise when you realize you’re not in control. Thankfully, sticking with the process brings the priceless reward of increased self-awareness. Thoreau wrote, “Things do not change. We change.”"
taurus,2017-11-18,"You might not understand the complicated needs of a friend or lover today, but you’re drawn to the energy like a moth to a flame. The mysteries of the unknown are thoroughly enchanting and you’re a more-than-willing participant in the magic. Although left to your own devices you may choose a simpler path, the Scorpio New Moon activates your 7th House of Partners, shifting your focus onto someone else. Don’t fight against the emotional tides; be courageous and let go of your resistance. Joseph Campbell wrote, “The cave you fear to enter holds the treasure you seek.”"
gemini,2017-11-18,"Your physical wellbeing is inextricably connected to your emotional and spiritual health. Although it’s challenging to stick with a program, the benefits make it a worthwhile investment. The intense Scorpio New Moon lands in your 6th House of Logistics, motivating you to adopt a new routine and adhere to it. Don’t be overly concerned if you choose a difficult path. Acting on your intentions now makes a strong statement to the cosmos; expect to receive support in mysterious ways over the days ahead."
cancer,2017-11-18,"Allowing others in can be challenging now, especially if you feel emotionally self-sufficient. The evocative Scorpio New Moon falls in your 5th House of Creativity, encouraging you to express your passion through an artistic endeavor. Although you are quite serious about your goals today, you don’t want to minimize the role of play in your current activities. It’s all too easy to be dragged down by the heavy emotional energy. Thankfully, changing your attitude changes everything. Author Tom Robbins wrote, “It’s never too late to have a happy childhood.”"
leo,2017-11-18,"You are at the threshold of change and you know you can’t go back to the way things were. But others can’t see the transformation yet because it’s taking place within your brain rather than in the world. In fact, the Scorpio New Moon plants a seed of intention in your 4th House of Roots, ensuring that the magic initially occurs hidden beneath the ground. You aren’t convinced that you want to go on this journey, but you have no more choice in the matter than a caterpillar has when it chooses to become a butterfly. Stop fighting the inevitable; you will be soaring high on your new wings soon."
virgo,2017-11-18,"Everything and everyone might seem too intense today. Passionate conversations about issues basic to your very existence are prompted by the Scorpio New Moon as it energizes your 3rd House of Communication. Even trivial interactions can become critical when you believe you’re in the middle of a life or death situation. Although your survival is not in question now, you may be required to let certain patterns die so new ones can grow in their place. At this time, the only danger you face is the unwanted fallout from your unwillingness to grow. Psychologist Carl Jung wrote, “What you resist, persists.”"
libra,2017-11-18,"You are deeply committed to living in harmony with your values now. In fact, the Scorpio New Moon intensifies your 2nd House of Self-Esteem, motivating you to reevaluate the direction of your life and make corrections to your trajectory as needed. But your current career fixation does not involve making any changes today. You derive greater benefits from kicking off your boots, putting your feet up and reviewing all the possibilities ahead before choosing one. Thought before action empowers your success."
scorpio,2017-11-18,"Creating a bucket list for each month of the year is a valuable exercise that teaches you about the efficacy of your decisions, both the good and the bad. Meanwhile, the passionate Scorpio New Moon validates your 1st House of Self, making it doubly important to check in with your heart to reassess your personal aspirations. In fact, you don’t need to wait until next year to itemize your resolutions. There is no time like the present to create the life you want."
sagittarius,2017-11-18,"Your life is on the launch pad again but this time the rocket ship could actually reach escape velocity. The Scorpio New Moon reinforces your 12th House of Destiny, sending off a ripple of synchronicities while preparing you for an intervention by the “Flying Fickle Finger of Fate.” But it’s dangerous to jump to outrageous conclusions, especially once the Moon flies into optimistic Sagittarius. You’re so eager to start your new adventure that your spontaneity could cause trouble. Ben Franklin said, ""Motivation is when your dreams put on work clothes."""
capricorn,2017-11-18,"Your social network -- both online and offline -- is an anchor that prevents you from drifting aimlessly into space now. The passionate Scorpio New Moon enhances your 11th House of Community, inspiring you to raise the stakes in your interactions with others. You might even grow possessive of a particular friend, only to find that he or she isn’t interested in analyzing or labeling relationships. There is wisdom in this simple philosophy. Cherish the people who mean the most to you and don’t worry about what anyone else thinks. Stop looking back, unless that’s where you are heading."
aquarius,2017-11-18,"You are strangely quiet today, but your presence seems larger than life to others. The unrelenting Scorpio New Moon concentrates the cosmic energy in your 10th House of Status, but the most profound transformations are occurring out of everyone else’s sight. Nevertheless, everything will become obvious once you put your action plan into motion. Your ambitious goals are within reach; all you need to do is stretch your wings. Dr. Albert Schweitzer wrote, “Success is not the key to happiness. Happiness is the key to success. If you love what you are doing, you will be successful.”"
pisces,2017-11-18,"You might be feeling dissatisfied with your current lot in life today, and you're eager to seize every intriguing opportunity that passes your way. The powerful Scorpio New Moon triggers your 9th House of Big Ideas, connecting your emotions with far-reaching plans. You won’t be happy until you have exceeded your wildest dreams. However, anything seems possible now, especially because you know that reality is molded and shaped by the brain. Having faith in yourself is half the battle."
aries,2017-11-19,"You could go to extremes in order to reach your goals today. You may be so obsessed about getting what you want that you don’t even think about giving up when you meet resistance. Unfortunately, others might see your current ruthlessness as a behavior that needs to be checked, so they band together to put you in your place. Fortunately, your opposition will begin to fade as soon as you cool your jets and stop trying to control every situation. French Poet Guillaume Apollinaire wrote, “Now and then it’s good to pause in our pursuit of happiness and just be happy.”"
taurus,2017-11-19,"Although you typically prefer slow and methodical improvements, you are running out of patience and want to shake everything up today. You’re less interested in establishing a sustainable process than you are in implementing dramatic change. However, you will accomplish a lot more in a shorter period of time if you remember to include others in your plans. Persuading a few folks to join your parade attracts more attention to the event and increases the fun for everyone."
gemini,2017-11-19,"On any other day, you might create an expressive piece of art by simply jumping in with your brush, guitar or pen. But today is different as you hope to toss your ideas around with a friendly audience first. Surprisingly, talking about the meaning behind your current inspiration tends to polarize people’s personal beliefs. However, it’s not your job to change anyone’s mind now. You only need to worry about managing your own feelings. Give everyone the courtesy of ample time before asking for their opinions. In the meantime, continue to honor your muse with your best work."
cancer,2017-11-19,"It feels as if someone is working against you now and you wish you could just ignore the negativity. But you can’t just walk away today; the unaddressed energy will circle back to you soon enough. Confront the source of resistance directly since you can't expect others to continue to pass along your message intact. Nevertheless, opting for behind-the-scenes discussions allows you to make your point while saving face for your opponent. Demonstrating compassion encourages your enemies to become your friends."
leo,2017-11-19,"Your unique perspective enables you to see far into the future today, yet you still can swing into action with little warning to protect your favorite idea. Your vision is clear, but your reaction may be excessive because your energy is so tightly wired now. The last thing you’re looking for is a fight, but one might be brewing before your eyes. Fortunately, you have the power to walk the energy back to neutral if you tone down your roar and present a factual case that can’t be denied."
virgo,2017-11-19,"You could be called on to stand up to a bossy person who seems to think that intimidation will silence anyone who disagrees. Thankfully, you don’t need to accept someone’s transparent power play or any type of bullying, regardless of the context. Your voice is only one, but it sings in unity with many others. You may wonder if you’re the best one to say anything publicly today. The answer is yes. Speaking up for justice inspires others to do the same."
libra,2017-11-19,"Your even-keeled approach to an emotionally charged conflict is exactly what’s needed to help settle the energy. You hold high standards for yourself and others today. You stand firm in your convictions and defy anyone to question your resolve. As long as you maintain your integrity, you can transform a difficult situation into a manageable one. Don’t let your emotions muddy your clarity. Keep your eyes on the ultimate goal of reconciliation and expect the best. Roy T. Bennett wrote, “Create your own miracles; do what you think you cannot do.”"
scorpio,2017-11-19,"You’re not going to show your anger because you believe that will only reduce your power today. Instead, you’re more likely to use the energy generated by the willful Mars-Pluto square to create a plan that will even the score. You’re not in a hurry; you want to be sure your actions create the effect you seek. There’s no need to grab low-hanging fruit just because it’s available. Take whatever time is necessary to turn your strategy into a winning course of action. Frank Sinatra said, “The best revenge is massive success.”"
sagittarius,2017-11-19,"You see your destination in the distance and may head out in that direction without giving it a second thought. Although your emotionally charged state of mind has a strong impact on your current actions, you might believe you’re making a rational decision based solely on the facts. You're worried people are plotting against you now and any delay on your part will send a signal of weakness to them. Don’t take the bait; an African proverb teaches, “When there is no enemy within, the enemies outside cannot hurt you.”"
capricorn,2017-11-19,"You are driven to take charge but you may end up creating a quagmire of conflict today, whether you’re planning a corporate coup or a family outing. You are poised to conquer anyone who challenges your position while domineering Pluto in your sign squares bossy Mars in your 10th House of Public Responsibility. Although you may wish you could share power with someone you trust, you are likely to fiercely guard your secret to protect your vulnerability. Author Ken Blanchard wrote, “The key to successful leadership today is influence, not authority.”"
aquarius,2017-11-19,"You might feel as if your spiritual integrity is under attack today as someone publicly compares your beliefs with theirs. But you’re not interested in a debate about which system is superior; it’s sufficient that your metaphysical understanding of the universe works for you. In your mind, there’s nothing to be gained from an academic discussion about such a personal subject. The Dalai Lama said, “The purpose of religion is to control yourself, not to criticize others.”"
pisces,2017-11-19,"You want nothing more than to get to the original source of a mystery and you will do nearly anything to uncover it today. Your conundrum may be a simple whodunnit or a complex metaphysical question. Either way, your secret weapon now is your emotionally detached approach to the search. Relentlessly gathering the facts and peeling back the hidden layers enable you to see things in an entirely new light. You begin looking for one thing, only to discover something much more valuable. Poet John Dryden wrote, “He who would search for pearls must dive below.”"
aries,2017-11-20,"You have no shortage of big ideas, but sooner or later you must turn one into something real or let it go. The problem is that your schemes seem to grow on their own until a plausible plan becomes so inflated that it’s impossible to manifest now. Instead of investing your efforts into a project that might fizzle out, pare it back to the bare minimum before it fails the test of time. Knowing when to say no means you won’t have to say sorry later on."
taurus,2017-11-20,"You’re so sensitive to subtle emotional signals today that you could end up turning a trivial matter into the main event. Although it may feel like a gift to have x-ray vision, perceiving the invisible world can be a mixed blessing. It’s challenging to maintain a clear perspective now, making it tough to keep your priorities straight. Paradoxically, it’s your actions that ultimately determine the significance of a particular experience. The more you focus on it, the more important it becomes. Energy flows where attention goes."
gemini,2017-11-20,"You’re unhappy when someone tries to limit you from extending your thoughts into the realms of imagination. Your peers expect you to stick to the agenda and concentrate on finishing your work today. Nevertheless, they cannot prevent you from taking quick metaphysical excursions to the far reaches of the universe as long as you return in time to contribute to the current collective effort. However, there’s a severe price to pay if you drop the ball and fall short of meeting your responsibilities. President George Washington said, “It is better to offer no excuse than a bad one.”"
cancer,2017-11-20,"You may overestimate your abilities today and take on more assignments than you can possibly complete. Although you are a capable and competent worker, there are definite limits to what any human is able to do in twenty-four hours. Instead of placing yourself in an untenable position where you cannot keep your promises, establish boundaries before you’re in over your head. Naturally, you want to do the best you can, but remember that sometimes production is more important than perfection. Yogi Berra said, “Life is a learning experience, only if you learn.”"
leo,2017-11-20,"You are not in the mood for work today. In fact, you might be busy plotting your escape route while the adventurous Sagittarius Moon cavorts with mischievous Mercury in your 5th House of Play. Unfortunately, karmic Saturn is quietly waiting in the wings to dole out the appropriate punishment for your foolish shenanigans. But you can outmaneuver the inevitable by effectively managing your time to fulfill your duties on schedule. Author Robert T. Kiyosaki wrote, “You and only you are responsible for your life choices and decisions.”"
virgo,2017-11-20,"You can rewrite your personal history today, telling whichever parts of the story you choose. The cavalier Sagittarius Moon’s presence in your 4th House of Roots entices you to explore only those memories that align with your current frame of reference. Although denying the facts isn’t recommended, this process of self-reflection could still lead to an unexpected breakthrough about the importance of being honest with yourself. Unfortunately, as Oscar Wilde wrote, “The truth is rarely pure and never simple.”"
libra,2017-11-20,"A casual conversation at the water cooler could take you on a merry adventure. You’re happy to stretch an unplanned moment of social interaction into a long break. In fact, multiple surprises may be in store for you now if you keep your eyes and heart open for them. However, don’t get too carried away because there’s still plenty of work to be done. Greek philosopher Epictetus wrote, “If one oversteps the bounds of moderation, the greatest pleasures cease to please.”"
scorpio,2017-11-20,"Your optimism is contagious today because you truly believe your dreams will come true. You have a knack for persuasively describing the absolute best possible scenario in the hope of realizing what you envision now. Somehow, you’re able to take a tiny seed from a single thought and make so many assumptions that a bountiful harvest seems unavoidable. However, imagination alone won’t guarantee results. A fruitful garden requires consistent cultivation."
sagittarius,2017-11-20,"Although you can’t stop talking today, you might not actually have a lot to say. The extroverted Moon joins loquacious Mercury in your 1st House of Self, encouraging you to share your opinions whether or not you are asked. In fact, your off switch may not be functional until Luna hooks up with sobering Saturn later in the day. In the meantime, you continue to ramble as you spin your stories, expecting your audience to hang on every syllable. Sophocles wrote, “Much wisdom often goes with fewer words.”"
capricorn,2017-11-20,"You don’t need to look as though you’re in control as long as you’re still running the show. In fact, your associates are on stage performing their parts today, but they are like marionettes and you’re the puppeteer who is pulling the strings as the Moon settles into your 12th House of Invisibility. However, you may be tempted to test the limits of your power by asserting your authority to seek personal gain. Keep in mind you don’t have to put others down in order to lift yourself up."
aquarius,2017-11-20,"You love the idea of finding solutions to complicated problems. Your conceptual IQ is high today and you can swiftly move around large concepts in your mind as if they are colors on a Rubik’s cube. Others look at you in wonder, bewildered at how fast you solve the puzzle. However, there is a danger to your clever brilliance: you might jump to the answer so quickly that you could end up answering the wrong question. Wait until you hear the entire story before you give it your own ending."
pisces,2017-11-20,"You intuitively know that your current professional aspirations are far beyond your reach now, but you would rather be disappointed because you fell short of the impossible than be satisfied with mediocre achievements. Setting the bar for success too low can be an excuse to be lazy. Nevertheless, aiming high demands your absolute dedication at all times. Running champion Steve Prefontaine said, “To give anything less than your best is to sacrifice the gift.”"
aries,2017-11-21,"No task is out of the question today. You’ll figure out a way to make it happen if you believe you can do it. Your organizational skills are finely sharpened, and you can’t wait to put them to good use. Others might criticize you for your pie-in-the-sky thinking, but you have run all the variables through your analytical process and you know exactly what you are doing. The same people who doubt your ability to deliver the goods will be there to congratulate you when you finish."
taurus,2017-11-21,"It may be up to you to be the peacemaker in a relationship today. Your key planet Venus in your 7th House of Partners is empowered by unrelenting Pluto, motivating you to be steadfast in your opposition to fear. There’s not much you need to say or do if you simply show up with an open heart. You can inspire others to let down their boundaries by consistently holding space that is illuminated by the light of love. Deepak Chopra wrote, “Life gives you plenty of time to do whatever you want to do if you stay in the present moment.”"
gemini,2017-11-21,"You’re not inclined to express your desires today unless you can see a tangible benefit from your emotional disclosure. Sometimes sharing your feelings is the first step to a lively discussion that brings you closer to someone else. However, you might try to avoid such a conversation at first because it pulls you into unexplored territory. But once the words start flowing, you quickly realize how your interaction fosters a more intimate connection. Tony Robbins teaches, “The way we communicate with others and with ourselves ultimately determines the quality of our lives.”"
cancer,2017-11-21,"Your need for security is given a cosmic boost today as the Moon slips into your 7th House of Relationships. It feels natural now to rely on a close friend or lover since he or she adds an extra layer of stability to your world. Nevertheless, you’re not sure how quickly you want to acknowledge the depth of your current feelings. You enjoy the emotional bond, but you’re worried about setting yourself up for a broken heart later on. Author Doe Zantamata wrote, “Don’t let the fear of what could happen make nothing happen.”"
leo,2017-11-21,"You want to help others, but you’re afraid of losing your focus if you do. Nevertheless, you are compelled to be of assistance if you can as the dutiful Capricorn Moon highlights your 6th House of Work and Service. Naturally, you can’t just blow off your job-related responsibilities, but neither can you abandon a friend in need. Fortunately, balancing your professional duties with your personal activities is possible if you develop a dependable routine. Author Edmond Mbiaka wrote, “Actions become very effective when they meet the habit of consistency.”"
virgo,2017-11-21,"You have a rather rigid outlook on love now and your assumptions about it could make happiness more difficult to find. Unlike many others, you’re sensible even when you’re romantically enchanted by a lover’s spell. Nevertheless, once you meet the one who rattles your heart, there’s no question about your next move. You can logically justify your behavior, even when you act completely out of character. But don’t let someone else’s judgments rain on your parade. Sufi poet Rumi wrote, “Set your life on fire; seek those who fan your flames.”"
libra,2017-11-21,"Although there may be chores to do out in the world, you’re also concerned about managing family matters. Wherever you are, you are taking your responsibilities very seriously today, leaving you with little energy left over for relaxation. Nevertheless, your key planet Venus tempts you to forget about your obligations for a while by promising exquisite experiences. A proverb teaches, “When pleasure interferes with business, give up business.”"
scorpio,2017-11-21,"You need your schedule etched in stone today. In the midst of a rapidly evolving world, the traditional Capricorn Moon’s visit to your 3rd House of Distractions insists that the timing of your day be left as it is. Nevertheless, whatever you choose to do now will be approached with a high level of passion. Unfortunately, your emotions do not have a dimmer switch; they are either off or on. Keep your head down and finish your work so you can start a journey into the underworld to see what treasures await your arrival."
sagittarius,2017-11-21,"You’re not giving out many clues today, so everyone will have to guess what you want. It’s not that you’re intentionally trying to annoy others if your desires aren’t satisfied. It’s just that your values are changing, and you don’t need to process information that’s not urgent in the moment you hear about it. Once you know someone is playing the game of life at a much deeper level, you can choose to join them and volunteer anything that might be helpful. Hold out for the less obvious truths."
capricorn,2017-11-21,"You are more than willing to work extra hard today if you can measure your progress in tangible results. The Capricorn Moon reminds you of the cause-and-effect relationship between your ambitious efforts and the sweetness of being rewarded for a job well done. However, your friends might distract you with social invitations now that passionate Pluto is flirting with romantic Venus in your 11th House of Community. Don’t change your agenda; sometimes it’s easier to achieve your highest potential if you keep your blinders on and your phone off."
aquarius,2017-11-21,"You can’t reveal your plans today because you know they aren’t ready to undergo the scrutiny they will receive once you go public with them. Instead, you’re likely to wear a happy face so everyone thinks nothing is afoot. You don’t want anyone to notice that you’re secretly working toward striking out on your own. If anyone discovers your current strategy it could put all your efforts in jeopardy. Trust your intuition to tell you when the time is right to make your move. In the meantime, keep your head down and your thoughts up."
pisces,2017-11-21,"You may rely on your friends and associates to come to your aid today because you know they have your back. Thankfully, they won’t let you down now. In fact, you may be part of such a strongly knit workgroup that each of you stands a better chance of achieving success because of all the mutual respect and support. Nevertheless, don’t assume you can get by with doing less than your fair share. Hold up your end of the bargain before expecting others to do the same."
aries,2017-11-22,"Your attention is singularly focused on receiving recognition at work today, and you’ll do nearly anything to achieve success. Unfortunately, you could inadvertently hurt someone’s feelings if you don’t stop to think about how your relentless drive might negatively impact others. Saying you’re sorry after the fact isn’t good enough; it doesn’t undo any pain you caused. Taking the time to check in with those around you enables you to avoid any unnecessary harm -- and the satisfactory glow of your accomplishments burns brighter than before."
taurus,2017-11-22,"You are so confident that your solution to a problem at work will be successful that you don’t hear the advice you receive from others now. You are quick to dismiss the observations of your associates without even giving them real consideration. Although your intentions are good, your execution is lacking. You like to work at your own pace, but you’re not truly a solo act if your actions affect anyone else. Instead of getting angry at people for offering constructive criticism, be grateful for what they bring to the game."
gemini,2017-11-22,"You can’t quite grasp how the unknown components of a relationship are more crucial than the obvious. Your concern with creating a safe space is only one ingredient in your recipe to empower people. You are thinking more clearly today, but there’s something wrong with selectively using logic to make your position known. Don’t hold back any information, even if it runs counter to everyone else’s intelligence. Full disclosure works in your favor now only if you avoid hiding behind artificial walls."
cancer,2017-11-22,"A good friend or workmate may seem to be a bit overbearing today. You might try to step out of the direct line of emotional fire, but there’s nowhere to hide. You don’t have the energy or the desire to engage in conflict now. Thankfully, you have a trick up your sleeve that comes in handy. There’s no reason to go anywhere else if you can temporarily make yourself invisible. Return when the danger is passed. Your silence speaks more than your words ever could."
leo,2017-11-22,"An intelligent debate is better than a shouting match, but either will suffice to clear the air of building emotional tension today. At first, you might resist participating in verbal combat, proudly declaring that your actions will speak for themselves. Unfortunately, you may not have a chance to act with the clarity you wish to convey. If you need to make your case, try writing it down first so you know you will cover all the critical points. Rumi wrote, “Raise your words, not voice. It is rain that grows flowers, not thunder.”"
virgo,2017-11-22,"You have something on your mind that must be expressed today. Although you could justify waiting for the perfect moment, it would be a mistake to miss this opportunity to reveal your thoughts. Unfortunately, carefully describing your point of view might agitate others, prompting a swift reply in return. But don’t feed the negativity if emotions begin to escalate. Keep in mind the goal of sharing isn’t to focus on differences; it’s to establish common ground."
libra,2017-11-22,"You’re certain that your current plans are built upon solid assumptions. You’ve taken great caution to avoid conflicts of interest, but those concerns resurface today as you revisit your original thinking. Don’t wait until you’re in the middle of an argument before shoring up your facts; knowing the difference between a verifiable truth and an opinion is a necessary first step. Benjamin Franklin wrote, “By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.”"
scorpio,2017-11-22,"You are on the warpath today, yet are willing to wait for the most opportune moment to attack your unsuspecting opponent. Paradoxically, you would rather kick back and enjoy a relaxing day at the beach or on the couch. But you can’t afford to be complacent now; you could lose your creative edge if you don’t fight for your right to express yourself. Greek statesman Pericles wrote, “Freedom is the sure possession of those alone who have the courage to defend it.”"
sagittarius,2017-11-22,"You have your sights set ridiculously high today because you woke up feeling like anything is possible. Some people are so practical they only see what can’t be done. But you’re ready to initiate action now, since you know complications could surface in the days ahead. Encountering obstacles is inevitable, so it’s sensible to make as much progress as you can before you run into trouble. An Arabian proverb states, “A promise is a cloud, fulfillment is rain.”"
capricorn,2017-11-22,"Although you don’t often let your feelings get in the way of your accomplishments, you might not be able to avoid an emotional meltdown today. You fully understand why logical analysis should overrule the heat of passion. But all the rational thinking in the world won’t suppress what’s in your heart now. Rather than wasting your energy fighting against the inevitable, surrender to the wisdom of your body. Trust your gut instincts; if something seems wrong, it probably is."
aquarius,2017-11-22,"You are being gently held by the hands of fate now. It’s as if your destiny has been chosen and you’re just tagging along for the ride. But don’t think for a moment that your actions are wasted. Everything you do has ramifications that ripple into the future, whether or not you can see them. Although a past failure might prevent you from being successful, you can overcome your personal history by remembering it, retelling it, and then letting it go. Mahatma Gandhi said, “The future depends on what you do today.”"
pisces,2017-11-22,"You are gazing into the future with a very practical eye today. Your perceptions are eerily accurate, so there’s no need to jump through lots of extra hoops to continue your research. Work with the data that’s already in your possession. Although you can make decisions with a high level of certainty now, don’t be overly rigid in your thinking. When new information knocks at your door, let it in and reevaluate the big picture from a different angle. Byron Katie wrote, ""Until the mind is open, the heart stays closed. The open mind is the key to the open heart."""
aries,2017-11-23,"Every hill you see is another potential mountain to climb, just like every social engagement is an opportunity to create and share new experiences. You perceive the world as a series of challenges and adventures today, each waiting for your participation to bring it to life. However, it helps to remember that everyone carries a different set of hopes and wishes -- and that someone else’s dreams are not the same as yours. The question about the purpose of life is multiple choice and there are as many answers as there are people."
taurus,2017-11-23,"Your expectations for the day are likely based on practical considerations. However, there are not-so-normal circumstances developing behind the scenes that could alter the storyline in a moment. Sometimes you make things worse by resisting change, especially when you’re not in control of it. But you don’t have to let your current assumptions prevent you from thoroughly enjoying a surprising turn of events today. Eckhart Tolle wrote, “Realize deeply that the present moment is all you ever have.”"
gemini,2017-11-23,"Hanging out with friends and family isn’t necessarily the most relaxing thing in the world today, but it will be fun and exciting nonetheless. Although discussions about people, world events and politics can stir conflict, you have the sense to know when not to push other people’s buttons now. Nevertheless, it’s fascinating what you learn about someone you thought you knew well. Your mantra for the day is “Don’t judge; everyone is different.”"
cancer,2017-11-23,"Taking care of all your chores in the morning frees you to participate in a spontaneous event later on. Although unforeseen obstacles may slow your progress today, your perseverance enables you to power through on schedule. However, the cosmos is working on an agenda of its own and might present you with an out-of-the-blue proposition before the day is out. Accepting the invitation is your ticket to fun. Smile and enjoy the ride."
leo,2017-11-23,"You’re looking forward to a day of fun and frivolity, but you also have a list of obligations to fulfill. Unfortunately, you may struggle with finding an easy balance between your social inclinations and your mundane responsibilities. Keep in mind it’s not an either/or proposition; work and play can go hand in hand. Instead of seeing your chores as something you must finish before you relax, shift your thinking and find ways to enjoy yourself no matter what you are doing. Thomas Edison said, “I never did a day’s work in my life. It was all fun.”"
virgo,2017-11-23,"You are buzzing along in your comfort zone where everything goes just as you imagined. Although you rely heavily on your agendas and schedules, there are times when it’s wiser to set them aside. A change in the flow of events can be upsetting at first today, but you quickly see that the potential for positive experiences is higher than ever. Don’t let your love of logistics stand in the way of a wonderful day. Flexibility is your friend."
libra,2017-11-23,"Naturally, you want everyone to feel special today, but sometimes playing the role of universal host just adds stress to your life. Fortunately, your inner strategist understands the complexities of different people’s needs. However, you’re insistent that they can be brought together to share a common experience in the name of camaraderie. It’s helpful to examine your motives as the ringleader of the group. Are your actions aimed at making others happy or are you imposing your idea of happiness on them? Loosening the reins of control might ease the tension on everyone."
scorpio,2017-11-23,"You can’t help but spend time tripping through your personal history today. Nostalgic walks down Memory Lane can be nourishing to your soul, but they also take their toll when you stumble on a recollection that you wish never happened. Retelling stories about old events among friends and family could be healing as long as they don’t become a substitute for what’s occurring in the present moment. Tom Petty sang, “You can look back babe, but it’s best not to stare.”"
sagittarius,2017-11-23,"Your philosophical nature comes across strongly today as you share your dreams. But those who know you well are very familiar with your hopeful stories about your plans for the future. Nevertheless, they support you as you imagine the best possible scenarios out loud. Instead of watching your dreams rise and fall, pick one that’s a reoccurring fantasy and seriously consider what you need to do to make it come true. Byron Katie wrote, “What we really believe is what we manifest. What we believe, we see.”"
capricorn,2017-11-23,"You’re not a fan of uncertainty, yet you’re often the first to respond in a positive manner when something unexpected happens. If circumstances beyond your control disrupt your schedule, you have an opportunity to step in and save the day. Your organizational skills are well-known, and people tend to trust your judgment when it comes to coordinating lots of variables. Rather than worrying about what might go wrong now, offer your ideas for what could go right and let everyone pitch in with their suggestions. The only way to get something done is to begin."
aquarius,2017-11-23,"Although you might be restless as you anticipate a day that already has too much structure, things can transform in a flash. Hidden emotional tension bursts a bubble of containment like lightning striking the ground. You may feel the thrill of freedom when you realize the truth has been exposed and you are liberated from a monotonous fate. Ironically, it could be one little part of the big picture that shatters, but it’s enough to give you permission to change the day more to your liking. Abraham Lincoln said, “The best way to predict your future is to create it.”"
pisces,2017-11-23,"There is a specific place for you in the cosmic scheme of things today. It’s as if your role is already defined and all you need to do is show up and play the part. However, it may seem as if someone has tinkered with the script and the scene you’re now in isn’t the one you rehearsed over and over. Throw away your lines; you don’t need them anymore. Your new assignment is all about spontaneity as you make it up as you go along. Embrace the unknown and let life surprise you in delightful ways."
aries,2017-11-24,"Your appetite for excitement may seem insatiable today. You’re eager to try to set a new personal record for the amount of thrills you can pack in a twenty-four-hour period. No matter how much fun you’re having now, you believe there’s always the potential for more. Thankfully, you don’t need to let your unfulfilled fantasies prevent you from fully enjoying the present moment. Although you might see it differently, quality counts more than quantity."
taurus,2017-11-24,"It’s so tempting to spend time dreaming of the future that you might not realize what’s occurring in your immediate environment. The innovative Aquarius Moon catalyzes your thoughts, but you can’t see a direct route from here to there, precipitating a sinking feeling in the pit of your stomach. Your visceral feelings are the best indicator of your instincts. Be here now and trust the intuitive reactions of your body. Creating a better tomorrow starts today."
gemini,2017-11-24,"It seems as if people are rushing around with friends to see and places to go -- and they want you to tag along for fun. However, you don’t see the situation in a similar light and are not particularly interested in being dragged along on someone else’s errands. You have your own agenda today that is not nearly as ambitious. If there are specific chores to do, you prefer to conserve your energy and concentrate only on your work. Being honest saves time for everyone involved."
cancer,2017-11-24,"You’re raring to get outside so you can stretch your legs and breathe some fresh air. The exuberant Sagittarius Sun’s presence in your 6th House of Health encourages you to include more outdoor activities in your daily routine. However, someone close to you may have an alternative plan that doesn’t jive with yours. Although you like the idea of sharing the experience, don’t let anyone else’s agenda spoil yours. Take your much-needed walk by yourself and reconnect afterward to enjoy each other’s company. Your happiness begins with you."
leo,2017-11-24,"Although you may have promises to keep, you wish you could forget about all them today. Several planets converge in your 5th House of Fun, making a strong case for creative activities and innocent games. Unfortunately, you’re likely to upset others if you act irresponsibly. However, a diplomatic approach enables you to take care of your obligations and indulge your playful nature, too. It may be as simple as explaining your overall plan to those involved and reassuring them of your good intentions. Musician Stephen Nachmanovitch wrote, “The most potent muse of all is our own inner child.”"
virgo,2017-11-24,"You are often quite particular about what you eat, but your eccentric choices can be shocking today to those who are concerned about your wellbeing. You’re so comfortable with your modus operandi that you are quite skilled at using your analytical reasoning to justify whatever you want. However, it makes more sense to reconsider your conclusion than to worry about how you reached it. Listen to the feedback with an objective ear. Your health is more important than anything else."
libra,2017-11-24,"You wish you weren’t so attuned to other people’s needs today. You would love to spend time exploring your artistic side and pursuing your creative interests. But all you can think about is what you should be doing for everyone else. However, being considerate doesn’t mean you’re always required to drop everything in your world for the benefit of another person. Fortunately, seeing the current situation from multiple points of view enables you to find a middle path that honors your preferences while respecting those around you."
scorpio,2017-11-24,"There’s very little motivation on your part today to go along with the crowd. The individualistic Aquarius Moon settles into your 4th House of Security, prompting you to build walls where there could be doors. Instead of isolating yourself now and regretting your loneliness later, there are better ways to express your self-determination. Face your fears and share your concerns with others as soon as possible in order to avoid disempowering yourself. Psychologist Brené Brown says, “What makes you vulnerable makes you beautiful.”"
sagittarius,2017-11-24,"You’re not interested in hearing any negative feedback today, especially if the message comes in the form of a warning. You’re more likely to throw caution to the wind even if you know better. Unfortunately, you won’t likely get away with too much mischief now because the cavalier Sagittarius Sun must answer to dark lord Pluto. Instead of inviting trouble down the road, practice a bit of self-restraint. Greek philosopher Epicurus wrote, “Be moderate in order to taste the joys of life in abundance.”"
capricorn,2017-11-24,"Joining your friends for a shopping spree today might sound like a good idea until you end up being stuck in traffic or waiting in a long line. Fortunately, the technologically savvy Aquarius Moon reminds you that you can avoid the annoyances of seasonal commercialism by making your purchases online. However, you may be inclined to take your resistance to the next level by scaling back your participation in unrestrained consumerism. Anna Lappé wrote, “Every time you spend money, you’re casting a vote for the kind of world you want.”"
aquarius,2017-11-24,"Your idealism overpowers your cynicism today, inspiring you to let go of your objections to planned group activities. Left to your own devices, you could take a completely different approach to the day. However, you might bite your tongue and keep your non-conformist tendencies hidden for the time being because you don’t want to spoil everyone’s fun. But don’t go along with the crowd if you still have second thoughts. Your unexpressed negativity can turn cold and bring everyone down. The heart was made to love, not to harbor resentment."
pisces,2017-11-24,"You want nothing more than to be in the company of your friends and family today. You get goose bumps just thinking about the harmony that you feel when you’re with your tribe. It really doesn’t matter what you’re doing as long as you’re all doing it together. Unfortunately, someone in the group may be less than a team player and starts making decisions for everyone. Although they say it only takes one bad apple to spoil the bunch, a group intervention might be all that’s needed now to remedy the situation. Be thankful for difficult people; they remind you of who you do not want to be."
aries,2017-11-25,"You can be quite persuasive today if you slow down your delivery enough so people can follow your thinking. The problem is your brain is processing so fast now that you might leave out significant details just so you don't lose your train of thought. Still, it’s better to say too little than too much because others may believe your approach is scattered if you try to cover everything at once. Composer George Gershwin said, “Life is a lot like jazz... it’s best when you improvise.”"
taurus,2017-11-25,"You might find yourself in the middle of a discussion today that dredges up old emotionally charged material that you thought was safely buried. But you may fall down the rabbit hole of your past anyhow, as you take one more pass at putting a painful experience to rest. Hopefully, you are open-minded enough to learn from your previous mistakes. Thankfully, you can consciously shift your frame of reference to accommodate your evolving perspective. Author Frank Knight wrote, “We have to adapt and overcome, that’s all we can do.”"
gemini,2017-11-25,"Your emotional flexibility serves you well, especially when circumstances seem to drift out of control. But your friends and family might have a different view of your behavior, and they wonder if you are floundering now. Nevertheless, you’re able to think on your feet as you continue to untangle conflicts in your complicated calendar. Time will tell who is right. In the meantime, you agree with Olympian Mary Lou Retton who said, “Optimism is a happiness magnet. If you stay positive, good things and good people will be drawn to you.”"
cancer,2017-11-25,"You believe your logic is sound today, but you can’t be sure because you feel totally out of your element. Naturally, you prefer to lean on the facts, but there are missing parts of the story and you can’t make the larger pieces all fit into place now. Thankfully, you possess enough confidence to trust that everything will make sense over time -- and it will. In the meantime, enjoy the unsolved puzzle without trying to force resolution. Lao Tzu wrote, “Anticipate the difficult by managing the easy.”"
leo,2017-11-25,"A relationship issue that comes to light today feels familiar, giving you hope that it can be easily handled so you can move on. But your sense of déjà vu also makes you wonder why this problem continues to resurface. Luckily, you have an opportunity to gain a new understanding of your habitual patterns and how to change them. The key to your current breakthrough comes from a combination of your willingness to share your insights and to listen to the feedback you receive. It pays to keep an open mind and a responsive heart."
virgo,2017-11-25,"You’re willing to look at your activities today from a totally new point of view. Instead of fixating on your current schedule and how it differs from your ideal day, consider the changes you could make in your daily routine that would impact every day, not just this one. If possible, involve someone else in your process because it helps to receive support from an ally when improving your life. Robin Sharma wrote, “Today’s new behavior is the beginning of tomorrow’s new habit.”"
libra,2017-11-25,"You can already sense the changes on the horizon and you hope to move through them as gracefully as possible. It’s natural to feel a combination of excitement and fear as you consider all the possibilities before you. However, rather than bearing the burden on your own, talk about your feelings with a trustworthy friend. Revealing your current state of apprehension now enables you to clarify what you want in your future. Never stop looking up."
scorpio,2017-11-25,"Sometimes, you feel unstable when you can’t easily find your way back to center. However, exhilaration overpowers any uncertainty today as you revisit a series of events that has brought you to this present moment. Assessing your current position, along with your apparent trajectory, gives rise to a new wave of confidence that you are doing something that will generate enduring positive change. John Locke wrote, “The discipline of desire is the background of character.”"
sagittarius,2017-11-25,"Although you probably can see the speedbump in front of you, you have no intention of slowing down today. In fact, your thoughts are racing ahead so fast, you could achieve lift-off prior to reaching the obstacle. But there’s no fallback position now. If you’re going to take the risk and reach for the stars, you can’t cling to any doubt. The very notion of failure is enough to spoil your success. You have anticipated this moment and you’re prepared for it. Carpe diem."
capricorn,2017-11-25,"You may appear to be cautious today, but you’re more radical in your thinking than anyone realizes. Although people see you as dependable in times of uncertainty, you are entertaining every possibility now, no matter how crazy it sounds. Fortunately, you have the sense to keep your most unconventional ideas quiet, and this rational approach encourages others to support what you finally share. Architect Frank Lloyd Wright said, “There is nothing more uncommon than common sense.”"
aquarius,2017-11-25,"You possess a rare blend of visionary innovation and respect for tradition. Your unique perspective enables you to imagine creative solutions when others are stuck in the status quo. Fortunately, once you share your thoughts, it’s obvious to most people that your plan is vastly different than everyone else’s. More importantly, folks are eager to give it a try. You are like the fictional character MacGyver who said, “Any problem can be solved with a little ingenuity.”"
pisces,2017-11-25,"You may be concerned that going along with a group decision today might send a message that’s contrary to your nature. Your self-esteem is fueled by your ability to feel compassion for others even when you don’t agree with them. But there are limits to what you will do in order to be considered one of the crew. You don’t need to turn your dilemma into a crisis; just follow your heart, even if it means temporarily pulling away from everyone. Sometimes it is best to be alone than alone in a crowd."
aries,2017-11-26,"In theory, you understand why it’s wise to be receptive to other people’s perspectives. You might even go out of your way to ask someone to share their experiences. But, in practice, you’re itching to stop talking and swing into action. Although the Pisces Moon encourages reflection, the Sagittarius Sun speaks to your need for speed. Nevertheless, you ultimately believe that he who hesitates is lost. Gandhi said, “Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony.”"
taurus,2017-11-26,"Socializing with your friends and family brings out the best in you today. However, the adventurous Sagittarius Sun is arguing with the dreamy Pisces Moon in your 11th House of Community. Sharing your hopes for the future sounds enticing, but you might not feel supported if others think you’re heading in the wrong direction. Although you may want to leave at the first sign of conflict, talking it out puts everyone’s concerns to rest. Philosopher Alfred North Whitehead wrote, “Every really new idea looks crazy at first.”"
gemini,2017-11-26,"You don’t know whether or not to take people at face value today. Someone may suggest an activity that sounds fantastic to you, but they become less enthused as your excitement mounts. You wonder if you’re reading the energy wrong and could be confused by the entire interaction. But this situation stirs a deeper issue about your natural willingness to go along with others. Your adaptability can become problematic if you agree to an idea before thinking it through. Keep your expectations realistic now; go ahead and create a back-up plan so you won’t be disappointed if plans change."
cancer,2017-11-26,"You are in danger of letting your compassion spin out of control today. It’s one thing to empathize with someone who is in pain, but don’t allow their suffering to overwhelm your heart. You can do the most good by carefully managing your boundaries now. Maintaining a clear sense of self is necessary for your wellbeing or you could drown in the process of healing others. Remember, you can’t pour from an empty cup. Relax and put your needs first for a change."
leo,2017-11-26,"As long as you are smiling, the world will smile with you -- or so it seems. You may consciously choose to walk on the sunny side of the street today since you know it’s not as pleasant in the shade. However, you soon realize that a significant part of the spectrum of reality is missing from your experience. You don’t need to seek negativity just to know how it feels, but failing to face a challenge because it’s uncomfortable does not serve you in the long run. Carl Jung wrote, “Shadow work is the path of the heart warrior.”"
virgo,2017-11-26,"You might decide to spend some time on your own today so you can reconnect with your inner world. The imaginative Pisces Moon is visiting your 7th House of Relationships, flooding your fantasies with vague impressions that seem to originate from others. You can’t easily tell which feelings are yours and which belong to someone else. Turn down the noise by temporarily avoiding crowds. Anthony Douglas Williams wrote, “Silence has a mysterious calming effect, allowing your soul to be at peace with your thoughts.”"
libra,2017-11-26,"Your desire to be of service to those you love lights up your world today. Instead of pursuing personal pleasure, you’re inclined to share your gifts in the hopes of improving the lives of others. Happily, when your friends feel better, so do you. Just don’t lose sight of your own physical and emotional needs. Nothing is gained if you deplete your energy in your effort to help everyone else. Recharging your batteries is necessary when you give more than you get."
scorpio,2017-11-26,"Your dreams feel closer than ever today, but you realize your path is not always easy. You might be tempted to close down and hide your feelings in order to protect your vulnerable heart. However, creating unnecessary boundaries won’t make obstacles disappear and can isolate you from your most dedicated supporters. Sufi poet Rumi wrote, “Why struggle to open a door between us when the whole wall is an illusion?”"
sagittarius,2017-11-26,"You’re on a quest to be the best possible version of yourself today. Your friends and family can see how serious you are about your journey of metaphysical discovery. But they might not be aware of other important facets of your current explorations because you choose to keep some of your process private. You are happy to receive support, but you also believe that no one understands the depth of  your spiritual experience. Aristotle wrote, “Knowing yourself is the beginning of all wisdom.”"
capricorn,2017-11-26,"You may feel as if you’re gearing up for showtime but you’re still flying beneath the radar today. You don’t want to let anyone in on your secret yet, but you are busily developing a plan for the next chapter of your life. Although you’re not quite ready to share your ideas, you recognize the immeasurable value of your social network. Once you initiate action, you’re going to need the participation of others more than ever. Timing is everything when your success is at stake."
aquarius,2017-11-26,"You’re at the top of your game now, and you can enjoy basking in the warmth of the love surrounding you. Something as simple as a smile from the right person can brighten your world. However, you cannot rest on your laurels, for there is plenty of work yet to be done. Thankfully, you don’t need to do everything today, but it’s still wise to plot your course when the wind is in your sails. Oprah Winfrey said, “You get in life what you have the courage to ask for.”"
pisces,2017-11-26,"Nearly everyone who encounters you today receives an energetic boost, feeling happier because your paths have crossed. Whether or not you think of yourself as a healer, you seem to possess the magic touch now. Just listening to someone else’s problems and giving them a few words of encouragement may be enough to lift their spirits. By visualizing the best possible outcome in any situation, your imagination creates the way forward for everyone. Your heart shines when your compassion glows."
aries,2017-11-27,"Your feelings are anything but casual today. In fact, your desires are running toward the extremes -- black and white, with very little gray in between. You might be so attracted to someone that you declare your love too soon and scare them away. Or, you could emotionally withdraw, only to discover how much you miss the intimacy. It seems like you can’t win no matter what you do now. However, this unstable phase may require you to make lots of adjustments to your relationships while you try to find equilibrium. The key to keeping your balance is knowing when you’ve lost it."
taurus,2017-11-27,"You might not know how to react if someone professes their undying love for you today. But it’s not as straightforward as responding with a yes or no; the days of simple binary decisions are over. Modern relationships include a wide spectrum of possibilities, leaving you with the responsibility of sorting it all out and creating a mutually beneficial path. Nevertheless, separating your fantasies from reality can be extra tricky now, so don’t stress if you must temporarily give up until your clarity returns tomorrow. Exploring your options takes time."
gemini,2017-11-27,"You have a sneaky suspicion that someone at work is admiring you from a distance. Although you might be flattered by the attention, you’re not interested in mixing personal relationships and office politics. In fact, you are seeking ways to simplify your life rather than complicate it. You’re unclear about how to handle the situation because you don’t want to jeopardize the comfort level already established. Luckily, talking your feelings over leads to an amicable resolution for everyone as long as you don’t expect everything to be solved immediately. Don’t try to rush things that need time to grow."
cancer,2017-11-27,You may surprise everyone by breaking out of your mold at work but it doesn’t matter what issue you use to catalyze the change. What is important now is that you stand tall in your convictions without being swayed by people with an agenda that differs from yours. There’s no reason to keep track of who supports you and who does not. The only thing that matters in the long run is how you feel. Align your words and actions with your heart for the best results.
leo,2017-11-27,"You crave the adoration and affection that comes from a lover or spouse, but you might not want to sacrifice your independence just to get it. Nevertheless, you are still eager to try and make everything work. You claim you’re a new person, yet you carry your old fears with you. Thankfully, you can burn out old karma with your fiery style and powerful actions. Frank Sinatra sang, “So take a deep breath, pick yourself up, dust yourself off, start all over again.”"
virgo,2017-11-27,"You might be confused today because you can’t figure out what others want, even if they tell you. Their words say one thing yet their body language says another. But you’re willing to cut people some slack because that’s what you would like from them. After all, you’re not perfect last time you checked. However, you possess an unrelenting spirit and the eagerness to show up and do your best. Fortunately, that is more than enough even if you wish you could do more."
libra,2017-11-27,"You’re performing your best balancing act today, but it may not prevent you from taking an unnecessary spill. You might need to call in some favors and ask your friends for help. But they can only do so much; the real work is yours and yours alone. Although you want to open your heart, you can’t command it to happen. Skip the rationalizations and head right to your emotions. Your intuition is waiting for you to plug in and listen."
scorpio,2017-11-27,"You’re playing for keeps when it comes to the game of love. Although you prefer to take your time to build a solid foundation, you could lose perspective today as your feelings intensify rather suddenly. But something may happen that snaps you back to your senses, shifting you out of your heart and into your head. You are the master of your own thoughts, even if you’re a slave of your emotions."
sagittarius,2017-11-27,"Your feelings are aroused today and you are eager to follow them to the source of your attraction. However, you are also motivated to deepen your spiritual practices. Unfortunately, you can’t seem to successfully juggle your metaphysical interests with your romantic desires. You want to pursue each yet may end up with neither because you approach both as all-or-nothing pursuits. Avoid making long-term decisions now because you can’t accurately gauge the relative importance of your goals. Revisit your priorities in a few days when clarity returns."
capricorn,2017-11-27,"You take commitments of all kinds quite seriously, but you may run into trouble following through with your promises today. It’s not that you are operating with bad intentions; you don’t want to take advantage of anyone. It’s just that you might fall short of people’s expectations now, and rather than trying harder, you’re tempted to just throw in the towel. Nevertheless, as Maya Angelou said, “If you know you can do better, then do better.”"
aquarius,2017-11-27,"You’re able to capitalize on a personal relationship today, morphing a long-term acquaintance into a profitable business association. You are pleased that you can reinvent an old friendship and breathe new life into it. But you’re also concerned that the changing dynamics of this partnership could also bring about its demise if you aren’t careful. Total honesty is key to making this collaboration work. More choices demand more caution."
pisces,2017-11-27,"Your fantasies could overtake the real world if you surrendered to them, but you are more likely to survive and even thrive because of your willingness to walk the fine line between dreams and reality. Nevertheless, each time you venture into the realms of imagination, you encounter a customs officer who runs a complete reality check on your intentions before allowing you to pass. His goal is not to prevent you from entering the Land of Make-Believe; it’s to ensure you know the difference between fact and fiction. The trick is to see things for what they are instead of what you want them to be."
aries,2017-11-28,"Outlining your plans for the year ahead seems like a wise use of your time today, but there are several unknown factors that need clarification before you make any commitments. However, you are tempted to impulsively go ahead and say yes before you know all the details once the Moon blasts into fiery Aries. Nevertheless, you don’t want to finalize a decision twice. Gather the necessary information prior to signing on the dotted line. Doing things in the right order simplifies your life in the long run."
taurus,2017-11-28,"You might be expected to share your perspective on a complicated matter at work today. Although you have your opinions, you’re not interested in discussing them with anyone else at this time. Other people seem to be optimistic about the possible changes, but you’re not in agreement with their assessment. However, you don’t want to engage in a conflict where you end up playing the devil’s advocate. Talking about the issue accomplishes nothing now. Silence is your best option when you have nothing nice to say."
gemini,2017-11-28,"You can’t escape from the truth about a relationship today. Or, perhaps, you’re the recipient of a reality check issued by a partner or associate. No matter how the message finds its way to you, there’s no choice but to deal with it. Although you might feel immobilized at first, it’s wise to quickly move through your hesitation. Things will start to stabilize once you assimilate the new information and begin to do something about it. Regain your balance by reclaiming your power. Strive for progress not perfection."
cancer,2017-11-28,"Your emotional connection with the past is highlighted by a minor crisis today. You may be called out because your production is running behind, or you could run into a roadblock that reveals a problem with your current schedule. You can’t afford to let bad news send you into a tailspin now. In fact, this snafu could be the best thing that ever happened if it compels you to improve your habits and polish your work. Better an oops than a what if."
leo,2017-11-28,"You’re inspired to channel your creativity into something real today. You want to demonstrate the breadth of your vision as a pragmatic Mercury-Saturn conjunction occurs in expansive Sagittarius and your 5th House of Self-Expression. However, your little project isn’t as straightforward as you think. Thankfully, keeping your mind’s eye on the final result will help you stay on track. Rumi wrote, “Shine like the whole universe is yours.”"
virgo,2017-11-28,"Someone may be giving you a hard time today and you’re not sure why. Unfortunately, people aren’t saying much now, leaving you too much room to fill in the blanks with your doubts. Rather than worrying needlessly, it’s smarter to tell your story to others and let the conversation unfold the truth. Communication brings clarity when nothing else will. Mary Browne wrote, “The elegance of honesty needs no adornment.”"
libra,2017-11-28,"You don’t have enough time in the day to respond to emails, return phone calls and tie up all the loose ends that have unraveled. You feel like you’re driving down an information superhighway that narrows from four lanes to one while a restrictive Mercury-Saturn hookup occurs in your 3rd House of Communication. You may become so frustrated that you look for an exit ramp to escape from the traffic jam. However, there are no shortcuts when there are lessons to be learned."
scorpio,2017-11-28,"Your confidence rises and falls with the tides today. An unexpected setback could catalyze a cascade of conflicting concerns about your ability to perform your job. However, self-doubt and fear of failure can motivate you to work harder. Ironically, just as you begin to bottom out, the Moon enters enthusiastic Aries, fueling your self-esteem and inspiring you to nurture a positive outlook. Thankfully, if you continue to do the work when you are down, you will be back to yourself before you know it. Resiliency is your secret weapon."
sagittarius,2017-11-28,"Your current assignment is not yet complete, but you may be at a turning point today. You might have planned on already being done with this chapter of your life by now. However, for one reason or another you don’t yet have the green light. Justifying your situation by placing external blame is a colossal waste of time. Instead, refine your approach based upon the changing dynamics. Although you want immediate results, patience pays off in ways you can't yet imagine."
capricorn,2017-11-28,"You’re in for a rude awakening today if you thought you could power your way right through a roadblock. In fact, the cosmos is issuing you a speeding ticket for talking too fast as chatty Mercury runs into authoritative Saturn. Don’t worry; this is not the end of the road. This is merely a warning to slow down and pay attention to the details of your work. Poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow wrote, “It takes less time to do a thing right, than it does to explain why you did it wrong.”"
aquarius,2017-11-28,"You may feel isolated today, as if all your friends and associates are at a party without you. However, it’s your sense of alienation that’s causing your worry, not the real or imagined gathering. Although talkative Mercury is restrained by somber Saturn in your 11th House of Social Networks, there’s no reason to let paranoia hijack your day. Caroline Myss wrote, “Never blame another person for your personal choices -- you are still the one who must live out the consequences of your choices.”"
pisces,2017-11-28,"At first glance, achieving your goals seems out of the question today, but your courageous and ambitious nature is not to be underestimated. The distance between where you are now and where you are going makes reaching your destination appear impossible. However, you are much closer than you think. Objects in your line of sight may appear farther than they are. Someday you will look back at this time in your life, thankful that you didn’t give up."
aries,2017-11-29,"Your reactions are strong and immediate today, but your unpremeditated behavior can elicit undesirable consequences as the reckless Aries Moon squares ruthless Pluto in your 10th House of Career. You may find yourself locked in an argument with your boss or someone else who holds a powerful position. Your strength of conviction won’t likely be enough to assure your victory. Remember that you’re in it for the long haul and choosing your conflicts wisely may determine your success or failure. Sometimes it’s necessary to lose a battle to win the war."
taurus,2017-11-29,"You have high hopes about deepening a friendship by revealing your previously unexpressed dreams. You’re eager to take a risk today and launch into a story about your spiritual explorations. However, you might stir up a hornet’s nest if your religious views or metaphysical assumptions are in conflict with the faith of others. It’s imperative to express your beliefs without imposing them on anyone else. Nevertheless, it’s difficult to find common ground if one person already knows the other one is wrong. Mutual respect is a cornerstone to a strong community."
gemini,2017-11-29,"You think all is well in your social world at first glance today, but strange energies are floating in the atmosphere. Sharing your plans with a friend or associate seems like an innocent thing to do. However, your disclosure may not unfold the way you wish as emotions escalate. You could suddenly find yourself in the middle of a melodrama that has nothing to do with you. Unfortunately, a quick escape seems out of the question. Although you didn’t break the vase, you still have to pick up the pieces."
cancer,2017-11-29,"It doesn’t necessarily feel comfortable, but you’re ready to step outside of your emotional safety zone today in order to get what you want. You might think that your willingness to put your feelings on the line will immediately bring you the respect and rewards you seek. But it appears as if an adversary is present every step of your way. Fortunately, the situation is not as dire as it seems and your concern only makes matters worse. Continue on your path, undeterred by the judgment of others. Confidence is contagious."
leo,2017-11-29,"You have big plans, but you may need to follow a long and winding road until you can start to execute them. Naturally, you are happiest when your dreams are manifesting like instant karma, but you’re willing to sit quietly in a holding pattern if you must. Although you really don’t like waiting for something that should already be yours, you’ll take delayed gratification over none at all. Irish Statesman Edmund Burke wrote, “Our patience will achieve more than our force.”"
virgo,2017-11-29,"Exploring the natural beauty in the shadows demands a certain strength of character, and you’re up for the excursion today. Unfortunately, someone with an ax to grind might single you out and try to discredit your work. But you are a force to be reckoned with when it comes to your integrity. Your survival instincts kick in when you feel threatened, especially now that the warrior Aries Moon squares unrelenting Pluto in your 5th House of Self-Expression. Lao Tzu wrote, “Respond intelligently even to unintelligent treatment.”"
libra,2017-11-29,"People seem to change their minds at the drop of a hat today. You wish you could approve of their spontaneous behavior, but it complicates your schedule. Naturally, you want to maintain a friendly connection, but not at the cost of turning your life inside out. Although you’re most often driven by your desire for peace and harmony, you could reach a breaking point now and say or do something you’ll soon wish you hadn’t. Gold medalist Jackie Joyner-Kersee said, “It's better to look ahead and prepare, than to look back and regret.”"
scorpio,2017-11-29,"You feel the need for a sudden and complete overhaul of your daily routine because it’s no longer aligned with your goals. However, your transformation might require the intervention of supportive friends to assist you in morphing the old into the new. Nevertheless, you still could run into resistance from someone who isn’t on board with your plan, but you can’t let that derail your progress. Thankfully, your persistence will be rewarded and the very same people who thwarted your efforts may turn into your biggest fans."
sagittarius,2017-11-29,"You are on a creative rollercoaster today, making it necessary to ride the waves of production when they are flowing. However, unpredictable currents can knock you for a loop and stir up so much adrenaline that you can’t think straight. Instead of forcing your continued output, know when to take a break. Intermittent rest and relaxation periods throughout the day enable you to work your magic more effectively. John Muir wrote, “The power of imagination makes us infinite.”"
capricorn,2017-11-29,"There are many separate issues that feed your anger these days and it’s challenging to leave your feelings unexpressed. Unfortunately, no one knows your needs unless you tell them. Keeping your thoughts to yourself doesn’t do anything to improve the current emotional imbalance. In fact, suppressed negativity just grows stronger when left to simmer. Carlos Castaneda wrote, “We either make ourselves miserable or we make ourselves strong. The amount of work is the same.”"
aquarius,2017-11-29,"You are growing increasingly restless day by day and are ready to do almost anything to alleviate the mounting pressure. However, the longer you can wait the better now, because your actions will likely set a whole new sequence of events into motion. Although there’s no way of knowing in advance exactly what will happen once you speak your truth, your honesty and kindness will help to minimize any further conflict. Transparency cultivates trust."
pisces,2017-11-29,"You might be concerned about the inconsistent behavior of your friends today. However, it’s not entirely clear whether or not your suspicions are based on the facts. You may even feel like the entire world is against you now that paranoid Pluto forms a contentious square with the independent Aries Moon in your 2nd House of Self-Esteem. Surprisingly, the emotional landscape could dramatically shift in a moment’s notice, restoring your faith in others. Tim Fargo wrote, “Opportunity doesn't make appointments, you have to be ready when it arrives.”"
aries,2017-11-30,"It might be challenging to discern the difference between adrenaline and anxiety today. Whatever you call it, you’re likely feeling on edge and can’t decide whether to back away from the uncertainty or to jump into the fire. Although your first impulse is to leap, it’s wiser to wait and watch the circumstances unfold before you’re in over your head. If your friends are telling you to hold off, listen to their good advice. And remember the words of Margaret Thatcher who said, “I am extraordinarily patient, provided I get my own way in the end.”"
taurus,2017-11-30,"Unexpected news at work could require you to recalibrate your schedule in order to accommodate the change in circumstances. All of a sudden, there are too many unknowns and a lack of certainty makes you nervous. But when the going gets tough, you Bulls become more determined than ever to continue along your chosen path. Nevertheless, responding out of fear won’t help the situation. Give yourself a little space to readjust to the new lay of the land before making any important decisions. Transformation takes time."
gemini,2017-11-30,"The walls of containment are shaking and the structures that have been holding you back are starting to crumble. You are one step closer to realizing your dreams of independence, but you must respond to the current changes to turn an apparent crisis into a lucky opportunity. Paradoxically, your attempts to maintain the status quo will act like a lightning rod that attracts greater instability. Although you need to make your move, don’t react too quickly without a plan in place. President John F. Kennedy said, “Conformity is the jailer of freedom and the enemy of growth.”"
cancer,2017-11-30,"When circumstances seem to grow out of control, your tendency is to retreat in order to protect your sense of security. However, once you see the handwriting on the wall, you can quickly shift gears and become proactive to maximize your position. Running into external resistance now is not the problem; the cosmos is encouraging you to step up to the plate and be the creative agent of change in your life that you dream about. Hafiz wrote, “An awake heart is like a sky that pours light.”"
leo,2017-11-30,You are in the process of reactivating an old fantasy that you previously set aside to fulfill your responsibilities. But impulsive behavior could create more disruption than opportunity today. Talking about your unrealized dreams with someone you trust is a smart way to get the ball rolling. You are being offered a chance to have your cake and eat it too if you’re willing to take a calculated risk now. There is a way to continue with your life as you have created it while also opening a door to the future you imagine. Your job is to find it.
virgo,2017-11-30,"You’re not one for surprises when you’re working on a tight schedule. In fact, you may grow anxious today if something happens out of the blue. But you are more in control of your destiny than it seems. Doing whatever it takes to reclaim your inner tranquility is more important than anything you could do in the outer world now. Once you have reconnected with your center, the external pieces will fall into place quicker than you expect."
libra,2017-11-30,"People seem less than reliable today as they promise one thing yet do another. You wonder if there’s something in the air and if everyone has caught a touch of irresponsibility. Nevertheless, the tension is palpable, and it feels like something big is going to happen. Rather than pointing your finger at anyone else and blaming them for your current dilemma, examine how you may be contributing to the angst. Accepting your role in the greater chaos enables you to do something about it. Conflict resolution starts within your psyche and spreads from there."
scorpio,2017-11-30,"Consistency in your daily life has been disrupted by chaos. Although you anticipate returning to a normal routine, it might seem like a dream that’s fading into the past. Fortunately, your wish may come true sooner than you think. You are at a turning point today where you can begin to recapture a simpler lifestyle without sacrificing your recent gains. Avoid overreacting to the current tension; it will settle down on its own, leaving you in a better state of mind to make choices that will impact your future."
sagittarius,2017-11-30,"You’re ready to cut loose and let the winds of fate carry you wherever they will. However, your innocent daydreams of flying will only lead to a crash landing unless you stop and put things into a proper perspective. Your intentions may be admirable, but your spontaneous behavior without forethought is childlike foolishness. Cherish your hopes and dreams by creating a viable plan to make them come true. Intention plus hard work equals magic."
capricorn,2017-11-30,"There are legends about the Mountain Goat’s determination to reach the summit. You are known for your ability to set goals and reach them, but the best strategies in the world become useless if you aren’t motivated to follow through with your plans. You may be experiencing strange rumblings in your emotional foundation that make you wonder if you’re on the right track now. Perhaps you’re due for a reevaluation of your life purpose. You might decide to change everything or nothing. Thankfully, going through the process will leave you feeling revitalized, no matter what you discover."
aquarius,2017-11-30,"The cosmos is playing your song today, but it may be blaring and you can’t find a way to turn down the volume. The key to uncovering a solution to this dilemma is understanding that your tune carries a message of independence, and the more restricted you feel, the louder the music must blast in order to get your attention. Paradoxically, your world will grow quieter as soon as you begin to consider alternative paths into your future. The universe won’t need to shout at you once you remember how important it is to fearlessly express your freedom."
pisces,2017-11-30,"You prefer to be left to your own devices today, meandering through your dreamworld with little interruption. Any activity that stimulates your imagination is high on your list, whether it’s watching a movie, reading a book or listening to music. Unfortunately, reality has other plans for you now. Much to your chagrin, you may need to sacrifice your leisure time to deal with a minor financial or relationship crisis. Fortunately, once you rectify your accounts and revisit a sticky issue with your partner, you can return to feeding your soul."
aries,2017-12-01,"You are quite sure that everything is going to turn out even better than you imagine as long as you take definitive action now. But it’s not wise to believe everything you think today. Although the power of your positive attitude can lead to a brighter future, it might also prompt you to run an unnecessary risk that could jeopardize recent progress. Don’t follow the rash advice of anyone else unless you feel it in your gut while unstable Uranus opposes aggressive Mars in your 7th House of Others. Your common sense outweighs someone else’s panic."
taurus,2017-12-01,"You’re channeling your inner Bull today and feel like nothing will prevent you from reaching your goals. Unfortunately, a sudden change of circumstances can occur out of the blue, revealing how unprepared you are to reap the benefits of the seeds you have sown. You may set yourself up for failure if you overreact and blindly push ahead, without regard to the new conditions. On the other hand, adopting a methodical approach might mean success is further off into the future. Nevertheless, a carefully considered response increases the odds of achieving a personal victory. A flexible mind and a determined heart make a winning combination."
gemini,2017-12-01,"Someone may present you with an exciting opportunity today, but don’t jump too quickly at the chance. First, consider your possible financial exposure if you say yes. But also think about the potential instability this unknown path may lead you down. Sometimes, taking a gamble is the right thing to do but other times the risk is just not worth the trouble. There’s no right or wrong answers now. Nevertheless, there’s a rational course of action if you can discover it. Anthropologist Carlos Barrios said, “Find your heart, and you will find your way.”"
cancer,2017-12-01,"You can’t help but worry about the future, especially when unexpected events at work make you unsure of your ability to cope with change. Although there may be many variables up in the air today, you can amaze yourself with your own resilience while the unflappable Taurus Moon is stabilizing your 11th House of Long-Term Goals. Instead of letting the uncertainty pull you off center, put it to good use by expressing your dreams through a creative project. Your passion for your art will make a profound statement to others who are still trying to figure out what to do next. Ram Dass wrote, “Be here now.”"
leo,2017-12-01,"You naturally gravitate to a leadership position, but you may resent someone else’s dependence on you today. You don’t want anything or anyone holding you back from fulfilling your mission now. You might even do something rash to take matters into your own hands. Unfortunately, your actions create unpredictable consequences. Although you are willing to assume responsibility for anything you do, you never can be certain how others might respond. Martin Luther wrote, “Nothing in the world causes so much misery as uncertainty.”"
virgo,2017-12-01,"You can entertain all kinds of possibilities today without necessarily losing your focus. Although stress may be taking its toll on your coworkers, you are busy imagining the next big thing in your life and holding onto a hopeful vision no matter what. Once you make a decision, don’t let the external noise stir up random doubts. The good news is you excel at discerning the useful information from all the incoming data. Dr. Joyce Brothers wrote, “A strong, positive self-image is the best possible preparation for success in life.”"
libra,2017-12-01,"You want to take your self-exploration and spiritual growth to the next level. Thankfully, you have the necessary tools for your journey, but your short attention span can stymie your progress. Every little thing that occurs now seems to be another crisis, leaving you little time to pursue your personal interests. Nevertheless, you hold the power of self-awareness within your mind. Ultimately, how you spend your time determines what’s most important. Author Brian Tracy wrote, “The key to success is to focus our conscious mind on things we desire not things we fear.”"
scorpio,2017-12-01,"Your hidden agenda gives your life purpose today. It’s not like you’re up to anything nefarious; you just don’t want to spend your day counseling everyone else when a little undivided attention to your own projects cultivates joy in your heart. Although you’re not prepared to blast your ideas over a loudspeaker yet, it makes sense to pick a highly trusted friend or partner and share your story. You may be happily surprised when your designated ally becomes such a stabilizing force as they validate your destiny’s calling. Mick Jagger said, “Lose your dreams and you might lose your mind.”"
sagittarius,2017-12-01,"You are the life of the party today, even if it’s only a party of one. You can’t help but be charming when sweet Venus returns to your extroverted sign, but you could quickly get into trouble by theorizing when you should stick to the facts. Jumping to conclusions isn’t a sane way to make a decision, even if you’re sorely tempted to skip all the boring details for the sake of expediency. Isaac Asimov wrote, “Your assumptions are your windows on the world. Scrub them off every once in a while, or the light won’t come in.”"
capricorn,2017-12-01,"You may seem to be a bit off your game today, as if something unnerved your very core. In fact, you might uncover a detail about your family history that changes the way you view an ongoing dilemma. Unfortunately, you could be so stressed that you respond impulsively, increasing the likelihood of making poor choices. If you feel an urgent need to shake up the dynamics between home and work, it’s crucial to take time to reconsider the consequences of your reaction. Stephen Covey wrote, “I am not a product of my circumstances. I am a product of my decisions.”"
aquarius,2017-12-01,"You’re still riding a wave of positive cosmic energy, but someone has finally given you some serious food for thought. It’s like receiving a wake-up call a few hours too early and you can’t go back to sleep. Although you must grapple with the truth today, you will emerge from your current struggle a wiser and humbler person. Don’t sidestep the conflict, especially if the real opposition is within. Alan Cohen wrote, “If you gave your inner genius as much credence as your inner critic, you would be light years ahead of where you now stand.”"
pisces,2017-12-01,"The sky clears and new vistas open up before your eyes. You can see new possibilities where there were none yesterday. But you’re feeling apprehensive about choosing your path into the future, because all of them zig and zag, making it nearly impossible to pick the best one. Unfortunately, delaying your decision is not a viable option. Ask for advice if necessary, but your intuition already knows the answer. Vincent Van Gogh said, ""I don't know anything with certainty, but seeing the stars makes me dream."""
aries,2017-12-02,"You don’t understand why reality falls short of your dreams today. In fact, you have little patience for any sort of drawn-out process that presumably leads you to your goals. Your frustrated desire for immediate satisfaction might make you angry, but losing your temper will only make your journey longer. Fortunately, channeling your angst into your work moves you closer to your idealized future and helps to rebuild your confidence in the process. Success will taste even sweeter in time."
taurus,2017-12-02,"You are single-minded in your pursuit of your objectives today, but you might suddenly discover that you bit off more than you can chew. Part of your problem is there are simply too many things you’re trying to squeeze into a few short hours. You take pride in your reliability, so your anxiety may surface every time you think about letting someone down. The earlier you inform people of your over-scheduling problem, the better it will be for everyone. Bruce Lee said, “It’s not the daily increase but the daily decrease. Hack away at the unessential.”"
gemini,2017-12-02,"Naturally, you know the difference between facts and fantasies, but the truth is not as much fun as what you cook up in your imagination. You’re not just whistling while you work today; you’re conducting entire symphonies with full orchestration. People may wonder why you’re so happy, but there’s no reason to tell them anything about your internal state of affairs. The good news is you can travel everywhere in your mind now as long as you keep up with your responsibilities. Dutch painter Anton Pieck said, “Creativity isn’t worth a thing if it isn’t served with an equal amount of reliability.”"
cancer,2017-12-02,"You may be facing a list of chores a mile long today but you’re confident you will be able to finish them all. However, your progress might slow down throughout the day, until you start to wonder if you’re making any headway at all. But you don’t really have the time to map out all the scheduling options, analyze the data, and develop a creative strategy to complete everything in a timely manner. The most important thing you can do now is to remain open to life as an adventure, wherever it takes you. Zig Ziglar wrote, “Doing your best is more important than being your best.”"
leo,2017-12-02,"There are many wonderful ways to capture your energy today and transform it into something tangible. Although you have a clear idea of what you want to accomplish, you may feel such a creative buzz now that you can’t decide where to start. Actually, it doesn’t matter what you do first as long as you begin the process and keep your eyes on the prize; the details will fall into place naturally. But your commitment cannot waver if you want to overcome the obstacles along the way. Persistence in the face of temporary adversity leads to success."
virgo,2017-12-02,"You normally have a tight grip on reality because you prefer to work smarter not harder. You’re often the one who sees how time can be saved on a job by envisioning a different approach. However, you’re in a very optimistic mood today, believing that things will take care of themselves, if only one would trust in the process. Unfortunately, the complexity of the convergent forces coming to bear on the present moment still requires your innovative intervention. The truth is you need to be your very own superhero to save the day."
libra,2017-12-02,"You wish you could take people at face value today but believing others is tough when their actions don’t match their words. At first, you might give them the benefit of the doubt, only to be disappointed with their lack of follow-through later on. Nevertheless, beneath your annoyance runs a deep spiritual conviction that -- no matter what is happening -- everything and everyone is perfectly imperfect. Sometimes, taking a leap of faith is the only way out of an earthly mess."
scorpio,2017-12-02,"Your visions of the future are easier to manage when you keep them to yourself. But today they escape your imagination and, somehow, install themselves into your life. Unfortunately, once others catch wind of your plans, you’re accountable for your ideas and must be ready to explain them in a way that makes sense. The visibility of your inspiration is a mixed blessing because it takes time and energy to collaborate. Ultimately, the benefits of sharing your prescience outweigh the difficulties. Educator Steven Anderson wrote, “Alone we are smart. Together we are brilliant.”"
sagittarius,2017-12-02,"If you thought you were moving into the next phase of your life, think again. You are standing at the precipice of change, eager to jump into a new project or relationship. But the energy shifts at the very last moment today, halting your progress in its tracks. There's no reason to panic now, even if you start to slip backward.

Lao Tzu wrote, “The key to growth is the introduction of higher dimensions of consciousness into our awareness.”"
capricorn,2017-12-02,"It may seem as if there is less of an emotional edge now, but you’re still worried about the fallout from a recent family squabble. Although you may be moved to tell your story among friends, one of them could turn out to be less than trustworthy. But don’t get too complacent because it’s easier to nip a potential problem in the bud than to wait until it’s blossomed and already gone to seed. Relationships require cultivation if you want them to flourish. Karen Lamb wrote, “A year from now you may wish you had started today.”"
aquarius,2017-12-02,"Although you wish to preserve your individuality, your friends are so important now that they take center stage. On the surface, your intent is straightforward, but in practice it’s challenging to reconcile your needs with theirs. Nevertheless, living according to the Golden Rule supports fairness by giving others what you want in return. Happily, this exchange works out well for all parties involved. Satisfaction is not always the  fulfillment of every desire; it is the quiet realization of the many blessings currently in your life."
pisces,2017-12-02,"You are setting ambitious goals today, and won’t give yourself permission to relax until you can justify your break with a list of accomplishments. Thankfully, you have plenty of excess energy to work off while pursuing your objectives. Unfortunately, recognition from your peers doesn’t infuse your soul with exactly what it needs now. The truth is you’re not seeking accolades for what you do; you simply want to be accepted for who you are. Sarah Ban Breathnach wrote, “The authentic self is the soul made visible.”"
aries,2017-12-03,"There’s no simple way to get from here to there today, yet you will probably try anyhow. Unfortunately, you may lack the determination to stick with your plan long enough to see if it really works.

Exploring your psychological landscape motivates you to improve your external conditions. Allan Rufus wrote, “Your inner strength is your outer foundation.”"
gemini,2017-12-03,"Waves of uncertainty come crashing on the shores of your consciousness today. Naturally, the Full Moon in your sign intensifies your feelings, adding to the complexity of relationships, especially since trickster Mercury turns retrograde in your 7th House of Others. Although your adaptability usually enables you to go with the prevailing currents, you’re reluctant to say yes to anything now because you can’t tell which way the wind is blowing. Deepak Chopra wrote, “To make the right choices in life, you have to get in touch with your soul.”"
cancer,2017-12-03,"Daydreams about slipping out of your current situation and into a new life can hijack your day. Although the restless Gemini Full Moon rattles your 12th House of Escapism, your delusions of morphing into a superhero are not connected with reality. Nevertheless, metamorphosis is unavoidable, and today’s fantasies play a significant role in determining your future. However, change takes time and if you expect to accomplish your goals right away, your frustration could impede your progress. If you become discouraged, remember that transformation is a process, not an event."
leo,2017-12-03,"You have plenty to say and you’re eager to take every chance available to speak your mind. You could lose your power of discrimination today and accept every social opportunity that comes your way as the chatty Gemini Full Moon brightens your 11th House of Friends.

William Shakespeare wrote, “Have more than you show, speak less than you know.”"
virgo,2017-12-03,"You wish to clarify your place in the world, but you seem to have multiple ideas about where you want to go. Although the dualistic Gemini Full Moon illuminates your 10th House of Public Life, its square to imaginative Neptune fuels your fantasies with outlandish images of fame and fortune. However, you might convince yourself that your success is hindered by your personal history or family responsibilities. But you have an opportunity to change your destiny by choosing one goal and single-mindedly committing to reach it. Actor Scott Caan said, “Good things happen when you set your priorities straight.”"
libra,2017-12-03,"It’s easier to tell a tall tale today than to handle the truth. Your mind is racing through imaginative scenarios, but it’s challenging to distinguish these inspirational flashes from your life as the mischievous Gemini Full Moon lights up your 9th House of Big Ideas. Instead of creating problems by bending reality to suit yourself or someone you love, try your hand at writing fiction or spinning a yarn. Everything will be fine if you can keep the facts and your fantasies separate. Poet Muriel Rukeyser wrote, “The universe is made of stories, not atoms.”"
scorpio,2017-12-03,"You are fully prepared to go wherever your thoughts lead because you’re on a quest to improve your life.

sagittarius,2017-12-03,"You might not be able to avoid the complexity of relationship fantasies today as your mind weaves dreams about people you know. Some things are better left in fantasyland, but it’s nearly impossible now to know which visions are worth pursuing. Setting priorities on your own is not wise while the curious Gemini Full Moon activates your 7th House of Significant Others. Employing your friends and family as sounding boards enables you to make the best choices. Being intelligent enough to listen to those you love and courageous enough to act on good advice can make all the difference in the world."
capricorn,2017-12-03,"You have reached a turning point and your current behavior will set the tone for the weeks ahead. The versatile Gemini Full Moon lands in your 6th House of Routine, prompting you to delay your decision on a personal matter. You may be overly concerned that making a commitment now will severely limit your choices down the road. Ironically, the opposite is true; narrowing your options will attract more opportunities. David Foster Wallace wrote, “Be on guard. The road widens, and many of the detours are seductive.”"
aquarius,2017-12-03,"Exercising your playfulness through self-expression sounds like a natural thing to do today, but it’s more complicated than you think. You’re driven to make something meaningful that you can share with your friends, but it’s tough to get into a productive groove. Although the Gemini Full Moon falls in your 5th House of Fun and Games, its square to fuzzy Neptune prevents you from fully trusting your intuition. Poet Sylvia Plath wrote, “The worst enemy to creativity is self-doubt.” Nevertheless, resistance dissipates once you choose courage over concern."
pisces,2017-12-03,"You can see how your recent hard work will likely be rewarded in the near future. However, your road to success may encounter a few detours you don’t expect. It might be disheartening at first if you discover you took a wrong turn, but your decision-making abilities are hampered while foggy Neptune squares the Gemini Full Moon in your 4th House of Emotional Security. The safest route isn’t necessarily the best one. Swedish coach Sven Göran Eriksson wrote, “The greatest barrier to success is the fear of failure.”"
aries,2017-12-04,"Your optimism fades because everything seems to require additional time and effort now. You speak yet aren’t heard until you say the same thing a few times. It takes you twenty minutes to get to someplace that’s only ten minutes away. It’s enough to make you think the universe is purposefully impeding your progress today -- and perhaps it is. It’s not always necessary to be so aggressive when you meet resistance; paying attention to the signs helps you to go with the flow instead of pushing against it. Lao Tzu wrote, “That which offers no resistance overcomes the hardest substances.”"
taurus,2017-12-04,"A crisis of confidence may be precipitated by someone who works closely with you. But another’s person’s harsh feedback might actually be a blessing in disguise. Rather than sinking into self-doubt today, consider responding to negative criticism in a positive manner, whether or not you agree with it. Imagine you’re learning what you can do to improve your contribution. You can’t change the past, but you can alter the future by changing your attitude in the present."
gemini,2017-12-04,"The same people who have been cheering you on to move ahead with your plans might have a change of heart and tell you to reconsider them. At first, you may be so annoyed with their unexpected objections that you start an argument. But conflict won’t solve anything and could even set you back. In fact, Mercury’s retrograde phase is a perfect opportunity to review your recent progress and reevaluate your goals. Your willingness to adapt to new conditions is a backbone of your success."
cancer,2017-12-04,"You’re not sure how you will accomplish all your work this week, but there’s no time for you to complain. You will simply need to get busy and make the best of a difficult situation. However, your current lens may be sullied with negativity that dissipates toward the end of the week if you remain calm. The trick is to keep up your efforts now, so you don’t end up in trouble later on. President Franklin Roosevelt said, “The only limit to our realization of tomorrow will be our doubts of today.”"
leo,2017-12-04,"Acting cautiously in a relationship is probably your smartest strategy now. There’s no reason to keep your feelings entirely to yourself, but you don’t need to play all your cards at once. In fact, there’s good reason to unfold your story slowly and deliberately; a methodical approach gives the other person time to assimilate your message. Instead of pushing toward immediate satisfaction, look at your current interaction as part of a larger process that could take weeks to unfold. Lincoln Chafee wrote, “Trust is built with consistency.”"
virgo,2017-12-04,"You are concerned about your professional trajectory now and may analyze current events from a global perspective. Although you can see how everything is connected to the bigger picture, your natural tendency to narrow your focus still might create obstacles to your progress. Nevertheless, your penchant for details actually works in your favor as long as you know when to stop. Being here and now is more useful when you have a clear destination in mind."
libra,2017-12-04,"You may struggle with someone’s negativity today as they attempt to convince you that your current position is wrong. It’s not always easy to go on the record with your opinion, and you don’t appreciate having to defend it against people who don’t even take the time to understand your logic. Nipping the problem in the bud is your best response, but you must do it right away. A moment of hesitation now may cost a lifetime of regrets."
scorpio,2017-12-04,"You’re prepared to work hard to meet your commitments today. However, you might experience self-doubt if others question your values. Your integrity is fundamental to your decisions, and you find it disconcerting if you feel the need to fight for your beliefs. Justifying your motives is a dead-end street. Instead, channel your distress directly into your job performance and let your production speak for you. Marcus Aurelius wrote, “Waste no more time arguing about what a good man should be. Be one.”"
sagittarius,2017-12-04,"People might be concerned if you don’t seem to be as happy as they think you should be. But there’s no reason to fall into the trap of trying to fulfill anyone else’s expectations now, especially when it comes to your character. You’re serious for a good reason; reassessing recent choices about your life path may be necessary as cerebral Mercury retrogrades through your sign. The cosmos is offering you extra time to reconsider your current strategy and to redirect your efforts to align your goals with your heart. Anne Frank wrote, “A quiet conscience makes one strong!”"
capricorn,2017-12-04,"You appear so busy today that your coworkers won’t likely think anything is wrong. Nevertheless, your behavior could be covering your real concerns as you struggle with an issue that you prefer to keep private. You’re willing to hide your feelings, so people won’t interfere with your current spiritual process. Although the planetary emphasis on your 12th House of Secrets tempts you to say nothing, sharing your story with a trusted confidant can lighten your metaphysical load. Robert Louis Stevenson wrote, “A friend is a gift you give yourself.”"
aquarius,2017-12-04,"You’re on a creative roll today with lots of new ideas popping into awareness. However, you might find it challenging to bring your innovative thoughts out into the open. You may even feel as if your personal expression isn’t appreciated by others, prompting you to keep your current brilliance to yourself. Nevertheless, it’s worth the extra effort on your part, even if acknowledgement doesn’t immediately follow. Your work is important, and will be recognized over time. Persistence is your friend."
pisces,2017-12-04,"Your career responsibilities seem more important than anything else today. In fact, you might be called on to perform duties beyond your regular routine. Naturally, you want to do a good job, and you could end up temporarily setting aside other commitments in order to achieve excellence at work. Nevertheless, it’s a mistake to ignore your home, family and personal relationships for the sake of success. Author Tom Robbins wrote, “Don’t confuse symmetry with balance.”"
aries,2017-12-05,"You’re not interested in casual conversations just for the sake of being social today. Thankfully, you have much to gain from a day of reflection if you shift your focus from your head to your heart. What others think about your temporary unavailability is not your concern. Your time alone is an investment in your emotional wellbeing. Brené Brown wrote, “Loving ourselves through the process of owning our story is the bravest thing we will ever do.”"
taurus,2017-12-05,"Ironically, losing yourself in a daydream can be a group project today as ideas are passed back and forth among your friends. The energy of shared emotions is amplified as each person adds his or her perspective to the mix. It’s hard to cling to your individual story because you weave such a convincing tale together. However, sooner or later you must reclaim your own vision in order to manifest it. Ram Dass said, “Don’t compare your path with anybody else’s. Your path is unique to you.”"
gemini,2017-12-05,"You can justify your unusual behavior today by sharing your feelings. However, you’re more likely to remain uncharacteristically quiet to keep your secrets from being exposed. Nevertheless, you have more support now than you realize, and there may not be a better time to take a leap of faith and start a conversation. Your courage might create ripples you can’t imagine; revealing your vulnerability could set an example for someone else to do the same."
cancer,2017-12-05,"You may gain the respect of others today when you demonstrate your emotional self-sufficiency. Although you might enjoy the comfort of a familiar relationship, you need extra space to process your intense feelings now. Your current behavior sends mixed messages to those closest to you who misinterpret your retreat as a rejection. Nothing could be further from the truth, but don’t assume anyone knows that. Take the necessary time to explain that saying yes to yourself doesn’t mean you’re saying no to anyone else."
leo,2017-12-05,"Verbalizing your fantasies is nearly impossible today, and you could frustrate yourself trying. In fact, sometimes sharing a dream prematurely can weaken its further development. There is a time and place for everything; paying attention to the signs  makes all the difference in the world. There’s nothing to be gained by struggling, so let your intuition be your guide. The Beatles sang, “Turn off your mind, relax and float downstream.”"
virgo,2017-12-05,"You can visualize a future that exceeds all your expectations. Unfortunately, you don’t know how you’re going to reach your desired destination. Thankfully, you possess the good sense to procure a map, so you don’t end up on a journey to nowhere. But your refined analytical skills that usually come to your rescue are nowhere to be found today and even reading directions won’t come easily. Ultimately, you may need to reconnect with your feelings in order to get your bearings. Oprah Winfrey said, “Trust your instincts. Intuition doesn’t lie.”"
libra,2017-12-05,"You want to take care of everyone at work today, but may grow resentful if they don’t acknowledge your support. You are a bit fuzzy about your boundaries and you might commit to more than you can actually deliver. Don’t let even the tiniest ambiguity slip by without clarification. Prevent the need to apologize down the road by being a better communicator now. A stitch in time saves nine."
scorpio,2017-12-05,"Your optimism is reinforced by your interactions with others today as they encourage you to follow your dreams. But you’re afraid to move forward because you feel as if you haven’t uncovered all the information that is vital to your project. Thankfully, you can easily convince everyone you’re an expert who has everything under control. You won’t miss anything as long as you focus on the big picture. Nevertheless, you’re at a loss when it comes down to knowing the details. Elna Raye wrote, “Where hope grows, miracles blossom.”"
sagittarius,2017-12-05,"You long for a real human connection today, built upon shared dreams and common interests. Taking a risk and revealing your hopes isn’t as easy as it sounds now, especially if the other person isn’t interested in a heart-to-heart conversation. If there’s no one who fits the bill for a meaningful exchange now, don’t settle for second best. British actor Nigel Harman wrote, “You’ve got to aim high and see where you land.”"
capricorn,2017-12-05,"You are sure that someone isn’t telling you everything you need to know today. However, you must make a decision about a relationship, even if you don’t have all the information. You might utilize all your favorite tricks to get people talking, but your words could fall on deaf ears. The harder you try, the more self-protected everyone else becomes. You may need to shift your tactics and be patient. Your simple act of respecting a person's boundaries encourages them to open up and share whatever they were previously hiding. Elbert Hubbard wrote, “Secrets are things we give to others to keep for us.”"
aquarius,2017-12-05,"You’re committed to improving your life these days, but don’t know where to begin. It makes sense to start small, inventory your assets, and create a concrete plan to reach your goals. Fortunately, little steps can lead you on a journey of epic proportions. But even before you embark, you must take time to put together your dream team that will ultimately ensure your success. An African proverb teaches, “If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.”"
pisces,2017-12-05,"You can tell that something has shifted, but you can’t tell exactly what it is. Nevertheless, you’re eager to capitalize on this propitious moment once you realize what is actually being offered by the cosmos. It’s as if the heavens suddenly give you the approval you’ve been waiting for. However, it’s still up to you to overcome your personal inertia and initiate decisive action. Novelist Paulo Coelho wrote, “It's the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting.”"
aries,2017-12-06,"You can organize the complexity of a large project today without skipping a beat. It’s as if you’re an athlete that’s been in training for a competition. You’re looking forward to the opportunity to demonstrate your managerial prowess as superhero Mars inspires your confidence. There’s no reason for concern if everything gets off to a slow start. Stay focused; you will be happily surprised with your accomplishments by the end of the day. Samuel Johnson wrote, “Great works are performed not by strength but by perseverance.”"
taurus,2017-12-06,"Creating an ambitious schedule today sets you off in the right direction, but you must involve others in your plans or you will be doomed to fail. Fortunately, you can transform bad odds into a sure win if you bring the right players onto your team early on. However, you must be willing to relinquish some control in order to empower your coworkers to contribute fully. Mother Teresa said, “I can do things you cannot, you can do things I cannot; together we can do great things.”"
gemini,2017-12-06,"Something that seemed impossible only yesterday is now within reach. However, there will be no free lunches; you must work for everything you achieve now as taskmaster Saturn leans on your key planet Mercury. Obstacles may appear in your path, impeding your progress and stirring frustration. Thankfully, warrior Mars comes to your rescue as he supports Mercury, encouraging you to stand up to anyone or anything that threatens your success. Journalist Hal Borland wrote, “Knowing trees, I understand the meaning of patience. Knowing grass, I can appreciate persistence.”"
cancer,2017-12-06,"Hopefully, you can see the proverbial light at the end of the tunnel today as your recent efforts begin to pay off. Although you know there’s still hard work ahead, you do not have the luxury of allowing a lack of faith to impinge on production. You are particularly sensitive to changes in your mood now, and anything less than absolute certainty distracts you from your tasks. Jack Canfield wrote, “Don’t worry about failures, worry about the chances you miss when you don’t even try.”"
leo,2017-12-06,"The cosmos has an obvious message for you today as you aspire to untangle yourself from a recent dilemma. Although your momentum has been restrained, you can spot signs of forward movement everywhere you look. Nevertheless, there is no quick fix waiting around the next corner; you must fight for every inch you gain. Fortunately, there is a direct relationship between your effort and your progress. Picasso said, “Action is the foundational key to all success.”"
virgo,2017-12-06,"Planning for the future is challenging when there is still so much to be learned from reviewing your recent past. However, you can only mull over the same events so many times before you feel trapped by them. Luckily, assertive Mars assists analytical Mercury, reinforcing your efforts to weave the disparate memories into a coherent story. Once you reconstruct your personal history, focus on what’s ahead and successfully navigate around the obstacles. Poet Theodore Roethke wrote, “Over every mountain there is a path, although it may not be seen from the valley.”"
libra,2017-12-06,"Unresolved interactions with a close friend may resurface today as you try to settle the lingering tension between you. Rather than letting residual bad energy simmer in silence, resolution is possible now if you are courageous enough to initiate a conversation about an uncomfortable subject. Although you usually are more inclined to bring up a pleasant topic, a frank discussion can clear the air and inspire good feelings all the way around. President Ronald Reagan said, “A lot of problems in the world would disappear if we talked to each other instead of talked about each other.”"
scorpio,2017-12-06,"Your game plan may not be obvious to others, but only sharing strategic pieces of information can augment your power today. You are known as a master when it comes to employing the right tactics at the right moment. You’re even more formidable while heroic Mars fortifies Mercury and Saturn in your 2nd House of Self-Esteem. Your confidence is one of your most useful assets as long as your intentions remain honorable. It helps to remember the words given to Spider-Man, “With great power comes great responsibility.”"
sagittarius,2017-12-06,"Although it may appear as if the sky is clearing today, there is still palpable stress floating in the atmosphere. Everything you say seems to carry an extra punch as contentious Mars aspects verbose Mercury in your sign. Since you are a force to be reckoned with now, it’s crucial to be aware of the likely consequences of your actions. You can use your words to hurt or to heal, so choose them wisely. Maya Angelou wrote, “Try to be a rainbow in someone’s cloud.”"
capricorn,2017-12-06,"You might think your hard work will speak volumes today, but it may be your silence that says what’s most important. Naturally, your productivity is appreciated by your teammates, but they are probably aware that you are keeping significant information to yourself. Although you have something to share, you want to be sure that you deliver your message at the most opportune moment. Militant Mars forms a powerful sextile with your key planet Saturn, blessing you with good judgment. Trust your instincts and keep your lips sealed until the time seems right."
aquarius,2017-12-06,"You are on the receiving end of external pressure to make a decision about your holiday plans. Although impulsive Mars has been hanging out in your 9th House of Big Ideas, authoritative Saturn now demands your final answer. Thankfully, there’s little reason to stress over your current choice because the cosmos has your back no matter what you choose to do. Author Lewis Carroll wrote, “In the end, we only regret the chances we didn’t take.”"
pisces,2017-12-06,"You may be in the process of reconsidering your goals now, even if you believed they were written in stone. However, sometimes even the most definite plans need to be altered when your feelings are in flux. Nevertheless, you might become uncharacteristically obstinate when facing new developments today. Thankfully, you can access wisdom from a deeper place if you choose trust over fear. Stephen Hawking wrote, “Intelligence is the ability to adapt to change.”"
aries,2017-12-07,"You may throw away your current strategies today because you realize where they fall short of your initial expectations. In fact, you believe you can accomplish more by spontaneously reacting to each moment without clinging to any old assumptions. Nevertheless, there are gems buried in your previous plans, making it counterproductive to dispose of them entirely. Astrologer Johannes Kepler cautioned, “Don’t throw the baby out with the bathwater.”"
taurus,2017-12-07,"Exploring your feelings opens new paths for self-discovery today, but you must be willing to travel into unfamiliar territory. Thankfully, your resistance fades now, allowing you to delve into mysteries that were recently out of bounds. However, you won’t get very far if you stubbornly insist on going solo since opportunistic Jupiter accentuates your 7th House of Relationships. Listening with an open heart to the ideas of others doesn’t mean you should discard your own. Oprah Winfrey said, “Only surround yourself with people who will lift you higher.”"
gemini,2017-12-07,"You could easily be swept up by the enthusiasm of people working on a large-scale project. In fact, you might need to set your original plans aside in order to fulfill your commitments to the group. Although you are easily distracted by every fascinating idea you learn about, you won’t make progress if you spread yourself too thin. Steve Jobs said, “It’s only by saying no that you can concentrate on the things that are really important.”"
cancer,2017-12-07,"Your undying optimism can inspire others to shift into gear and work toward a common goal today. However, you still must do your part in creating a supportive environment that fosters the group process rather than individual ambitions. Dropping your ego at the door enables you to keep your need for acknowledgment to a minimum, paving the way for true teamwork. Helen Keller said, “Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much.”"
leo,2017-12-07,"Your creativity is on fire today, encouraging you to proudly display your artistic or literary talents. However, you could run into trouble if you try to push your production capabilities too far past their regular limits.

Imagination will take you everywhere.”"
virgo,2017-12-07,"You’re so quiet today that others might not realize how much you are contributing to the group effort. Nevertheless, you continue to work behind the scenes without the urgency to set yourself apart from everyone else. Thankfully, your current confidence fuels your ability to maintain a healthy perspective and be an effective team player. Indian yogi Sadhguru said, “Collaboration is far more powerful than competition. Do not think that only if you are pushed to the wall, you will do your best.”"
libra,2017-12-07,"Talking with your friends can be constructive today as long as you bring the conversations back to practical matters. Although nearly any subject is fair game, you’re likely to explore all the ways you can increase your cash flow while loquacious Mercury agitates exuberant Jupiter in your 2nd House of Income. But net worth and self-worth often travel as a pair. When your self-esteem grows, so does your financial security. Marc Chagall said, “Work isn’t to make money; you work to justify life.”"
scorpio,2017-12-07,"You want to demonstrate your leadership skills today and expect others to be duly impressed with your commitment to excellence. However, you may try so hard to win their favor that you lose sight of what’s actually relevant. You might not know when to stop talking as chatty Mercury in happy-go-lucky Sagittarius conspires with excessive Jupiter in your sign. Bringing your focus back to the essentials is a smart way to regain your competitive edge. Silence commands respect."
sagittarius,2017-12-07,"You are a study in contradiction today and find it challenging to express your emotions in a consistent manner. Oddly, you’re feeling connected to your friends one moment and quite isolated the next. Negative self-judgment, spawned by the lingering Mercury-Saturn conjunction, is counterbalanced by optimistic Jupiter. Author Steve Maraboli wrote, “When I accept myself, I am freed from the burden of needing you to accept me.”"
capricorn,2017-12-07,"Whatever you didn’t say yesterday is today’s fuel for the fire of conversation. Your willpower, along with your self-restraint, enabled you to stay quiet about your emotions, but now you happily push them to the surface for others to see. Luckily, discussions can be quite revealing while the reflective Moon is camping out in your 8th House of Deep Sharing. Actress Sue Krebs wrote, “Speak from your soul and every heart will understand.”"
aquarius,2017-12-07,"Your primary interest today is to stay connected with your friends and associates. Four planets in your 11th House of Social Networking encourage you to team up with others for work and play. However, you’re inclined to test your limits now, which could prompt you to go overboard and make promises you can’t keep. There's no need for you to drop everything on your agenda to join someone's cause just because they put on a good show. Actor Edward Albert wrote, “Sometimes you have to be selfish to be selfless.”"
pisces,2017-12-07,"You don’t like an authority figure telling you what to do today. But you may need to acquiesce and simply perform as expected unless you want to make waves. Sometimes, you must set aside your immediate personal desires to make an investment in your long-term happiness. However, the cosmos is enticing you to envision a future that is tailored more to your preferences. Juggling two realities is a trick that you can master in your mind. Wayne Dyer wrote, “The greatest gift that you were ever given was the gift of your imagination.”"
aries,2017-12-08,"Although you may experience delays as you strive to reach your ambitious goals today, it takes more than a few unwanted detours to dampen your enthusiasm. In fact, a surprising setback only inspires you to try harder as you’re not likely to admit to failure. But blind optimism doesn’t work in your favor. Be mindful of any possible pitfalls now, instead of just admiring the benefits of your plan. Keeping your eyes wide open multiplies your chances for success."
taurus,2017-12-08,"You believe you possess an effective action plan that will land you at your destination ahead of schedule. However, you may be so jazzed with your progress now that you take on more jobs in a flurry of excitement. Avoid all temptations to make additional commitments; your reputation shines if you finish what you already have on your plate before making promises you can’t keep. Benjamin Franklin wrote, “Well done is better than well said.”"
gemini,2017-12-08,"Creating a lot of fanfare about your role in the community is exhilarating, but no one will likely remember your words in the long run. Many people may misunderstand you today, but it’s not your job to set them straight. Ultimately, your character will be assessed by what you do rather than what you say. Minding your own business takes precedence over anything else. Wayne Dyer said, “When you judge another, you do not define them; you define yourself as someone who needs to judge.”"
cancer,2017-12-08,"You may start off today like there’s no tomorrow. But you might work at such a fevered pace that you lose sight of your ambitious goal. You certainly don’t want to be exhausted before you fulfill your obligations. Unfortunately, if you slow down to conserve your energy, you could lose momentum. Although you’re attracted to extreme solutions now, the moderate ones are the most enduring. A Yiddish proverb warns: “Measure twice, cut once.”"
leo,2017-12-08,"You can accomplish your mission with time to spare, as long as you don’t let any distractions creep into your world. Nevertheless, you may inadvertently instigate a major drama by talking about your feelings. But just as everything begins to settle down, another surprise might show up. Treat everyone else with the same courtesy you wish for yourself. The Dalai Lama said, “The more you are motivated by love, the more fearless and free your action will be.”"
virgo,2017-12-08,"You are yearning for change so intensely that you might dream of all the structures around you tumbling down like a house of cards. But, in reality, you would never let that happen because you’re attracted to the stability of the status quo. Dancing on the fine line between chaos and boredom requires a specific set of skills for which you are uniquely equipped. Take a risk and act spontaneously while you feel it in your bones because cutting loose becomes more difficult this evening. Knock on opportunity’s door instead of waiting for it to show up at yours."
libra,2017-12-08,"You derive great pleasure from being in the company of people who appear to have broken free from their regular responsibilities. You are eager to join their ranks, even if you haven’t yet achieved escape velocity. Nevertheless, you’re afraid to sink back into the comforts of your familiar patterns. You might believe that taking a quantum leap is your most intelligent strategy, but you quickly realize that it’s not. Impulsive actions will likely lead to trouble today, so put away the parachute and put on your life vest instead."
scorpio,2017-12-08,"Your plans may sound fantastic but only until you try to put them into motion. Fortunately, whatever obstacles you encounter today are like grist for your mill. Eagerly engaging with your current challenge is the first step to clearing the path to new opportunities. Remember, there are no mistakes now, only more chances to learn from experience. Information you gather -- even if it comes at a cost – can be helpful. B.B. King said, “The beautiful thing about learning is that no one can take it away from you.”"
sagittarius,2017-12-08,"You are a powerhouse of intention today but some of your drives might not be as useful as others. However, it’s nearly impossible to tell which goals are worth your extra effort. First things first: reestablish a set of priorities based upon your values. Once you have your list in order, start at the top and don’t stop until you can clearly see your progress. Be fearless in the pursuit of what sets your soul on fire."
capricorn,2017-12-08,"You are not easily pulled off course, but reality makes a convincing case for you to create a new itinerary today. Nevertheless, you can put up a good fight, claiming that you don’t trust an unfamiliar route, even if it appears to be a shortcut. Often, your success is determined by your ability to calculate the most effective method to achieve your goal. Francois de La Rochefoucauld wrote, “It’s not sufficient to have great qualities; we must be able to make proper use of them.”"
aquarius,2017-12-08,"You are so enamored with thoughts of the future that you find it difficult to fully show up in the here and now. Your fascination with all the possibilities could grow into such a obsession that you spend all your waking time plotting and scheming about ways to make your dreams come true. Nevertheless, focusing your attention accomplishes more when you are concentrating on current events. Eckhart Tolle wrote, “Challenges are something that can only be tackled in the present moment.”"
pisces,2017-12-08,"High hopes for a promotion could entice you to put in extra hours at work now. Everything may be looking so perfect that you believe you can’t miss this opportunity of a lifetime. However, the cause-and-effect relationship between your effort and the results is not as straightforward today as they should be, and you might be discouraged if you don’t receive the recognition you expect. Lao Tzu wrote, ""Nature does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished."""
aries,2017-12-09,"You’re an irresistible force now, whether selling yourself, a product or a plan. But your emotions may develop a life of their own today, as they bubble to the surface and then pop too loudly to ignore. The presence of macho Mars in your 8th House of Deep Sharing drives you forward with a powerful momentum, propelling you past any fears or doubts that might inhibit your action. However, your high energy and strength could overwhelm some people, so turn down the heat a notch if you want to avoid scaring them away. Author Oliver Herford quipped, “There is no time like the pleasant.”"
taurus,2017-12-09,"You are quietly hoping to deepen all your personal  interactions now. Although you don’t like being forced out of your comfort zone, giving up a little safety to gain a large dose of emotional satisfaction is a worthwhile exchange. Nevertheless, trying to meet people’s expectations might feel like an exercise in futility. Reinforce your commitment to pursue who and what you want with passionate intensity. Assertive Mars is moving through your 7th House of Partnerships, making it healthier to be more proactive with others now than to passively wait for your unspoken needs to be magically met."
gemini,2017-12-09,"You can make a lasting statement when you have a purpose, a plan and the passion to embark on your journey. However, trivial matters interfere with your daily routine by luring you off course. Little things matter once impatient Mars enters your 6th House of Details, testing your ability to manage your affairs. Surprisingly, using your intention to narrow your focus and block out distractions allows you to become a master of efficiency. Small moves produce significant results."

Mars moves into your 5th House of Romance today, nudging you to listen to your heart and share your needs with someone special. You may be quite comfortable diving into the murky emotional waters, enjoying the chance to wallow in the intensity for a while. There is a powerful energy in the air now, yet you can't help but gleefully anticipate the holiday madness. Sir George Savile said, “A man who is a master of patience is master of everything else.”"
leo,2017-12-09,"You are more apt to find happiness while you’re at home today, rather than when you are out running errands. There is a noticeable shift toward deepening your connection with the past as Mars settles into your 4th House of Roots, stimulating memories of childhood, home and family. Reminiscing about hard times or the good old days helps you reprocess your personal history and move into the future with a fresh perspective. Additionally, sharing your nostalgic recollections with a loved one can sweeten intimacy if you’re willing to be real. Thomas Jefferson wrote, “Honesty is the first chapter in the book of wisdom.”"
virgo,2017-12-09,"You are quickly irritated if anyone messes with your schedule today. In fact, you might just surprise others with your immediate reaction while fiery Mars is stirring up conflict in your 3rd House of Immediate Environment. However, engaging in combat won’t lead to anyone’s satisfaction. Thankfully, your penchant for critical analysis offers you an alternative course of action based on a more rational approach. Ketan R. Shah wrote, “Anger kills logical thinking and logical thinking kills anger; the choice is yours.”"
libra,2017-12-09,"You might experience a little emotional letdown today, as if you just missed your chance for something special. Nevertheless, your feelings begin to intensify when red-hot Mars leaves your even-keeled sign for the deeper waters of mysterious Scorpio. You may need to defend your beliefs while the warrior planet establishes his authority in your 2nd House of Core Values. Rely on your innate ability to examine both sides of an issue. Even in times of conflict, rest assured that your natural mediating skills will assist in creating the peace you seek."
scorpio,2017-12-09,"You may be eager to tackle a new project, fan the flames on a romance, or engage in a competitive sport now. Fortunately, enterprising Mars is moving through your sign, blessing you with the motivation and persistence to finish whatever exciting endeavor you start. Reconsider your intentions so you don’t waste this incredible energy on unnecessary battles. Remember, you can transform every doubt and disappointment into a powerful resource that fuels your actions."
sagittarius,2017-12-09,"You are quite discriminating when deciding who you want to include in your activities today. But your current wish for solitude may linger longer than you think since you’re more likely to work on your own while Mars camps out in your 12th House of Privacy. Although you dream of more time alone, you still crave the camaraderie of friends and family. There’s no simple resolution to this paradox. Nevertheless, keeping your options open helps you navigate your fluctuating moods. Increased awareness enables you to make better choices if you remember that balance is best."
capricorn,2017-12-09,"You’re not sure if you woke up on the wrong side of the bed today, or if everyone else did. Unfortunately, there’s likely to be a battle of wills while contentious Mars visits your 11th House of Social Connections. Hopefully, you are quick to defuse the tension by jumping in and discussing your difference of opinions. Making allies is a much better use of your energy than making enemies. Investing in peace now will save you time and effort down the road. Lead with love and you can't go wrong."
aquarius,2017-12-09,"Although you are fiercely determined to finish a job once you commit to it, there’s more ambiguity while you’re still in the planning stages. You possess a picture of your destination in your imagination, but you’re unable to paint in the details today, even though you continue to try. Fortunately, bold Mars is empowering your 10th House of Status, demanding that you make a mark in the outer world. You’re up for the challenge; the sooner you start, the easier it will be to manifest your goals. Og Mandino wrote, “Act now. For now is all you have.”"
pisces,2017-12-09,"You are like a snake, shedding its old skin. However, this transformation isn’t all fun and games as you begin to outgrow the container that holds you in. But thankfully, you are more comfortable now that energetic Mars is immersed in a fellow water sign, intensifying your emotions. Stand up and fight for a principle or embark on an adventure while action-hero Mars rocks your 9th House of Truth and Travel. Dr. Benjamin Spock wrote, “Trust yourself, you know more than you think you do.”"
aries,2017-12-10,"You are convinced that you can manifest anything you can imagine today. Unfortunately, this assumption is incorrect and will certainly lead you into trouble now. Although there is often a causal relationship between your dreams and your future, it is not a guaranteed process. Nevertheless, some outrageous fantasies have resulted in profound scientific breakthroughs, practical inventions and great works of art. You will never know what is possible unless you’re willing to try what is impossible."
taurus,2017-12-10,"Your imagination is working overtime today, enabling you to look at a caterpillar and see the butterfly waiting to manifest. Your power of visualization is strong now and your ability to follow through with determination is legendary. Don’t let someone else’s negativity stand in the way of your success. But rather than arguing with others about the viability of your ideas, roll up your sleeves and show them what you can do. Don’t just look at the stars, be one."
gemini,2017-12-10,"People send confusing messages today and you’re wondering how to interpret what they are saying. Your friends and family keep encouraging you to take a leap of faith. However, you also feel their unspoken concern, as if they don’t believe you have the capability to execute your plan. Rather than taking anyone’s criticism personally, examine what you might do to make your efforts even more effective. If necessary, cut back on the scope of your vision now and focus on where you can make measurable progress. Anne Frank wrote, “First we make our choices. Then our choices make us.”"
cancer,2017-12-10,"You might believe your life is spinning out of control today with your thoughts and emotions leading you on a wild goose chase. Nearly every fantasy seems worth pursuing at first, but then reality sets in, revealing why you can’t reach your goal. But there’s no room for entertaining feelings of self-doubt; you can’t afford to quit now. Fortunately, your logic is sound enough to bring you back down to earth, prompting you to reconsider recent choices and modify your strategy as needed. John C. Maxwell wrote, “Dreams don’t work unless you do.”"
leo,2017-12-10,"You are motivated by your desire to be a creative genius today. Luckily, your brain is up for the challenge as neurons fire to create strings of innovative thoughts that are then woven into complex tapestries. But sharing your brilliance can be frustrating if others won’t take the time to listen. Nevertheless, it’s more satisfying in the long run to overcome resistance based on your fear of rejection than it is to give up before you start trying. Gandhi said, “I want freedom for the full expression of my personality.”"
virgo,2017-12-10,"You’re eager to explore the depths of your imagination today. Ironically, you’re quite intrigued with how your subconscious mind has a direct impact on the body.

The greatest medicine of all is to teach people how not to need it."
libra,2017-12-10,"Someone’s unexpected behavior can catch you off guard today. It’s as if you picked a wild card, but don’t have any clue how to handle the element of surprise. Keep in mind that it’s easier to dance with the uncertainty than to control it. But you might not want anyone to know how entrenched you are in your own fantasies now because you think you will lose their respect. Inventor Edwin Land said, “An essential aspect of creativity is not being afraid to fail.”"
scorpio,2017-12-10,"You may be struggling with your need for independence today, especially if you want to avoid hurting a friend. Although you’re willing to bend, you’re afraid that you might give up too much for the sake of compromise. But a meaningful relationship could encounter problems later on if you attempt to sidestep your truth now. True intimacy requires honest communication. Austin O’Malley wrote, “Those who think it is permissible to tell a white lie soon grow colorblind.”"
sagittarius,2017-12-10,"You are stuck between your good intentions and inescapable circumstances. You can see a solution to a situation that continues to hold you back, but your awareness doesn’t necessarily change anything. You must take action now, even if you are unsure of how others will react. But your willingness to slip into unrealistic fantasies can bring down the entire castle built on unstable sand. Rein in your dreams today; you can always explore them again tomorrow. Practical steps guarantee practical results."
capricorn,2017-12-10,"You may be hiding behind a protective wall today because you believe your dreams are not ready for an audience. Although you have a few sweet tricks up your sleeve, you don't feel experienced enough to share them yet. However, you could be worrying needlessly now, especially if your frustration stems from your fear of failure. Instead of focusing on what might go wrong, concentrate your intentions on what will go right. Positivity begets positivity."
aquarius,2017-12-10,"Your dreams seem closer than ever, yet something is keeping them just out of reach. You’re ready to celebrate each time you break through an obstacle on your path. However, as soon as your way appears clear, another problem arises. You quickly grow weary of the cycle and seek resolution once and for all. Unfortunately, you’ll only set yourself up for failure if you think everything will resolve overnight. Remove the pressure by cutting yourself some slack. Practice finding pleasure in the present moment while the metamorphosis continues at its own snail's pace."
pisces,2017-12-10,"Sometimes you wish others didn’t look up to you as an authority figure. You may feel like a fraud today, especially if you secretly think that everyone knows more than you. Nevertheless, you must accept the role you’re currently playing if you want to move beyond it. Your imagination holds the key to your happiness. Looking back gives you regrets; looking ahead gives you opportunities. Envisioning the future is just as easy as replaying the past."
aries,2017-12-11,"You want to give everyone the benefit of the doubt now by assuming they have your best interests at heart. But even if others are on your side, something unexpected may happen that could prompt you to reconsider your earlier conclusion. It might even seem as if someone you trust is working against you. Luckily, there’s an excellent chance that the tension will dissipate once you put your worries out into the open. Paradoxically, talking about your fears prevents negativity from seeping into your life."
taurus,2017-12-11,"You may have a wait-and-see attitude about work today, since you never know what new assignments will demand your attention. Naturally, you want to please your boss, but sometimes you must also protect your own boundaries. Although you’re eager to do your job well, maintain a healthy balance between the personal and professional aspects of your world. Natalie France wrote, “Focus your energy on the life you want to manifest for yourself.” You’re the only one who knows what makes your heart happy."
gemini,2017-12-11,"Communication with your coworkers seems a bit out of whack today. Although you might initially approach others in a diplomatic manner, it’s all too easy to get carried away with enthusiasm when they are supportive of your current ideas. Pay attention to the conversation if it escalates out of control because your real strength is your compassion now. The good news is there are practical gems waiting to be discovered in between the successive waves of intense emotions."
cancer,2017-12-11,"You’re trying to keep your unexpressed feelings from impacting a current relationship. However, in your attempt to stay calm, you may come across less emotionally available than you actually are. Nevertheless, making a commitment to be honest sets the underlying tone for the day. Don’t miss this opportunity to be as real as you possibly can. It’s unnecessary to fabricate a story, since you won’t be criticized if you simply tell the truth right from the start. Transparency is your not-so-secret weapon."
leo,2017-12-11,"Presenting an overly cheery attitude might sound like a smart thing to do, but any misrepresentation of your feelings will likely lead to conflict down the road. You might think it’s better to advertise your strengths at the risk of bending reality only to discover you’ve stepped into unknown emotional territory. There’s no reason to be overly concerned about any unpleasant interactions since they will only last for a few minutes. Werner Erhard said, “The essence of communication is intention.”"
virgo,2017-12-11,"Fortunately, your ego is strong enough to survive a bit of criticism today, but you grow tired just thinking about the power of creativity and what you must do to protect it. Nevertheless, you’re also reminded of how social protocols are so important when you’re trying to fit in with the crowd. However, your attitude is a bit cocky now and can stand in the path of your progress. Mountaineer Hermann Buhl wrote, “Mountains have a way of dealing with overconfidence.”"
libra,2017-12-11,"Oddly enough, you can combine an unbridled optimism about the future with an outright pessimism for the present. However, your ability to simultaneously see the potentials and the pitfalls places you in a unique position. You want to try something different today, but all improvements in the real world are preceded by changes of your own beliefs. John Lennon sang, “Imagine all the people living life in peace.”"
scorpio,2017-12-11,"Your fair-mindedness is not apparent to others today because it may be overridden by more obvious planetary archetypes. You might act out the various roles you have played in the past, whether or not they fit into the current melodrama. Unfortunately, this could prompt you to overreact and create a scene while you temporarily bury your pain. Don’t fall for the old story of denial. Philanthropist Bernard Baruch said, “The ability to express an idea is well-nigh as important as the idea itself.”"
sagittarius,2017-12-11,"You’re full of energy today, but might be running short on confidence. You know you can finish what you start, but doubt your skill at managing all the variables and putting the disparate pieces together in a manner that works. Nevertheless, you have no choice but to roll up your sleeves and jump in. Ironically, your affirmative action is sufficient to invite assistance from other dimensions. But don’t play hard to get; when the supportive spirits and angels come knocking at your door, let them in."
capricorn,2017-12-11,"You need to be needed today and the most efficient path to happiness is to take care of someone else. Whether it’s your friend, coworker or a relative, you are eager to express your nurturing side. Nevertheless, you may encounter your own resistance to revealing your compassion. Thankfully, you can remedy this situation by talking about your worries and fears rather than your achievements and success stories. Although the thought of sharing what’s lurking in your shadows is scary, showing up for someone else will be easier once your secrets are out in the open."
aquarius,2017-12-11,"You may have an opportunity to further your education at home or by traveling to distant lands. You recognize both the pros and cons to changing your current trajectory to learn new skills or just expand your knowledge base. But it’s nearly impossible to resolve your ambivalence immediately, so you must exert self-restraint and practice patience for a while. Benjamin Franklin wrote, “Energy and persistence conquer all things.”"
pisces,2017-12-11,"You have a busy workweek on the horizon and you’re poised to make the most of it. Unfortunately, you don’t yet know how you will stand up to all the demands being made of your time. Ultimately, your confidence -- even in the face of possible failure -- could make a big difference in the outcome. Thankfully, you are drawing from deep energetic reserves that enable you to save the day like a superhero. The ripples from one small positive thought can change the world."
aries,2017-12-12,"You’re well aware it’s time to make arrangements for an upcoming trip. In fact, you wish everything was already in place. Nevertheless, there are still loose ends that must be tied up before you can finalize your itinerary. Involving others in your planning now may help you to work out the logistics that were previously elusive. However, your current solution might not be the one you imagined. The best surprises happen when you least expect them."
taurus,2017-12-12,"Although you’re intent on making sense of a lingering mystery, circumstances may require you to wait now. You’re unwilling to give up your quest, but you are quite content to practice patience until you receive a green light from the cosmos. Other people might be ready to throw in the towel, but your unflappable determination is just digging in for the long haul. Satisfaction will be yours if you hang in there until you uncover the answers you seek."
gemini,2017-12-12,"Your life is a dance of extremes today. On one hand, your enthusiasm can get the best of you, encouraging you to run away with an outrageous idea. On the other hand, a cautionary instinct prevents you from taking a risk, even if the calculations are in your favor. Thankfully, you have an excellent sense of balance now, enabling you to gracefully sidestep any trouble. However, the wheel of fate is still in spin; even if your path seems unencumbered, there are numerous twists and turns ahead. Poet Andrés Neuman wrote, “History shows that people are as changeable as rivers.”"
cancer,2017-12-12,"You have big ideas about how to improve your working conditions so you can feel more comfortable on the job. Unfortunately, the practical constraints of reality don't necessarily support your hopes today. Although you’re often willing to quietly wait for the right moment to initiate action, you may fervently believe that the best time to act is now. Nevertheless, another round of reconsideration might be exactly what the doctor ordered. A fresh perspective widens your options."
leo,2017-12-12,"New avenues of communication seem to open and close today, making it tricky to choose an uncharted route and stick with it. Just as you formulate your message and start to deliver it, you see a road-closed sign that requires you to pick a different path to your destination. Although giving up is not a solution, you might tire of all the detours. Nevertheless, blazing a new trail may be unnecessary when such well-traveled ones are already available."
virgo,2017-12-12,"The nostalgic idea of revisiting your past sounds lovely until you actually begin your journey, only to remember things you wish you forgot. What seems like a casual stroll down Sentimental Street quickly turns into a labyrinth of unsettling images. Thankfully, your logical approach enables you to sort through the incoming torrent of recollections, so you can reconstruct your past from your current perspective. Dr. Wayne Dyer wrote, “If you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change.”"
libra,2017-12-12,"You might think that talking about a problem will solve it once and for all, but reality won’t likely support your wish today. Nevertheless, you are hopeful when you delve into the heart of the matter with innocent intentions. Unfortunately, your current concerns are not new ones and another  discussion will only seem like a déjà vu. The definition of insanity is repeating the same mistakes again and again while expecting a different outcome. Words sound hollow when action is what’s really required."
scorpio,2017-12-12,"You may be obsessed with making money today and can’t stop running schemes through your head. Ironically, you’ve been here before, thinking some of these very same thoughts. However, you are more informed now than you were in the past. Although your current plans are close to being realized, you still have some work to do in order to manifest your dreams. Roy T. Bennett wrote, “Those who win never give up. Those who give up never win.”"
sagittarius,2017-12-12,"Your thoughts are bold and unrestrained today, empowering you to conjure up a storm of ideas that inspire others to take action. Your vision is unobstructed and you can see far into the future. However, walls may appear once your thoughts are put into motion. Don’t let external resistance distract you; it is merely a reflection of your fears. Thoreau wrote, “What lies behind us and what lies ahead of us are tiny matters compared to what lives within us.”"
capricorn,2017-12-12,"Being misunderstood is no fun, especially when you’re so close to a major turning point in your life. It’s as if you’ve been working on an important project that should already be finished, yet it always seems like completion is a week away. It’s frustrating now that in the twelfth hour you feel so unsupported because people don’t even know what you’re trying to accomplish. Fortunately, this is an opportunity to explain your intentions in a way that makes sense to others. George Bernard Shaw wrote, “The single biggest problem in communication is the illusion that it has taken place.”"
aquarius,2017-12-12,"You’re driven to share your vision of the future with your friends today. However, you know that your perspective isn’t the only one. Instead, you want everyone in your social network to be buzzing about the plethora of possibilities ahead. You don’t mind if people are harboring different dreams as long as they are actively pursuing goals that benefit all. Dr. Albert Schweitzer said, “To work for the common good is the greatest creed.”"
pisces,2017-12-12,"You are a mouthpiece for your fellow workers today because others seem to listen intently when you talk. However, you could take your soapbox diatribe too far and end up sabotaging your cause by alienating those who could be your best allies. Instead of waiting for someone else to issue you a reality check, curb your enthusiasm preemptively in order to remain in good standing with your colleagues. Bruce Lee said, “A quick temper will make a fool of you soon enough.”"
aries,2017-12-13,"Your agenda may clash with someone else’s today, yet you do not feel like compromise is in your vocabulary. Instead of searching for ways to establish common ground, you are fixating on the differences as the Moon-Mars alignment prompts you to take control. Although your intentions are clear, open conflict won’t necessarily bring the results you seek now. Resist your natural urge to resolve a disagreement with a show of power. Knowing when to walk away reveals your true intelligence."
taurus,2017-12-13,"You wish that everyone would just speak the truth  without beating around the bush, but complex interpersonal politics make real communication unlikely now. You’re particularly sensitive to the feelings of those around you today. In fact, you can derive just as much meaning from what they don’t say as from what they tell you. But you’re not interested in extracting the hidden message one question at a time. Ironically, taking a few steps back gives the other person enough room to come out of their shell without feeling threatened. Confucius wrote, “When anger rises, think of the consequences.”"
gemini,2017-12-13,"You are so focused on finishing whatever you start today that you are likely to miss something important when it enters your field of awareness. Although you’re often distracted by shiny objects and sparkly ideas, your power of concentration is so intense now that it will take a significant event to pull you off course. Fuel your ambition by reevaluating your priorities and goals to avoid ending up at the wrong destination. Historian John Maynard Keynes wrote, “When the facts change, I change my mind.”"
cancer,2017-12-13,"Although you already have a busy work schedule today, you can’t ignore your muse when she stops by for a visit. You might not like the timing of your creative urges, but something tells you that you must respond immediately when the waves of inspiration wash over you. Nevertheless, you can’t walk away from your regular responsibilities since they won’t take care of themselves on their own. Cicero wrote, “Whether it’s public or private life, nothing is devoid of moral obligations.”"
leo,2017-12-13,"There are many conflicting emotions rattling around in your head today and the more you focus on them, the more irritated you become. You might feel as if you’re nearing your boiling point, yet you don’t want to lose your temper. Unfortunately, turning the energy inward in an attempt to avoid creating a scene only amplifies your frustration. It’s been said that holding onto your anger is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die. Express your concerns without asking for anything in return. Allow others the time to respond authentically."
virgo,2017-12-13,"You don’t want to miss a chance to clearly state your position on a personal matter. However, you can’t seem to find the right words to make your point. It’s almost as if the cosmos is conspiring against you now. But you’re unwilling to give up so quickly while the passionate Scorpio Moon teams up with warrior Mars in your 3rd House of Communication. In fact, woe to anyone who dares to impede your progress today. Dr. Albert Schweitzer wrote, “One who gains strength by overcoming obstacles possesses the only strength which can overcome adversity.”"
libra,2017-12-13,"You are part of a group that must make a practical decision today. Although people may stereotype you as an indecisive Libra, it’s essential to share your opinion now. You know exactly what you want to say and you hope everyone hears your message. Unfortunately, you might be so confident with your conclusions that you trample over someone else’s considerations. Softening your approach allows your words to come through loudly and clearly. Simply put, you can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar."
scorpio,2017-12-13,"When you speak today, everyone else listens because of the authority your voice carries. The potent Scorpio Moon joins forceful Mars in your 1st House of Self, encouraging you take an issue under your wing and let the world know the truth. But rather than playing to their emotions, it’s crucial to stick with the facts now. Quietly engaging a few people in a meaningful dialogue has greater influence than shouting your message from the mountain top. E.E. Cummings wrote, “I'd rather learn from one bird how to sing than teach ten thousand stars how not to dance.”"
sagittarius,2017-12-13,"Attempts to put your best foot forward are admirable, but your actions might not create the impact you seek. Naturally, you want others to see you shine, but it may be more useful for them to encounter the true you rather than the polished version of you. Suppressing your emotions for the sake of expediency is not a sensible strategy in the long-run. Expressing your anger or fear can improve the possibility for real intimacy, but you must be willing to be honest for the process to work."
capricorn,2017-12-13,"Participating in a group project isn’t always easy. You have a very specific strategy in mind to reach your idealistic goals. Your dilemma stems from the fact that setting your standards so high can alienate friends and associates whose dreams are not as ambitious. This level of excellence is difficult to maintain if they don’t share your work ethic. Nevertheless, you might choose to fly solo since you don’t want to water your plans down just to include others. T Walt Disney said, “If you can dream it, you can do it.”"
aquarius,2017-12-13,"You can see things that aren’t really there, yet these invisible apparitions influence your actions. You may be so close to the success you are striving for now that you believe it’s possible to reach out and grab it. However, each time you try, you come back empty-handed. Nevertheless, you’re motivated by the thought of professional recognition and won’t stop until you achieve your goal. B.J. Gupta wrote, “Hard work doesn’t guarantee success, but improves its chances.”"
pisces,2017-12-13,"You have put a lot of research into your personal ideology and won’t easily change your position today, even in the light of new data. Although your assumptions are well-informed, there are many ways to interpret the same set of facts. Be wise and consider all the possible factors before writing off the opinions of everyone else. Aristotle wrote, ""It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it."""
aries,2017-12-14,"You’re no stranger to speaking before thinking about the ramifications of your words. Unfortunately, your impulsivity can take you down a road to nowhere while witty Mercury annoys cranky Mars. Instead of defensively striking back at someone who may have inadvertently hurt your feelings today, try a more compassionate response. Although opening your heart to hear another person’s pain isn’t easy, it could help dissipate the negativity and clear the way for mutual understanding."
taurus,2017-12-14,"People seem to be pushing your emotional buttons today by inviting you to become more involved with their issues. However, you’re quite clear about the limitations your current commitments place on your interactions with others. You wish you could devote more time to another person’s predicament, but you have your own complications to contend with now. Your honesty might not make you any friends, but establishing boundaries is healthier for everyone in the long run. Columnist Irma Kurtz wrote, “Givers need to set limits because takers rarely do.”"
gemini,2017-12-14,"It doesn’t matter how busy you are today, you might be operating under the illusion that you can do even more. The reflective Moon conspires with exaggerating Jupiter in your 6th House of Work, bolstering your confidence beyond reason. Don’t wait until you’re in over your head. There’s nothing to gain by increasing the expectations of your associates, only to let them down later. Promise less, deliver more."
cancer,2017-12-14,"You are on a creative jag today, but still need to balance your artistic pursuits with your mundane responsibilities. One way to maximize your current enthusiasm is to make a schedule and stick to it. Some people may think that inspiration can’t fit into a time slot, but a certain amount of structure works well for you now. You will be happy to discover that your self-expression doesn’t need to negatively impact your job performance. In fact, a little distraction at the right time improves your overall productivity."
leo,2017-12-14,"Although the intensity of your feelings lingers in the air, your attitude is likely much improved now. What seemed like impassable roadblocks yesterday are merely challenges for your ingenuity today. Thankfully, you are standing on solid ground, confident you can handle even the trickiest of situations while the Moon cozies up to buoyant Jupiter in your 4th House of Foundations. There’s no need to overreact if you encounter resistance later in the day. Taking the speed bumps in stride allows you to reach your destination in time."
virgo,2017-12-14,"You are not a happy camper today, especially if someone takes you to task over a familiar issue that you thought had already been resolved. You’re tired of running around the same verbal track again and again, as if others expect you to change your story. Your patience is evaporating; you could step over the line by unleashing a barrage of anger to put an end to this nonsense once and for all. Giving voice to your feelings is admirable if you are mindful enough to do it with compassion."
libra,2017-12-14,"Your unflappable self-assuredness is a surprise to others today, but they quickly adjust to your display of confidence. Nevertheless, it’s crucial to acknowledge the entire spectrum of your emotions, not just the positive ones. You can still be certain about your choices, even if there are potential problems that might pop up along the way. You will be more believable if you tell a realistic story rather than one tinted by rose-colored glasses. The truth may hurt for a little while, but a lie hurts forever."
scorpio,2017-12-14,"People might see a more optimistic side of you today, but the same issues still lurk behind your pleasant demeanor. Nevertheless, your positive outlook is sincere and your I-can-do-it attitude reflects your willingness to deal with circumstances in their true light now. You don’t need to filter out the tougher aspects of life if you view them as opportunities to exercise your resiliency and strength of character. Ironically, setting realistic targets enables you to reach an unrealistic dream."
sagittarius,2017-12-14,"You can accomplish wonders now if you keep your doubts under wraps. Hopefully, you already shared your innermost feelings with a close friend and aren’t planning on repeating your fears today. In fact, dwelling on any form of negativity could distract you and others from the project at hand. Your internal dilemma stems from your need to be honest while simultaneously being positive about the current process. Focusing on your goals inspires you to put a minor setback into a larger perspective. Work first, talk later."
capricorn,2017-12-14,"Relationship dynamics seem to be flowing smoother, as if you have driven through a construction zone and now are resuming cruising speed. But don’t set your expectations so high that you crash at the first sign of trouble. Instead, maintain your standards while allowing for the additional time it might take to reach your destination. Regardless of your inner resolve today, you still must make adjustments when road conditions change. Adaptability is your saving grace."
aquarius,2017-12-14,"The fog lifts, the clouds dissipate and the blue sky reveals the distant horizon. You are relieved that you can finally see where you are going again, prompting your hopes and dreams to creep out of hiding.  You may discover your goals are further away now than you originally assumed, but you’re still enthusiastic about reaching them. Nothing is gained by entertaining self-doubt. Playwright Anton Chekhov wrote, “Man is what he believes.”"
pisces,2017-12-14,"Your dreams often seem as real as the three-dimensional world around you. But the evocative Moon’s alignments with ethereal Neptune and excessive Jupiter place a magnifying lens on your fantasies today, making them appear more believable than your five senses. It’s as if you are on Star Trek’s Holodeck and whatever your imagination conjures up is true. Luckily, you can choose where your thoughts go. Exercise your options with care."
aries,2017-12-15,"You mean well when you promise someone blue sky today, only to discover that dark clouds are blocking the light of the Sun. Unfortunately, you’re unable to control the weather, but you can modify your response to the situation. No one will fault you for your human limitations, but their criticism is justifiable if you continue to offer assurances you cannot guarantee. Journalist Malcolm Gladwell wrote, “Incompetence annoys me. Overconfidence terrifies me.”"
taurus,2017-12-15,"Professing your appreciation for a friend’s brilliant ideas may be all the encouragement they need to continue on their path. However, voicing your positive feedback entangles you in their work in ways that are not immediately obvious now. The good news is that you get to share in their success. However, your enthusiasm might not play out so well if they fall short of their goal. It’s not that you are to blame for anyone else’s failure, yet you could end up feeling guilty for your role in the process, nonetheless. Sometimes, the effort counts more than the outcome."
gemini,2017-12-15,"Clear communication is a necessary component of any relationship, but that doesn’t mean sweetening the truth for the sake of expediency is a good idea. Although a Mercury-Venus conspiracy in your 7th House of Partners might convince others that all is well, there are more intense issues stewing below the surface. Instead of waiting until the hidden feelings bubble into the open, express them before they can do any harm. Napoleon Hill wrote, “Don’t wait. The time will never be just right.”"
cancer,2017-12-15,"You know where your current routines fall short of your highest ideals and you truly want to improve your lifestyle. You might share your ideas about cleaning up your diet, but verbalizing your intentions is not the same as putting a plan into action. Unfortunately, you could talk yourself out of initiating a healthier regimen because of a past failure. However, experience is the best teacher. Just start small and watch the benefits grow over time."
leo,2017-12-15,"It’s easy for you to make a mediocre idea sound fantastic today. A Mercury-Venus conjunction rattles your 5th House of Fun and Games, enabling you to infuse a serious situation with a playful passion. You see possibilities where others only perceive problems. Just be sure that you’re not in denial of the obvious. Review your research now; if the positive potential is still present, then go for it with gusto. However, a half-hearted attempt is a waste of everyone’s energy. Yoda said, “Do. Or do not. There is no try.”"
virgo,2017-12-15,"You may be unsure of your long-term goals today because you’re so busy focusing on your immediate surroundings. You’re happiest when reassessing what is nearest and dearest to your heart because the familiarity is comforting. However, there are only so many times you can go over the same material, especially when you actually need to expand your vision further into the future. Practice extending your senses by looking at clouds or the tops of buildings and trees. H. Jackson Brown Jr. wrote, “Think big thoughts but relish small pleasures.”"
libra,2017-12-15,"There’s nothing more enjoyable than relaxing in the company of friends and family now. However, your notion of pleasure thrives on the give and take of communication. Unfortunately, you might not have enough free time to fully explore a subject of interest. But conversations don’t need to delve into the mysteries of the universe today; they only need to create a structure for an ongoing dialogue. Louisa May Alcott wrote, “The power of finding beauty in the humblest things makes home happy and life lovely.”"
scorpio,2017-12-15,"You might experience a minor crisis of confidence today, but nothing serious enough to stop you in your tracks. Retrograde Mercury bumps into value-conscious Venus in your 2nd House of Self-Esteem, prompting you to question the importance of your creative contribution to a project now. However, your work will stand on its own merit if you continue to put forth your best effort. Goethe wrote, “Doubt can only be removed by action.”"
sagittarius,2017-12-15,"Your charm enables you to turn a difficult situation around in record time. However, you must believe your sales pitch before you try to convince anyone else. It may be nearly impossible to discern the facts now, especially if you can’t remove your self-interests from the equation. Nevertheless, there’s always room for objective analysis to help illuminate the truth. Psychologist Albert Ellis wrote, “Rational beliefs bring us closer to getting good results in the real world.”"
capricorn,2017-12-15,"Normally, you place your trust in the established structures of the three-dimensional world. In fact, you often gain notoriety for your mastery of the system. However, the floodgates are wide open now, allowing a steady influx of otherworldly images to flow into your awareness. Choosing to tune into the stream of consciousness improves your chances of healing an old emotional wound while blocking out the data that could lead to defeat. G.K. Chesterton wrote, “There are no rules of architecture for a castle in the clouds.”"
aquarius,2017-12-15,"Your friends appear to be quite supportive of your grandiose plans today, but you’re not ready to take their encouragement at face value. In fact, you may think they are reflecting only the most positive aspects of your current work, and you’re not interested in feedback that fails to consider the entire picture. However, they might actually offer constructive criticism if you bother to listen. Sun Tzu wrote, “If you do not seek out allies and helpers, then you will be isolated and weak.”"
pisces,2017-12-15,"You have a one-track mind today and can’t stop thinking about climbing the ladder of success. Although there is a cosmic pile-up of planets in your 10th House of Career, your emotional wellbeing is more complicated than the satisfaction of receiving a promotion. Don’t let your worth be determined solely by your current position in the hierarchy of achievement. Albert Einstein wrote, “Try not to become a man of success, but rather try to become a man of value.”"
aries,2017-12-16,"You may lack good judgment today as your common sense goes flying out the window. Ironically, this isn’t as bad as it sounds because acting on an impulsive decision might be just the thing you need. If you have been patiently waiting for a better time to take a calculated risk, the Sun’s happy trine to radical Uranus in your sign could be your ticket to success. Philosopher Simone de Beauvoir wrote, “Change your life today. Don’t gamble on the future; act now, without delay.”"
taurus,2017-12-16,"You typically like to know the consequences of your behavior before you make your move. However, sometimes it’s impossible to predict what the future will bring, no matter what you do. Although you can’t see around the next bend, you intuitively understand that time is running out, motivating you to initiate action before the window of opportunity closes. You have thought your plan through so many times that there’s no point in procrastinating any longer. Start the ball rolling now, even if progress is negligible. Momentum, not perfection, is the key to success."
gemini,2017-12-16,"A fateful conversation with a friend can take you down a rabbit hole today. You assumed you were heading one way, only to discover a new world of possibilities on a different trajectory. But don’t push the start button just yet, even if everything looks wonderful. If a change of direction is a good idea now, it will make even more sense after the holidays. In the meantime, continue your research and refine your strategy so you’re ready to hit it hard when all the pieces are finally in place."
cancer,2017-12-16,"Your excitement about starting a new project or possibly switching jobs adds a touch of instability to your world. You know that a change of routine is overdue, but you’re not sure if this is the right moment to turn your life upside down. The timing of your transition is less important than your attitude about it. Remaining open-minded is the secret to allowing everything to unfold organically at its own pace. Less worry, less stress."
leo,2017-12-16,"You believe you can do anything you set your mind to today -- and maybe you can. Your perceptions are sharp and your logic is sound. You are so ahead of the game now that you don’t even need to create a plan; you just know what to do next as each moment happens. In fact, a rigid schedule or a demanding routine could dampen your enthusiasm. Do whatever you can to step outside of structure. Your creativity will flourish now if you feel free from the binds of responsibility.  Spontaneity is your friend."
virgo,2017-12-16,"You would rather think about a dream holiday now than actually leave the comforts of home. Maybe it’s the time of year or, perhaps, you just don’t want to venture too far from those you love. Nevertheless, you can derive great joy from travel fantasies, mental excursions or the study of anything that broadens your perspective on the universe. Instead of inventing reasons to maintain the status quo, consider the pleasure you can experience by expanding your thoughts into new and different realms. Author Chuck Palahniuk wrote, “Here in your mind there is no difference between what is and what could be.”"
libra,2017-12-16,"Your friends are not the source of responsible advice now. In fact, they may be encouraging you to do the crazy thing you have secretly dreamed about for a long time. But you always find a logical reason to avoid taking such a big risk, especially if you’re considering doing something with no socially redeeming value. It can be particularly challenging to put your needs ahead of others, but the cosmos is opening doors and pushing you through them. Don’t resist; it’s your moment to fly."
scorpio,2017-12-16,"You might be wise to hide your credit cards or ask a trusted friend to keep them for a few days, so you’re not tempted to buy something on a whim. It’s all too easy to justify a discretionary expenditure now, but spending a large chunk of money on a new car, television or camera doesn’t make any sense while Mercury is in its final days of a retrograde cycle. Channel your excitement into researching all your options and reassessing your resources so you can make a purchase that you won’t regret. Buyer’s remorse is a tough pill to swallow."
sagittarius,2017-12-16,"There’s no holding you back today, nor should anyone try. In fact, you are being blasted into the future as electric Uranus forms a superconductive trine to the radiant Sun in your 1st House of Self. You are wired for sound, neurons are firing in your brain, things are happening at warp speed, and your world is popping. The distance between cause and effect has grown infinitely small. This is your chance to merge with the flow of time, itself. Answering the call of destiny is an act of faith and courage."
capricorn,2017-12-16,"You may be pleasantly surprised with your own whimsical outlook on life today. Although you are still concerned about making your mark in the world, you long to set aside your ambitions and let loose now. However, you might worry about others judging you harshly if you act irresponsibly. But everyone deserves to have fun and you’ve certainly earned the right to take some time for yourself. Don’t just sit around thinking about what you would do if only you could. You can. But you better play now before the thrill of the moment passes."
aquarius,2017-12-16,"The future shows itself in brief flashes today, as if your cosmic connection is downloading bursts of information and then going offline. Your key planet Uranus harmonizes with the Sun in your 11th House of Hopes and Dreams, juxtaposing time and space. You might momentarily forget where you are now, but you won’t lose track of where you are going. You are on a direct intercept route with your destiny. Check your baggage and get ready to travel at the speed of light. A more enlightened version of you is waiting your arrival."
pisces,2017-12-16,"Although your imagination is one of your favorite places to play, it is just an annoying distraction today. Your primary concern now is your overall path while here on planet Earth. But questioning your life’s purpose is not just pie-in-the-sky dreaming. You want to have a positive impact on your world and the people in it. You might be wondering where you will be in five years or even next month, but rest assured your intuition will help you navigate your true course.  Managing the practical calculations sets the stage for successfully realizing your dreams."
aries,2017-12-17,"You are champing at the bit, waiting for the starting gate to open. But nothing is happening and your frustration is growing faster than your logic can handle. This is a particularly delicate moment because the race will begin soon, and you need to be in top mental form and excellent fighting condition. You must find a way to settle your nerves and be content until your moment arrives. Joyce Meyer wrote, “Patience is not the ability to wait, but the ability to keep a good attitude while waiting.”"
taurus,2017-12-17,"You have a lot on your mind today, but aren’t sure how much you want to share with anyone else. Your closest friends encourage you to spill the beans, but you don’t think they will be happy with your message. The truth is they will likely appreciate what you say, but not how you say it. You may be more intense than you realize now, and your passionate declaration could inadvertently alienate others. If you use a gentle and sensitive tone, you won’t need to water down your words. Author Kevin J. Anderson wrote, “A moment of consideration often prevents a thousand apologies.”"
gemini,2017-12-17,"You might feel as if no one really understands you today, even if you’re careful about choosing the right words to convey your ideas. You can go over the same points again and again, but to no avail while the rowdy Sagittarius Moon hooks up with retrograde Mercury in your 7th House of Others. Make sure to complete your first thought before jumping to the next one. It’s not about how much you say; it is the content of your message that matters. Instead, concentrate on a single concept, take your time and drive it home."
cancer,2017-12-17,"Sometimes the tiniest changes made at the right moment in time can ripple outward and create significant consequences. Acknowledging the importance of every little thing you do helps you to remain focused today so your actions are not wasted. But don’t be afraid to try something new, even if you’re unsure of its efficacy. A few false starts are to be expected when so many planets are visiting starry-eyed Sagittarius. Ariana Huffington wrote, “Failure is not the opposite of success; it’s part of success.”"
leo,2017-12-17,"You can magically transform a dire message of warning into a sweet love song today. In fact, you’re able to use your charm to soften harsh news without whitewashing the truth. However, once you start talking, you might get so carried away by your own enthusiasm that you forget to pull your punches and end up doing damage, even if your intentions are honorable. Think before you speak. Less is more when it comes to matters of the heart."
virgo,2017-12-17,"Naturally, you want to do the right thing today, but you might not be capable of meeting your own expectations. Rather than falling short of your high standards, you may decide to let the moment slide without taking any action at all. Although retreating to a safe space could feel good in the moment, it’s not productive -- and having something to show for your efforts is crucial to your emotional well-being. Author Paulo Coelho wrote, “The reward of our work is not what we get, but what we become.”"
libra,2017-12-17,"Your schedule is full of people to see, places to go and errands to finish. You love being busy now, even if it keeps you from indulging in a relaxing day of peace and quiet. But there’s no rest for the wicked, and you aren’t likely to cut back on your commitments when you’re having so much fun. Your eyes twinkle with mischief when you imagine the sheer variety of activities that stretch out before you. Dr. Seuss wrote, “Oh the places you’ll go. Today is your day!”"
scorpio,2017-12-17,"Although your confidence is growing, lingering caution impedes your progress. You fear that you’re like a satellite ready to be launched into orbit, yet there isn't sufficient fuel to achieve escape velocity. Timing is everything. You believe you only have one chance to manifest your dreams, but this false sense of urgency is a trap you must avoid now. Do not let your attention wander; the strength of your convictions will ultimately propel you to new heights."
sagittarius,2017-12-17,"It’s all too easy for your thoughts to get so far ahead of your actions that you can’t keep up today. In fact, you might feel as if you’re stuck in a weird time loop, like you’re experiencing your own private Groundhog’s Day. However, it’s less about learning a lesson now than it is about waiting until next week when Mercury turns direct in your sign. Nevertheless, reconsidering your plans and reassessing your feelings ensure a smooth journey once you’re cleared for takeoff."
capricorn,2017-12-17,"You can visualize the light at the end of the tunnel today, yet everything remains entrenched in darkness. You know deep down that your ambitious efforts will eventually be rewarded, and you will reach your mountain peak. However, there doesn’t seem to be a clear and direct route from the present moment into the future. Although your calculations are typically based on logistics and practicalities, faith is your current ticket to satisfaction. Marilyn Monroe said, “The sky is not the limit. Your mind is.”"
aquarius,2017-12-17,"Hanging out with friends sounds like the perfect way to idle away the day. You’re not feeling particularly ambitious now, but the notion of sharing your dreams with like-minded people brings a smile to your face. Unfortunately, a social gathering might not be as lively as you expect, especially if everyone is absorbed in their own personal stories today. Nevertheless, simply being in the same space together prevents you from feeling lonely or alienated. Practicing cautious optimism allows for the possibility of manifesting magic when the time is right."
pisces,2017-12-17,"There are several unknowns lurking in the shadows today and you want to figure out what to do about them. You wish you could map out the workweek ahead so you know what will be expected of you along the way. However, you might be required to wing it now. Flying by the seat of your pants isn’t your favorite modus operandi, but it may be the best way to reach your desired destination. Lao Tzu wrote, “A good traveler has no fixed plans, and is not intent on arriving.”"
aries,2017-12-18,"You can see blue sky on a rainy day, enabling you to walk on the sunny side of the street no matter the weather. The inspirational Sagittarius New Moon energizes your 9th House of Distant Horizons, empowering you to transcend the apparent obstructions between you and your dreams. Although you might lack practicality at first, establishing ambitious goals gives you a reason to work harder and smarter. Pleasant surprises are all but guaranteed when you dare to reach for the stars."
taurus,2017-12-18,"You are eager to give a partner the benefit of the doubt today, even if you envision potential trouble ahead. The optimistic Sagittarius New Moon occurs in your 8th House of Shared Resources, prompting you to gloss over any lingering doubts you might have about a joint venture. Your unwavering determination goes a long way to counterbalance unresolved issues that have yet to surface. However, it’s still wise to reconsider the entire project one more time before finding yourself in over your head. Fools rush in where angels fear to tread."
gemini,2017-12-18,"The more you seek approval from external sources, the less likely it is that you will feel encouraged. Unfortunately, your most dependable allies might question your ability to fulfill your ambitions while the Sagittarius New Moon joins naysaying Saturn in your 7th House of Relationships. However, your success is not contingent on anyone else’s judgment unless you succumb to their negativity. Use the feedback you receive to improve your game rather than to abandon your dreams."
cancer,2017-12-18,"Your commitments may have piled up so high that you are overwhelmed today. You thought that everything was moving along according to plan, only to realize how much remains to be completed. The Sagittarius New Moon falls in your 6th House of Work, giving you hope that you still can perform a miracle. But its conjunction with taskmaster Saturn reminds you of the long row to hoe extending before you. Although you wish you could find an escape hatch, rely on the fact that you will feel a real sense of accomplishment once you are done. The sooner you start, the sooner you will finish."
leo,2017-12-18,"The weekend may be over, but you are busy building momentum toward the end-of-year festivities. You may already feel the holiday spirit and don’t see the need to pretend otherwise just to keep up appearances. Much to your chagrin, you won’t be free to indulge in sentimentalities if you haven’t fulfilled your obligations. There’s no simple way to avoid the fact that austere Saturn’s authority is restraining the Sagittarius New Moon in your 5th House of Spontaneity, requiring you to work now and play later. Responsibility is the ability to choose your response."
virgo,2017-12-18,"You are quite comfortable stepping into your power, but only when you are supported by solid information. However, you grow timid when you lack good data. Normally, anxiety might surface when the buoyant Sagittarius New Moon emphasizes your 4th House of Foundations because you can’t trust the ground on which you stand. However, the proximity of retrograde Mercury and stabilizing Saturn helps to shore up your confidence. Nevertheless, as Roman philosopher Pliny wrote, “The only certainty is that nothing is certain.”"
libra,2017-12-18,"You may be blinded by the light of your own positive thinking today. Normally, optimism works in your favor, but you must exercise caution or you could spread your energy so thin now that you won’t be effective at anything you do. Thankfully, the Sagittarius New Moon collaborates with strict Saturn in your 3rd House of Information, enabling you to filter out extraneous distractions. Anything is possible when you put your mind to it."
scorpio,2017-12-18,"You are neither an optimist nor a pessimist today. You are a possibilist, believing that good intentions coupled with hard work can bring about the results you desire. The audacious Sagittarius New Moon lands in your 2nd House of Self-Esteem, planting seeds of confidence that might grow into a job well done. However, your efforts are only rewarded by serious Saturn if you diligently complete all your work. For better or for worse, you get what you deserve."
sagittarius,2017-12-18,"Taking your game to the next level seems like a piece of cake until you actually step up to the plate. The cavalier Sagittarius New Moon prompts you to believe you can do nearly anything now, without taking responsibility for the consequences of your choices. Thankfully, sobering Saturn’s presence demands that you come to your senses before you create a situation that you can’t control. There’s no time to waste; you must swing into action if you’re hoping to hit a home run."
capricorn,2017-12-18,"The sands of time are slipping through the hourglass and you intuitively know you must act before the moment is lost. You are passionate about your current ambitions while the ennobling Sagittarius New Moon invigorates your 12th House of Destiny. However, matters are complicated because this lunation is aligned with restrictive Saturn, which enters your sign tomorrow for a three-year visit. The short-term benefits of anything you undertake now may be limited. Thankfully, karma is at work and your current efforts will produce positive results over time if you are persistent and patient."
aquarius,2017-12-18,"Tantalizing glimpses of the future fascinate you with a variety of possible paths. You wish that you didn’t need to wait until your dreams come to fruition. However, authoritative Saturn has laid down the law and there are no shortcuts when traveling down the river of time.

Every flower must grow through dirt."
pisces,2017-12-18,"You’ve been wandering long enough and it’s time to take bearings on your current position. Normally, you’re quite happy to follow the whims of your imagination.

aries,2017-12-19,"You are ready to begin a new chapter of your life. The time for unrealistic dreaming is over; you must take your big ideas out of the realm of fantasy now and give them structure in the real world. Of course, this transition won’t happen overnight. Your current aspirations can take months or even years to bring to fruition. Nevertheless, spending the day doing the right thing is crucial because it sets the tone for all that follows. Og Mandino wrote, “What you plant now, you will harvest later.”"
taurus,2017-12-19,"Although you may feel the pressure of life, you’re aware you’ve been preparing for this moment for a long time. Nevertheless, it can be disconcerting when you realize how much is at stake now. Thankfully, you know in your heart what you need to do. Taking the easy way out might bring you a measure of relief in the moment but, unfortunately, regret is close at hand. It’s not too soon to begin setting practical goals for the year ahead. President Dwight D. Eisenhower said, “Plans are nothing; planning is everything.”"
gemini,2017-12-19,"Changing your strategy may seem impossible now because so many recent decisions have already set you on a certain trajectory. You might even feel tired from all the recent challenges. Fortunately, you will soon be able to see the results from your past efforts. Although you are turning a significant corner, it may take a few weeks before you gain enough perspective to clearly determine where you are and where you are heading. You can’t rush something that needs time to develop. Michelangelo wrote, “Faith in oneself is the best and safest course.”"
cancer,2017-12-19,"It might seem as if your work is never done, but if you continue to concentrate on fulfilling your current obligations, you will soon begin to see the fruits of your labor. You might believe that someone close to you is being particularly critical of your work, causing you to doubt recent choices. However, you do not have the luxury of questioning the forces that brought you to this present moment. Throw away your rearview mirror and focus on the road ahead. It doesn’t matter what you did or didn’t do yesterday; it only matters what you do today."
leo,2017-12-19,"It feels as if an opportunity is slipping away and you must start a new endeavor immediately. However, it’s wiser to take some time to contemplate your current position and where you wish to go in the weeks and months ahead. It might seem counterproductive to waste valuable production time when you’re already facing too many deadlines, but working smarter will not slow you down in the long run. In fact, sharpening your navigational skills ensures that you’re on the right path."
virgo,2017-12-19,"Accepting an invitation to collaborate on a project or to join a cause close to your heart is not something you take lightly today. You are quite concerned about overcommitting your time when your life already seems so busy. Nevertheless, you are not one to avoid responsibility, even when it means shouldering an extra burden. The simple fact is you will survive if you do not finish everything that’s on your to-do list today. Instead of allowing anxiety to morph into panic, just admit you’re human and do the best you can."
libra,2017-12-19,"Your family ties are an important part of your life, even when you are away from home. However, other people’s expectations can crimp your style now, leaving you less time to fulfill your obligations at work. Paradoxically, you may feel shortchanged if you need to cancel personal plans. Maintaining healthy relationships is always important, yet it can be quite complicated to juggle your priorities this time of year. Author Avina Celeste wrote, “Life is about balance. Too much work and you'll lose your spirit. Too much leisure and your dreams fall away from you.”"
scorpio,2017-12-19,"A freight train of emotional intensity may be running down your track today, and you can’t decide whether to jump on board or leap out of the way. You’re no stranger to riding powerful passions; in fact, you often seek out extreme experiences in your quest to live life to the fullest.

But the tables are turning, and you can feel the joy creeping back into your life as everyone else is growing more serious. Ironically, your spirit might continue to lighten, even if you assume more responsibilities in the weeks ahead. Confucius wrote, “Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life.”"
capricorn,2017-12-19,"Sometimes it takes karma a long time to come around, yet this is exactly what’s occurring in your life now. Although everything you do today has the potential to change your destiny, ripples of your past behavior are activating current events. Well-tended geese may appear laying golden eggs, while unattended responsibilities might come back to haunt you. Either way, your work is cut out for you as you play a game of catch-up or reap the rewards of the job well done."
aquarius,2017-12-19,"Big changes are rolling through your life now, but the real impact may be occurring deep within the shadows of your imagination. Everything might seem normal on the surface but even your closest friends won’t necessarily realize the intensity of your inner quest. It’s likely too early to talk about your dreams and you’re quite comfortable flying solo anyway. However, don’t let your introversion alienate those close to you because you will want their support and feedback sooner than you think. Stephen Covey wrote, “Seek first to understand, then to be understood.”"
pisces,2017-12-19,"You might surprise others now as you narrow your focus and set very specific goals. Your pragmatic approach to managing your life could even seem out of character.

Although your dreams of life on the edge are quite titillating, you might not be able to pursue your heart’s desire now if you’re already locked into a set of circumstances with commitments that cannot be broken. But there’s no reason to complain since you can still have the time of your life once you accept the fate you have chosen."
taurus,2017-12-20,"A sudden windfall may surprise you with unexpected money or love. However, you must be open to receiving the cosmic goodies or they could pass you by unnoticed. Enjoy the fleeting pleasures as electric Uranus harmonizes with your key planet Venus, zapping your 8th House of Regeneration. Sharing your emotions can catalyze your revitalization. An improvement in your finances elevates your spirit. But today’s positive momentum won’t likely last, so make the most of it while you have the chance."
gemini,2017-12-20,"Turning down social invitations isn’t something you want to become a regular habit. Nevertheless, you can spread yourself so thin that it feels like you aren’t able to be present anywhere at all. Paradoxically, limiting your holiday celebrations today could actually lead to more fun, not less. When it comes to expending your energy, choose quality over quantity. Just because you can doesn’t mean you should."
cancer,2017-12-20,"You’re eager to cash in your chips today, especially if you see a fast way to make money. Although the financial odds might be in your favor, the question is how much are you willing to risk. Weigh the pros and cons of your current choices, but keep in mind that your chances for success increase in proportion to your investment of time and energy. Fortune favors the bold but only when you don’t push your luck."
leo,2017-12-20,"You pleasantly surprised that everything seems to be falling into place now, and you’re willing to accept the synchronicity with a smile and a nod of appreciation to the universe. However, you’re not one to passively sit around waiting for something to happen. Naturally, you would rather be the lightning now than be struck by it. Go out and make some mischief but don’t get into any trouble."
virgo,2017-12-20,"Enjoying peace and quiet at home sounds like a brilliant idea now, but you can’t avoid the noise that seems to follow you around. Whether you’re whiling away the hours with friends on the phone or lost in someone’s online melodrama, there’s a part of you that would actually miss the chitter-chatter if it was gone. Thankfully, your relationship with your social network is not an all-or-nothing proposition. Carve out some alone time to recharge your batteries. You possess the power to regulate your involvement with interpersonal interactions so that you honor your need for solitude too."
libra,2017-12-20,"People may let you down now as they unexpectedly walk away from their obligations. However, you can’t find fault in their actions because they are juggling their own needs alongside the needs of everyone else. Ironically, once you have a few minutes to blow off your annoyance, you slowly realize that you’re free to pursue the very same dreams you were thinking about yesterday without the interference of anyone else. Wayne Dyer wrote, “Go for it now. The future is promised to no one.”"
scorpio,2017-12-20,"Your values might be called into question today by events occurring at work. It’s not that you’re being asked to do anything shady. It’s just that you take deep pride in maintaining total integrity and you don’t want to be a part of an activity that could compromise your stringent principles. You are being presented with a chance to reassess your core beliefs and you could surprise yourself by changing your mind before you’re done. A Scottish proverb teaches, “Better bend than break.”"
sagittarius,2017-12-20,"Love is in the air today but somehow your feet manage to remain on solid ground. You are exceptionally charming now as unconventional Uranus forms a smooth trine to beautiful Venus in your 1st House of Self. However, others may wonder what you’re going to do next. You can keep everyone peering over the edge of a cliff now as they anticipate the magic you are about to make. Philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche wrote, “You must have chaos within you to give birth to a dancing star.”"
capricorn,2017-12-20,"You may be so attached to your dreams today that you can’t just let go of them on command -- even if they are no longer serving your best interests. In fact, your imagination is so wired by an electrical Venus-Uranus trine activating your 12th House of Soul Consciousness that you can’t wait for the rest of the world to catch up to your fantasies. Unfortunately, living your life disconnected from reality is unproductive. Jan van de Snepscheut wrote, “In theory, there is no difference between theory and practice. But, in practice, there is.”"
aquarius,2017-12-20,"Dreaming about the future is one of your favorite pastimes, but the Law of Diminishing Returns is about to catch up to you. It’s like fishing in the same small pond every day; eventually, there’s going to be less fish available to catch. You have already explored every possibility and there’s little reason to run through your list one more time. Although your peers are ready to assist you if needed, the smartest thing you can do now is trust your own intuition. If it feels right, chances are it is."
pisces,2017-12-20,"You may be unexpectedly recognized by your peers today for your ongoing contributions to a project at work. You might not see anything different about your current participation, since you always do the best job you can. Nevertheless, the waves of admiration are revitalizing and lift your spirits above the humdrum of the mundane world. Don’t minimize the accolades in the name of humility. Taking pride in your performance is a gift to your heart."
aries,2017-12-21,"Taking your place in the outer world seems like the natural thing to do now. You command with an air of authority and you expect others to follow your lead while the Sun is illuminating your 10th House of Public Life. You have no option today but to choose responsibility over independence. Fortunately, you fully appreciate your role in the larger changes and are temporarily willing to set aside your personal battle to play a part in a larger one. Bob Dylan wrote, “A hero is someone who understands the responsibility that comes with his freedom.”"
taurus,2017-12-21,"Your goals are simple and straightforward. You want to step so far out of your regular routine today that everything appears sparkling new and different. But your current restlessness doesn’t alter your basic need for consistency, even if you’re being pulled in opposite directions. Ultimately, the Sun’s month-long trek through your 9th House of Journeys highlights the trajectories that take you far from your current circumstances. Tim Fargo wrote, “Until you cross the bridge of your insecurities, you can’t begin to explore your possibilities.”"
gemini,2017-12-21,"Your margin of error is quite narrow now, requiring you to make certain that your behavior is right on point. Performance pressure is an excellent motivator, giving you just enough push to prevent you from being lazy. The methodical Sun-Saturn conjunction falls in your 8th House of Transformation, stabilizing your emotions while you experience a complete metamorphosis. Don’t fear failure when change looks so good on you."
cancer,2017-12-21,"You might believe that your positive outlook can turn a stressful day into one filled with fun and games. However, the Sun’s current visit to your 7th House of Relationships shines the spotlight on people who make demands of your time. Unfortunately, altering your attitude will not necessarily change the dynamics of the present situation. Trusting your intuition today could lead you down the scenic route when it’s much wiser to take the shortest one. Honesty saves time."
leo,2017-12-21,"There is no escaping the road of hard work that stretches into the future if you want to reach your current goals. Your biggest struggle now may stem from your resistance to pay attention to all the details. You wish you could continue to spontaneously react to each situation as it arises, since your energy shines brightest when you are simply acting in the moment. However, the scope of your current job might be overwhelming if you only look at the big picture. Focus on the most important task first."
virgo,2017-12-21,"Expressing yourself creatively allows you to tap into your artistic potential. You can be incredibly productive these days if you take time to map out your plans. Working from a blueprint makes more sense than winging it when managing all the complicated variables at play. Creating your playbook while the energy unfolds is less than ideal now. As President Thomas Jefferson noted, “I am a great believer in luck, and I find the harder I work the more I have of it.”"
libra,2017-12-21,"Stepping back from activities in the outer world gives you time to formulate a new strategy when dealing with the inconsistent behavior of others. It’s as if overcompensating in one area of your life where you can exercise control will fix the lingering problems somewhere else where your jurisdiction is limited. If it feels like there is too much at stake now, retreat from the center of the storm while you decide what to do next. Declaring a personal timeout gives you the objectivity you need."
scorpio,2017-12-21,"You are caught in an odd predicament today. You are standing at an intersection on the Highway of Life, yet your maps don’t indicate where each road leads. Unfortunately, it’s nearly impossible to make an informed decision without all the facts at your disposal. You don’t like the idea of standing around and waiting for help to arrive before you commit to one path or another. Thankfully, your sense of immediacy is based on your own fears now rather than actual cues from your environment. Not all those who wander are lost."
sagittarius,2017-12-21,"You have many tricks up your sleeve that enable you to sidestep your responsibilities whenever you get the urge to play. However, it’s a whole new story today when an industrious Sun-Saturn conjunction settles into your 2nd House of Money. You understand the connection between self-esteem and abundance; it’s not enough to simply hustle harder to increase your income. You must also do the spiritual work that bolsters your confidence and strengthens your metaphysical foundation. Proceed slowly and build on what you already started, rather than beginning something new."
capricorn,2017-12-21,"Your dedication to a cause makes you a fierce force once you discover your mission. You feel highly energized now that the willful Sun joins authoritative Saturn in your ambitious sign. People may be overwhelmed with your unrelenting drive to reach your goal, but you won’t back down today. Although establishing yourself as the leader of the pack makes you feel like a winner, it turns everyone else into losers. Your lesson now is the realization that you succeed or fail as a group, not as an individual. Michael Jordan said, “Talent wins games, but teamwork wins championships.”"
aquarius,2017-12-21,"Although you may be pleased with your recent progress, there’s still a long way to go. You wish you were more excited about your future, but there is too much happening now to dream about tomorrow. There are major decisions looming on the horizon while the Sun travels through your 12th House of Destiny. Rather than attempting to make midcourse corrections on your current trajectory, focus your efforts on lightening your load by eliminating unnecessary emotional baggage. The less encumbered you are, the easier the choices will be to make."
pisces,2017-12-21,"Your interactions with friends and associates may not go as planned today, since you are unwilling to play frivolous games when you have more important matters to manage. You’re particularly serious now because you intuitively know your current actions could make or break your plans. Demonstrating your effectiveness and efficiency on the job is a major contributor to your success. Nevertheless, your support network is an important piece of your overall business strategy and should not be ignored. Your appreciation is a gift from the heart."
aries,2017-12-22,"You don’t know whether you should push for what you want now, or if the resistance you’re facing is a sign that’s telling you to retreat. You know that sometimes you can get so passionate about a project that logic falls to the wayside. On the other hand, your enthusiasm accomplishes wonders, enabling you to turn insurmountable odds into a sweet victory. There’s no simple answer to your current question. However, a decision to hold back today will still likely lead to success at a later date."
taurus,2017-12-22,"Someone encourages you to be more generous today, but you might feel as if you have already extended yourself far enough. Naturally, you want to express your love through your actions and gifts, but you’re sensitive about going over the top with lavish displays of affection. It’s hard to know when enough becomes too much, especially if you are swept up in the seasonal spirit of giving. All limits are created within your mind, but respecting boundaries is imperative."
gemini,2017-12-22,"It doesn’t seem fair if your unfinished tasks must be completed while friends and family have already switched gears heading into the holiday weekend. Nevertheless, you know what you must do before you check out of work and into play. Everyone else will just have to wait for you to join them. Thankfully, clear communication between you and others will prevent any bad feelings from surfacing down the road now that interactive Mercury is turning direct in your 7th House of Relationships. Proactive measures cultivate peace and harmony."
cancer,2017-12-22,"Performing the simplest tasks requires extra effort today. You might even feel as if you’re not making any progress at all as mental Mercury stands still in your 6th House of Work. Thankfully, you can still be productive in spite of the awkward pace. Instead of intensifying your frustration by trying to concentrate on one thing at a time, cut yourself some slack and take short breaks throughout the day. Ironically, the change of tempo might be all you need to find your center and regain your focus."
leo,2017-12-22,"You can’t stop thinking about spending time with your relatives, but you realize the gathering could go one way or the other. You might have a wonderful rapport with your family but your domestic relationships may be more complicated, bringing personal issues from the past back to life. Fortunately, the emotionally detached Aquarius Moon is travelling through your 7th House of Others, enabling you to maintain a clear perspective and a healthy distance, if necessary. Practice intentional acts of kindness without expecting anything in return."
virgo,2017-12-22,"Your reputation for getting things done may result in lots of little chores being handed off to you now. Naturally, you want to contribute to the domestic tranquility, leading you to say yes to each request. Unfortunately, your to-do list could grow so long that you can’t finish everything. Nevertheless, your key planet Mercury turns direct today, altering the fabric of time, itself. It’s still possible to work your magic, pull a few rabbits out of a hat and fulfill all your commitments in the process."
libra,2017-12-22,"You might harbor mixed feelings about someone in your family who often seems to go out of their way to take you down a notch. You are fully aware of your successes and failures; you don’t need anyone to remind you of your list of shortcomings. Although you could be concerned about getting through the holidays unscathed, there’s really less to worry about than you currently imagine. Your quick wit and objective outlook enable you to take criticism in stride, reply with a clever retort and move on to a more pleasant topic."
scorpio,2017-12-22,"You may be riding a wave of optimism as you look toward the new year. However, buoyant Jupiter must answer to somber Saturn in your 3rd House of Communication, preventing you from going overboard. Conversations with those closest to you open your eyes to a more practical perspective. Thankfully, placing your feet back on solid earth won’t detract from the fun. Jim Rohn wrote, “By working hard, you get to play hard guilt free.”"
sagittarius,2017-12-22,"You have plenty to say these days, but might feel as if no one wants to listen. Your frustration could transform into discouragement because you know how relevant your ideas are now. But verbose Mercury is turning direct in your outspoken sign, inspiring you to talk so much that others begin to tune you out. Paradoxically, the trick to getting your message across is to pare back your lengthy treatise into a short paragraph. Shakespeare wrote, “Brevity is the soul of wit.”"
capricorn,2017-12-22,"Your no-nonsense reputation often precedes you, leading others to completely misread your energy. You might not be as serious as people think and you’re more willing to engage in crazy antics than anyone realizes. You grow annoyed when you are stereotyped, and may give someone the silent treatment rather than demonstrating your capricious nature. But others can easily misinterpret your lack of response today. Nevertheless, your mischievous smile keeps everyone guessing and for now that is enough."
aquarius,2017-12-22,"You might not want to commit to a set schedule because you believe you should honor your emotions, which are subject to change often now. The evocative Moon’s presence in your sign can push your feelings up to the surface today, increasing your sense of vulnerability. However, you need to maintain your freedom of choice, and you’re in no mood to abdicate your authority. Bruce Lee said, “Notice that the stiffest tree is most easily cracked, while the bamboo or willow survives by bending with the wind.”"
pisces,2017-12-22,"You can’t think of any reason to postpone your big adventure and you’re so excited that you can barely stand it. But your friends are not convinced that you’re doing the right thing. In fact, they may be so upset that they try to talk you out of your plans. However, intelligent Mercury turns direct in your 10th House of Authority, giving you the last word on the subject now. Jimi Hendrix said, “May the dreams of your past be the reality of your future.”"
aries,2017-12-23,"At first glance, it appears as if everything in your life is making sense now. Resistance that was problematic just a few days ago seems to have dissipated, allowing you to make progress putting your plans into motion. However, it’s unwise to rush headstrong into the future and let your newfound confidence dismiss any lingering concerns. There are still forces operating outside your realm of understanding and it pays to proceed slowly so you have time to react to unexpected events. Otto von Bismarck said, “A little caution outflanks a large cavalry.”"
taurus,2017-12-23,"You are so concerned with losing control that you could hold the steering wheel too tightly today. Every subtle nuance of emotion is recorded in your body, increasing your fear and setting you up to overreact. You must loosen your grip and lighten your attitude now or your extreme reactions could invite unwanted trouble. Carlos Barrios wrote, “Flexibility makes buildings to be stronger; imagine what it can do to your soul.”"
gemini,2017-12-23,"You must relinquish your need to revise reality today, especially if you are trying to justify your recent decisions. The Moon’s shift into sensitive Pisces and your 10th House of Status deconstructs your pending plans without asking for your approval first. Nevertheless, your instincts are so spot on now, attempts at reasoning only weakens your choices. Worry less about reaching a destination and more about experiencing the magic of the journey."
cancer,2017-12-23,"You might consciously limit your activities today, especially if you’re running into situations that seem like the universe is out to get you. But there’s no valid reason to support your notion that you’re a target. Shifting the blame alleviates your stress for a while, but it doesn’t fix anything. It’s never wise to assume the role of a victim when you had a hand in creating the circumstances. Those who start fires can't complain when they get burned."
leo,2017-12-23,"You aren’t happy if you’re unexpectedly drawn into a discussion about your feelings today. Oddly enough, once the can of worms is open, you want to go deep enough to get to the bottom of an issue that’s been bothering you for years. Although you might not resolve everything all at once, you can see glimpses of where your new awareness may eventually lead. Sometimes a fateful conversation can change your perspective and positively alter the direction of your life."
virgo,2017-12-23,"Your activities are entangled with people who don’t seem concerned about adhering to your schedule today, making it difficult to finalize your plans. In fact, someone’s purposeful elusiveness adds to your frustration if you try to pin them down. Rethinking your strategy may be necessary if you want to maintain peace of mind. Simply announce your agenda to set the record straight and go about your day. Ironically, accepting the fact that you might fly solo now could be the catalyst that moves others to respond with a firm commitment."
libra,2017-12-23,"Taking a quick break from the noise of the world is exactly what the doctor would prescribe today. Escaping into a peaceful space for a while may be the perfect remedy for a busy lifestyle, helping to alleviate the pressure of the holiday season. But don’t overextend your little retreat or you will add unnecessary complications to your day. Honoring your own need for quiet time now allows you to return to the festivities with a cheerful attitude and a generous spirit."
scorpio,2017-12-23,"Consciously setting aside the complexities of your life gives you the chance to luxuriate in your favorite daydreams. But somehow, your old standbys might not have the same level of attraction today. You may need to acknowledge that you are outgrowing some visions from the past that are no longer supported by your current lifestyle. Or, perhaps, you have actually manifested enough of a familiar fantasy that you are ready for some new ones. J.R.R. Tolkien wrote, “The greatest adventure is what lies ahead.”"
sagittarius,2017-12-23,"You go back and forth between carefully choosing your words and blurting out the first thing that enters your mind today. Although thinking about your delivery before you open your mouth improves your message, it also inhibits your spontaneity. Keep in mind that witty Mercury has just turned direct in your sign, giving you permission to speak directly from your heart. You are known for your outspoken manner and people expect nothing less but the unvarnished truth from you, so don’t disappoint them now."
capricorn,2017-12-23,"You are being presented with an opportunity to make a choice today. You can either try to maintain your position of authority or you can retreat and let others take charge. The advantage of running the show is you have a better chance of getting exactly what you want. If you believe efficiency is the goal, that’s what you will manifest. But you can’t be fully present to participate in the experience if you’re responsible for it. Passing the reins to someone else frees you to be a part of the group while giving another person the chance to stretch their leadership wings."
aquarius,2017-12-23,"You have a very specific idea about how you want the day to unfold. However, some things might not go your way now, requiring you to relax your expectations in order to adjust to circumstances beyond your control. There is no reason to assume your ideal fantasy is the only path to happiness; there are many routes to the same destination. Let your ingenuity be your guide."
pisces,2017-12-23,"The magic of the holiday season touches you today, no matter whether you choose to celebrate or not. The reflective Moon’s current visit to your spiritual sign dissolves the hard edges of life and opens your heart to a deeper level of compassion. But don’t just dream about higher ideals; put your inner experience into practice by spreading love wherever you go. Marianne Williamson wrote, “As we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same.”"
